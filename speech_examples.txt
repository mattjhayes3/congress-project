"i thank the gentleman for his comments i just would like to observe one additional thing on this point i think we ought to put into perspective the amount of money which is supposed to be saved by slowly strangling eda with the amount of money that was provided almost surreptitiously on the now famous 27 billion new welfare program for corporations which was built into the tax program that passed last summer under which corporations like ford for instance can now sell their excess tax credits to another corporation for cash i would suggest that that is a device by which great subsidies are provided with no planning with no judgments made as to the eventual economic value of that subsidy all that happens is that two cpas get together and work it out carte blanche if you compare that to the orderly process by which eda projects are supposed to be evaluated if you compare the discipline in both systems there is no question about how the taxpayers interests are better served"

"i have long supported sending to the state legislatures an amendment to alldw them the opportunity to ratify or not to ratify a constitutional amendment to balance the budget today we have two such amendments to send to the state legislatures and my preference is the alexander amendment why for two reasons first our constitution is our sacred document that has governed our nation longer than any document for any country it has survived because the wording of the unitedstates constitution provides the needed flexibility to allow the statutory law to support such amendments to the constitution in my opinion the alexander amendment comes closer to providing that language second in a survey of my constituents over 75 percent felt the president should summit to congress each year a balanced budget the alexander amendment provides such wording and the jenkinsconable wording does not this president has provided the congress with a budget that has doubled the deficits in just 2 years to a history recordbreaking high"

"when former surgeon general dr c p everett koop spoke to us a couple mornings ago he said the following before we can enact the sweeping reform we need in health care we must agree on the basic values and the ethics upon which our health care system and indeed our society is based and from which it draws its moral power if we could reach an ethical consensus i think many of the economic and political problems of health care reform would fall rather easily in line then he further said i dont imagine any one of us will agree with every point in the proposed reforms i imagine that the president has his own reservations about some points but our reservationsor even outright objectionsto some provisions cannot give us the excuse to oppose everything we have the opportunity to do something good for the american people to provide universal health care security for every man woman and child in this country i hope that we meet the challenge of this moment"
