most important labor of man the state of california was admitted to the union just 2 years before the death of this great statesman but if daniel webster were alive today he would be proud of my home states contribution to american agriculturethe richest agricultural state in the nation consider for instance that 8 of the 10 leading agricultural counties in the united states are located in california recently i shared with my colan article from the wall street journal which discussed the important role research plays in advancing the agricultural sciences and how california has so resourcefully responded to the challenges of the future our commitment to furthering californias position in unitedstates agriculture promises to enhance the economy of both the state and nation while providing consumors everywhere with an abundance of quality farm products an example of californias foresight was the issuance of an executive order by gov jerry brown a few weeks ago which creates a new agricultural research program for the state the 12 5 million undertaking is in the governors words a significant and dramatic expansion of the states direction in dealing with the problems of soil erosion energy resources used in farm production water delivery and the use of pesticides funds from the program will finance grants to schools universities and agricultural organizations to be determined by a task force of farm advisers and other citizen interests for the record i wish to include the governors executive order state of californiaexecutive onrnm b7781 whereas an economically

that this past saturday it was my honor and privilege and personal satisfaction to address the annual rio orande united methodist church conference which is an historical one perhaps the most historical of all the meetings in that particular church or christian denomination in the southwest united states to give my colleagues an idea of its historicity all of the transactions in the official proceedings of the conference are in spanish because there are spanishspeaking delegates from both the states of new mexico as well as texas and even some delegates from northeastern mexico the meeting is evocative of a history of the united states that has yet to be written that particular developmental history in the southwest border country and particularly the 20year period known as the mexican revolutionary period stretching from about 1910 to 1930 this conference is really unique as a matter of fact it is a separate and apart annual conference from the main southwest conference of the methodist church which was celebrated in my district in san antonio tex the heart of the city in fact at a place adjacent to the alamo just a few days prior to the rio grande conference last saturday but it is nevertheless an integral part of methodism the rio grande conference took place at georgetown tex at another historical site the southwestern university which has been in existence 141 years and is a substantial educational institution with a tremendous background of service to methodism and in imparting education to the people of texas it is a beautiful campus it has grown tremendously just in the last 20 years since i served in the texas state senate and had ccasion last to go to the campus in any event i feel it was a real privilege to attend this particular conference last saturday the methodist bishop for the region bishop ernest dixon was there the vice president of the university william b jones was also there and there were more than 1 000 persons present at this great conference the discussion that i was asked to develop was the developing eighties the decade of the eighties and the role of the ethnic minorities i will insert in the record at this point the substance of the address that i gave in pursuance of that request i am grateful to have the opportunity to be here ith you and spend a few minutes reflecting on the eternal dilemma where do we go from here there are never any easy answers or sure road signs to guide us in lifes conflicts no matter how great or small those might be we travel with certainty only when we move on the basis of firm faith it is so in daily life it is so in academic life it ia so in political life therefore when you ask me to talk about the role of minoritles in the eighties you are asking me to describe a map that does not really exist except in faiththe faith that we can even in the resurgent spirit of a new knownothing age of politics still find ways to improve the lot of people who are all too often left behind left out and left hurt in the great swirl and hubbub of our society we know at the outset in the words of herman melville that there is no steady unretracing progress in this life we do not progress through fixed gradations there is no way that we can with certainty say what this decade will bring or what we will be like at the end of it all we can know is that we have to strive for the best that is within ourselves and seek to commit this country to do the best that it can for all of its people there is in any country any society the temptation to be complacent to shut out the afflictions and problems of the unfortunate this is no less true of our great country than of any otherbut still there is a redeeming optimism that prevails in our country most of us believe that there are very few problems of any kind that cant be licked that is why americans didnt let the prairie be the end of the westward movement there might have been less water and little wood in the westbut americans discovered that you did not have to have wood or stone to build fences you could use wire and you did not have to have water in streams you could drill deep wells and bring the water from the earth by using the power of the wind and just as we have tended to be inventive and practical so have we realized that social problems can be licked too sometimes our efforts to help our fellow man have been terrible failuresprohibition was a disasterbut far more often we have found that there are ways and means of helping our fellow human beings overcome the viscissitudes of life so we have been optimists i like to think that our general optimism has also made us idealists justice brandeis who himself sprang from a class who were subjected to the most odious kind of discrimination found it in his heart to say this there is in most americans some spart of idealism which can be fanned into flame it takes sometimes a divining rod to find out what it is but when found the results are extraordinary we know from history and the events of our own lives that idealism is a real and present thing in our society where else but in america would anyone dream up an idea as outlandish and as outlandishly successful as the peace corps where else but in america would we find a president inviting as franklin roosevelt did the daughters of the american revolution to think of themselves aa immigrants where else but in america could there have been the great civil rights movement that mighty and creating wave of equality and dignity that expressed itself in words of idealism and faith that no one could ever forget we shall overcome we shall overcome i do believe we shall overcome some day nowhere but in america could you find that kind of movement born in faith nourished by optimism and fueled by pure ideal lam crystallized in those words and now here we stand the fight for simple access won here we stand knowing that the real fight is only now beginning for it means nothing it we have the right to walk into the hamburger joint if we lack the money to buy the burger it means nothing to have the right to apply for a job if we dont have decent schools to equip us for that job it means nothing to have the right to buy or rent a home if there are no homes to buy or rent the fight of the civil rights movement was a fight for access the fight today is much harder than that it is the fight for the mainstream the fight for economic opportunity and this is the key it is not a fight only for the minority people of this country it is a fight for all the people of this country in the state of texas about a third of the population could be considered a member of one minority or another about one texan in five as hispanic about one texan in eight is a black it is true that when you talk about unemployment when you talk about low income and when you talk about poor education and when you talk about poor nutrition those are problems that fall first and hardest and most often on the ml nority population of this state but when you talk about absolute numbers there are twice as many poor anglos in texas as there are poor hispanics there are four times more poor anglos in texas than there are poor blacks therefore when we talk about the fight for economic opportunity we are not merely talking about a fight of by and for blacks and hispanics we are talking about a fight for all poor people when we talk about how republican budget cuts hurt poor people we too often forget that the greatest number of the poor are not minorities at all but anglos for all poor people the fight in thin decade is to reach the mainstream the point where most americans live a decent job a decent education a decent home and a decent meal on the table because so many in the minority population are poor this effort to reach the mainstream is too easily seen as simply a minority struggle such an image is wrongfor the problems of all poor and struggling people are different only in degree and there is no degree of difference in the pain of poverty a hungry stomach does not differentiate between races in the civil rights struggle the key was to awaken the realization that civil rights was h 2778 co not just a concern of black people it was a concern of all people i remember vividly that when i fillbustered aainst the infamous segregation bills of the fifties i did not merely arousd the hatred of rednecks and the suspicions of the fbi my own friends said they were disappointed in me that i was trying to reduce my own hispanic brothers down to the level of blacks but what was any different about laws that tried to exclude me from certain housing right along with blacks what was any different about me being excluded from a public park right along with blacks what harmed blacks harmed me and what offended any human being offended all human beings there are many keys to the economic mainstream it takes more to reach that mainstream than to have an opportunity for a job it is necessary to be equipped for that job and so for many the main thing is to stay in school to gain skills we have done well in that task in the last decade and the progress for minorities has been encouraging and yet even today among adult hispanics in texas only a third have finished high school blacks by contrast can count half their adult number as being high school graduates meanwhile twothirds of the anglos have completed a high school education therefore for a third of the anglo population half the black population and twothirds of the hispanic population education remains a supreme priority without education and without skill the door to opportunity may be open but the threshold remains too high to cross what that educational attainment means is this a third of the anglo population of this state lives on an income of less than 6 000 a year close to 60 percent of hispanics and blacks on that kind of income 500 a month here in texas if you have less than four years of education it doesnt make much difference what your ethnic background is black white or brown anybody with less than a fourth grade education is twothirds of the time working at a low wage blue collar job of one kind or another there is nothing dishonorable about hon orable workbut what i am saying is that staying in school is the first prerequisite to entering americas true mainstream and that is the upwardly mobile population the population that moves up the ladder rather than being forced to stay on the same level unable to move ahead if we have to be concerned about education we have to doubly concerned about the forces that are threatening our schools today all across texas there is resentment about property tax levels our states teachers are inadequately paid and they get nothing like the respect their jobs entitle them to but most alarming of all is the fact that at the same time the reagan budget programs intends to cut federal aid to schools by 25 percent what this means for disadvantaged people is that it will be next to impossible for schools to provide the kind of remedial and special education in the eighties that they did in the seventiesthis at a time when test scores are confirming that those programs have worked and worked wellthis at a time when we know that the investment in human potential has truly paid off just this week the house education and labor committee driven by the fantastic budget cuts imposed by the republican budget voted to kill future funding for the impacted areas assistance program this can if the decision sticks have disastrous effects on schools in san antonio that have no conceivable way to relay on local taxes to make up the differ ence and we are seeing moves to dismantle federal aid to the handicapped here in texas the clients of the texas rehabilitation commission last year reported a total income of 19 million before rehabilitation training after that training their income went up to 120 million the cost about 25 million vocational rehabilitation pro duced in other words an increase in income of four dollars for every single dollar that was invested in that training yet that program atands in clear danger today i think that if we but had the instruments to measure it we would see that education of every kind produces the same kind or return on investment for the poor and disadvantaged there is absolutely no doubt that the chances of getting a job increases with each additional year of school and the quality and income from that job likewise increase with each additional year spent in school and for that reason i think that ethnic minorities need first to be concerned about maintaining educational opportunities in the eightiesand this is a concern of every citizen rich or poor black or white i have said much about education and i underscore the importance of education as the key to economic opportunity but i do not want to leave the impression that the struggle ends there if there is no job to be had qualifications and skills make no difference if there is no food in the house it does not matter how great the schools are hunger and learning arent compatible if there is no roof to live under no clothing to wear it does not matter if the schools are outstanding we have to be concerned with overall economic program we have to be concerned with programs that make it possible to realize human potential when an administration creates dellberately an economic program that forces high interest rates upon uswe have to under stand that those interest rates forcea general economic slowdown a general rise in unemployment a general rise in small business bankruptcles those are the things that fall hardest on those who have the least to begin withand most particularly on minority groups does the building industry have trouble then we have to reali2 that the small builders and the small suboontractorsa great many of whom are minority persons struggling for a break throughare hit first hardest and longest of all does the auto industry have trouble it is the assemblyline worker the car salesman the mechanics who suffer the first blows the hardest knocks and the greatest struggle do the banks cut off loans we have to understand that it is the corner grocer the neighborhood dry cleaner the independent merchant who really suffers the consequences in each and every case it is not just the minority who sufferit is every struggling person in this country who suffers what we have to look for them is ways and means to make common cause with everyone who shares the concerns and burdens of proverty or handicaps of one kind or another it was making that common cause that allowed the great civil rights breakthrough now that we are looking for economic opportunity the fight is far more complex far more subtle far more difficultbut it can only be won in the same way by making common cause with all who are poor all who are oppressed all who need help and all who care about human decency what we cannot afford is to become locked in some sterile selfisolation not long after the civil war walt whitman wrote a great essay democratic vistas we have to understand that whitman loved this country as few others could he saw its greatness torn assunder he worked in military hospitals around wash ington and witnessed the terrible tragedy of war and he had mourned the death of lincoln and yet despite all that he looked to the future and saw a nation which he said would eventually have lorty or fifty great states and he saw in america a place where every individual could realize the best in himself he saw equality for women he saw the building of a unique ideal society and he saw the dangers of injustice and isolation he might have been thinking of todays demands for blind conformity when he wrote the great word solidarity has risen of all dangers to a nation as things exist in our day there can be no greater one than having certain portions of the people set off by a line drawnthey not privileged as others but degraded humiliated made of no account what he was saying was this we can neither allow ourselves to be cast into ethnic stereotypes nor can we put ourselves into such a mold just as we would not have society put us into an isolated box neither should we in our own pride impose rigid conformity on ourselves in whitmans vision of americs every man and woman would be unique would honor their own roots but be free to reach out in all directions to other people other citizens he saw american individualism as not that half only i which isolates there is another half which la adhesiveness or love that fuses ties and aggregates making the races comrades and fraternizing all whitman lived and wrote at a time of great national disillusionment the din of disputation rages around me he wrote acrid the temper of the parties the president sends his message reconstruction is in abeyance the nomination and the contest for the twentyfirst presidential draw close with loudest threat and bustle but he did not despair of these and all the like of these the eventuations i know not but well i know that behind them and whatever their even tuations the vital things remain safe and certain and all the needed work goes on so are we in an age of disiluslonment the industrial world sees slow growth and no way to cope with the insidious effects of inflationand so the rich intend to build their walls higher and surround their wealth with moats fearing that they might lose everything the politics of the administration today is a new period of knownothingsome thing that whitman knew very well the administration puts its civil rights litigation on hold it spends all its energies dismantling education housing and employment programs saying that when the economy is right everyone will be all right but they ignore and forget the experience of our own past it was only in the sixties that we had ideal economic conditions like those stock man promlaes yes in the sixties we had low unemployment we had low inflation and we had rapid growth but we also had millions who were left out of the general prosperity millions who has no way to latch onto the promise of americathe promise that they too could become the kind of individuals we all want to bethe promise that every man and wolman could realize their full potential we discovered then that general prosperity and stability does not bring with it automatjune a 1981 co ic success for everyone there are those for whom the door may be open but the threshold too high to step over there are those who struggle for food for the bare necessities of life for any kind of hope at all that ia why we had riots in the midst of plenty there was despair and that is why the new knownothing age is so dangerous it ignores the reality that even when there is plenty even when there is economic stability there are those who need help to survive and to realize their share of the dream for us then for those of us who are ethnic minorities and for those who care about people who are in need this is the task of the eighties we must first and foremost defend the basic civil rights that have been so hard won after all as melville warns the gradetions of progress arent automatic and retracing our steps is a possibility it would be tragic to forget that vigilance is not only prudent but absolutely necessary in an age where the president aims to tear down the structures that protect civil rights from affirmative action right down to the elemental human rights of prisoners secondly we must concentrate our energies and resources on the fight for economic opportunityfor it means little or nothing to have the right to ride the bus if we cant serape up the money to buy the ticket or to enter school where there are no books and third we must make common cause with others when the civil rights of some are threatened the civil rights of all are threatened when poverty afflicts minorities it also afflicts those who are not in our number we cannot let ourselves be isolated or work in ways that isolate ourselves the great strength of this country as whitman observed is in its diversity he saw in us a great rolling massindividual and yet united no matter how great the concern how far the vision sooner or later we come down to one single solitary soul and so it is with us we have to concern ourselves with the greatest good for the greatest number and yet we can never forget that for people of faith and people of good will we can never forget the individual dignity and worth of each single solitary soul that is what our country is about it is what our faith is about and it is what our task is about if we maintain civil rights if we achieve economic opportunity we can only do it as part of a great nation that remains dedicated to the achievement of individual potential a nation that prizes most of all its own people that is why the song reads we shall overcome black and white together we shall overcome i do believe"], [0.4846770763397217, 0.5153229236602783, 1, "i certainly support h r 6892 in its entirety we are met for the seventh year in my 8 years of service in congress to alter the food stamp program one more time in the name of budget cuts we have conducted 40 days of hearings and 95 days of markup on this program since january 1975 we continue to give it more scrutiny than any other social program we constantly tinker with and change its details until neither recipients nor state and local administrators can remember what the rules of the game are why should that be why must this program consistently provide year after year the primary target for budget slashers and those who would scheme to redistribute income from the poor to the rich there is no good answer academic experts and social policymakers agree that food stamps are the best countercyclical program ever devised to offset however partially the ravages of unemployment and depression doctors testify that food stamps are the most valuable health dollar spent by the federal government nutritionists know that food stamps are responsible for the progress we have made this past generation in eliminating hunger and malnutrition in this country today however we meet to consider budget savings and not the nutritional needs of the poor h r 6892 amends the food stamp act of 1977 and extends the food stamp program for 3 additional years through september 30 1985 in the course of extending the food stamp program the committee added amendments that would sanction the states for overissuance of food stamp allotments and tighten eligibility require ments title iii extends an emergency feeding program which enables 21 to 22 million truly needy americans to purchase food second it expands program benefits to include disabled veterans elderly social security recipients and certain afdc recipients third it tightens the household definition and modifies procedures for determining benefits fourth it prevents fraud and abuse by establishing state option for job search at application and providing for alternative issuance systems fifth it imposes strict sactions on states for excessive error rates improving costeffectiveness of monthly reporting allowing prompt reduction or termination of benefits and eliminating possible duplication of benefits and sixth demonstrates a concern for nutrition by studying the impact of program budget cuts on the nutritional status and social conditions of needy americans the amendments to the food stamp act achieve significant cost savings through measures believed by the committee to represent the least harmful alternatives to needy households dependent upon the program the committee emphasizes that as a result of legislation adopted in 1981 savings were made in the food stamp program which totaled 6 7 billion for the 3 fiscal years affected while the committee was again compelled to make further food stamp cuts to achieve the directive that it make cost savings in programs within its jurisdiction any deeper cuts in the program would impact heavily on the ability of lowincome americans to have an adequate diet the committee adopted many reforms in the food stamp program to control error rates and to curb abuse these provisions resulted in additional savings of 334 million in fiscal year 1983 431 million in fiscal year 1984 and 561 million in fiscal year 1985 for a total net savings of 1 3 billion over a 3year period this bill will continue the food stamp program for 3 more years through september 30 1985 as well as provide authorization for funding for fiscal year 1983 at 12 648 000 000 for fiscal year 1984 at 12 908 000 000 and for fiscal year 1985 at 13 651 000 000 our committee recognizing the fallibility of the economic forecasts on which the spending limits for the food stamp program are based imposed a ceiling on expenditures to maintain oversight and control of program funding the economic assumptions on which the spending ceilings are founded include the following estimates for unemployment and food price inflation in percent fscal year1983 1984 1985 ur iymt 86 7 1 7 3 fmod pnce il3ion 61 6 8 69 in addition cbo savings estimates assume october 1 1982 implementation date the total spending established for each fiscal year includes an appropria ugust 10 1982 ation level of 825 million for puerto rico as mandated in the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1981 it also includes offsets of 190 million for fiscal year 1983 208 million for 1984 and 213 million for 1985 to refleft the impact on food stamp costs of reductions in other benefit programs a recent report from the food and nutrition service of usda issued june 1982 indicates that participation in the food stamp program averaged 22 7 million for march 1982 the highest level in 11 months although participation has increased for 4 consecutive months it remains about 1 3 percent below a year earlier legislative and administrative changes slowed the usual seasonal increase in participation however the sluggish economy and high rates of unemployment have pushed participation up particularly in areas hard hit by unemployment in the midwest region where unemployment is exceptionally high participation during march of this year was 5 percent above a year earlier and about 120 000 more than march 1980 commensurate with the overall decrease in total participation the costs of the food stamp program in march 1982 were 5 percent below the preceding march each 1 percent increase in unemployment adds 500 million to program costs and each 1 percent price increase adds 150 million the committee assumed that the current cbo estimates for program expenditures are accurate and will be sufficient to maintain benefits for those americans without resources to purchase an adequate diet it is not the intent of the committee to abruptly cut off food stamps or abruptly decrease the amount of food stamps that recipients would receive in the last quarter in the event that unemployment or inflation should go higher than the figures projected by cbo at the same time the committee recognizes the responsibility of both usda and the state agencies to operate an efficient

for the committee on agriculture and the house of representives and indeed for the american people as we discuss h r 3603 the agriculture and food act of 1981 i support with amendments that will be offered later this legislation because we need in the interest of the entire nation and indeed of the world stability in the agricultural sector just this morning in one of the newspapers in this capitol i read a report from lester brown one of the renowned researchers and experts in the field of world food resources where he stated that the population of the world which will increase around the turn of the century to over 4 billion people could not be sustained materially in the manner in which it is not being sustained nutritionally unless we have more productivity and that perhaps that productivity is indeed limited due to the lack of fertile lands or arable lands and that the bulk of them are now under production second let me say that there are some members in this house who oppose either parts of this legislation or the whole i could not fathom anybody opposing this legislation for one simple reasonless than 3 percent of the population of the united states provides all of the food and fiber for the entire population of the united states and enough to export to bring precious income back to our countrythat 225plus million people are fed by less than 3 million further and i think this is worthwhile for all of those who may listen or may read the recordit should be noted that the people in the united states of course there are always exceptionsevery rule has an exceptionand someone might quote us the exception but in general the people of the united states today are the best fed people in the world in the history of the world and they buy the best quality food in the world in the history of the world for the smallest part of their disposable income it takes less of their income to buy the food which they need to sustain themselves than in any other country in the world in the history of the world to get the food that they need there will always of course be the exception the american housewife or homemaker can get meat for example if she wants beef if she wants mutton if she wants ham shecp goat poultry whatever she wants she can get whole or frozen or fresh or cut up all you have to do is to go to the supermarkets and to the grocery stores and it is there available for a lower price a lower part of disposable income than for all of the people in the rest of the world the housewife can get the fruits the vegetables and of course in this legislation we do not deal with fruits and vegetables but our farmers still produce those items the best quality for the american people now why the need for the legislation because sources or items or factors beyond the control of the farmer have forced his cost of production to the limitmany times beyond what he sells his product for the cost of fuel the imposition by the government of restrictions or limitations what kind of pesticides what kind of insecticides how mlich he has to pay his farmworkers not that he begrudges thisand indeed the farmwvorker probably is the lowest paid of all of the workers of americabut yet that farmworkers contribute more i say respectfully than any other worker in america because he works for less unfortunately but helps provide the food that is necjessary to sustain this great nation and our people because of these deficiencies government has to intervene and we have this program which is meager assistance at best a safety net if one calls it thatand we are not speaking here of a hammock someone can go out and take a siesta on we are speaking of a safety net that you see in the circus the last thing that will break your fall before you fall to the ground and break all the bones in your body as you see with the aerialists in the circus this is what we are trying to do for the american farmer there are american farms collapsing by the day there are american dairymen shutting down their operations there are young people closing down their farms and i listened to lester brown saying we will not be able to feed all the people in the world so this is a very small modest effort to assist that productivity and meet our responsibility as a congress and a nation and as a people to that less than 3 percent who provide the food and fiber for all of us there are various and sundry parts of this bill which i would not detail to the members but rather will be available to read in the record but i say very respectfully that the line should be forming behind us to support us to provide this very very modest assistance to those who provide the food and fiber now the members will hear later aljout othe amendments the bill that passed the committee is beyond the budget resolution but we have a consensus amendment from the comimittee and outside the committee that wvill be offered by the gentleman from iowa that will bring our bill in line or below the budget imposed upon us by the budget committee we will bring our bill below the budget for fiscal year 1982 as instructed by the committee so i would hope that the members who are not here would read the recoiw for when we resume our deliberations next week those who oppose sections of this bill should realize again that it may be popular to say well it will increase the price of sugar it wvill increase the price of wheat for bread it will increase the price to the consumer out there in the marketplace it may wellin very very small areas but it is either that or like in many other countries in the wvorld that we have been reading of lately getting in line and waiting at the grocery store only not to have food available we really do not know what it is not to have it available i daresay all of us here had lunch no one told us how much we could order for that lunch no one told us wvhat the ration would be that is what we are trying to continue and to do so we have to offer a very modest fornm of legislative or government assistance to those who put that food on our table to those who put that food on our table for the lowest amount of disposable income than for any other people in the worldin the history of the world i would add that we need an effective government farm program because american agriculture is in deep economic trouble today without our action to continue a fair safety net farm support program that trouble will get worse and that would be the worst kind of bad news for american consumers depression in agriculture can weaken the ability of american farmers to provide us all with ample supplies of food and fiber at reasonable prices the fact that farmers are in trouble today is no news to those of us who follow agriculture closely but for those who do not let me recall for you the report issued by the department of agriculture just a few days ago that report said prices paid to farmers fell 2 2 percent in september that decline left the farmers purchasing power at the lowest level since april 1933 according to the report farm prices were down to just 59 percent of parity in september the lowest since april 1933 when the figure was 54 percent just 1 year ago farm prices were at 68 percent of parity compared with the 59 percent we got last month looking ahead we do not see much official optimism h 6879 octobcr 2 1981 an agriculture department expert was quoted thursday as predicing some continued weakness in prices this month unless there is an unexpected surge in exports or a sudden turn for the worse in harvest prospects government analysts have predicted that net farm income for 1981 which was formerly expected to show some improvement may be down around last years very poor level ini fact if we consider cash income without inventory changes 1981 could be even worse than the very bad year we had in 1980 many of my colleagues may have noted the feature story on this issue in thursdays wall street journal that story pointed out that inflation high interest rates and even the strength of the dollar overseas are combining with a growing grain surplus to batter the farm economy the story points out that wheat prices are down 7 percent from a year ago corn down 23 percent and soybeans off 19 percent the story adds that in this farm recession unlike some of those in the past we have some new problems producers generally unlike situations in that past cannot recoup their present losses on crops from offsetting profits on livestock this time livestock prices are so weak that there is only marginal profit in pork and continued losses in cattle the journal says this account also underlines the tremendous squeeze farmers face because of continued high interest rates one iowa farmer reports that a fewv years ago his interest cost on money borrowed to finance a steer was about 21 today the interest on that one feeder is about 120about the cost of feeding the steer the journal story quotes one private economist as saying that unless some unforeseen event rescues farmers in the near future many will be pushed over the brink and into depression secretary block in recent testimony before a subcommittee of the joint economic committee had this to say the farm balance sheet for this year is equally bleak farm asset values are up 8 4 percent but farm liabilities are up some 14 7 percent from last year due primarily to the increasing cost of borrowing financing for land purchases and operations also the secretary said he thinks hardly any farmers can make money when they pay 20 percent interest rates the secretary is perfectly right and this is part of our problem i do not know how accurate the forecasts are but i am convinced that farmers are facing a really critical period over the next few years that is why we mustfor the protection of the entire nationmaintain a farm program which gives producers at least a fighting chance to win their way back to a sound economy we understand the budget problems facing all legislation in this congress we understand fully that agriculture is going to absoi b its share of the cuts which must bc made to rebuild the nations economy but we must also understand that if we permit agriculture to continue sliding into depression farmers will not be the only victims in the long run a depressed agriculture is the worst kind of bad news for consumers because a depressed agriculture loses the ability to give consumers what they need mostan ample and stable food and fiber supply at reasonable prices i will not take your time to describ e in detail the provisions of h r 3603 i will include for the record a summary of those provisions suffice it to say here that it revises and extends for another 4 years price support and related programs for most of the major farm commodities it likewise extends the export assistance provisions of public law 480 it reauthorizes and places caps on appropriations for the food stamp program for 4 more years and provides the tools to conduict that program in a manner which keeps hunger from the needy and eliminates the greedy it improves and renews provisions relating to agricultural research extension and teaching and in no small measure it comes to grips with threats to one of the most precious elements of our national heritagefertile productive agricultural landwhich is increasingly endangered by erosion and conversion to a host of nonagricultural uses hl r 3603 is by no means a fat or flabby bill its provisions reflect the best judgment of the agriculture committee as to the minimal levels of protection necessary to permit american agriculture to continue the role it has so admirably filled in supplying adequate quantities of food and fiber at reasonable cost to the consumers of the nation while at the same time meeting the heavy demands of the world for agricultural commodities many of the provisions represent the only real safety net for farmers who are caught in the increasingly severe squeeze bietween declining prices and everincreasing costs it is true however that the bill as reported will for fiscal year 1982 result in costs exceeding the limits prescribed in the first concurrent budget resolution however amendments will be offered by a member of the committee to bring its costs within those limits they will deal with the dairy price support provisions and several other sections of the bill i would pause to point out that the agriculture committee has been one of the most diligent committees of the congress in practicing budgetary restraint for example last spring it reported out one of the first significant mea sures adopted by this session of the congress to reduce federal expenditures by eliminating a scheduled increase in dairy support levels this action was estimated to have saved a total of 246 million in outlays in fiscal years 1981 and 1982 the committee performed in a similar fashion during the reconciliation process measures agreed to in conference with our senate counterparts resulted in savings of a total of 2 7 billion over and above those called for by the reconciliation provisions of the first budget resolution in this regard i will offer amendments to h r 3603 which will delete provisions already disposed of by the reconciliation act or other legislation we assure you that we fully intend again to take the responsible course during the consideration of h r 3603 but we do not intend to deprive amerclan farmers of the minimal protection they need to permit them to survive the vagarics over wvhich they have no controlthe weather disaster inflation and crushing interest rates and we miust act to preserve the very basis for our botjntythe land with the amendments i have referred to the bill constitutes a responsible and costeffective approach to maintaining a viable agriculture in the national interest and insuring that hunger will not stalk the needy of our land it is a bill that merits the support of the farmer as well as the consumer and i urge my colleagues to give it that support"], [0.48535507917404175, 0.5146449208259583, 1, "today i am introducing the corporate takeover tax act of 1982 the objective of the bill is to make the tax system more nearly neutral with respect to corporate takeovers the tax system should create neither special benefits from nor impediments to mergers acquisitions or reorganizations unfortunately our present tax system creates a motive for takeovers quite apart from any opportunity to improve the utilization of productive assets when the tax advantages of a takeover become significant it is as if the unitedstates treasury provides a part of the funds used to finance the takeover under the present law corporate takeovers can be structured to achieve the same tax benefits to the buyer as a direct purchase of assets without incurring the tax consequences to the seller which would occur with a direct sale of assets in other words a transaction which is substantively an asset purchase can be structured to achieve avoidance or deferral of depreciation and investment tax credit recapture the availability of these techniques conflicts with several tenets of sound policy that is the tax consequences of a transaction should be based on its substance rather than its form there should be neutrality of treatment for essentially identical transactions and taxpayers should not be able indirectly to achieve that which cannot be achieved directly present law also permits nearly unfettered discretion to step up the basis of some of an acquired corporations assets so as to gain new depreciation deductions and retain for other assets the acquired corporations favorable tax attributes the undue degree of selectivity of treatment available under present law is illustrated by the recent unitedstates steelmarathon takeover according to some press accounts a partial liquidation of marathon would achieve a steppedup basis for selected assets the yates oilfield and certain other assets including lifo inventories if lifo recapture is postponed under pending legislation while under the consolidated return regulations there would be no recapture of any unearned investment tax credits and there would be deferral of the tax for recapture gains for intangible drilling costs depreciation et cetera the tax attributes relating to the other assets would continue with the continuing marathon subsidiary under this scenario according to one article there would be as much as 500 million in mergerrelated tax benefits in the first year with another 400 million in deferred taxes relating to lifo reserves finally present law does not adequately deal with taxmotivated takeovers of companies having net operating loss and investment tax credit carryovers the need for more adequate rules to restrict trafficking in loss companies is greater now because of current economic conditions and because the investment incentives provided by the economic recovery tax act of 1981 including the accelerated cost recovery and investment tax provisions will make more companies attractive takeover targets for tax reasons the bill would repeal the partial liquidation provisions of present law and in their place make it clear that a distribution in redemption of stock would qualify for capital gains treatment to the shareholder to the extent attributable to the termination or distribution of a business conducted for 5 years however present exceptions to the requirement that gain be recognized to a corporation distributing appreciated property in a stock redemption would be repealed in this way there would be parity of treatment for a case when stock is purchased and then redeemed with a property distribution and a case when the property is directly purchased moreover these changes would reduce the unwarranted selectivity available for the treatment of the assets of an acquired corporation the bill would not affect the presentlaw rule which permits a corporation to be completely liquidated without recognition of gain a basis stepup cannot be achieved in such a case without complete recapture complete liquidation also results in a termination of the corporations tax attributes to protect the requirement that gain be recognized on other stock redemptions the bill would require gain to be recognized in certain complete liquidations where a target company has spun off or distributed some of its assets to a subsidiary the bill deals with liquidations of an acquired subsidiary by repealing the present law provisions under which property distributed to the acquiring corporation receives a steppedup basis in its place the bill would allow an acquiring corporation to elect to treat the acquired corporation as having sold all of its assets in a 12month liquidation and then reincorporated as a result of this treatment there would be depreciation and investment tax credit recapture from the deemed sale and the tax attributes of the old company would be extinguished however the basis of all assets of the acquired company would be adjusted to reflect the purchase price paid by the acquiring corpora tion for the stock to this extent the tax treatment of the acquisition would be similar to an asset purchase from a company which had elected a 12month plan of liquidation thus unlike existing law a steppedup basis will no longer be available where liquidation of an acquired corporation is postponed for several years after its stock is purchased yet its favorable tax attributes are available to the acquiring corporation through a consolidated return this result under existing law is inconsistent with treatment of the acquisition as a purchase of assets when the election is made tax attributes of the old corporation would no longer be available on the acquiring corporations consolidated return because the old corporation would be treated as terminated when its stock is acquired the election would apply to all members of an affiliated group acquired as a result of the stock purchase which become members of an affiliated group with the acquiring company the rules i have described are intended to discourage corporate takeovers motivated by unwarranted tax advantages however these specific rules are designed to implement an overriding general rule that would be added to existing law by the bill under this rule a stepup in basis of all of a corporations assets can be achieved under other provisions of existing law including the consolidated return regulations only if complete recapture occurs as though the corporation sold all of its assets in a 12month liquidation to obtain a stepup of only selected assets there will be recognition of all gain including recapture items with respect to those assets the bill would simplify and improve the tax rules dealing with trafficking in net operating loss and credit carryovers the rules presently applicable or those adopted under the 1976 tax reform act and scheduled to be effective in 1984 do not adequately deter taxmotivated takeovers of loss companies the bill would prescribe uniform continuity of ownership rules for shareholders of a loss company whether a loss company is acquired by purchase by a corporate reorganization involving the loss company or in part by a corporate reorganization and in part by a purchase the presently applicable rule that losses may be carried over in full in a purchase acquisition merely because the trade or business of the loss company is continued would be eliminated to allow normal shareholder turnover there would be no reduction of carryovers when there is 60 percent or more continuity of ownership by shareholders of the loss company in other words the reductions in carryovers would occur when ownership by those who were shareholders in the loss year falls below 60 percent of a loss company uniformly for purchase acquisitions and reorganizations the portion of the loss that could be carried forward would be 2 2 percent for each percentage point by which the old shareholders retain more than 20 percent of the loss company the bill completely eliminates carryovers only when the old shareholders ownership falls below 20 percent to conform with the present law rules under which the attributes of an acquired company are generally usable in full under the consolidated return rules by an acquiring company controlling 80 percent or more of the stock of an acquired company under the bill losses would be preserved for continued ownership from the taxable year in which the loss was incurred to the taxable year to which the loss would be carried forward this would be more rational than either present law or the provisions of the 1976 act which arbitrarily compare ownership changes during a 2 or 3year period ending with the carryover taxable year under those rules the test for ownership changes is not made with reference to those who were shareholders when losses were actually sustained to facilitate the determination of ownership continuity ownership in the loss year and the carryover year would be compared only for shareholders who actually or constructively own 5 percent or more of the companys stock at either time for this purpe e all small shareholders would be aggregated and treated as a single shareholder thus in the case of a widely held company the computation and recordkeeping problems attributable to tracing the top 10 or 15 shareholders as under present law or under the 1976 act provisions would be alleviated in comparison to the 1976 act the bill would simplify the operating rules by not containing a concept of participating stock many commentators have indicated that the concept was an unnecessary complexity under the 1976 act under the bill the changes relating to partial liquidations stock redemp tions and liquidations of subsidiaries would apply witwtrespect to liquidations and redemptions occurring after august 31 1982 the changes relating to net operating loss and credit carryovers would apply to acquisitions and mergers occurring after decembe r 31 1982 i believe that it is essential that the congress strengthen and improve the tax rules applicable to corporate takeovers the bill i am introducing today would do that in several ways the subcommittee on select revenue measures will hold i hearings on this bill and related legislative proposals on may 24 1982 at that time i will be most anxious to receive the constructive comments and observations of economists tax practitioners and academicians an explanation of the provisions of h r 6295 follows this statement"], [0.4854172468185425, 0.5145827531814575, 1, "first i wish to express my sincere grief and sorrow at the passing of our distinguished colleague from ohio mr ashbrook whose funeral services are being held today and as i understand it the reason why we have no legislative business this afternoon though the gentleman from ohios philosophy of government and mine may perhaps be described as quite different if not diametrically opposed i had nothing but respect and appreciation for his dignified manner his behavior and his record as a member of this house today i continue the effort along the lines and in pursuance of the two resolutions and the two bills that i have introduced with respect to the federal reserve board the absolute need for the congress to revise the structure that results from passage in 1913 by the congress of the federal reserve act of 1913 and the resolutions in which i am calling for the impeachment of the chairman of the federal reserve mr paul volcker as well as the supplementary resolution that equally calls for the impeachment of the open market committee which means the board plus the five private bankers that serve on this tremendous powerful socalled open market committee which as i guess most if not all my colleagues know is hardly open at all now i have in the past outlined the case i reported to the house that because of the reply i had received from the chairman of the committee on the judiciary to my request that my resolutions be considered seriously and his reply which i have inserted in the record and will not refer to it nowin which he indicated that for reasons pressures and numerous business pending in that committee he could not commit the committee to look into the matter in the immediate foreseeable future but that he was instructing the staff to evaluate the case i have not had any kind of response if any indeed has been forthcoming from that staff so i announced to the house that in view of the fact that i was indeed earnest and that despite some interpretations of these efforts that having no other recourse i would have to do the next best thing as the gentlemen conversant with our rules know in the case of a bill that is improperly bottled up by an arbitrary committee or chairman of a committee we have recourse to the discharge method by which if we get the required number that is half plus one of the membership to sign a discharge petition that committee is discharged of that matter and the matter is presented to the full house but in my case and for this reason i follow this route i intend to fully exercise the prerogatives under the rules of the house and under the applicable rules to this kind of resolution for it is a house resolution and therefore under the rules it is amenable to consideration by the house at the proper time and i intend to do that since that is my intention i then announced to the house that i would conduct the equivalent of a proceeding in a committee such as the judiciary of the impeachment process and ry first two statements in pursuance of that the last made about a week before the easter recess i laid the bare outlines and established the beginning of a predicate in a legislatively and legal or statutory method as to the conception the range and the applicability of article 2 section 4 of the constitution with respect to the jurisdictional coverage of that section to such officers as the federal reserve board chairman there is no question about it and i think that that is no obstacle whatsoever as a matter of fact it was insinuated in the chairmans reply to me that the chairman of the judiciary committee that he ful y appreciated the intention and thrust of my resolutions and considered it serious and worthwhile that is in other words constitutionally responsible which is fine and i am grateful for that but nevertheless i feel impelled to lay out the case so to speak so today in pursuance of what i am going to engage in that area of prime cause for my motivation in following this kind of activity or channel of action so to speak for several years as a matter of fact more than severalfirst going back to 1965 i addressed to this house to my colleagues on the banking committee a committee that i have served on for 20 yearsbetter than 20 years since i first came to the congressand addressed myself to the president at that time lyndon johnsonconcerning what was obvious to me then and that was that the factors that had for one reason or another be it war be it domestic policy or being the policies of war though undeclaredand the consequence that was apparent in the year 1965 as reflected in all of the reports the annual report of the federal reserve board unfortunately i found that even though every member particularly of the committee gets a copy of the annual report very few bother to leaf through it or look at it but that was something that i have always done since being on the committee plus my general interest in the field of fiscal and monetary policies which i consider to be the critical area as a matter of fact to personalize a bit when i first was elected to the congress during the campaign for this seatthe opposition made a big issue about the absolute need to have a guarantee no matter who won that race he would be assigned to the armed services committee because of the nature of the district and its overwhelming dependence on federal policies with respect to defensesan antonio my home base is traditionally a city that has had a stake in national defense since its founding in the days and in the times of the spanish control of that part of thiscountry it has been an outpost of defense since its very founding in 1718 and today it is one of the great pillars of our national defense composite and therefore this issue was raised politically it was a safe issue to raise by the oppolition because the democrats were in the majority the rules and the precedents of the texas delegation were rigorously based on seniority and there was a great desire for joinder to the armed services committee so those texans who had been in the congress several terms had indicated that that is exactly the post they wanted remembering that my predecessor was the ranking member of the armed services committee at the time he departed congress however since i had had some experience 5 years in the state senate of the state of texas i knew what was proper and what would be properly committed and promised and of course i never made that an issue when i got here i realized that even though the opportunity was afforded me by the then speaker of the house who told me that the president of the united states had called to ask if anything could be done to see that i would be assigned to the armed services committee i was not aware of that until the speaker called me in when he did he laid it out he said now congressuman the only way that can be done is if we find some way of enlarging that committee and if we can overcome the resistance of your own colleagues from texas who obey strict seniority he said we can strong arm we can strong muscle but i wanted to talk to you and i said no i did not come up and choose to seek this position to do anything other than to be a member of the house and legislate as a member what would follow thereafter committee assignments and the like i was perfectly content to follow the precedents and the rules and that the only time i would raise cane would be if i april j8 1982 was shortchanged or if i was discriminated against and then i told the speaker you will know what it means for me to get aroused i said i want to explain to you that i faced the same thing when i was elected to the texas state senate in 1956 like a revolution in my country and i found our great system to its everlasting glory still works and it is strictly up to you no matter what kind of committee assignment a man gets if his range of interest is in any particular field pftrticularly on the congressional level there is no reason he cannot have ample opportunity to discharge that pentup interest or that expertise he might possess no matter what his committee assignment is i want to say that because my answer to the constituents at that time since i had the honor of being immediately referred to a standing committee at that time known as the banking and currency committeeand though there were already three of us simultaneously sworn in on january 10 1962 i was the only one of the three that got assigned to a full standing committee the other two had to wait until the next congress so when i went back home i said i know that an issue had been made but i want you to know this too banking finances fiscal matters and all are one of my pet areas of interest and no matte how much you ntay think a man can do on the armed services committee or any american thinks he can do on behalf of defense if the cur rency of the nation has no value you have very little ability to fund the proper defense now that i think of those words i am struck by the appropriateness of that thinking today because that is the issue but all along when i spoke out and addressed myself to president johnson in 1965 i pointed out that it is going to be inescapable that one of two things happened soon and quickone was it was inflation or high interest rates and that our history showed us that unless specific action were taken both on the executive level as well as the congressional levelthat it was inevitable unfortunately there was no success on my part this has been the story of my careerin some cases it has taken as long as 10 years before i have had completion of an action that i initiated and so i am used to that we come to the great beauty of our system and our system is so great that if a man or a woman is right and if he has any kind of survivability that is if you can live long enough politically eventually you will be heard and if you have any kind of e lciency in presenting the cause eventually it will be considered and adopted this is the beauty of our system now of course the question is how long can you survive in this case in 1965 it was obvious to me that the soft underbelly of the american economy was showing great stress the reason was that back home i was getting messages from the local superintendents of the independent school district for example and other local political subdivisions as well as private corporations that even though in the case of the public entitles they had issued bonds for the construction of schools for the repair and recon struction and extension of such things as water mains and sewage mainsthat the sudden increase and the scarlcity of the material such as copper the labor costs had grown expedien tially that they first were finding it difficult to obtain the material what could we do up here because we had the strategic reserves at that time second what could be done to prevent a further escalation in the infla tionary pressures and labor well when i picked up the same local papers and looked at the want ads i saw huge ads almost half a page asking for carpenters electricians and skilled workers to address themselves to a number in san francisco for construction work in southeast asia well that was then the beginning of the great construction of the camranh bay which as you know was a many many millions of dollars investment on the part of our country and which tragically today is being used as a way stop base for the russian navy but at that time with these pressures the soft underside of our economic belly was being pressured my suggestion to the president was one of two things one immediately consider those measures that presidents such as roosevelt and truman had seen fit to devise particulary truman because in the case of president truman it was the most similar to that which we were entering into in vietnam it was an undeclared war in the case of world war ii of course which had a declaration of war and all that the means and the full resources and energies of the nation shoring up for one purpose and one purpose only and that was the prosecution and the winning of the war what they did was specific and as i keep on pointing out every year for 20 years when i ask the economists when i ask the chairman and the board menbers of the federal reserve board when you come here and tell me and you wring your hands and you say what is tantamount to saying that interest rates for example are acts of god that nobody can do anything about it you are overlooking history why is it then that world war ii where by 1945 46 percent of our gross national product was being used on the federal level governmental levelnaturally for the prosecution of the warand the government the taxpayer never had to pay more than 2 percent interest can you answer that not a one has bothered to try to answer it of course there are answers and there are reasons and this is what iwas getting at the same thing with president truman except that there they also used other leverages they had mild credit restraints at the proper time timing is the most important thing so that here we are today with the greatest enemy of all no russian menace no german menace of world war ii is or was ever as ominously dangerous as what our country has allowed to happen to itself mostly because the people have lost out because their government has foresaken the interest of the greatest number that is of the people for the sake of the predatory few who have existed through all time and also since the beginning of the history of our government now i have gone into that and i am not going to be repetitious other than to enlarge a little bit to go into the greater range of history and i should preface those remarks by giving credit to a man who is the author of the only book that i know of anywhere that has such a comprehensive history of interest rates in fact the title of his book is a history of interest rates and that man is mr sidney homer of new york his volume is not only eloquent it should be must reading i should say by certainly every member of the banking committee in his prefatory remarks he says this he says a spectacular rise in interest rates during the 1970s carried many longterm market rates on prime credits up to levels never before reached or approached in our time and remember he is writing as of 197677 at the latest and such a thing as 21 percent prime interest rate he has not experienced so we are talking about what he is calling high interest rates pushing toward 10 percent at that time a longer view i continue to quote provided by this history shows that recent peak yields were far above the highest prime longterm rates reported in the united states since 1800 or in england since 1700 or in holland since 1600 in other words since modern capital markets came into ex istence in the course of his book he has what i consider to be tbe most incisive and the most pertinent observation and sums up the issue that has motivated me to speak out and introduce resolutions and bills he says in another place and the never ending struggle of democracy with the rule of the elite the difference between law imposed and law accepted and that is what my resolution of impeachment of mr volcker is all about and my bills to abolish the board as it is now constituted and transfer all its functions its rules buildings its printing presses its clerks its mimeograph machines over to the department of the treasury where they will be accountable to the peopledirectly as it always had been and even halfway under the federal reserve act of 1913 until 1952 that is one of the bills but this is the issue it is the issue of power as i have said beforepower and the lack of accountability on that power no country in the history of the world has given the power that resides and has been used ruthlessly and without a counting by the federal reserve board and partiaularly since 1952 but generally since about 1923 and the beginning of such a gimmick as the open market committee because that power in essence is as mr volcker himself said less than 7 months ago when he was talking about the need for the policy that he has so sternly and in heedless disregard of the average little businessman of the average standard of living said yes of course some americans staidard of living is going to have to deteriorate well this is a matter of national policy under our constitutional form of government not to be determined by a financier who is beholden to the private banks that control the economic destinies of our country who is more sensitive to the needs of chase manhattan and first city national than he is to the president or the congress of the united states i said in the last couple of remarks that just here recently the president had a secret meeting with the chair man of the federal reserve board secret meeting can you imagine that as is these are two foreign potentates having a summit meeting here is a man that is supposed to be a public servant accounting if not to he congress certainly to the president finally being prevailed upon to condescend to walk over to the white house and have a secret meeting with the president we still do not know what if anything happened there has been a lot of scuttlebutt about there being an impasse and that mr volcker said you have still got to do more than what you have done thus far and i am not going to yield one bit in wrenching that screw one more time but who knows there is no accountability the chairman let it be known that he was there at sufferance not as a responsibility discharged but what is the federal reserve board the federal reserve board you would be surprised how many of my colleagues and the infinite number of constituents and citizens who have written to me that have been under the impression that the federal reserve board was independent autonomous as if it had sprung from the brow of a greek god and not created by the congress the federal reserve board is a creature of the congress born as a result of congressional action known as the federal reserve board act of 1913nothing else but in the meanwhile our system of economy predicated on mass production mass consumption the glory of the world which in turn and especially since world war ii has another third leg to that stool and that is consumer finance or mass financeis predicated on exactly the policies that are in opposition to what mr volcker says must be done because and even if it does and the price of it will be the deterioration in the standard of living of some americans what americans david rockefeller of chase manhatten hardly members of the congress hardly only insofar as we know we are impacted by some of the adverse situationsconstituents going broke the number of foreclosures on homeowners tripling in the last 6 months not postponement of payments not delinquencies but foreclosures mind you and as we watch our hapless small businessmen how can they finance a floor inventory by borrowing at a bank that is going to demand what they say 2 or 3 points over the going prime interest rate well what that means right now is that there is no small businessman who is going to get a line of credit for less or much less than 18 percent who in the world in any country at any time at any point in history with comparative situations can survive much less our form of economy this is what is at stake this is why i was impelled to follow and seek the quickest means to bring attention and focus concerted action it has not been forthcoming and perhaps it is one of those regretful cycles where we do not respond until catastrophe is on us the trouble with that is that usually when we act in emergency or crisis we do not react as wisely and as prudently as we ought as a matter of fact the federal reserve board act of 1913 was a result of the great panicmore than a depressionit was the panic of 1907 but going back even to the beginning of our government because this is tied in with the very existence of our government mr homer was not exaggerating when he said the never ending struggle of democracy with the rule of the elite that is what we have now we have the rule of the elite and that elite is a socalled elite banking class that now is supranational why should they worry when their powers transcend the capacity the ability and the jurisdiction of individual nations including our own even the matter of war and peace is a decision now pretty much vested in the bankers sc as i said earlier the issue is power are the people going to completely keep the power the constitution vests in them of formulating and approving the fiscal the monetary the economic policies that are going to govern our country or are the bankers going to do it that is the issue the bankers are doing it they have done it and 1 see nothing on the horizon that seems to be able to muster the help we need to break that hold other than disaster and that i certainly do not even want to think about though reality compels me to admit that there is much more likelihood of that than not and i have expounded on that as long ago as 2 years and 2 montis ago it seems fair to bay that the socalled free market longterm rates of interest for any industrial nation properly charted provide a sort of fever chart of the economic and political health of the nation i have been charting it and that is the reason why i was im pelled to communicate with the president in 1965 certainly i was not seeking some political or personal benefit this is a subject matter that has very little political mileage if anybody is interested in knowing that but when we look at the full range of history and we see that the rise and the fall of nations and empires and societies are tracked by this thing we call interest rates it seems that somehow we have all been brainwashed as to the true definition of interest rates interest rates is a mechania by which the wealth of any country or society is transferred it is as simple as that i have pointed out of course that interest rates can be controlled of course there is such a thing as manageability of course there is such a thing as the american form of government having the resources to do exactly that if in the wisdom of the congress and to a certain extent of the executive as well it sees fit to do so what i am saying is that there is no reason why it cannot be reversed and in order to bring about some procedural suggestions to focus our attention on the reforms needed and the actions that can be taken both legislatively and administratively i have introduced these resolutions and these bills when we look at the history as so dramatically presentedeven though this is not a book on grammar this history of interest rateswe find that we as modem citizens like to think that credit is a modern invention but we can go back to 1800 b c before christ and look at the code of hammurabi in ancient babylonand learn that there must have been agitating minds even then because in the code it is prescribed that the maximum amount of interest charged for example on grain deals was 33 percent on other transactions such as silver it was 20 percent now we come down through history we bounce down to about 600 b c the greek states and we find that the same thing agitated the athenians and the law of solon had to be invoked there was a crisis incurred because of war and debt and what not but we should remember that at that time interest could be paid in money as well as other things including per sonal enslavement for nonpayment the code of solon limited that what it did was it removed the limitations that had been in existence since the code of hammurabi but instead reduced and eliminated interest in many many ways but then the next were the romans in their socalled twelve tables of the law which were sort of semicustomary law and semistatutory prescribed law and there the romans had precise figures and limitations and they went down to the figure of 8 percent and quadruple damages for violations exess charges over that amount then we go down the line even then to what i think was the most interesting period up to now up to this entry and that was the middle ages where we had a period of a thousand years but even charlemagne in what was known as the capitularies of charlemagne flatly forbade any increment on loans for a thousand years in the middle ages that was the rule and it became a theological or a religious issue on usury and the wrongness of usury even in the time of jesus christ there were usury laws and control of interest we come down to the 12th century in england and we find there these peculiarities that we find today because this is the great dilemma of the history of interest rates rememberkia that like a fever chart as the author says we can chart a nations period of stress and downfall this is why i am so concerned about out country ar we know it was not until the confederacy actually went broke and could not obtain credit that they called the constitutional convention though when they did issue bills or notes they never paid more than 5 percent and when they borrowed they never paid more than 51 percent but it finally got to the point where because as we will recall under the confederacy or the articles of confederation the government had no power to tax that therefore its paper had no real redeeming virtue so it was at that juncture in 1786 when it could no longer get credit or issue notes that the need for calling the constitutional convention of 1787 became absolutely imperative this is how money ties in with the flow and ebb of political and govern mental events this is why i was in great distress 2 years after 1965 when i saw what was happening with gold at that time we had the socalled gold exchangenot the gold standard but the gold exchangeand the gold we were pouring into vietnam was ending up in france and later when mr nixon made his famous trip to china what we did not read in the papers was that the chinese would not let his plane land until we had deposited 10 million worth of gold with them ostensibly to secure the cost of all the tv apparatuses and the other things that were entailed in that sojourn of our president in china but the interesting thing for us to remember is that it was demanded in the form of gold that is convertible that is ultimately it is payable in gold or redeemable in gold these things all have their meaning not because there is any justification to returning to a gold standard or anything like thatthat is equal follybut because they are symptomatic of this other thing and that is the fact of the policies that are shaping for ex ample how much interest the government is paying i am sure that the founding fathers and every responsible leader through franklin roosevelt and harry truman are turning over in their graves even in the depths of the ground to hear rumors that the government is paying almost as much as 15 percent on longterm notes that is incredible a 21vpercent prime interest rate incredible and we have our president piously proclaiming on radio last saturday that oh we should not be paying more than 10 percent well why 10 percent why not 6 percent since when are we going to be so grateful that is like saying oh hit us on the head again because it feels so good when you stop it is ridiculous and it has never ceased to amaze me how with such complacency we have accepted the loss of the power of determining the policies of economics of fiscal policy and monetary policy and without a whimper and how oblivious we are to the implications of this and how much we have lost in the way of time to be able to redeem even partially what has happened there is no way that the businesses that have been forced out of business just in the last 60 days can be revived even if interest rates were to drop to 6 percent today there is no way that this economy is going to be turned around at all even if interest rates were to drop in the next 3 months to 10 percent there is no way that before the end of this year there would be any impact at all but what is tragic is that in the meanwhile we have had such a maladjustment in the functional ability of this intricate economy known as the american economy and this should have been apparent to us with the folly of the 1971 economic stabilization act wage and xirice controls and incidentally even then on that issue we were a lost voice in the wilderness as members know i am labeled a liberal and i am proud of that designation if it is interpreted like i have always interpreted it in the american sense but there were a few of us5 of us and we were alonewho resisted tlat effort in the committee and there wore about 17 in the full house and the reasons we gave of course were just about as listened to as what we have been saying here in the last few months that perhaps is neither here nor there and we return to the fundamental question and that is what should we do to have accountability at least if we cannot have the return of this usurped power why can we not have some measure of accountability from these money managers why cannot the congress act that has been my question it seems to me that it is not a question just of this board and this chairman it has been a question that has been raised since 1963 after the visit of the then secretary of the treasury mr dillon who incidentally was supposed to be a great financial wizard but actually really was not except in one category and that was knowledgeability of the bond market in new york and the speculative market there the truth is that since i have been in the congress and on this committee for 20 years i have never yet had any member of the federal reserve board much less the chairman come to the congress and give us an ac counting of the reason for policies or an explanation of the mechanism and the system used in judgment making an evaluative explanation of making judgments on these critical issues because they are the ones who are saying that if you want to buy a car you pay 16 percent interest i notice there was a lot of hulabaloo recently because a few small bankers in california decided that they could go as low as 12 percent an average american family today even with the socalled decline of inflation knows better knows that when he goes to the market or the housewife goes to that market her grocery bill is not less and the items she has to have have not been reduced i have good testimony as of last saturday from my own wife but when it comes to a car remembering that that is our prime product we like to laugh at some of our countries to the south of us as onecrop economies banana countries coffee countries sugar countries but we are pretty much the same way the automobile industry is our basic if anyone does not believe that go try to tell the quarter of a million unemployed and the ripple effect of that unemployment in the northeast in the central midwest in ohio and illinois pennsylvania new york michigan because first the cars that are made are not being sold how can the average american at 16 percent afford to even if he could get the downpayment how can the small average businessman first get a line of credit from a bank even at 16 perceit longterm mortgages 17 percent if somebody is able to find an assumable longterm mortgage april r8 1982 ironically as in the case of interest rates we are going right now in that respect in that sector of our economy we are exactly where we were in 1929 5percent balloon notes no longterm financing which is exactly the point we have reached now these are not things that are caused by accident and let me hasten to pursue one further matter they are not caused either by socalled profligate government which has not been profligate it is not caused as the economists now are expressing puzzlement the secretary of the treasury regan said about 2 weeks ago that he was completely mystified he could not understand why this intractability in the persistence of high interest rates because they were supposed to with the reduction in budgetary outlays and with the other concommitants of a reduction in inflation rates supposed to have gone down he is not the only one puzzled even some of the preeminent economists but the truth is if we do not understand the true cause and the true nature of the forbes that lead to the condition how in the world can we ever arrive at a solution to the matter it is impossible this is ekactly what i think has been the case in and out of the congress essentially we cannot have it both ways the federal reserve cannot have it both ways on the one hand they want to assume and take credit for fighting inflation through a restrictive tight money policy on the other hand they say their hands are tied because the prime cause of that inflation is the insufficient and inadequate reduction in the budgetary side of the governments activity they cannot have it both ways either they are able to and have the power or they do not on the other hand they resist any kind of inquiry from the congress fifteen years ago i requested gao to try to find out for me what resources the federal reserve board had for selfpolicing did they have an inspector general who did they account for other than a socalled internal audit the gao the general accounting office which is the only instrumentality the congress has amenable to it replied that they were not empowered to look into the federal reserve board so that i joined at that time with the distinguished chairman of the banking committee my fellow texan mr patman one of the greatest americans who has served in this house in a bill that would bring in the gao and you would have thought that we had introduced the equivalent of a resolution of an act of treason and naturally never could get it considered the bankers there is not a bill i have known of particularly those that mr patman was trying to sponsor in 1965 in anticipation of the stress in our financial and banking system that was beginning to be visible the failure of some banks and the like and so he tried to get the administration house administration committee to budget a modest amount so that he could get the staff to look into such things as interlocking directorates now of course that is out of control you have these massive mergers and acquisitions where you have more than interlocking controls you have now fewer people controlling a greater mass of our economic activity in the country mr patman was trying to get at the interlocking relationships and banks some of the monopolistic corporations some of the key pricefixing pricedetermining monopolies in our country and he never succeeded in fact he was abused and fought bitterly here and back home politically and we never succeeded in even getting approval on the committee level because i have not seen any of those bills and especially if a powerful body such as the american banking association is against any of these measures my experience and observation in 20 years is it is not about to be approved by the congress or the committee that sounds harsh but that is my observation based on 20 years of membership on the banking finance and urban affairs committee as it is now known of the house of representatives the federal reserve board is actually the private commercial banking system of the country it is not a public entity in that sense so you have the fox so to speak watching the henhouse about the only discretion we can hope he will have is how may chickens that fox decides to eat up per night and when it suddenly gets voracious and uncontrolled well then should we be pained should we be surprised if what we call the american way or standard of living is collapsing and in danger with that question i will yield with the unanimousconsent request that i may be permitted to include at this point a recent article entitled they recall cars dont they why not central bankers by an illustrious professor of economics at the university of waterloo waterloo ontario

agriculture committee on which i serve is meeting to mark up legislation deciding the fate of the commodity futures trading commission the cftc is an independent federal regulator with the formidable responsibility of overseeing this countrys futures markets i say formidable because i think the futures industry is growing at a rate unforeseen a decade ago since 1975 the year the cftc began operating the number of active futures contracts traded has increased 75 percent while trading volume has almost quadrupled to more than 100 million contracts per year ten years ago futures contracts were in wheat soybeans corn oats and other agricultural commodities now you can buy a futures contract in treasury bonds treasury bills certificates of deposit and other financial instrumentsnot to mention petroleum products precious metals and foreign currencies my point is that the futures market is rapidly changing and expanding and the cftc must keep pace the cftc is no stranger to criticism i would imagine that the first time that some of my colleagues ever heard of this particular agency was during the silver crisis of 1980 when silver prices skyrocketed and then plummeted the events surrounding the rapid price movements in silver during this time have been examined investigated and studied more than any previous incident in the hihtory of futures trading congress ordered a comprehensive interagency study of the matter in 1980 and at least four congressional committees have held extensive hearings on the subject the conclusion of the agriculture subcommittee was that the cptc handled the silver matter professionally the agencys chosen course of relying on persuasion market forces and selfregulatory action under careful oversight was ultimately successful in confining the disruptive effects to a minimum no one defaulted on his contracts and every penny owed on the contracts was paid in none of the reports prepared for congress has anyone suggested a preferable course to that selected by the cfic and there is no evidence that any other acency of the government could have done the job better the commodity futures trading commission is a creature of congress it was established by congress in 1974 and is subject to the reauthorization process which means it must justify its existence to congress at specified intervals reauthorization by its very nature is a process of constructive criticism it is a time to see what has worked and what has notkeep the good and improve upon the problem areas that is what the house and the senate are attempting to do at this time just as reauthorization brings forth constructive criticism it also gives rise to complaints and in the case of the cftc the dredging up of past perceptions that are no longer accurate i think for the record it is important to go over the recent accomplishments of the commodity futures trading commission and to state that the commission of 5 years ago is not the cftc of today the commission has been criticized for its slowness in approving new contractsand rightly so in 1981 however the pace picked up and there were 22 new futures contracts approved for trading by the end of the year in a few instances the commissions accelerated pace of new contract approvals placed it ahead of the industrys timetable several new contracts were cleared even before the exchanges were ready to trade them with the continued hard work of the commission staff the new contracts approval procedure should be well under control in 1982 along these same lines the commission approved a 3year pilot program permitting commodity options trading on regulated exchanges it is a cautious carefully reasoned approach to trading options and at this moment the commission is reviewing the contract applications of the futures exchanges and hopes to have the program up and running by this summer last september the commission granted registration to the national futures associationthe first organization ever to qualify as an industrywide selfregulator since the 1974 amendments to the commodity exchange act the nfa holds great promise of rounding out the industrys efforts to regulate itself while offering relief to the commission in a number of areas including financial audits dispute resolution training sales practices and so forth the commission will have a continuing oversight role and is working with the nfa as it organizes aid begins operation also last september the commission directed for the first time that all futures contracts must have speculative position limits and is in the process of working with the exchanges to determine what these limits will be after nearly 8 years of turf fighting the cfic and the securities and exchange commission reached an accord which was announced last december in general the understanding leaves all futures trading with the cftc while regulation of options directly on most financial instruments in with the sec the cftcrelated features of this accord are part of the commissions reauthorization legislation and have in fact been approved by the senate subcommittee on agricultural research and general legislation and the house subcommittee on conservation credit and rural development another aspect of the improved relationship between the cftc and the sec is found in a firstever joint lawsuit filed by both agencies last august against a utah firm dealing in both commodities and securities the cftc has been making a concerted effort to involve state enforcement agencies in cracking down on offexchange commodity fraudsan area which unfortunately is seeing tremendous growth the commission has joined in several state lawsuits and prepared a spotters guide to commodity investment fraud which it sent to all state liw officers for their information and use there have also been a number of inhouse improvements at the commission leading to better more efficient public service these include paperwork reduction improvements in the reparations system as well as the beginning of a new computer system which will be a great help in market surveillance registration and information retrieval i have not meant to belabor the improvements i see at the commodity futures trading commission nor to infer that it has no further to go there is always one more step that can be taken one more program that can be improved upon but i think that the commission and its staff has proven their willingness to work and to meet the challenges of overseeing a rapidly growing industry in a time of government restraint i wish to commend them for their efforts and bring them to the attention of my colleagues o h1398 co"], [0.4856373071670532, 0.5143626928329468, 1, "i rise in the solution for the most part

not secretary lewis told our committee in hearings convened yesterday that a further cooling off period might put the other crafts in the position of vetoing the agreements which their union representatives accepted because it would shake the economy to act in such a manner as to terminate all 13 agreements our committee was advised to accept the administrations proposal and pass this legislation it is difficult to forecast whether this assessment is correct it would be consistent with our experience during the prior work stoppages addressed in the years since 1960 to mandate a coolingoff period this would have the effect of returning the engineers to work and continuing the negotiations congress could pass such a resolution and we could revisit this issue next year if the negotiations are unsuccessful however the senate has acted to order the engineers back to work under the terms dictated by the emergency board our committee voted today in favor of an indentical resolution and it appears likely that wd will approve the legislation without adding the coolingoff period as i said earlier given the dire state of our economy this is a decision which i support ievertheless i find this process somewhat troubling in the case of patco and in the case here today our government has made the policy decision to deprive labor of its right of selfhelp we have decided that the needs of the economy outweigh completely the rights which we as a free society have accorded to labor clear ly we have to draw the line somewhere but it is not in the ultimate best interests of this country to make industrial policy through government intervention only in crisis circumstances can we say with complete accuracy that a rail strike requires more government attention than a string of corporate takeovers which tieup billions of dollars in credit can we make the claim that government intervention in a labor dispute is more appropriate than emergency planning to guard the economy against an oil shock this is a decision which the reagan administration has made can we justify doing nothing about the penetration of imported automobilesas the administration asserts we must when a legislative solution is availableand act decisively in this instance to block a rail strike how do we decide in each of these instances where to draw the line we have a free enterprise system which we all support and all of us here today take this action with some reservations we face a crisis and clearly congress should act but when our economy is suffering as it is our industrial policy needs to be somewhat broader than merely passing bills which ieturn labor unions to work there are alternatives for months i have advocated an economic summit to be called at camp david by the president in such a setting labor management expert economists small businessmen and business women and members of congress could meet and agree on positive policios arrived at on a nonpartisan basis the economic policy task force of the democratic caucus has made a similar recommendation in terms of the establishment of a coordinating council recently i was joined by our colleagues jonw dingell and perer rodino in introducing legislation to establish a select committee on reindustrialization this would be an appropriate forum for the house to arrive at consensus policies for an economic alternative to the presidents program there is no shortage of alternatives no shortage of energy and certainly tremendous need for us to work cooperatively on solutions to our economic distress regardless of whose proposal we adopt i think it is clearin light of the debate taking place here todaythat we need more assertive leadership in the formulation of economic policy further we need to avoid legislating in the midst of a crisis particularly when the crisis calls for us to intervene in the collective bargaining process we can we must do better e"],

late representative robert l doughton of north carolina one of the most illustrious members this body has ever produced his career in the unitedstates house of representatives spanned 42 years 18 of which he served as chairman of the ways and means committee mr doughton retired from congress in 1953 and died in 1954 he is buried in his beloved alleghany county n c among the hills and the people he loved so much to do justice to the achievements of this great man would in the words of chief justice fred m vinson require the ability of a boswell a morley a freeman or a sandburg i possess none of these talents nor does time permit an encompassing recitation of his contributions to the nation mr doughton had a legislative record over his 42year stay in congress which president truman said was without equal i could not begin to list his accomplishments president truman said but above all else i like to think of what bob doughton has done to bring security to millions of his fellow citizens of course the security of which president truman spoke was the social security act which in the words of the late honorable john d dingell sr of michigan was the humane plan proposed by one of the greatest presidents america ever had franklin delano roosevelt was materially inproved as it was fashioned in the ways and means workshop back in 1935 and it was under the skillful piloting of chairman doughton that all dangerous shoals and reefs were avoided~ 0 this recognition of the importance of mr doughtons role was widely acknowledged in fact representative wilbur d mills dark once stated that mr doughton is properly known as the father of our social security system while this probably was his greatest contribution to the nation it was by no means hits only shortly after mr doughtons election to congress in 1910 he joined in the fight to strip the speaker of his power to appoint the house committees the feat inspired chief justice vinson to write to have been a soldier in such a battle in the democratic process is distinction unto a lifetime in 1924 mr doughton was selected by the party caucus to be a member of the ways and means committee it was through his work on this committee that he would make his greatest contributions to his district state and nation in 1932 mr doughton exhibtied the independence and tenacity which earned him the nickname mulely bob by being the only 1 of the committees 24 members to oppose the hoover administrations sales tax joining forces with representative d fiorello la~luardia he was able to kill the bill on the house floor by a 223 to 153vote only a year later mr doughton became the committees chairmana position he held for 18 years longer than any other person in the history of congress because of this position it was his responsibility to raise the revenue for the new deal and fair deal programs by the time mr doughton retired in 1952 the nation had enacted 25 major tax bills in its 176year history eighteen of those twentyfive bore the name of robert l doughton president truman was mnot simply offering words of flattery when he said under his mr doughtons leadership the congress has developed the greatest revenue system in the world but mr doughton did not funnel all his energy into raising revenue for the federal government in 1936 he sponsored the legislation which created the blue ridge parkway a 480mile scenic parkway which cuts through the beautiful western mountains of virginia and north carolina connecting the shenandoah national park and the great smoky mountains national park representative doughton was so closely associated with this project that he was often called the father of the blue ridge parkway in 1938 representative robert f rich republican of pennsylvania offered an amendment to interior department appropriations which would have changed the name of the parkway to the doughtonblue ridge parkway this amendment passed the house by a unanimous vote however it was stricken from the senate version at the time of its construction the parkway opened up what had been until that time an extremely isolated area in both states and created jobs in an area where the depression may have had its greatest impact today the parkway still is greatly valued and treasured according to the national park service in 1980 alone the parkway was used by over 13 4 million vehicles for recreational purposes and by over 3 2 million vehicles for nonrecreational purposes mr doughton also effectively and actively supported two other pieces of legislation which still have a significant impact upon our state one such program which we refer to is the tva this program finally brought the unruly tennessee river and its tributaries under control sparing the people of that area untold amounts of flood damage also this program has provided electrical energy and recreational facilities for the state the other program which we would like to point out is the rural electrification administration this program still is making significant contributions in 47 states in our state it has allowed the rural areas in all sections to develop and offer an alternative to its agrarian tradition for which it is so well known and of which it is justly proud some other legislation which representative doughton handled in committee and on the house floor include the following the national recovery act the reciprocal trade treaty acts the bituminous coal act which saved the depressed coal industry throughout the nation the renegotiation of war contracts which brought about the reversion of billions of dollars of unjustified profits back to the government obviously this brief summary of mr doughtons legislative accompiishments cannot do justice to a brilliant career of 42 years however it does indicate the type and range of mr doughtons contributions to the nation in addition to his fine legislative record mr doughton also demon strated that he was not just a parochial politican whose efforts and energies were directed to serve only state and local interests mr doughton was a national statesman in the truest sense of the word this fact is reflected in some of the comments made on the house floor at the time of his retirement in 1952 and at his death in 1955 at the tribute paid to him on his retirement speaker sam rayburn democrat of texas simply stated that this country is a better country for bob doughton having lived in it at the time of mr doughtons death representative robert w kean republican of new jersey a member of the ways and means committee with mr doughton for 7 years ijut it this way though representing a rural area he understood the needs of all the nation rural and industrial and worked for the good of all the american people without doubt mr doughton placed the good of this nation firsteven before his own personal career it was well known that he wanted to retire from congress as early as 1940 to run for governor and then for the senate however president roosevelt quickly sent a letter asking him to reconsider his personal goals part of that letter follows no one knows better than i what your service as chairman of the ways and means committee in the past six years has meant to me and the nation it would be a great loss to the country to have you leave this post in concrete results the legislation piloted by you to enactment has included many of the most important measures of my admin istration of course that part of your work is a matter of public record but in addition to such distinguished accomplishment there has been a great service which you have rendered personally your councel your sound mature judgment on public questions and the steadying influence which you have exerted has been of invaluable assistance to me in addition to being a fine legislator and statesman mr doughton was a man who still was able to retain the love and respect of his colleagues on both sides of the aisle again the words of those with whom he served leave no doubt of this fact representative john w byrnes of wisconsin said at the time of mr doughtons death our country is a better place to live because bob doughton served in congress history must list him among the great public servants of the nation representative clare e hoffman of michigan added had it been my privilege to have changed his life i would have said this i am sorry he was not born in the fourth congressional district so it might have had his able service as their public servant but the man who probably best expressed the republican opinion of mr doughton was representative daniel a reed mr reed ranking minority member of the ways and means committee and mr doughtons successor to the chairmanship once said we have just listened to a great and grand american we may not agreed in our philosophy on some things but as far as concerns the patriotism and the earnestness and the sincerity and the justice of the great man from north carolina i think we can all agree that he is outstanding in every respect these words were not made to flatter a retiring colleague or to honor a dead man they were genuine words of admiration and love made during the heat of the 1951 tax debate truly mr doughton was held in only the highest esteem by all his colleagues finally mr doughton was a man of unimpeachable integrity and the embodiment of the best qualities of rural america this fact was widely acknowledged and shared by all who knew him he was a man who had never quite finished high school and yet he became one of our countrys outstanding legislative experts in the most complex and most technically difficult areas of governmenttaxation on the occasion of mr doughtons retirement the late john d dingell sr said it is because of the known quality of his character that so many of the bills bearing his name have been accepted and passed almost on faith on that same occasion congressman mills a successor to mr doughton as chairman of the ways and means committee said he has been acclaimed by persons and organizations from all walks of life for his contribution to the wellbeing of his fellowmen a high standard of christian morality has been inherent in his every action it is such a record as that achieved by mr doughton that stands as a challenge to each of us in this chamiber~ 0 our great chairman has unstintingly lent his keenness of mind physical stamina and moral courage to his country when duty called mr doughton knew no comprom~se while each of the foregoing gives us an idea of the greatness of this man we think that the comments of former speaker john w mccormack after mr doughtons death best show us his true character mr mccormack the majority leader at that time said it is a life so interwoven with the meaning of america that for me it is impossible to think of this country without men like him or to think of men like him without think ing of this country there can be no doubt that the hon robert l doughton is truly worthy of a commemorative stamp and of our honor and respect he had a legislative record which perhaps is unparalleled he was a statesman in the truest sense of the word he was respected and loved by all members finally he was a man of unimpeachable character who embodied all the great aspects of rural america his hoaietown newspaper the alleghany news said upon his death on the courthouse lawn in sparta a figure of his head looks down on the people he and his brother rufus a doughton served so well there is his likeness again on the bronze plaque in doughton park but there are many other monuments to this great man not in bronze but on the nations law books and in the heart of thousands who will tell those who come after them of what this bighearted man of the mountains accomplished through his long and purposeful life since that tribute was written the other memorial to mr doughton has been the dedication of a wing of the alleghany memorial hospital in 1964 nothing exists outside of tiny alleghany county to honor this great national servant today those hearts who carried the monuments to robert l doughton are slowly disappearing i feel that something must be done to help erect new monuments in the hearts of people the issuance of a commemorative stamp will go a long way in that direction certainly if ever there has been a man worthy of such an honor it is the late hon robert l doughton e"], [0.4860421419143677, 0.5139578580856323, 1, "the vote today on whether or not to approve a sale of airborne warning and control systems to saudi arabia is a very difficult one for me it appears that the house will disapprove the sale by an overwhelming vote this is one of those issues where it would be easy to just go along because politically it appears to be popular to do so however we are voting on more than a sale of military equipment embraced as an integral part of this issue are the questions first would the loss of the awacs equipment to the soviets present a threat to unitedstates security second would the sale of awacs to saudi arabia weaken israeli defenses third what impact would a denial of the sale have upon future unitedstates efforts to bring peace to the middle east essentially the questions can be classified into two groups military and political in order to reach the political question one must resolve the military questions first members of congress would not consciously vote to damage american security and most members of congress feel an obligation to the survival of israel and would not vote to weaken israeli defenses would the loss of the awacs equipmenit to the soviets present a threat to unitedstates security while there is confusion of the facts on the question of a loss of the awacs equip~ment to the soviets i am not convinced that a loss would pose such a threat i heard the speaker say this morning ait his press conference that sophisticated equipment such as the awacs should not be sold to any nation the speaker stated that awacs and other sophisticated equipment should be under joint control such as the umbrella established by the north atlantic treaty organization but the awacs is a boeing 707 aircraft equipped with radar and computer equipment that has been available for as long as 20 years equipment of this nature can be purchased from many sources including but not limited to the british the french the belgians and others indeed should the awacs sale be deniled to saudi arabia the british have offered to supply the saudis with similar equipment known as nimrod while there are differences between the nimrod and the awacsand the awacs is a superior systemthe nimrod would serve the saudis needs for an airborne early warning capability the question then is not whether the saudis will have the capability but rather who will supply the equipment it has been argued here that it would be damaging to unitedstates military capabilities if a captured awacs were to fall into soviet hands but the soviets have their own version of the airborne and control system known as candid the candid is projected to be in production before the awacs could be delivered to the saudis thus the intelgence value of a captured awacs to the soviets would be marginal therefore the argument that a loss of the awacs to the soviets would be damaging to our security is a red herrin~g would a sale of awacs to saudi arabia weaken israeli defenses virtually no one can deny the claimn that the israeli air force is suprenme in the middle east inasmuch as israel is only about 200 miles from potenitial saudi targets a forwatrddeployed awacs could provide only a scanit 2 to 3 minutes extra reaction time for the saudis in addition we have provided the israelis with the e2 electronic countercounter meastirv s aircraft which has the ability to ef fectively jam the awacs voice transmiission because saudi arabian fighters do not possess datalink comnmunicat ions capabilities control and coordination by a saudi awacs by voice transmnission in a conflict with israel wouild be difficult if not impossible some argue that the saudis usie of awacs would diminish israels offensive air capability if israel attacked saudi arabia the israeli air porce possesses the capability with the e2 electronic countercounter measures to jam the awacs voice transmissions thereby neutralizing the awacs in the event of a war between saudi arabia and israel finally the awacs proposed for sale to the saudis has no lookdown capability which would allow it to provide comnmand and control of arab aircraft attacking israeli ground forces without that ability it could not be used to direct arab ground and air forces in the event of another outbreak of liostilities thus israels capacity to defend itself or to undertake offensive actions in the middle east would not be icasurably affected by the sale of the awacs to saudi arabia what impact would a denial of the sale have upon future unitedstates efforts to bring peace to the middle east saudi arabia has demonstrated its friendship as well as its economic and political alliance with the united states on numerous occasions saudi arabia has been a stabilizing economic influence within opec in the oil pricing debate while some opec producers would indiscriminately raise the price of oil saudi arabia has argued successfully in maintaining oil price levels which have riot escalated at the same rate as worldwide inflation in addition saudi arabia successfully persuaded the plo to agree to a ceasefire with israel for the first time during the recent lebanese missile crisis everincreasing outbreaks from rad ical muslims and other arab extremists challenge the established order of the middle east the assassination of the late egyptian president anwar sadat last week is an infamous example which is fresh on our minds at a time when waves of islamic fundamentalism threaten to engulf the arab world the united states must expand its influence throughout the region in order to broaden the peace process begun at camp david we simply cannot be satisfied to maintain the status quo to succeed american policy must address the legitimate defense needs of moderate arab nations such as saudi arabia when those needs do not jeopardize american security or weaken israeli defenses the conclusion is unavoidable that it is in the best interests of my country to vote for the awacs sale"]], "top_incorrect": [[0.5162827372550964, 0.5162827372550964, 0, "mr speaker that yuri federov and

distinguished colleagues messrs edwards stark and hyde would help to restore stability to our nations professional sports leagues and give fans and communities a muchdeserved degree of protection for the enormous investments they make on behalf of their sports teams it deserves prompt and favorable consideration by every member of this body my decision to cosponsor this legislation was not arrived at lightly i am no opponent of our free enterprise system nor is this bill a bailout of the owners of national football league clubs quite simply this bill is necesary to protect fans and communities from irresponsible actions by team owners who have forgotten on whose behalf the games are played it will entitle leagues to refuse to permit wellsupported and financially successful clubs from relocating and it encourages leagues to maintain geographic and competitive balance by permitting revenue sharing h r 6467 will protect the loyal fans who are after all the lifeblood of professional sports the simple truth is that sports teams could not survive without the support of the local fan who buys the tickets attends the games and watches the telecasts sports teams and their home communities traditionally have a unique and very special relationship with one an othera relationship that involves each adopting the other as its own here in washington for example the redskins are our redskins and it is our hockey team the capitals that so many residents are working to keep in washington it is this bond between team and community that makes professional sports so different from any other business no other business exists for its customers the way a sports team exists for its fans it is the interests of those fans that we in congress are obligated to protect moreover communities have substantial interests in the continued operation of their local franchises that deserve protection the presence of a major league franchise results in tremendous economic and psychic benefits to a community the contribution a club makes to the local economy is measured in the tens and sometimes hundreds of millions of dollars dozens of local businesses depend on the continuing operation of professional sports teams and major league teams help to boost tourism and in vestment moreover these franchises are an indispensable unifying force to their communities and bring together people of all ages races and economic stations the players are an inspiration to a communitys youth and the clubs and their players are often intimately involved in a wide variety of civic charitable and cultural programs for their part communities make significant contributions to the success of their local sports teams they construct and maintain often at substantial public expense stadiums and related facilities that are so essential to a teams economic and playing field success more importantly though the communities and their residents identify with their teams the teams victories belong to the whole community and the civic pride that a sports team provides cannot be measured in dollars the loss of a franchise is immeasurable and communities should not be forced to bear such losses simply because a particular owner wants to fatten his bottom line i am at a loss to understand some of the opposition that has arisen to this measure h r 6467 is an extremely narrow bill that will have no effect on any player or collective bargaining issue it has no effect on any competing league it has no effect on broadcasting or cable television and it has no effect on baseballs current antitrust status other arguments raised against h r 6467 are equally spurious it does not as its opponents contend give leagues a blank check to move teams at will precisely the oppositeh r 6467 only protects league decisions to maintain clubs in their existing locations in addition because h r 6467 would encourage more equal sharing of revenues among the clubs of a league it would discourage franchise shifts that are motivated by an owners desire to move to larger more profitable markets finally i have heard it said that h r 6467 is unfair because it would deprive the oakland raiders of their recent court victory over the nfl to the contrary no single event more clearly underscores the need for legislative action to protect the sports fan of america than the attempt by the raiders to abandon oakland for the cabletv riches of los angeles when the raiders announced their intention to abandon oakland they had just concluded their 12th consecutive sellout seasona record of support virtually unmatched in professional sports mayor lionel wilson in his testimony last february before our subcommittee on monopolies told of the tremendous psychological loss that the entire east bay would suffer if the raiders threatened departure were to become a reality as the new york times reported on june 2 the raiders put oakland on the map to the fans in the east bay who so loyally supported the raiders the team was the most dynamic thing to happen to oakland and rooting for them was almost a religious experience i am inserting the new york times article in the record at the end of my remarks perhaps the relationship between oakland and the raiders was best summarized by the teams captain gene upshaw who said on national television that the raiders and oakland have given each other pride and identity when the raiders announced their plan to movedespite the unanimous opposition of the other 27 nfl clubsthey ranked near the top of the league in ticket receipts and total income they had been enormously successful on the field throughout the 1970s and had always been a highly profitable franchise in short there was no reason for them to move except al davis desire to seek even larger profits in los angeles finally it should not be overlooked that the raiders earned these revenues and profits while playing in the publicly financed oaklandalameda county coliseum this modem facility was built especially for the raiders largely on the strength of commitments made by the team and afl commissioner joe foss that they were in oakland to stay if they are now permitted to abandon oakland that stadiumwhich local residents will be forced to pay offwill be an everpresent reminder to fans and taxpayers everywhere of the cost of misplaced trust if the federal antitrust laws require the nflor any other sports leagueto stand by and permit its most successful and wellsupported franchises to relocate at will and in express disregard of past commitments to the fans the congress and other members of the league then those jaws are not serving the public interest and should be changed unless congress acts now the door will remain open for a series of hitandrun transfers that would benefit individual owners at the expense of the communities and loyal fans that have supported the clubs over the years in circumstances such as these there is every reason for congress affirmatively to act to protect the rights and interests of fans and communities no injustice will be worked by requiring the raiders to honor their contrac tual obligations to their partners in the nfl and their civic and moral obligations to the fans and community of oakland the committee on the judiciary of which i am a member has already held several days of hearings on sports and antitrust issues those hearings conducted under the skilled direction of chairman rodino have been extremely valuable in defining the relationship of antitrust principle to professional sports leagues and clarifying the form that any remedial legislation should take i look forward to early hearings on h r 6467 and to the prompt enactment of this valuable and muchneeded protection of

that peace will be miraculously achieved the only thing holding the camp david accords together are billions of dollars of american taxpayers money and for this reason they are built on a shaky foundation bound to crumble whenever the storm winds of conflict blow i find it inappropriate to criticize israel for wanting to secure its borders yet if this means more military action than seems reasonable and it is financed entirely with american tax dollars the unitedstates congress and the people of the united states who elect the members of congress bear a responsibility for what is happening interventionism in the internal affairs of other nations and policing the world to make it safe for democracy do exactly the same thing as domestic economic intervention they create many more problems than they solve the vietnam war is a good example of that is likely to result when intervention is pursued and our national security is not our only concern obviously our loss in vietnam did not precipitate a war in hawaii or california it has been frequently argued that the reason why we stay in europe the mideast and the far east is to prevent the battles from occurring on our own shores in an age of icbms and space technology this argument seems ludicrous yet the policies never change the absurdity of interventionism was clearly demonstrated by our participation in the rio treaty and in nato obviously we could not perform both commitments except by making war against both argentina and britain in the long run it is anyones guess as to what this will do to our relationship with our neighbors to the south neutrality obviously would have served our national interest to a much greater extent now we witness again this same absurd policy in the mideastwe supply

proposed 20 million grant to lebanon is quickly increased to 50 million for humanitarian reasons to refuse would mean that america and the unitedstates congress are heartless and enjoy seeing the innocent suffering because of the war we helped to create we offer to risk not only more dollars but now american boys to rescue the plo an organization we have never recognized and have as policy tried for decades to destroy when will this ever end economically we are teetering on the brink of collapse and militarily we remain weak weak and defenseless from a soviet missile attack all this interventionist activity designed to make us look strong serves only to weaken and demoralize our people the american people are tired of sacrificing themselves for the world it never seems to help and the cost is now prohibitive on top of it all we are not respected and generally condemned for our meddling the foreign policy debate that has existed for the past 45 years must be changed from a discussion of whom we should support the arab countries or israel argentina or britain greece or turkey north or south vietnam to a debate about interventionism or armed neutrality it is interventionism inflation and trade wars that inevitably lead to economic isolationism and finally to war the pattern of the 1930s is a typical pattern of interventionism and trade wars leading to war a sound money free trade and keep your guns at home program can give us peace and prosperity the inflation that has permitted a massive international debt to accumulate is clearly intertwined with all the military activities of recent years martial law was declared in poland on the day many loans were due to be paid to the international bankers it appears that argentinas 34 billion debt to western

billions of dollars of shortterm deposits in new york banks could easily influence our policy in the mideast only through neutrality with strength can we hope once again to have a foreign policy of sense and direction but it is not the administration that is solely to blame the congress is equally culpable it is so easy for members of congress to be critical of what the president is doing in the mideast yet they themselves are as much to blame as he is why does congress now have a right to criticize the president for his daily decisions last year the congress encouraged the president to pursue a course he deemed necessary to stabilize the mideast by resolution the houseoverwhelmingly 391 to 1encouraged the president to pursue a comprehensive and coordinated policy in lebanon including the development of an effective ceasefire resolution of the issue of syrian missiles and promotion of the independence sovereignty unity and territorial integrity of lebanon although the resolution does not have the force of law it imples that congress endorses virtually whatever action the president deems necessary and encourages further involvement in the mideast although it is clear the president has acted in accordance with the congressional intent the bigger question remains are the congress and the president acting in accordance with the intent of the american people i am convinced the american people no longer endorse foreign adventurism and believe that our best interests are secured by a policy of armed neutrality this was the policy of our government from its founding until 1917 it is only in the 20th century that interventionism has been accepted as a foreign policy with the obvious consequences of unprecedented world wars and the loss of enormous numbers of american lives on foreign soil our experiment with foreign policy interventionism has failed just as our experience with domestic economic interventionism has failed let us learn from that experience and reinstitute the policies of free trade neutrality and a strong defense that took this country from an under developed agrarian economy to the worlds major economic force only such

and its consequent price are unaffected by huge government borrowing demands i find this impossible to believe rather it seems to me the prospects of everincreasing federal credit demands competing with consumer and business borrowing forces up interest rates and keeps them high in the absence of some signal to the markets and the people of our country that the pressure will be reduced i see this package as that signalthat congress has the courage to follow its own budget resolution and to take actions that will help reduce the deficit bring down interest rates and put unemployed americans back on the job the president has correctly described the package as mainly tax enforcement and reform of some of the excessesthe ornaments hung on the christmas treeof last years tax reduction legislation but just as correctlylet us not kid ourselvesthere is 98 3 billion of new revenue this bill raises clearly the people are the ones who will pay it but if fairness and equity are a part of our considerationand god help us when they cease to bethen this package commends itself yes it will require some sacrifice especially by higher income taxpayers and corporations but all segments of american society must participateequitably and fairlyif we are to succeed in turning the corner on our economys problems no one expects americans to want or like tax increases the only surprise in todays harris survey is that onethird of the people favored this measure but there are times when courage and commitment are needed in the congress the courage to recognize what must be done and to do it thats what the american people are looking for now the economic crisis is largely one of spirit the signal must be sent last year we began a program to reverse the stagnation to rebuild our economic base and to rekindle the competitive spirit in america we have accomplished much the rate of increase in federal spending has been curbed taxes have been reduced substantially and indexed for the future and excessive federal regulation has been cut back inflations back has largely been broken interest rates have been reduced by onethird and the supply of money and credit have been stabilized but because economic growth rates have not responded quickly to our policiesones which i strongly believe are correctwe face an exhorbitant federal deficit which as i have said holds interest rates captive further control on the rate of increase in future federal spending is also necessary to secure the 284 billion in additional spending cuts specified in the budget resolution the administration needed to promise some readjustmentparticularly of business deductionson the revenue side if we fail now to carry out the revenue portion of the budget resolution what expectation can there be that the spending portion will be carried out without further spending cuts the third year of the kemproth tax reduction program will soon be under siege and the prospect of preserving it in the face of even higher deficits conjectural at best my economic instincts frankly find me most comfortable with those opposed to this legislation but we are not engaged in an exercise in economic theory we are no longer the minority we must govern to do so effectively and preserve the principles and the program we have fought so hard for passage of the conference report is in my judgment

attention on a problem in the proper financing of the district of columbia retirement funds i am opposed to his amendment on this bill for several reasons first the amendment is contrary to the very nature of the federal payment there has never before been an earmarking of the federal payment in the authorization process rather the level recommended is the result of a consideration of the net impact of the federal government on the local community after taking into account all of the various positive and negative factors in our one major concession to true homerule the federal payment is granted with no strings attached when special needs have been identified such as reimbursement for water and sewer use by the federal government or the federal contribution to these same retirement funds specific payments have been authorized in addition to the regular federal payment to change that procedure as this amendment would not only ignores the practice of the past 9 years it rejects the basic principle of homerule and undermines the basis of the federal payment second the gentleman is certainly aware that there is major legislation dealing with the retirement systems of the district of columbia public law 96122 this legislation outlines exnctly how the local and federal contribution to the retirement funds is determined if there is a shortcoming in the manner in which the local contribution is handled it would seem to me much more appropriate to amend public law 96122 than the bill currently under consideration in addition the district of columbia retirement board htus had under consideration a series of amendments which i trust will come before the congress next year if not sooner i would be happy to join the gentleman from virginia in requesting the chairman of the district of columbia committee to hold hearings on this matter to consider any and all changes needed in the operation of the district of columbia retirement funds next i would remind the gentleman of my earlier statements concerning the work of our colleagues on the appropriations committee we have relied on that committee to pass final judgment on the appropriate level for the federal payment at times that committee has found it necessary to force the city to take certain actions by earmarking the federal payment this occurred once when the city indicated that it did not intend to make required payments to the federal bureau of prisons and st elizabeths hospital also that committee has many times found it necessary to severely restrict the use of funds whether from local sources or federal sources most recently in action on the fiscal year 1982 supplemental the city was strongly reminded that the 10 million budgeted for elimination of a portion of the accumulated deficit was to be used for that purpose only not as a cushion against local revenue shortfalls so i would say to the gentleman that if earmarking of funds is deemed to be necessary in order to insure the city lives up to its commitment with regard to retirement funds it should be considered in the appropriation act not in this authorization bill finally i would remind all of my colleagues that just last year we passed a bill eliminating the technical impediments to the issuance of bonds by the district of columbia public law 97105 one provision of this act requires the mayor to use the federal payment to pay bondholders in the unlikely event that no other resources are available for that purpose if we now decide to get into the practice of earmarking the federal payment whenever a problem arises a cloud of uncertainty will be hanging over any bonds offered by the city for all of these reasons i submit that the proposed amendment while trying to contribute to the financial soundness of the city will instead do great harm to the overall financial health of the city as i said i am very sympathetic to the concerns of the gentleman from virginia i can certainly understand that any collapse of the pension program would have a severe effect on the constituents of his district but i would have to suggest to the house that in seeking a remedy he is taking exactly the wrong tack first off we set a historical precedenta dangerous precedent if we try to direct or allocate the federal payment there has never been an earmarking of the federal payment in the history of the u s congress in an authorization bill it has always been left up to the appropriations committee to appropriate a justified federal payment and in fact if this amendment were to pass there is nothing that says the appropriations committee has to put that line item in the district of columbia budget in fact they could simply leave that line item blank and it would therefore not be funded the gentleman from virginia has suggested to us that in fact the chairman of the appropriations committee would say that he will not legislate on appropriations bills that is perfectly true but a line item change or an earmarking of funds in the budget of the district of columbia by the appropriations committee is not legislating many times the appropriations committee has thrown in x number of dollars for this and taken x number of dollars away from something else all they simply have to do is to put in a budget line item that says 14 3 million 12 9 million 13 6 million perhaps by the time they get to the appropriations committee somebody will know what the figure is the real problem here i suggest to the gentleman from virginiaand i spoke to the chairman about itis the fact that we have public law 96122 which is not good legislation we knew when we passed that legislation that we were passing one of the most complicated types of legislation that can possibly be writtenpension legislation they have lawyers that make 500 000 a year in new york city just to try and write the actuarial tables and figure out the logistics outforward movements in the pension process it obviously has got to be brought back in front of the authorizing committee and changed that is the second place where what the gentleman wants to do should be donein the rewrite the amending the review of public law 96122 i would also suggest to the gentleman that saying that the district of columbia government has not complied with the law is inaccurate incorrect and wrong they have complied exactly with the letter of the lawexactly what is the problem public law 96122 is flawed and if it is brought before the committee which the chairman assured me he would do i would move to insist that the district of columbia pl y the unfunded liability on a yearly basis rather than having the pension board go into their trust fund and take it out that is the real problem the gentleman and i and i think the chairman are very disturbed by the fact that they are dipping into the fund and that we feel it is absolutely necessary to fund this through local revenues but let me tell the gentleman the unfunded pension liabilities of the city of washington were founded by the congress built by the congress made by the congress and on this very floor in 1938 i believe it was one of our astute former colleaguesprobably now long gone from the scenestood up on the floor of the house and amended all our funding from the pension program of the district of columbia he said the tax revenues of the city will take care of it and that money was thrown into the general fund of the united states of america and the funding for all of our pension programs disappeared i would hope some of the members would have their staffs or the congressional research service find that debate or i will send them that debate so that is what we are talking about we are talking about a bill that does not operate quite properly we are talking about a bill that is obeyed by the district of columbia we are talking about a bill that has a problem that would not be taken care of by the gentlemans amendment until fiscal year 1983 we are talking about a problem that should be taken care of either in a reauthorization and amending of the bill and most definitively soon or in the appropriation process where the line item is put in for the payment of the figure"], [0.513785719871521, 0.513785719871521, 0, "contributions at full committee each offered amendments in an effort to bring h r 5320 closer to positions that republicans have supported historically in employment and training programs and i want to acknowledge the contribution of our late colleague john ashbrook who as the ranking republican on the committee played a key role in making this a bipartisan bill he joined with chairman perkins and mr goodling the ranking republican on the subcommittee on elementary secondary and vocational education in putting together a major amendment which for the first time insures that our education system will have a major role in the delivery of job training services even though john was running at full tilt for the unitedstates senate in ohio while carrying the burden of being the ranking republican on our committee and doing his usual superb job on the house floor he took the time to leave a major imprint on this legislation which he supported we had actually postponed the full committee markup of this bill for a week so that he could be present when his tragic and untimely death intervened his part of this bill which chairman perkins and mr goodling carried through in full committee markup was his final contribution in an outstanding and successful career as a legislator i would not want this occasion to pass without that fact being a part of the history of this legislation h r 5320 represents a genuine effort to build a training system that does not perpetuate the mistakes of the past this bill incorporates many of the elements integral to the success of job training policy that were missing in ceta i would like to describe in detail some of the ways in which this bill is a major departure from the current employment and training legislation there are no public service employment or job creation provisions in h r 5320 republicans were successful in working with the majority to remove the language in the original bill that allowed such activity i must note that this was a very difficult concession for our colleague mr hawkins to make he did so in the interest of obtaining a job training bill which could be enacted he agreed to attempt the very difficult task of moving a public service employment bill as separate legislation which demonstrates what all of us who have been privileged to work with him over the years know very well that he is one of the best and most public spirited members of this house the intent of this bill is job training much of what has plagued ceta and created the most criticism of previous employment and training programs has been the public service employment programs they are not authorized in this bill under h r 5320 the private sector through its role on the private industry council pic becomes a partner with local elected officials in the development of community job training plans previously the function of the pic was to serve in an advisory capacity over a small portion of the program run by the prime sponsor in h r 5320 the private industry council a majority of which is composed of members of business and industry participates in the planning for the use of funds determines the administrative entity and approves the use of funds the private industry council is established as an independent body not subject to dissolution by the prime sponsor except for cause and may hire staff from available funds business members in the pic must be chosen from nominations by general purpose business organizations a meaningful private sector role is integral to the success of job training presently local governments are eligible for designation as prime sponsors solely on the basis of population if this basis for designation as a service delivery area remains the labor market factors of an area can be ig nored h r 5320 requires the consideration of population and labor market factors in deciding prime sponsor eligibility this bill must be viewed as part of our economic policy the local base of support for these programs must be coalesced rather than divided allowances and stipends are not provided to all participants at the minimum wage level rather a needsbased allowance system was developed to assure that eligible individuals would not be precluded from participation in training programs because of an inability to pay for the costs of participation under the previous program employment and training policy was administered directly from the federal government to local prime sponsors the state had no coordinating function h r 5320 provides for statewide coordination of employment and training programs the governor is authorized to develop a coordination and special services plan plans for employment and training programs conducted under this act and plans for employment service programs must fit into this overall plan in order to receive certification additionally employment service plans must be developed jointly with the prime sponsor other factors that separate this bill from those of the past include a displaced worker training program funds provided to prime sponsors as single grants a single eligibility criteria for participants and the requirement of local matching funds for some por tions of the program these are only a few key differences between ceta and h r 5320 but they are critical in spite of the many important and meaningful changes that have been incorporated into h r 5320 there are several aspects of the bill that warrant attention and refinement the amendments which mr jeffonds and i will offer address the concerns of the republicans in the education and labor committee and will bring the bill closer to a workable compromise with the other body they will also help insure presidential approval of the final product of that conference their purpose is to strengthen further the provisions in this bill which correct the weaknesses of previous employment and training programs as a balance between the permissive allowance provisions contained in current employment and training programs and the strict prohibition against allowances in the senate bill the house bill contains a needsbased systema provision suggested initially by the ranking republican member of the employment opportunities subcommittee this system restricts allowance payments so that only those most in need receive funds of particular concern for example are the eligible participants who would not have access to training because they do not have the necessary funds to pay for transportation to the training or worksite we do not want to deny training to individuals who are motivated to re ceive it because they cannot afford the costs of participation on the other hand we do not want to provide incentive for participants to remain in the program for as long as possible because allowance payments are greater than entry level job wages we cannot afford to divert scarce resources from the direct training services to allowance payments the needsbased allowance system is a remedy for this concern in keeping with this premise an amendment will be offered to satisfy the republican concern that maximum funds under this program are devoted to the direct provision of training the amendment states that not less than 70 percent of the funds received by a prime sponsor shall be used to provide direct training services to participants this amendment allows up to 30 percent to be used for administrative costs supportive services and wages allowances and stipends we must insure that a greater share of the funds is directed toward training not income maintenance i believe that this amendment accomplishes that goal further it has long been true that republicans desire to involve the private sector more in the total fabric of publicly funded employment and training programs eighty percent of all jobs are in the private sector it is imperative to have the insight and participation of the private sector in the determination of the types of jobs for which to train participants the necessary skills that are required for the jobs available in the area and the areas of potential job growth if a true partnership of local governments can be developed with the private sector an acceptance and support of public job training programs can be fostered among the private sector without a commitment to job training programs by the private sector an unnecessary barrier to placement of participants in unsubsidized jobs is created i intend to offer an amendment that will clarify the initial planning authority of the private industry council this amendment does not change the requirement in the bill that both the prime sponsor and the pic must agree to the plan before it is transmitted for approval the balance between the pic and the prime sponsor is retained if the business community perceives that its role is only to approve a plan after it has been developed by the prime sponsor it is likely to take its role seriously because this program will be judged by the successful job placement of participants an active role for the private sector is critical a major weakness in previous employment and training programs was the lack of clarity among the roles of the federal state and local governments under these programs the federal government held the responsibility for designating monitoring and auditing over 450 prime sponsors this administrative structure was at best unmanageable the coordinating role given the state under this bill is a step in the right direction it will help to reduce overlap and duplication of services with scarce resources this reduction is essential this improvement is not enough an amendment i will be offering balances the role of the state with that of the federal government federal oversight is retained and overall performance criteria are established at the federal level the states are given the authority to designate prime sponsors and to approve community job training plans pics and prime sponsors still retain their right toappeal these decisions to the secretary the states will be the direct recipient of federal funds with a prescribed passthrough of funds to the prime sponsors this reduces the federal oversight function to the 50 direct recipients of funds and transfers several of the functions previously held by the federal government to the state governments while retaining the local role of plan development and program implementation republicans support a federal policy for employment and training as embodied in h r 5320 the amendments i have already described are designed to strengthen even further the elements of the bill that are integral to the success of job training programs of a different nature are two othdr amendments that will be offered to the labor standards section they clarify reduce and eliminate redundant and unnecessary federal labor standards that have been inappropriately inserted in the bill the amendments assure that federal osha applies where applicable and where not applicable the secretary shall apply appropriate standards with regard to participants similarly state workers compensation laws shall apply to participants but they shall august 4 1989 be given to participants but where they are not applicable the secretary may assure that insurance coverage for injuries suffered by participants is secured it is my desire to see that all participants are treated the same as similarly situated persons not treated differently or given special benefits because of participation in the programs established by the act it is clear that such participants could not benefit from funds contributed for their retirement rather than divert these funds from training an amendment will be offered to prohibit contributions to retirement systems or plans since public service employment is no longer a concept contained within this bill contributions to retirement systems or plans are not appropriate other amendments address issues where the bill as presently written may conflict with areas under the national labor relations acts jurisdiction my amendments will allow the nlra to govern where it is presently applicable but still addresses the concerns of proponents of the bill so that funds cannot be improperly used and collective bargaining contracts cannot be impaired without concurrence of the parties to those contracts the final amendment distinguishes between the roles of the authorizing and appropriating committees h r 5320 contains an authorization level of 5 4 billion for fiscal year 1983 the amendment that will be offered changes this figure to such sums as may be necessary the republicans on the education and labor committee believe it is their responsibility to establish the framework for a federal job training program this framework must be defensible and must meet the needs of the eligible participants however the responsibility for establishing the allocations for this program within the context of the economy and the need for a responsible federal budget lies with the appropriations committee republicans attempted to change the authorization level in committee but were unsuccessful due in part to the lack of a first budget resolution at time the bill was considered now that the budget resolution has been adopted a specific authorization provision is misleading it creates the false expectation that the total amount will be appropriated an action that is highly unlikely the appropriations must be made with consideration for the needs of other programs and for basic economic and budgetary constraints h r 5320 is the result of a long process of compromise and negotiation since the first hearing was held in november of last year the members of the employment opportunities subcommittee have considered a wealth of information regarding employment and training programs the efforts of mr hawkins and mr jeffords in this process must again be noted without their knowledge leadership and willingness to compromise we would not be where we are today the end result of this process is a proposal for federal involvement in job training policy that does not perpetuate the errors of the past but instead incorporates improvements that have been determined to be essential to the success of job training programs although i support the improvements that have been incorporated into h r 5320 i believe there are a few areas where refinement is necessary the republican amendments to this bill will insure that h r 5320 does not fall victim to the errors of the past and will conform the bill to present budgetary realities adoption of these amendments will provide the house with a sound and realistic proposal with which to go to conference with the other body i am confident that the house will realize the value of these amendments and will recognize that h r 5320 is a significant piece of legislation one that is an integral part of an economic recovery

with remembrances of f d r it is best to recall what president roosevelt did in the field of monetary policy for our inflation unemployment and related problems are a continual reminder of his monetary policy inaugurated on march 4 1933 president roosevelt did not waste any time on march 6 he issued a proclamation declaring a bank holiday and a national emergency this proclamation also prohibited the banks from paying out gold or dealing in foreign exchange this was the first major interference with the gold standard since world war i eventually it resulted in the ultimate abandonment of the gold standard entirely president roosevelt summoned congress to an extraordinary session on march 9 in order to le gitimize his declaration of march 6 the bill to legitimize his actions however was not ready on march 9 and the administration could not wait for a bill to be prepaled a folded newspaper was tossed into the hopper of the house of representatives to serve as a bill until the bill could be written the bill was then sent to the congress by the president congress passed it inii1295 stantly and gave the president full powers over foreign exchange and extraordinary powers over the banking system but the bank holiday was but the beginning of a list of monetary achievements of the roosevelt administration which included first repudiation of the unitedstates treasury promises to pay gold second seizure of the gold owned by the american people third debasement of the currency fourth deliberate inflation fifth deficit spending sixth monetization of government debt and seventh confiscation of privately owned gold previously seized by the government this was achieved despite the fact that the first three planks of the democratic party platform of 1932 read as follows we advocate 1 an immediate and drastic reduction of government expenditures by abolishing useless commissions and offices consolidating departments and bureaus and eliminating extravagance to accomplish a saving of not less than 25 percent of the cost of federal government 2 maintenance of the national credit by a federal budget annually balanced 3 a sound currency to be maintained at all hazards one day after the passage of the emergency banking act on march 10 1933 president roosevelt issued executive order no 6073 permitting the secretary of the treasury to issue regulations or licenses with respect to gold exports on march 13 1933 the secretary of the treasury by regulalion authorized the federal reserve banks temporarily to deliver gold in amounts deemed by such banks to be reasonably required for legitimate and customary uses in trade profession or art a month later on april 19 1933 the secretary of the treasury announced that no further licenses to export gold for foreign account would be granted until further notice the same action was taken with respect to gold already earmarked for foreign account the effect of this action was for the first time to withdraw the support of gold shipments from the foreign exchange value of the dollar with the result that thereafter the progressive decline of the dollar in terms of foreign currency took place on april 5 a month after he had issued the decree closing the banks president roosevelt issued a decree seizing the gold owned by the american people executive order no 6102 declared that all persons are hereby required to deliver on or before may 1 1933 to a federal reserve bank or a branch or agency thereof or to any member bank of the federal reserve system all gold coin gold bullion and gold certificates now owned by them or coming into their ownership on or before april 28 president roosevelt cited an emergency world war i measure the trading with the enemy act as authority for his executive order seizing all privately owned gold executive order no 6102 further provided that whoever willfully violates any provision of this executive order or of these regulatlions or of any rule regulation or license issued thereunder may be fined not more than 10 000 or if a natural person may be imprisoned for not more than 10 years or both on april 20 1933 another executive order was issued which redefined the export and license privilege on may 12 1933 the emergency farm mortgage act was signed into law by president roosevelt the act permitted the issuing of 3 billion worth of greenbacks in order to pay off the national debt and authorized the president tofix the weight of the gold dollar in grains 0 9 fino and also to fix the weight of the silver dollar in grains 0 9 fine at a definite fixed ratio in relation to the gold dollar at such amounts as he finds necessary from his investigation to stabilize domestic prices or in accordance with any international agreement arrived at by the president the only limit imposed on this debasement of the dollar was that its weight could not be reduced by more than 50 percent on june 5 1933 house joint resolution 192 was enacted by the congress and signed by the president this joint resolution declared that any fiat currency issued by the government would be legal tender for all debts public and private public charges taxes duties and dues the joint resolution also abrogated all public and private obligations in which payment was to be made in gold the resolution provided thatevery provision contained in or made with respect to any obligation which purports to give the obligee a right to require payment in gold or a particular kind of coin or currency or in an amount in money of the united states measured thereby is declared to be against public policy and no such provision shall be contained in or made with respect to any obligation hereafter incurred every obligation heretofore or hereafter incurred whether or not any such provision is contained therein or made with respect thereto shall be discharged upop payment dollar for dollar in any coin or currency which at the time of payment is legal tender for public and private debts on august 28 1933 president franklin roosevelt issued yet another executive orderno 6260in which he prescribed regulations concerning the export and earmarking of gold coin bullion andcurrency and transactions in foreign exchange again he used a world war i measure as justification for his declaration the following january january 15 1934 president roosevelt addressed congress and asked that congress enact a law placing all right and title to gold held by the federal reserve banks in the government having seized privately owned gold the previous year now the government was to assume title of it in a massive confiscation of private property congress responded 15 days later by enacting the gold reserve act of 1934 the act provided that the government assumed all title to gold coin and bullion in the united states that no gold coins were to be issued and that no currency of the united states could be redeemed in gold dollars the act provided thatno gold shall hereafter be coined and no gold coins shall hereafter be paid out or delivered by the united states all gold coin in the united states shall be withdrawn from circulation and together with all other gold owned by the united states shall be formed into bars of such weights and degrees of fineness as the secretary of the treasury shall direct further the act provided thatno currency of the united states shall be redeemed in gold the following day january 31 1934 president roosevelt issued still another proclamation changing the gold content of the dollar which was no longer circulating from 25 8 grains to 15 521 grains a devaluation of 41 percent in his speech of january 15 1934 president roosevelt stated thatfree circulation of gold coins is unnecessary leads to hoarding and tends to a possi ble weakening of national financial structures in times of emergency the practice of transferring gold from one individual to another or from the government to an individual within a nation is not only unnecessary but is in every way undesirable the transfer of gold and bullion is essential only for the payment of international trade balances therefore it is a prudent step to vest in the government of a nation the title to and possession of all monetary gold within its boundaries and to keep that gold in the form of bullion rather than coin amazingly the two principles upon which president roosevelt based these actions were 1 our national currency must be maintained as a sound currency which insofar as possible will have a fairly constant standard of purchasing power and 2 the inherent right of government to issue currency and to be the sole custodian and owner of the base or reserve of precious metals underlying that currency since president roosevelt took this step to maintain a sound currency the dollar has depreciated to a minor fraction of what it was worth in 1933 so much for his first principle as for his second principle concerning theinherent right of government to issue currency and to be sole custodian and owner of the base or reserve of precious metals tinderlying that currency there is no basis either in fact or law for that principle it seems to have sprung full grown only from his own imagination senator carter glass a democrat and former secretary of the treasury under woodrow wilson appeared in the senate in april 1933 although he had been ill in bed to speak about the administrations money policy he said i wrote with my own hand that provision of the national democratic platform which declared for a sound currency to be maintained at all hazards with nearly 40 percent of the entire gold supply of the world why are we going off the gold standard with all the earmarked gold with all the securities of ours they hold foreign governments could withdraw in total less than 700 million of our gold which would leave us an ample fund of gold in the extreme case to maintain gold payments both at home and abroad to me the suggestion that we may devalue the gold dollar 59 per cent means national repudiation to me it means dishonor in my conception of it it is immoral there never was any necessity for a gold embargo theres no necessity for making statutory criminals of citizens of the united states who may please to take their property in the shape of gold or currency out of the banks and use it for their own purposes as they may please we have gone beyond the cruel extremities of the french and they made it a capital crime punishable at the guillotine for any trademan or individual citizen of the realm to discriminate in favor of gold and against their printing press currency we have gone beyond that we have said that no man may have his town gold and the penalty is 10 years in the penitentiary or 10 000 fine within the space of a few months franklin roosevelt wrecked a monetary system that had protected the american people for over a century it is ironic that many succeeding members of his own party have decried the imperial presidency nothing could have been more imperial than the presidency of franklin roosevelt particularly with regard to the gold standard there was no need to leave the gold standard in 1933 the suspension of gold payments was presumably regarded as part of the banking emergency and hence expected to be temporary the gold position of the government in march 1933 was sufficiently strong so that there was little doubt the preceding gold parity could have been maintained if desired just as senator glass argued in april the ratio of the governments gold stock to the total stock of money was higher than at any time since 1914 there was in short no reason to confiscate privately owned gold or to leave the domestic gold standard but the gold standard was regarded by president roosevelt and his advisers as an obstacle to his plans to remake the american economy its removal was designed to put the american people into a monetary straitjacket and to allow the government to embark upon a 13year binge of deficits and inflation the president thought that raising the price of gold would increase the price of all commodities and it was price increases that he so avidly sought now 50 years later we are suffering from the price increases franklin roosevelt desired while there was no reason fo leave the gold standard in 1933except of course to loosen the chains placed upon the government by the constitutionthe government immediately received a windfall for dolig so de basing the dollar by 41 percent meant that the government now had about 3 billion more to spend most of this money was put into a stabilizatioi fund that was establisbed to mitigate the damage roosevelts prohibition of gold exports had caused and the remainder was spent on interventionist programs in the domestic economy in his diary henry morgenthau gives us a glimpse of the president gradually debasing the dollar by choosifig lucky numbers as the new gold price however lucky this monetary policy was for president rooseveltafter all he was president for lifeit was singularly unfortunate for the american people the initial robbery of the gold seizurewhich senator glass rightly called immoralhas now been compounded many times by the cbntinual issuing of fiat paper currency infla tion is theft and inflation has been the deliberate policy of the government since 1933 last summer this house appropriated 30 000 more to a commission that has been trying for 25 years to find a suitable monument for franklin roosevelt that monument already surrounds us inflation unemployment bankruptcies and increasingly worthless paper bills in everyones pockets franklin delano roosevelt ushered in the age of keynesian economics and put into practice the erroneous ideas of economic interventionism along with this we have suffered the ill effects of international intervention and government abuse of our personal liberties the

the numerous organizations which have been involved in the drafting or have been asked to review this important bill the national oil jobbers council the national association of homebuilders the environmental policy center the northeast coalition for energy equity the national association of realtors the national consumer law center and the national council of state housing agencies among others the energy equity act is a break from the past i might remind my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who are bornagain budget balancersit was president carter in 1979 who first told the american people the windfall profits tax revenues would not go to help the poor pay fuel bills but would instead go to pay for the 88 billion synthetic fuels corporation i remind my colleagues it was the democratic leadership of this housein particular my friend and distinguished colleague the majority leader from texaswho in 1980 asked us to agree with the carter administrations request and increase federal synfuels subsidies from a 3 billion demonstration program to a massive 88 billion government corporation under pressure from president carter and the majority leader the house passed the energy security act in june 1980 i remind my colleagues that it was the democratic leadership again which in early 1981 when the reagan administration was considering abolishing the synthetic fuels corporation wrote the presidces and asked him to spare synfuels from the slash of omb as our former colleague bob eckhardt wrote at the time if the house democrats do not wish merely to win a few battles and badly lose the war which is now being waged against the door they had better choose their priormarch 29 1 982 itles more carefully it will be hard enough to save programs essential to a humane and developing society without taking on the burden of defending programs which guarantee profitable sale of even unprofitably produced synthetic fuel in 1980 the synfuels bulls were on stampede but today it appears the synfuels corporation has been put out to pasture as a sacred cow the energy equity act will not let that happen the energy equity act will not let synfuels developers get high on the hog at the public trough while congress continues to cut social programs the energy equity act will not let the synfuels corporation subsidize multinational companies and the governments of kuwait and japan while our nations homebuilders and realtors facecatastrophe and the needy get no help with their fuel bills the time has come to abolish the synthetic fuels corporation and allocate our whole resources to the critical problems at hand for this reason we have written the house leadership asking that the energy equity act be given the same accelerated consideration that congress gave the synthetic fuels corporation legislation in 1979 the emergencies we face in 1982 in social programs and in the housing industry are every bit as critical as the gaslines in 1979especially since gaslines were caused by government regulation in the first place not lack of synfuels the purpose of the energy equity act is simple it will do three things no 1 the energy equity act will once and for all restore the promise and repair the breach of faith between congress and the american people which occurred in 1980 when president carter and the democratic congressincluding the democratic leadership of this housecreated an 88 billion synfuels boondoggle and then took the money to fund it from the windfall profits tax revenues which they had promised to the poor our bill will impose an energy equity fee on all sponsors of synfuels projects who receive federal subsidies from the unitedstates synthetic fuels corporation prior to september 30 1982 the energy equity fee will be 20 percent of the amount of federal financial assistance awarded each project the proceeds will be deposited in an energy equity account in the treasury and made available only for lowincome home energy assistance weatherization assistance and an emergency program of aid to our nations housing industry in other words we are saying the federal trough is off limits to the energy greedy unless they aid the energy needy we estimate if 5 billion in synfuels subsidies are awarded before september 30 1982 our energy equity fee will raise 1 billion in extra funds to help the needy pay fuel bills next winter and help pull our nations housing industry out of its catastrophic slump by the end of the year no 2 the energy equity act will reduce the federal budget deficit by reducing federal subsidies to big corporations to build uneconomic synthetic fuels plants our bill will immediately repeal 68 billion in funding authorized for the unitedstates synthetic fuels corporation in the energy security act and terminate all other funding authority for federal synfuels subsidies by september 30 1982 this will reduce the immense intrusion of the corporation into credit markets and thus will assure that more private capital is made available this year for currently economic and energyefficient activities rather than for uneconomic synfuels projects we estimate abolishing federal credit assistance to synfuels boondoggles will this year alone free millions of dollars into the economy which otherwise would be tied up in the lines of credit set aside for these huge projects synfuels were a piginapoke in 1980 and they are a pig in the taxpayers pockets now when interest rates are high and we are trying to control federal spending it is absolutely outrageous preposterous and idiotic that the federal government is making 15 billion available to subsidize synfuels follies no 3 the energy equity act will automatically transfer to the energy equity account 50 percent of synfuelsv funds uncommitted to synfuels projects by september 30 1982 these uncommitted fundswhich could total as much as 5 billion by september 30 1982would then be available for loans and loan guarantees to states and local governments for fuel assistance lowincome weatherization and even an emergency program of mortgage interest subsidies to help american home buyers the other 50 percent of uncommitted funds would be returned to the treasury as miscellaneous receipts and thus help reduce federal borrowing i am pleased that mr evans of the banking committee has joined with me on the energy equity act and it was with his sound advice that we included this setaside of federal credit for housing assistance as an integral element of the legislation i would like to remind my colleagues that by itself abolishing the synthetic fuels corporation will have a positive effect on the economy on jobs creation and on the federal budget deficit the big companies which have applied for federal synfuels subsidies are right this minute asking the unitedstates treasury to guarantee that up to 15 billion in commercial credit will be set aside for uneconomic synfuels projectswhen that 15 billion would otherwise be available for home mortgages credit to home heating customers new businesses car loans plant modernization or to finance the federal budget deficit without crowding out private borrowing for this reason i have cosponsored h r 5404 introduced by mr brown of colorado 2 months ago to aboliflh the synthetic fuels corporation the energy equity act recognizes that abolishing the corporation is the ultimate goal by including a section stating that the energy equity act will not be effective if the corporation is repealed by prior enactment i commend my colleague mr brown for his leadership on this issue the energy equity act however is designed to immediately address the shortterm mischief the synthetic fuels corporation is causing in the credit markets if this congress does not enact the energy equity act in the next few months we will witness nearly 5 billion in synfuels subsidies awarded to turkey projects at the same time this congress is struggling to reduce the budget deficit and maintain critical social programs and if we in congress sit still for this outrageous boondoggle 1 minute i would say we should get what we deserve a posse of 200 million strong to descend on capitol hill to throw the rascals out i commend the energy equity act to my colleagues as a start toward fiscal integrity i include herewith a copy of the energy equity act and a sectionbysection analysis as follows ii r 5977 a bill to amend the energy security act to finance lowincome home energy assistance and weatherization through an additional fee on awards of financial assistance provided by the synthetic fuels corporation to terminate activities of the corporation by september 30 1984 and for other purposes be it enacted by the senate and house of

responsible statement on this matter i spent 20 years with the federal bureau of investigation as a special agent in different capacities supervisory and otherwise most of it abroad but i have to tell you that i at no time had anything less than the highest respect for mr hoover i had to deal with him personally from time to time frequently as a matter of fact on may return from abroad for special assignments and for conferences but let me just say that mr hoover was the boss and there is no way in the world that any organization any law enforcement organization or any other organization can have more than one boss the buck stopped with him but in referring to what happened on june 3 2 weeks ago the american broadcasting co treated its viewers to a documentary on the life and times of the late director of the federal bureau of investigation john edgar hoover as is typical in the current fashion of television broadcasting this supposedly unbiased view of the career of director hoover which spanned over five decades was a collection of halftruths and oftrepeated criticisms which have been standard fare for those opposed to him and the bureau this documentary represents what is becoming the genre of broadcast investigative journalism the courtroom technique if you will of interrorgating one witness then editing his or her comments and sandwiching them between other hostile comments out of context the viewers are never treated to the full facts nor are they given the full answer it is in fact the camera or the editor acting as the prosecutor and the judge the jury we the viewers are not given the chance to see all evidence we only see what the interviewer wishes us to see that style is fine for feature length movies or a cartoon but not for a documentary about our federal law enforcement agency and its late director the public deserves better the charges against mr hoover as leveled by the american broadcasting co have been heard over and over again and have been leveled by critics of the federal bureau of investigation and mr hoover in other forums previous to that thursday evening these accusations typically range from bureau ineffectiveness the late director being a jespotic tyrant to charges of civil rights violations and political blackmail i think that it is important not only for the sake of the late director but for the outstanding service that the federal bureau of investigation has given this country to set the record straight the federal bureau of investigation was established in 1908 as the investigative arm of the unitedstates department of justice it was called then simply the bureau of investigation at the time it had the responsibility for investigating violation of certain federal laws j edgar hoover was made the assistant director of the bureau of investigation in 1921 at that time the bureau had the reputation of a place of corruption and political intrigue in one of his first directions as assistant director mr hoover organized a handpicked team of trustworthy agents to investigate terrorism in the deep south which was being perpetrated by a renascent ku klux klan on the basis of the investigation of one particularly brutal murder the bureau was able to turn away many prominent supporters of the klan in addition on the basis of a continuing bureau investigation imperial kleagel edward y clarke was indicted on white slavery charges and pleaded guilty at the same time under hoovers orders th i bureau uncovered the practice of selilng black prisoners to local farmers a subseqtent conviction stopped that practice the scandals that rocked the harding administration fully revealed the problems within the bureau of investigation a new attorney general harlan fiske stone had the choice of reforming or dismantling the federal investigative unit judge stone as he later became justice of the supreme court realized the need to have an active and efficient investigative unit at the federal level and knew that its choice of leader was critical in order to rid the bureau of its poor reputation he chose john edgar hoover vho accepted only after he was assured that the bureau would be free from political pressure subject only to the attorney general and that hiring and personnel decisions would be made only on the basis of merit judge stone and loover were determined to create an inestigative bureau that would be the model of integrity and more importantly an efficient uncorruptible arm of justice and the justice department and director hoover achieved that end and it was his promise tc do just that before he would accept the responsibility of being director the bureau instituted the policy of hiring only on merit got rid of all of the political appointees and began the task of becoming the model federal investigative unit in the space of 5 years the bureau had gone from what one writer of the time called a national disgrace to in the words of justice stone a bureau that the government can now take pride in instead of feeling obliged to apologize for it as the nation entered the depression the rate of crime was reaching epidemic proportions during the prohibition era gangsterism flourished as a result of this 7 imate and cases such as the lindburgh kidnapping case the bureaus duties were expanded by such laws as the kidnapping and extortion statutes the federal bank robbery act the national stolen property act and the antiracketeering act and agent were given authority to carry firearms and make arrests which they had not previously had today that expansion has grown to the point that the bureau is esponsible for investigations dealing with violations of over 170 federal statutes including the civil rights act which were imposed by thi congress on the bureau it was during this period that the bureau became prominent and the appellation of gman became popular in the folklore of this period and previously many critics point to this as an example of the use of publicity for the bureau for results that did not warrant such publicity it is important to note that such an appellation and the fear aspect that is implicit in that nickname reflected the great strides that the bureau had made in evolving from a national disgrace to an investigative unit that was given more and more reponsibility as it proved itself the federal bureau of irvestigation succeeded in its war against gangsterism and managed to stop such notorious criminals as george machine gun kelly alvin karpis john dillinger and the barker gang when war broke out in europe and it was feared that it would spread to the united states the federal bureau of investigation assumed another role that of counterintelligence and intercepting potential saboteurs and espionage agents on december 7 when news of the bombing of pearl harbor reached the united states fbi agents were ready and within 24 hours over 1 700 aliens were in custody to the credit of the dedication and hard work of the bureau in cooperation with other intelligence networks not one single enemydirected act of sabotage was committed in the united states during world war ii after the war the bureau again hae its responsibility enlarged with the passage of the atomic energy act the bureau was given the responsibility of safeguarding the secrets of the united states through personnel security checks and surveillance of seditious organizations in the early sixties and as the civil rights movement gained ground the bureau was in the forefront again of investigation of violence related to that movement in the development of the bureau one of the most efficient and respected investigative units in the world mr hoover introduced several concepts unknown in law enforcement he established the identification division in 1924 providing a new concept in identification senator carl hayden of my own state of arizona was instrumental in this effort which entailed an indexed fingerprint chart to help trace criminals he established the fbi laboratory in 1932 to use the benefits of modem science to aid law enforcement in 1935 the fbi national academy was established and remains one of the finest law enforcement education institutions in the world its purpose to train worthy law enforcement officers in administration and police work as the bureau has grown as additional responsibilities were thrown at it it attracted criticisms when director hoover received assurance that the bureau would be free of political influence he kept it that way he opposed any concept of a national police organization as has been charged in the program during the long sessions of the investigation chaired by senator mccarthy it was director hoover that come out against open publication of fbi security files to protect the innocent from any whispering campaign during the early and middle sixties the bureau and the director were charged with racism i find it odd that the charge was leveled because it was the fbi alone that responded to the violence in the early sixties when local law enforcement agenices could not or in some case would not investigate the murders and beating that took place the documentary aired by abc on director hoover tries to smear the bureau and the director with implied charges of fascism blackmail and generally attempting to paint a hardworking dedicated agency as a closed tyrannical society bent on destroying the constitutional right it was charged with protecting in relating the bureaus involvement with dr martin luther king abc implies that the director out of some racist or puritanical hate for dr king put him under surveillance and tried to prevent him from leading the civil rights movement abc patently ignores the fact that u hile wiretaps were authorized on dr king they were authorized by attorney general robert kennedy because of dr kings association with known communists and the fear that the communists would use the civil rights movement to foment other than peaceful change in american society the telecast opens with the line that j edgar hoover imposed his personal vision on congress presidents and on millions of americans the implied notion is that mr hoover used the threat of supposedly existent files on anyone who would defy him if indeed mr hoover imposed this vision on anything it was on the bureau he took a discredited agency and developed it into the most effective and respected investigative body in the world the documentary tries to make a case from the success of the bureau in stopping sabotage in world war ii as more a public relations creation than a fact however it still remains a fact that not one single enemydirected act of sabotage took place in the united states during the war the telecast makes several accusations of the kind that are only fit for cheap irresponsible tabloids the entire last third of the show is dedicated to examples of bureau surveillance and the implication is left that they were done in the attempt to gain leverage in the political arena director hoover was careful since the beginning of his tenure to have a reputable agency that worked to get investigation accepted in court not thrown out it is ironic that the method he most despised innuendo implications are used against him after his death the exercise we saw on abc is how to kick a dead horse his was a vision of protection of the nation and law he loved he battled nazism communism and the ku klux klan with equal fervor he introduced comprehensive law enforcement training in america for the first time he raised the level of law enforcement from that of mere night watchman to a respected profession more importantly he taught us respect for the law the best way to sum up director hoover is found in the book authored by ralph de toledano john edgar hoover did not wear golden shoes he was sometimes wrong many times more right but he lkved america he believed in america and he fought for amerlea for most americans that was enough for those who knew him that was a begin ning jume 23 1982 i have a letter in my hands from our former colleague congressman sam devine who is now practicing law here which i would like to insert in the record at this point it is a letter directed to mr leonard goldson chairman of the american broadcasting co in new york and takes on the charge with regard to a point made in the abc network program indicating that mr hoover had been accused of homosexuality it was never proved and it was reported that he was not but why mention it in the first place congressman devine addresses that point the letter follows"], [0.5134698152542114, 0.5134698152542114, 0, "i appreciate what the gentleman is saying and to that i can only respond that sofietimes you cannot pick and choose exactly where you have to fight if we have the opportunity here to have brought before us the question of how we reorganize this house i think maybe all of us from what i have been hearing from many of the chairmen of the committees would join to try to reorganize this place if that is going to be a combined resolution of the chairmen on the majority side let us kn3w about it because we would certainly like to assist you in that but i must confess i cannot hold my breath to wait for that because i like to breathe once a year at least i think we would be in some difficulty waiting for this i think the fact that the hous6 administration committee has done what it had done with its own budget is proof that we have a symbol for the rest of us to follow we in the house ought to be a symbol for the executive branch we in the house ought to show them that we are willing to take the first step and have them follow us now the house administration committee has done that i am just very sorry that other committees have not followed that lead we would certainly appreciate it if we would be given the opportunity to assist the house administration committee in following through and making it not just a symbol but making it a reality i must tell you that 2 years makes a tremendous difference i recall being a freshman here and talking about the fact that the rules committee had asked for a 2 600percent increase because they found it necessary they have got two subcom mittees now that are fully staffed i understand and not one piece of legislation came forth from those subcommittees last year you wonder are we overstaffed in each committee i wish we could go committee by committee that is what we asked in the last goaround when we talked about the rule we were prevented from going committee by committee which i now hear many of the chairman getting up and saying would have been the fairest thing to do we did not set those rules those rules were imposed upon us as the previous speaker said we have got to deal with what we have and what we have now is an effort made a good faith effort by the chairman of the appropriate committee and the chairman of the subcommittee and by the majority leader to at least lead us somewhere we are going from nowhere to somewhere that is progress i suppose but it is like finding ourselves in a swamp with the wright amendment at least we are going to grasp that one tree limb so that we keep our heads above water well i commend us for doing that i commend the majority side for allowing us to do that but what we are now saying is that grasping that tree limb is not enough let us get on solid ground and get out of the swamp and give the american people some reason to believe that we are really going to make an effort here the frenzel recommittal will give us that opportunity it does not gut the house look at it there are several committees that have no cuts whatso ever there is agreement on both sides that those should not be cut but as to others we are making a good faith effort to try to show how we would have come to a resolution if we would have been given an opportunity to look at each committee the other thing that comes to mind is that each committee chairman comes down here and give us a 5minute explanation of his committee we need at least an hour to go over every committee but we are denied that opportunity by the rule so we are in the proverbial point of being between a rock and a hard place should we just cave in and say well since the rules are against us since the chairmen feel that they are imposed upon by the rules committee all we can do is give up and go home i do not think anyone would suggest that we do that we ought to follow the lead of mr frenze and vote for the recommittal now unfortunately i have heard some words here that i think are very disturbing some have suggested and there are rumors about that if we adopt the frenzel motion republicans are going to suffer we are going to take an equal or 50 percent share of the cut well really is that equity is that fairness let us go down the party ratios on the investigative staffs because some have talked about how fair it is the aging committee 73 percent of the staff is democratic agriculture 71 percent banking 77 percent district of columbia 83 percent education and labor where we heard there is equity has 91 people on the investigative staff 76 are on the democratic side 15 on the republican side you can go on with energy and commerce there are 135 members 120 of them happen to be given to the democratic side you can go on and on and on i know why we do that we all know why we do that i know that is why it puts a lot of pressure on members on our side of the aisle to dare go against what is happening but you know we ought not to play those kinds of games we ought to really decide here that there are cuts that have to be made and if they are made and maybe this is a voice in the wilderness they ought to be made on the same ratio that presently exists with those investigative staffs i mean how can we honestly go home to the people and say to them look we are trying to be fair some suggest we have 3 people on the republican side 47 people on the democratic side of the aisle so each side is going to lose 2 people now that is not reasonable but we know that perception is going on and we really should shy away from that really when you look at this weeks unitedstates news world report you see that they have a study on middle america those are the people in this country that are now making less in purchasing power than they did in 1970 accountants chemists engineering technicians classroom teachers typists bank tellers clerical workers retail sales persons printing and publishing workers tire manufacturing workers thisis middle america these are the ones we are supposed to be concerned about so while we have made sure that we have gone far above inflation in the people that we hire and the money that we pay our people back home suffer what kind of a signal is that to them it is not a very good signal at all and we ought to really try to build on the work the good work that has been done by this committee and the subcommittee and particularly the chairman i know it is going to be difficult if i could cite my colleagues to an article that appeared in time magazine in hugh sideys column he said this never has washington seen such an army march down its old avenues the soldiers clad in pinstripes and shod in guccis not in all unitedstates history have such unusual political alliances been formed as those now taking to the barricades against ronald reagans budget cuts we may not have been shod there in guccis but we certainly attire ourselves in pinstriped suits it is kind of interesting that when i hear people talking down there in the well you would think we were discussing food stamps you would think we were discussing taking food out of the mouths of babes we are not talking about that we are talking about getting our house in order i have heard the suggestion that it will be a terrible thing if some people lost their jobs is this nirvana i mean do you get a job here in the house and no matter who is elected and who is defeated you stay here we know that cannot take place we know that these people are good people we kbow that they are qualified people or they would not be here i for one believe and have more confidence in their ability to get a job in the private sector if they should leave us i do not think we should besmirch their reputations by suggesting that if we cut the staff here these people would be unable to function in the private market we know they probably would be able to do a very good job there and perhaps give people on the outside some notion of what we do here lastly i will just close with a quote that was found in hugh sideys column hetalks about a man named bob komer whom he describes as a former new frontiersman for john kennedy former great society warrier for lyndon johnson and former under secretary of defense for jimmy carter obviously this man is not to be confused with a neoconservative or conservative republican and he said this if we dont first take care of the economy and our national security there aint going to be school lunches for anybody he is talking about our overall quest in attempting to get our total government house in order what we ought to be deciding here is whether we are going to give some symbol of leadership to the the executive branch to show them that yes we are not just talking about the governments overspending we are going to do something about it who cares what the senate did who cares what they have done in years past to assume that if we take the cuts today asked by mr frenzels recommital that we are somehow going to devastate our committees suggest that every increase we have had over the last decade has been a reasonable one i doubt anyone can suggest that when a committee can get a 2 600percent increase in 1 year and come back for more and more 1 year and then the next year and shy away from any attempt to bring some reasonable fiscal restraint to itself how can we stand up and say to our people back home proudly yes we are doing our part we are not doing our part we have made one hesitant step with what the committee has done let us take a real big step for the rest of our constituents"]], "top_unsure":

and licensing provisions of the energy and commerce and interior bills this legislative product is tangible evidence that the house can and will act on a national issue that has been the subject of some controversy the science and technology committee first began consideration of nuclear waste issues when we were assigned nuclear jurisdiction under house rules in 1977 since that time the committee has spent considerable effort developing nuclear waste r d legislation including the reporting of our first r d bill in the 96th congress in this congress because of what we had learned fromearlier attempts we took the approach of introducing a comprehensive bill to demonstrate how the research and development activities should be integrated into the overall nuclear waste repository program this bill is h r 5016 in its deliberations on this legislation the committee acted only on the r d provisions for both nuclear waste and spent fuel the legislation was introduced by mrs

her leadership in initiating this legislation at subcommittee and her willingness to incorporate a diversity of views on the various provisions into the introduced bill as a result of her consensus approach this legislation received overwhelming endorsement when it was reported by the full science and technology committee in a 37to2 vote on november 20 1981 i am very pleased to note that the other committees of jurisdiction have recognized the programmatic need for the research and development elements of our bill which include the concept of a test and evaluation facility this research and development concept is recognized as a most valuable element of the waste management program by the department of energy the nuclear regulatory commission and the technical community it is a focus for the r d activities which consist of site research and the ongoing generic supporting research which has been authorized by the science and technology committee over the past 5 years it is also tailored to demonstrate handling storage and other aspects of waste management in a sitespecific manner and will serve as a basis for resolving licensing issues in both cases the nrc has been given a significant role of concurrence with respect to the doe r d activities we have agreed with the other committees to provide the secretary with the discretion to locate the t e facility at a candidate repository site or on a separate site if he chooses to go the route where the t e facility is a precursor to the repository the site will be included in all the siting procedures of title i and onsite construction is tied to those procedures in the case of a separately sited t e facility the safeguards of the r d title apply so that the public is involved and health and safety issues are properly addressed our science and technology committee title also contains a research development and demonstration program on the dry storage of spent fuel this program encourages the department to aid the utilities by developing valuable licensing data and authorizes onsite demonstration programs at up to three power plants the secretary may also conduct a technology demonstration activity on dry storage at a federal facility using up to 300 metric tons of spent fuel this activity is an excellent complement to the last resort awayfromreactor afr storage provisions of title i the funding for the program may come from the doe the utilities and the interim storage fund this program appears in title ii very much as it was reported by the cothmittee in h r 5016 i should note that a few elements of the three major bills have been placed in a joint title since they are items of shared jurisdiction these three elements are first the funding mechanism which includes funds for title ii the r d title second the mission plan and third the new civilian office for nuclear waste management the r d provisions from the science and technology committee bill h r 5016 were conformed to apply

instance for higher and higher interest rates because interest rates are interested not in how you get the money not in how you spend the money necessarily but what the bottom line is apparently in the deficit now that would unfairly burden the committee bill let me show you what the total deficits for the next 3 years are in these three bills there is 232 billion under the committee bill 252 billion under the latta substitute 227 9 billion under the aspin bill do you know what accounts for those deficits more than any other single thing it was the big big tax cut of last year when david stockman was before the house committee i asked him for his appraisal of just how much money was siphoned out of the revenues of the government by that tax cut in these 3 years he said a little over 400 billion a little over 400 billion that accounts for the whole anticipated deficit do you not think that it is a fa r proposition to ask the average american which he would rather have does he want a big tax cut or would he rather have a balanced budget i think that the average american once asked that question would respond in the latter because i think he is a responsible person and the average american was deceived by marketing and by salesmanship on this tax cut last year the average american is not really getting any of it i think all of us really know that deep in our hearts that tax cut that we voted last year can yield up 30 billion from the enormity of its coffers without really hurting anybody at all because that much is going to the 5 or 6 percent of the wealthiest families in this country who do not really need that tax cut and who really are not taking it and investing it in jobproducing enterprises they are not investing it in the kind of things that modernize our aging industrial plant this has been the most regressive set of tax cuts in the history of the united states it has turned the united states back around and headed us in a direction of about 50 years ago it is the trickle down theory that is espoused here there is an obsession on the side i am sure of those who want to support the latta substitute and in the white house to protect at all costs this 7 000 return to the 100 000 family under the guise of trying to help all the families well it does not help all the families that program hurts most of the families of the united states on balance it hurts 75 percent of the families of the united states so you face this question right now do you want to insure that there is not going to be any way in any of these bills to redress the grievance that the old people are going to feel when they are forced to pay 534 for a 2week stay in the hospital maybe 710 in the year after that when you have added that on their backs in order to protect these 30 pieces of silver for those at the top of the economic ladder the top of the economic pyramid on the theory that some of it is going to trickle down do you really believe that this worked in the 1920s i tell you it did not and it will not work in the 1980s"], [3.224611282348633e-05, 0.5000322461128235, 1, "i would like to state in developing this bill we did find that there is and has been throughout the history of the highway trust fund a discrepancy between the amount of money that certain states may contribute into the highway trust fund and the amount of money that they may receive for that state from the highway trust fund when this program was established in the 1950s it was found that there was a national need for a major interstate highway network across the country a superhighway a safe highway a limited access highway states would be or individuals throughout the country would be asked to pay 3 cents and later 4 cents a gallon that would go into the highway trust fund to pay for this the amount of money going into the trust fund from a particular state had no relationship to the needs of that state we could take a state like the state of new jersey a state with a fairly high population many automobiles the state would put a great deal of money into the federal highway trust funds however when it came to the interstate highway we find that new jersey is a very small state and so in order to complete this necessary national network it would not get many miles of interstate or much money to build this interstate we find in other states mainly out in the west fairly rural states like montana nebraska or south dakota with relatively few people that they did not send very much to the highway trust fund at all and yet they had a need for many miles of interstate so in the national interests to have a national program the states were allocated sufficient money to build the interstates in that state no matter how much it cost that is why we had some states like smaller more populous states contributing money to the rest of the country to build the system because it was in the national interests many of the states which were allocated money on what it would cost to complete the interstate many of the states used their money early and they are now getting near the end of the interstate needs in their state so their allocation is going down therefore if you look at a number you would find that some states are getting 80 cents 75 cents 78 cents back on each dollar they contribute other states are getting more than a dollar for each dollar they contribute we cannot balance that out one to one otherwise we will have 50 separate highway situations in the country good roads in one state and poor roads in another state so what we did in order to help the imbalance was to not bother any state that was getting more than 85 cents per dollar back but for the states which got fewer than 85 cents to lift them up to a minimum of 85 cents the way this was done was to add money to the bill each year and in the first year the only year we have the figures for on projected revenues this adds 420 million in just the first year alone to the bill states will get at least 85 percent back for each dollar they send in one of the major recipients one of the ones that was lowest because it used a lot of its interstate money was the state of texas the state of texas in fiscal 1982 got 346 million even though we only double the tax this year the state of texas bringing it up to the 85 percent will get in fiscal 1983 779 million much more than double what they got even though the gas tax for the highway trust fund is double we think this is a good compromise it seems to have satisfied most of the states the 420 million addition to the program is something that we can live with through the 4 years of this bill without triggering the byrd amendment or any other amendments which would cause a reduction for all of the other states so this is an amendment that helps several states and hurts no state we believe that it will help in the passage of the legislation and i urge adoption of the amendment"],

the 8 a pilot program and an amendment to eliminate the provision that extends the surety bond waiver program i requested this time to highlight those defects so that my colleagues can better assess all of the implications of h r 4500 the purpose of the bill under consideration is to extend for another 2 years a program that is intended to help socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses develop the capability to pe~form sophisticated hightechnology largedollar multiyear contracts the program is being tested to determine whether the programn is achieving this goal and whether the authority to demand certain contracts is an effective means to this end thus our consideration of h r 4500 must address the level of success achieved by the 8 a program over the last 3 years testimony presented during our hearings on the bill indicated that the program as created by congress has failed to realize the fundamental purposes of its existence further the mere request for an extension the second thus far stands as clear evidence that elements of failure to adequately assess the program exist yet h r 4500 offers no substantive changes in the law two of the weaknesses i perceive in the bill concern the use of the department of defense as the test agency and the use of construction contracts to carry out the purposes of the legislation because efforts are underway by the small business administration and the 0mb to recommend that the president designate a nondefense agency for the program i will not elaborate on this concern however a brief statement on the use of construction contracts may be helpful testimony presented to the committee indicated that construction contracts may be counterproductive to developing a business ability to compete and to perform one of the central arguments here concerns the fact that the competitive bid process is an essential element of the construction industry to succeed a business must develop the skills of surveying the market for available work deciding which jobs are appropriate to the companys capabilities estimating the job and its costs obtaining bonding soliciting subcontracting bids and preparing the bid yet the 8 a pilot program does not require competitive bidding it is a solesource negotiation program a process that according to testimony can increase construction costs by 40 to 120 percent my final concern addresses the surety bond waiver program according to the gao surety bonding is often a prerequisite for obtaining some government contracts but the practice occurs particularly in construction work further the sba requests as a matter of normal procedure that agencies not require bonding bonding for nonconstruction contracts except where it is absolutely essential to protect the interests of the government as noted in the committee report the sea administers a surety bond program that allows the administration to guarantee reimbursement of between 80 and 90 percent of the value of a contract which does not exceed 1 million the purpose of the program is to help small businesses obtain the bonding required for federal projects especially construction contracts over 25 000 as mandated by the miller act in its report to the congress on the surety bond program the gao revealed that of the 6 085 applications that were received for bonding under the guarantee program only 2 percent or 144 were refused further of the 144 applicants who were denied bond guarantees 87 percent were not qualified 8 a firms of the 57 remaining 48 had participated in the 8 a program longer than the 1year limit and were not eligible six of the remaining nine firms had been in business longer than the 2year maximum thus the gao reports had the bond waiver program been implemented only three firms would have been eligible during the period of october 1978 through june 1981 further considering the very low rate of refusal under the bond guarantee program the advisability of waiving the bond requirement for firms that have been rejected by the guarantee program is questionable the effort to help disadvantaged small businesses develop expertise is admirable and providing the sba with the power to reserve desirable contracts may be the appropriate avenue for achieving this goal yet in 3 years the 8 a pilot program in its current form has not advanced the purposes of the program and has not provided an adequate base from which to assess the viability of the program as we consider this bill we should all be aware of the weaknesses of h r 4500 and should question the need to extend the surety bond waiver program the good intentions of the program deserve our full consideration mr mitchell of maryland i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from

brought out for the members so that they can better understand this highly technological aircraft you will hear from the opponents of the f a18 hornet that it is a too costly aircraft and can be replaced with a better alternative however the facts tell a different story the costs of purchasing each f a18 have been decreasing and are expected to continue decreasing as the program matures and larger numbers of aircraft are produced annually the 63 hornets funded for fiscal year 198 when inflation is taken into account wil have a significantly lower unit cost than f a18s funded in fiscal year 1981 second the f a18 is far less espensive than the f14 which is also being purchased by the unitedstates navy in recent action congress authorized fiscal 1983 unit flyaway costs requested by the navy for the f a18 of 25 1 million this compared to 38 million for the f14 also the hornet is comparable in cost with the slower less maneuverable less survivable a6 while we are all concerned about the cost of our weapons systems negotiations have taken place to control the cost of the f a18 in october navy secretary john lehaman and the planes prime contractor agreed on a 22 5 million price tag per plane for the first 63 aircraft this is a major decision by both parties to make a concerted effort to control the costs of the hornet critics have charged that a mix of a6s and f14s would be preferable to the navys current plan which includes the f a18 due to their lower cost and improved capabilities this is not the case if you compare these alternative plans with our current mix of two squadrons of f a18s two squadrons of f14s and one squadron of a6s you can easily see that it would reduce the departments fighter and attack capabilities it would also increase defense costs by an additional 10 to 16 billion over a 15year life cycle period there is no question that alternatives to the f a18 are less attractive and would be a step backward for the navy we must also consider the impact this amendment would have on our allies thus far three allies of the united states have after exhaustive studies of the most advanced aircraft in the world chosen the f a18 aircraft as the primary tactical aircraft for their nations future selection of the p a18 by canada australia and spain demonstrates the extent to which these countries have bet their future survival on the performance of the f a18 these countries chose the f a18 because of its capability reliability and maintainability and stateoftheart technology recently canadian pilots began training in the cf18a version of the f a18and the first week of operations exceeded even their most optimistic predictions following is a part of the text from the commander of canadas first cf18 squadron this has been a great week for the 410 squardron and the new air force we have an absolute winner on our hands and look forward to fully exploiting amazing potential of cf18 in weeks and months ahead recently a great deal of misinformation has been reported by the opponents of the hornet from the navys operation and evaluation test opeval of the f a18 i would like to clear the air and present all the facts about this test the opeval strike mission was at best questionably run the specifications for the strike mission called for a standard day mission the test was flown on a hot day also the specifications called for carrier operations the hornet flew off a runway another criticism of the hornet by the operations and evaluation test was its range the opeval used three 315gallon auxiliary fuel tanks which were retained for reasons of economy in wartime such tanks would be jettisoned once their fuel was consumed in order to reduce drag and improve range the f a18s currently coming off the production line have three 330gallon tanks regarding internal fuel the hornet that was tested had 10 400 pounds of fuel this can be compared with 10 860 pounds of fuel that the f a18 currently carries the combat radius deficiencies reported by the opponents are really not deficiencies at all but only reflections of the equipment the opeval aircraft carried and the way they were flown when the hornet is flown to the requirements specified you will see that it not only meets but exceeds its expectations i wouldalso like to refresh everyones memory of the actions the house took last year in support of the f a18 by a vote of 101316 the house defeated a similar amendment offered by the gentleman from minnesota to terminate this program the house spoke last year in support of the f a18

with my colleagues to take this debate seriously and consider our lessons from history before casting your vote chiseled in stone in front of the archives building just down from this capitol are the words what is past is prologue study the past perhaps no other proposed legislation at no other time in the last half century commands us to follow those precepts more than this domestic content bill it is protectionist pure and simple53 years ago the united states and the world trading nations found themselves in economic circumstances very similar to what we experience today president hoover called congress into special session in 1929 to consider tariff protection only for american farmers by 1930 when the smoot hawley bill was signed into law nearly every section of the american economy had joined the logroll of protectionist tariffs that triggered protectionist retaliation from our trading partnersinternational commerce came to a screeching halt and that legislation smoothawley perhaps more than anything else was the spark that ignited a worldwide depression lasting for a decade those same conditions exist today we saw recently at the gatt ministerial meeting in geneva that our trading partners are primed and cocked to protect their markets and will do so especially if the united states as leader of the free world sets the example if that happens it is just as much a nowin situation for us as is nuclear war in a much graver sense specifically on this legislation let us ask will it do what its proponents claim will it create more jobs in america and not increase inflation very clearly from any objertive study the answer is a firm no let me underscore what the congressional budget office study of the domestic content legislation reveals the cbo does acknowledge that 38 000 jobs will be reborn or created in the automobile industry however when the overall effects of protectionism are factored in there will be the cbo notes a net loss of american jobs unemployment in the nonautomobile sector will actually be increased by more than 100 000 for the american consumer according to the cbo study it will mean higher prices not only in automobiles but in other products as well let us dv a especially on where that net loss of jobs will occur there you find that the increased unemployment will hit in the very areas on which we must rely for economic growth for the rest of this century for example four out of every five new industrial jobs created in the past 4 yearshave been in the export sector more than one out of every six american jobs is totally dependent on exports one out of every three agricultural acres goes into export those will be the first wave of new unemployment if we start down this dangerous road of protectionism one of the problems with this bill is that it aims at the wrong target it aims at japanese imports and the facts are that japanese imports on a per unit basis are at the same level as they were 4 years ago the real target should be the american economy which has depressed all auto sales and that is not the target that is aimed at in this legislation this bill clearly violates the rules of international trade called gatt that is not to say that other countries including the principal one at whom this bill is aimed do not also violate the rules of free trade what i am suggesting is that there is another course to deal with this problem we can pass legislation that provides for reciprocity similar to the frenzel bill that provides for fair trade that puts american products on an even playing field with other nations and it is legislation that strengthens our hand to enforce on a continuing basis and within the rules of international trade free and open and fair trade the problem is that the reciprocity legislation is not before us today it has not completed its markup in the ways and means committee and that means we do not have the opportunity to vote on it today therefore i urge my colleagues to wait until the start of the 98th congress to deal with this problem in a more thoughtful calm and deliberate manner i agree that we should send a message to japan but let that message be a legal one let not this great lawmaking body the greatest in the world send a message which in itself violates the code of international trade law the philosopher santayana said those who
