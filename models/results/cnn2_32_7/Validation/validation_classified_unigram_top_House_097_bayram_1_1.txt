relating to a resolution of disapproval which would seek to delay the implementation of proposed regulations of the department of housing and urban development by way of background i should point out that in 1978 the banking committees of both houses of congress were granted the autnority to delay the implementation of huds regulations for a period of 90 calendar days if within 30 days of continuous session of congress after the regulations are published in their final form either committee reported out a resolution of disapproval the committee were also authorized to select various rules or regulations to be submitted to the committees 15 days prior to publication in the federal register in order that a preliminary review could be undertaken this authority was developed as a compromise between the house passed legislative veto sponsored by our former colleague from michigan garry brown and the position of the other body which merely required hud to publish an agenda of regulations expected to be considered during the fiscal year the conference report on the 1978 act sets forth the rationale for the legislative review process as follows in adoption this provision the conferees did not include the principle of a legislative veto of administrative actions instead the amendment formalizes a procedure designed to assure a constructive consultative relationship between congress and the executive branch the intent is to encourage cooperation and to develop a spirit of comity the conferees expect that the formality of this procedure will not stand in the way of such cooperation but will increase it the conferees also expect that the 00day deferral provision will only be followed where either committee believes that the proposed regulations violate the intent of congress since the 15day consultative period is designed to provide an opportunity for misinterpretations to be resiolved the conferees expect that the 90day deferral period will rarely be invoked of particular importance is the statement that the conferees also expect that the 90day deferral provision will only be followed where either committee believes that the proposed regulations violate the intent of congress that statement was our pledge of responsible implementation of legislative review it was our pledge that we would use the deferral process only as a means fo insuring the integrity of the legislative process with lhat in mind i would like to go back to the artion taken by the banking committee on may 26 at that time two resolutions of disapproval were brought up for consideration both resolutions were originally considered the day before but could not be reported out due to the lack of a quorum one of the resolutions house joint resolution 480 disapproved regulations that dealt with increases in rents for tenants of hud assisted housing the provisions expressly authorizing these increases were adopted last yeat as part of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1981 i voted against last years omnibus budget reconciliation act nontheless there is no doubt that the departments regulations are consistent with the law in fact the sponsors of the resolution never seriously contended that the regulations violated the intent of congress the argument for adoption of the resolution was on the grounds that what the house did last year was wrong and since we are attempting to change those provisions this year the regulations should be deferred i personally favor changing the law to prevent scheduled increases in tenants rents but i believe the use of the legislative review is inappropriate and a violation of trust delegated to the committee by the congress in this case the committee which under the law is to act in a quasijudicial manner as the agent of the house is acting in a way which ignores the expressed will of the house in last years vote i think last years legislative process was terrible but the fact is that a certain provision did pass and become law until the law is changed we should not be using the legislative review process as a rearguard action if it appeared likely that the house and the other body would repeal the tenant contribution provisions made last year i would agree that we should ask hud to voluntarily delay implementation of the provisions in fact however the other bcdy is adamantly opposed to any such changes and the housing bill reported out of the banking committee in the other body is clear evidence of that opposition unless the other body yields which is unlikely current law would remain in effect and this resolution will only delay the inevitable for 90 days at this point i would like to complement the gentleman from ohio mr seiberling for his farsightedness during the floor debate on the houses original legislative veto provision mr seiberling predicted that this situation would arise he predicted that after there had been an accommodation of differences between house and senate after the president had signed a law either body can hold up the implementation of that legislation reassert its original position and completely frustrate the compromises reflected in the legislation during that same debate the gentleman from georgia mr levrtas spoke strongly in favor of the legislative veto as he has many times since denying that reviewing all hud regulations would be a burdensome task mr levitas argued that every regulation would not require review it is only those which are the most devasting the most wrong minded the most excessive that have to be dealt with later mr levitas complained abdut the unelected bureaucrats who take what we thought we had written inta law and turn it upside down on its head legislative review he said is the means by which we can return to certainty what we thought we had to begin with we do not have to disagree with the principles of legislative review to question its applicalton in this case oh certainly we are following the statutory process set out in the legislative review procedure but we are abusing it in precisely the same way that we have complained that executive agencies abuse and distort the will of congress in regulations at this point in time both houses of congress and both sides ef the aisle are agreed that the legislative review procedure has worked well taking the type of action the banking commitee did on house joint resolution 480 is an abuse of the review power i believe that the surest way to build opposition to a legitimate power is to abuse it we should also be mindful that we will be presenting to hud an ideal case upon which it can challenge the whole legislative review procedure we would be foolish to think that a court would not take cognizance of the fact that such an abuse has occurred in considering the validity of the provision as i said earlier our hud authorizations bill for this year proposes that rent levels for assisted housing be returned to the 25 percent of adjusted income level i personally support this provision if we can persuade a sufficient numberin both housesthis will become law but until the law is changed house joint resolution 480 must be considered a gross distortion of the legislative review process"], [0.48588454723358154, 0.5141154527664185, 1, "this is a very unusual situation for me i am usually comfortable on the house floor and comfortable in the proceedings of the house but i am not today i am more upset about what is going on now than i have been since those sort of private times when i tried to influence policy decisions on the korean war and the vietnam war incidentally i was virtually never successful i am terribly worried about this performance because i have as the members will see as i try to explain what i am saying the deepest respect for two of the people who are heavily involved in this first i am very sad that this is happening this way and i say this not with any lack of sympathy for the republican members of the house i have witnessed the same kind of thing going on the democratic side particularly when lyndon johnson was the president when the white house presumed to take over the whole process i do not mean to be unkind to anybody on the republican side but it is very clear that the timing especially with regard to the great push to bring up this particular matter at this particular time was masterminded by the white house and perhaps some members of the house that i do not know but certainly not the leadership in such a way that it would have an overwhelming political smell i am not sensitive about politics you know i know about it and i have played legislative politics as well as substantive politics most of my career but this is really an extraordinary example it is an example of a party that had had a very strong program which went astray and then the party had the good sense to modify it somewhat that has happened in the last roughly 20 months i guess it is i am not going to go into any detail but it is very hardit is very very hardto come to a conclusion any other conclusion than that the timing on this is a diversion i would not be worried about it if the principal actors in this were only the president and jim baker and ed meese and the other white house operators the only sad thing about it is that a man whom i admire enormously and think would make a quite good prestdentand i hope i am not hurting him when i say thishas apparently been the hit man on this the vice president i hope that is not true i hope it is the others because i have come to expect that from them even including lyndon johnson and richard nixon this is the most political white house i have ever dealt with it is so much a politicalwhite house that it sort of frightens me because it does remind me of a combination of johnson and nixon and if that does not fnghten people we have a problem that is why i am sad and i am quite serious about this i have great admiration for the republican party and many of its members i am also sad because one of my best friends on the republican side of the aisle and one of the men i admire the most is the author of the base resolution i have a strong feeling that i understand why he is in that position he just got so fed up with the democrats that he thought anything was better than what they were doing and i do not even blame him from his point of view it makes sensenot from my point of view i have almost gotten in that situation a couple of times and never quite made it but i do not belong to his party i am not trying to be funny i am telling you why i am concerned but the bottom line of why i am concerned is the substance the gentleman from new york crafted the best possible bad resolution and the fundamental thing that is wrong with that resolution is that it demonstrates that he has truly given up on the essential democratic process he puts certain things in his resolutioneven though much more wisely drafted than most of the ones i have seen and many of those resolutions have been created by democratswhich would require supermajorities to decide that there will be an unbalanced budget some very estimable people on the republican side again whom i admire have made the point that we already have a supermajority that we have a supermajority in the twothirds required to override a veto but dear god does not anybody understand that in a government cleverly and carefully crafted to separate the powers so that no one power would become the tyrant that the veto override process is the great clash in the american political process between a convinced executive and a convinced congress that simple twothirds requirement is the only one and here we are not talking thank god and thank mr conable about anything quite as bad as a twothirds supermajority i can bring this rule to the floor only because i am convinced that it is the best rule we could possibly have for a completely outrageous situation that should never come up at this time in the flow of congress there can be all kinds of arguments made that the democrats prevented it from coming up any other time that is simply not true if the big five were going to put the heat on people some of whom are directly opposed to this proposition they could have done it earlier if they had really wanted to generate the steamand they did generate the steamit could have been done practically anytime even earlier this year now what is political about this it is inescapable to me that it is a diversion it is inescapable to me that the timing is a diversion the substance is not but the timing is a diversion now why is it upsetting me why am i worried my worry is very minor it has to do with me i am worried that i will not present this as well as it could be presented i am upset because i fear we are going to do grave damage to the republic and its processes i have been one of the earliest people to recognize that we must have a responsible process a budget process that gives us a rational approach i have been defeated by my party on occasions by both parties on occasion in seeking that opportunity the bill that we have been operating under for a number of years i crafted to a large degree and when i presented it to the house which voted virtually unanimously for it i tried to make it clear that it was not a very good bill that it needed a lot of change and that its future depended entirely on the will of the membership one of the tragedies of our time has been that in this institution we were unable to achieve what was achieved in the senate until very recently the budget resolutions have been a totally partisan matter i have no intention of trying to lay the blame for that there cannot be a partisan budget approach many of the democrats have never understood this what you do in your fight over a budget resolution is fight out the alternatives and come to a conclusion and then if you really believe in a budget process you have some responsibility that it functions and even if you do not win you need to vote for the process that may be a strange idea to some of you who have never looked at process as being that complicated and that restrictive but that is the way you are going to deal with these major problems if you ever do there are a lot of democrats who need to learn this lesson that we must have the process if we do not have a process which deals with the macroeconomic situation in the united states we will revert to the boom and bust of the period prior to world war ii administrations of great variety for years gave us a relatively steady approach to macroeconomic problems it is something that has to be done and it has to be done by this institution along with others we are dealing with the greatest single issue that faces the society the free world and all the democratic countries because none of them even the parliamentary ones have successfully dealt with it in this approach to using the constitution as the vehicle we crush the proper approach which is that we must have the will to pass legislation that will deal with economic problems and then we have the character the courage and the wisdom to deal with it in a bipartisan fashion i do not believe there is any future for this country literally if we think that one point of view by itself can prevail i do not think the democratic party by itself can prevail with the policies that we must have i do not believe that the republican party can prevail with its policies alone i am deeply committed to the notion that the only way we can function together and survive together is by coalitions of the unlike i am convinced that the good things that were done in a period of political chios in the late 1940s were done in that fashion by a great coalition of the country that put together the policies that made us live very well i think this is exactly the wrong way to go and i think we should defeat all the proposals for a constitutional amendment i think then we should return to an effort to see to it that we have an adequate budget process adequately supported by all of us and not in a narrow political way i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.485903799533844, 0.514096200466156, 1, "the major goal of american health policy since the rnid1960s has been the attainmient of equal access to health care that is access that does not differ because of income race or age differences between individuals however in the 1980s as the new administration begins to tackle the health care financing and delivery issues facing the unitedstates health care system concern will undoubtedly begin to focus on the relationship between federal health budget reductions and potential reduced access to medical care by the poor and elderly this may require the application of civil rights principles to the delivery of health services in the context of an ever changing political and economical environment consequently a new emphasis on civil rights as a mreans to protect health benefits may be needed to continue the public debate over equal access to medical care as a right for all americans even during a time of economic austerity the delivery of medical care in the united states through the use of expensive technology has fostered spiralling health care costs and the development of one of the largest service industries in the nation however access to medical care is limited for many americans with low incomes and who lack adequate health insurance protection during the past 15 years medical care for the poor and elderly has been subsidized primarily under the medicare and medicaid programs these programs help transfer a traditional welfare and charity arrangement of financing medical care into new attempts to mainstream medical care for the indigent populations this emphasis on making the availability of medical care more equitable has increased the purchasing power for the indigent and has helped to close the gap in health services and health status between black and white americans moreover recent attempts to expand the health care purchasing power of the poor along with removing discrimination barriers have been instrumental in assuring equity and accessibility in the delivery of medical care now this trend is being reexamined to reduce federal and state health expenditures and to develop more prudent methods of financing medical care for the poor the two major health care financing laws were created in 1965medicare and medicaid programsto help assure equal access to medical care for the elderly poor and disabled medicare established uniform hospitaland medical benefits which are administered as part of the social security program for all elderly persons regardless of income or place of residence now 16 years later despite the dramatic rise in public spending for health care the aged pay more out of pocket for health care than they did before medicare began the medicaid program was designed to aid and encourage the states to provide minimum health benefits for at least those individuals receiving federal income protection a ssistanceafce and ssi in 1975 many states began to liberalize entitlement and benefits for medicaid to individuals meeting specific categorical and income eligibility requirements the federal and state governments attempted to fulfill national expectations to make health cafe available to all even those unable to purchase private health insurance however runaway health care costs began to exceed public expenditures to meet this goal in 1978 states began to take measures to reduce expenditures under the medicaid program through lower fees to medical providers elimination of optional benefits and reducing the number of persons classified as medically needy for enrollment in the program the result of these policies was to reduced access to medical care for many of the poor as states began to restrict budget allocations for programs such as medicaid this required many indigent patients to rely on charity hospitals and other facilities that were funded by local government to obtain medical care thus many of the poor and elderly have been subjected to segregated facilities based upon inadequate purchasing power this time segregation was not on the basis of race but based upon low incomes and inadequate health insurance protection racial discrimination has been of fered as an explanation for racial differences in the utilization of nursing homes between blacks and whites many have concluded that racial dis crimination plays a major role in nursing home admission procedures this may also account for the low percentages and inadequacies of nursing home care used by blacks and other minor ities contrary to some reports these differences cannot be viewed based simply upon disparities in life expectancy between blacks and whites since recent mortality data identifies few differences between racial groups above the age 6f 70 1urthermore lower rates of nursing home usage among blacks cannot be attributable simply to more superior health status this stance is supported by recent data which suggest that therev is a higher incidence of disabilities amonir black elderly whicht may require institutionalization than among elderly whites for example the black elderly are more likely than elderly whites to reside as a part of an ex tended family living at home because they lack the resouirces tobe supported by nursing homes or other alterna tive living arrangements aside from racial discrimination economic limitations play a major rolein reduced nursing home utilization additionally nursing home beds are in short supply in many urban areas and blacks with limited and lower incomes have relatively fewer chances of obtaining admission consequently the black elderly are more likelyr thani white elderly to be institutionalized in settings other than nursing homes such as mental and chronic disease hospitals moreover reliance oni social security and medicaid for income and health insurance protection reduces their ability to receive quality nursing home and home health services a form of economic discrimination is thus created because many nursing homes are not willing to accept medicaid recipients it is well known that title vi of thel civil rights act prohibits discrimination violations on the basis of race color or national origin in any program or entity such as a hospital home health agency community health center and nursing home facility receiving federal assistance but relatively little is known about the application of this provision on eliminating access barriers to federal health benefit programs for the general population for example the de partment of health and human services office of civil rights ocr was involved in litigations during the l1970s over batterns of racial lsegregation among hospitals in new orleans la arid other urban areas similarly in 1978 ocr be came concerned about potential eases of discrimination against minorities die to reductions relocations l and closures of hospital facilities in urban communities currently we are not certain what position ocr will take under the new administrationto guarantee equal access to medical care for the poor elderly and handicapped citizens of this nation we can only hope that this office will continue its efforts to reduce barriers and practices of discrimination the primary cause of hospital closures facing many urban commnunities is the amount of care they provide to patients who cannot afford to pay for services and who lack adequate health insurance protection recent estimates in dicate that at least 200 hospitils closed during the 2month period between 1975 to 1977 this fact isl often related to the large numbers of individuals who lack medical insurance for example recent data has reported that over 23 million persons have no health insurance coverage in the united states and another 20 million have inadequate coverage many of these individuals are considered the working poor with incomes above state medicaid eligibility levels but are inadequate to purchase private health insurance or to pay directly for the medical care they need many of the poor and working poor would be eligible for medicaid if it were not for limited income eligibility requirements imposed by states these limitations on eligibility and scope of benefits contribute significantly to the gapq in coverage that exist among the medically indigent under the medicaid progran these gaps have become even wider in many states due to limited state expenditures to finance medicaid this requires many charity and public hospitals to provide expensive medical care free to individuals without health insurance in the past it was possible for private and voluntary hospitals to recoup a portion of their losses on services to uncovered patients by passing this lost on to privatepaying patients public general hospitals deficits for providing free care to a sizable number of their patients were usually subsidized by local governments now due to shrinking tax revenues for innercity areas many public general hospitals are in2 great financial distress since many local governments can no longer support them in a number of urban areas public hospitals which are the major sources of primary care and the only source of emergency and trauma services began to close moreover these closures have begun to be seen as a serious threat to reducing access to medical care for urban residents and viewed as a legittmate civil rights issue for example a recent study identified that the percentage of minority residents of the community around the hospital is directly related to the proportion of hospital closing or relocating from the area in neighborhoods 025 percent black in 1970 for example only 14 2 percent of the hospitals hadf closed or relocated between 1937 to 1977 but neighborhoods 70 to 100 percent black in 1970 fully 48 9 percent of hospitalsalmost half had disappeared other consequences of hospital closures include firstdeparture of the few remaining primary care physicians in private practice from the community surrounding the hospitals and second lost of health service employment opportunities for community residents these conditions have further reduced the effectiveness of the urban health care delivery system and to reduce assurance of equal access for many urban residents who have limited medical care purchasing power a number of cases now pending before ocr are designed to determine whether reductions in the availability of medical care due to hospital closures violate title vi since these actibns occur more readily in minority and poor communities many have viewed these closures as an act of racism cases involving homer 0 fhillips hospital in st louis mo and thenew york city health hospitals corp which have either closed or reduced health services in recent years are major litigation disputes for ocr the complaints allege that proposed reductions in medical services by hospital closures in predominantly black communities would reduce access to health care since few alternative health care resources were available contrary to earlier civil rights legal cases which involve hospitals and other health facilities practicing discrimination in the provision of medical care to minorities and handicapped individuals present cases have not gained national attention however as more hospitals and community health centers either close or reduce services due to recent federal health budget reductions we may expect future civil rights debates to be concerned with reduced access to federally funded health programs one major objective of title vi of the civil rights act in regard to the delivery of health services was to prevent minority patients who are seriously ill from being turned away from hospitals and community health centers legal disputes involving patients who were transferred from private to public hospitals or subjected to long delays for medical care are now being considered as a violation against federal civil rights statutes these problems of discrimination appear to be most frequent for blacks mexican americans asian immigrants a number of civil rights regulators have recently examined policies of proprietary hospitals that require patients to pay advance payments prior to receiving treatment and the diagnosis of illness in addition the failure of proprietary hospitals to inform patients of their free care obligations which they must assume in accepting hillburton funds can be considered an attempt to prevent poor patients from receiving equal access to medical care in private health facilities these examples of discrimination practices in the delivery of health care services may have to be rsolved within the context of civil rights protectionism civil rights in the delivery of medical care may gain prominence in the 1980s to assure equal access to medical care for the poor heightened public concerns about the relationship between federal budget cuts greater control by state governments and efforts to reduce access to medical care mpay be a concern of many black elderly yet the entrenched coalitions and ideological commitments to reduce inflation will continue to influence the debate on mainstream medical care for the poor and elderly we can only hope that concerns over whether blacks and other minorities are discriminated against by the private health system may be raised as a major public policy issue in this round of debate as in others that consider equal access to medical care the major issue will undoubtedly relate to an individuals ability to purchase medical care this argument is highly needed based upon recent attempts to reduce medicaid recipients freedom to choose health providers which may encourage the poor to receive substandard care in socalled medicaid mills ironically the governments new emphasis to convert categorical health programs into block grants to reduce medical care inflation has been opposed most vigorously by opponents that this will encourage states to reduce funding to urban health facilities that serve the minority poor conventional public opinion suggests that few solutions other than legal disputes are most likely to emerge during this period of federal budget reductions congressional leaders must understand the importance of federal health funds as a necessary ingredient to assure minorities and the poor equal access to medical care only in the event of strong and coordinated leadership committed to the ideas of civil rights and equal access to medical care can we expect that the poor and elderly will fare better during this decade"],

campaigns and anticipation of the longawaited report of the presidents commission on social security reform it has been impossible to forget about social security for long there is certainly no doubt that the fiscal crisis which has been predicted so many times is actually upon us as you know the retirement fund has had to borrow from the disability and medicare trust funds in order to send out its november and december benefit checks on time interfund borrowing is giving us the time we need to search for a solution but it is no substitute for comprehensive reform the newspapers have also told us that many young people are losing faith in the ability of the system to pay out benefits into the longterm future i believe this demonstrates a lack of confidence not just in social security but in the ability and the willingness of congress and the administration to deal with this issue in any substantive meaningful way it is essential not only for financial reasons but also to restore public faith that congress demonstrate the political courage to deal with this difficult problem we have heard a good many suggestions in recent months as to how best to solve social securitys problems but most of the proposals have this in common they are shortterm remedial measures designed to make up the systems immediate shortfall but to do little else most ould place heavy burdens on workers or retirees or both we must protect the current and future retirees who have paid into the system for many years cuts in benefits would cause especially severe hardships for the twothirds of recipients whose social security benefits are their sole or primary source of income likewise proposals to accelerate the scheduled increases in the payroll tax would have a severe impact on the young workers of today without guaranteeing that the system would still be available when they retire i believe we should view the current situation not only as a crisis to be solved but as an opportunity for major structural reform which will secure the retirement fund well into the future the social security system was established originally to pay pensions to retired workers and their dependents and to provide for their families in case of death americans now count on social security for many different kinds of assistance but i think most would agree that its primary purpose should remain the payment of retirement and related benefits if social security is to survive its current crisis and if the american people are to continue to believe in its future the system must be retuthed to this original conception i am today introducing legislation which will not only remedy social securitys shortterm financial difficulties but will also reform the system to insure its longterm fiscal integrity the basic thrust of this legislation is to provide for a gradual transition to do the following stabilize the retirement insurance program in its current form through the payroll tax and separate out the other major components of the social security systemdisability insurance and hospital insuranceby taking them off the payroll tax and onto a permanent trust fund supported by the general fund specifically this bill maintains the oldage and survivors insurance trust fund for the payment of retirement survivors and dependents benefits oasi will still be funded by the payroll tax but will have a separate account in the federal budget disability and medicare will be consolidated into one trust fund which will draw revenues out of the general fund oasi will be credited with whatever surplus remains in the disability and hospital trust funds and the amounts already transferred under the interfund borrowing program will not need to be repaid over a transition period covering the years 198390 the oasi trust fund will receive an amount of the payroll tax decreasing from 5 275 percent in 1983 to 5 2 percent in 1984 and 5 1 percent from 1985 on even under worstcase economic assumptions this tax schedule will build up a sufficient level of reserves to insure continued payment of retirement and retirementrelated benefits through the 1980s demographic trends in the 1990s are expected to favor social security meaning that the retirement program will be stabilized well into the 21st century immediate payment of disability and medicare benefits out of the general fund would obviously place a tremendous strain on an already overloaded federal budget next years budget deficit is projected to reach 200 billion and i do not think we can sanction any measure which would add substantial amounts to that staggering figure my legislation includes several provisions which will insure that during the transition period the federal budget deficit will not be adversely affected by the addition of disability and medicare benefits first over the 198390 transition period a specified amount of the payroll tax will be paid into the consolidated disability and health insurance trust fund to be used toward the pay ment of disability and medicare benefits this amount will increase from 1 425 percent in 1983 to 1 5 percent in 1984 1 95 percent in 198586 and 2 05 percent in 198790 under this system the total payroll tax will rise from its current 6 7 to 7 05 percent in 1985 and 7 15 percent in 198790 however the payroll tax is scheduled under current law to reach 7 05 percent in 1985 7 15 percent in 1986 and 7 65 percent in 1990greater increases than those contained in this legislation second in addition the projected 10percent tax cut due to be implemented on july 1 1983 would be reduced to 5 percent with theremaining 5percent setaside during the period 198390 into the consolidated trust fund i think it is important to point out here that the payroll tax is a regressive tax because it is a flat percentage taking a proportionately greater share out of the low or middleincome workers paycheck the income tax system on the other hand is designed to be progressive the h ther ones income the greater the ta rate use of an income tax base instead of the payroll tax thus spreads the burden of disability and medicare costs more fairly while the combined revenues from the special payroll tax and the income tax setaside will result in an increase in federal outlays in some years and a surplus in others the overall effects of revenues and outlays over the transition period will more or less offset each other current figures indicate that by 1990 this proposal will actually result in a net addition to the federal budget of 1 5 billiori finally this bill includes two additional reforms which i feel are important in the effort to insure longterm stability first social security ccverage will be extended to employees of nonprofit organizations federal employees who do not already have vested pension rights in the civil service or other federal retirement system and new federal hires this approach meets two consid erations it moves the system toward the universal coverage which was intended by its founders and it protects those federal employees who have paid into their own retirement systems in good faith and are already receiving or can expect to receive returns on those contributions second costofliving adjustments will be indexed to the annual increase in wages minus 1 percentage pointsthe average annual increase in productivityrather than to the consumer price index use of the wage index will stabilize the system by subjecting its beneficiaries to the same economic conditions as its working contributors the advantages of this legislation over other proposals currently under consideration are significant it does not cut benefits to current retirees or significantly restructure the benefits to be paid to future retirees it does not accelerate payroll tax increases indeed it scales those increases back and from 1991 on the new retirement fund is projected to remain stable with a 5 1percent tax rate with regard to medicare and disability i have long felt that these programs are better suited for general revenue financing than for funding through the payroll tax these are both extremely valuable and worthwhile programs and i certainly do not intend the federal governments commitment to the ill and the disabled to be weakened in any way however it is difficult to reconcile these programs with the earned wage benefit conception on which the retirement program was founded because unlike retirement these programs do not pay benefits to everyone who pays social security taxes use of a flat percentage payroll tax on all workers is appropriate for a retirement insurance program which pays benefits to all workers but insurance against disability and illness is best funded from other sourcep it simply is not equitable to ask low and middleincome workers who may never receive benefits from these programs to bear a greater share of their costs through a regressive payroll tax the measures currently under consideration by the commission constitute bandaid approaches to the social security systems problems they may succeed in patching up the shortterm financial crisis but they cannot be presented to the american people as a comprehensive solution i believe americans are willing to sacrifice in order to help insure the systems stability but at the same time they expect and deserve a responsible and humane approach to the systems problems this proposal provides such an approach it stabilizes the retirement program for all workers without asking any one sector to bear too heavy a share of the burden of change and it transfers the components of the system which are not available to all workers to general revenue financing i urge my colleagues to use this opportunity to institute this comprehensive and muchneeded reform"], [0.4868990182876587, 0.5131009817123413, 1, "i thank the gentleman for yielding this is truly a historic debate we are

dismembered i commend representatives jim leach and matthew mchugh and the staff of members of congress for peace through law for organizing this debate it is long overdue representatives conte bingham and i have introduced a resolution in the house calling on the superpowers to freeze their nuclear arsenals and begin cutting back so far 160 members of the house have cosponsored this resolution a similar resolution introduced in the senate by senators kennedy and hatfield has attracted more than 20 cosponsors in that chamber but this discussion today is not the result of this resolution no this measure is part of a much largeri movement gaining strength in the country that movement has a clear and simple message enough is enough the arms race must be halted before we blow ourselves of the face of the earth the nuclear arsenals of both superpowers must be reduced and reduced drastically why has the public suddenly turned itself toward nuclear arms control and disarmament because the public is afraid the american people want a strong defense but they are afraid that the 1 7 trillion arms buildup of the reagan administration heats up an arms race where nobody wins they do not want nuclear war but they hear talk of nuclear warning shots from their secretary of state and limited nuclear war in europe from their president they do not want other countries to acquire nuclear bombs but they see nuclear trade policies from the admi istration that show that proliferation will be none of its business all across the country religious leaders business executives lawyers doctors college students and local legislators to name a few are organizing to demand a halt to the nuclear arms race the one initiative gaining momen tum nationwide is the proposal for the united states and the soviet union to freeze their nuclear arsenals so far more than a million people have signed freeze petitions in california a compaign is under way to place a referendum on the november state ballot calling for a freeze the campaign has collected about a half million signatures nuclear freeze groups have sprung up in 43 states and 279 congressional districts the massachusetts oregon and new yor4 legislatures have passed freeze resolutions more than 160 vermont towns have voted to support the freeze these are not people who want the united states to lay down its arms they are not advocating unilateral disarmament they are people with commonsense they are people who want both sides to stop the arms race the contemarkeybingham resolution is a response to that commonsense appeal the resolution calls on the superpowers to halt the arms race it calls on the united states and the soviet union to sit down and negotiate a mutual and verifiable freeze on the testing production and further de ployment of nuclear warheads mis siles and other delivery systems it calls on the superpowers to then begin major mutual and verifiable reductions in their nuclear arsenals yes there will have to be some giver and take at the negotiating table because of differences in both sides deployment cycles deciding on how to draw the line on testing production and deployment and figuring out how to cut back on the weapons will certainly keep the negotiators busy yes the process of implementing a freeze will be arduous and detailed but we have no choice but to begin that process for time is running out the arms race is getting out of control the overkill the two superpowers have amassed defies any rational justification the weapons states now have more than 50 000 nuclear weapons with a total explosive power equal to 1 million hiroshima bombs one poseidon submarine has enough warheads to cause 30 million fatalities in the soviet union more than it suffered in all of world war ii in europe alone the united states has one nuclear weapon for every 50 soldiers just 200 of the some 9 000 strategic warheads in the unitedstates arsenal would destroy every major city in the soviet union but now the american public is being told this overkill is not enough the administration wants to build 17 000 more bombs over the next 15 years i both the united states and the soviet union are in the process of deploying or producing a new generation of weapons deadly weapons like the soviet ss18 and the american mx missile that improve each sides ability to knock out the others missiles in a nuclear exchange and will put a hair trigger on nuclear deterrence both sides are taking technological leaps in the research and development of nuclear weapons that will make it more difficult to negotiate arms control treaties george kennan once said that the nuclear bomb is the most useless weapon ever invented it can be employed to no rational purpose but now we hear dangerous talk from the white house the state department and the pentagon about using nuclear weapons we hear talk of waging a nuclear war rationally of employing nuclear weapons as instruments of foreign policy we hear this laughable statement from mr t k jones a deputy undersecretary over at dod who says that everybodys going to make it if there are enough shovels to go around his plan is for each american to dig a hole throw 3 feet of dirt on top so its the dirt we are told that does it we read in the paper today that president reagan pland to spend 4 2 billion on a program to relocate twothirds of the american public in case of a threat of nuclear war not only would this be a waste of money such a program would dangerously delude the public into thinking it can survive a nuclear holocaust and win when the bombs explode there will be no winners while the administration professes that it wants to deter nuclear war it is pursuingpolicies and developiqg weapons that could push us into a nuclear war we must now realize that spending more money on more nuclear weapons merely buys us more trouble our resolution has received quite a bit of criticism recently that criticism reached a low point with this ad from the college republican national committee which is an auxiliary of the republican national committee the ad says the soviet union needs you support a unitedstates nuclear freeze to imply as this ad does that the 160 representatives who have cospon sored our resolution22 of whom are republicansto imply that they are preaching moscows line is an affront to their integrity and intelligence to imply that rev billy graham and averell harriman and the more than 300 prominent individuals and organizations across the country who have endorsed this resolution are communist sympathizers does a monumental disservice to people who are committed to the security of america i also wish the administration would expend as much energy stopping the arms race as it has attacking our resolution the administration claims that our resolution would freeze the united states into a disadvantaged position with the soviets that is not true each side has advantages over the other in certain weapons systems but overall there exists a balance of imbalances between the two superpowers when administration critics talk about a disadvantaged position i would ask them which position they would rather have the soviets they have no bomber fleet to speak of their subs are noisy and easy to detect and more than threefourths of their missiles sit in vulnerable landbased silos or would they rather be in the american position half our missiles are in invulnerable submarines more than onefourth are on intercontinental bombers and we lead the soviets in warheads 9 000 to 7 000 the russians are not 10 feet tall we do a great disservice to our defense posture when we claim we are weaker than the soviets the fact is we have more than enough firepower to reduce the soviet union to rubble they know it we know it the american public knows it and it is about time the administration knows it the administration claims that our resolution cannot be verified that is not true a freeze and reduction in both sides nuclear armaments can be verified so each side be confident that violations affecting our national security would be detected in fact verification would be much easier if we freeze now and reduce the stockpiles than if we heat up the arms race and try to negotiate reductions as the administration proposes if we have a massive arms buildup as the administration advocates we will end up with more nuclear weapons that will be harder to verify when we go to the negotiating table the administration claims that our resolution undercuts the negotiations in europe that is not true both the soviet union and the united states have b en playing to the gallery in their neg aiations over a few thousand nuclear weapons in europe meanwhile the question of how we cut back on the 50 000 warheads stockpile worldwide remains ignored obviously the brezhnev proposal for a freeze in intermediaterange missiles in europe is inadequate but instead of rejecting that proposal out of hand as the reagan administration has done we should challenge the soviets to freeze and reduce all nuclear arms finally we now hear that the president plans to endorse a socalled freeze resolution in the senate sponsored by senators jacason and warner that is not good enough mr president the jacksonwarner resolution calls for a longterm freeze in other words it says let us build just a few thousand more weapons then lets talk about freezing the arsenals let us deploy the mx the b1 bomber and groundlaunched and sealaunched cruise missiles then well stop it is the same old tired line the american public has been hearing from its leaders for the last three decades just let us complete the arms race and then we will talk about disarmament it will not wash the arms race can never be completed when we build more they build more when we mirv they mirv when we build the cruise missile they will build the cruise missile and the arms race will never end the american people are tired of excuses they are tired of being fed this baloney that we must arm to disarm they are afraid of all this talk from the reagan administration about nuclear waring shots about nuclear proliferation beizlk none of our business and about a limited nuclear war in europe they want the arms race to stop"], [0.48705780506134033,

parity floor on dairy price supports from 75 to 70 percent of parity it would give the secretary of agriculture authority to allow the parity level to drop below 70 percent when government expenditures exceed 750 million finally it would eliminate the semiannual adjustment in the support price while retaining the current dollar level of the support price at 13 10 per hundredweight proponents of this measure argue that price supports must be held down in order to reduce dairy surpluses and cut government spending the president feels that it is fair to ask dairy farmersto make this sacrifice for the sake of the national economy furthermore he and agriculture secretary block claim their proposal preserves an adequate price support program for dairy producers i disagree with the president and his supporters on every point their proposal will not result in an adequate program on the contrary it will drive many farm families out of business their proposal is not the only nor it is the best way to reduce dairy surpluses the administration has badly mismanaged dairy exports has failed to actresponsibly on limiting imports and has cut back on important domestic nutrition programs which utilize milk and milk products finally the amendment is unfair after having provided huge tax breaks to the wealthiest individuals and corporations in this country how can this administration and this congress blame farm families for rising budget def icits before addressing each of these points in more detail i would like to review some of the history behind this issue four years ago the congress placed a temporary 80 percent of parity floor on milk price supports this relatively highparity floor was enacted to return stability to the dairy market previous lower support levels had resulted in extreme fluctuations in supply and price which hurt both producers and consumers the 80percent floor along with the semiannual adjustment of the support price worked remarkably well during the first 2 years the support price was generally even with or below the market price and the program acquired a relatively small quantity of dairy productsjust slightly above that required for domestic and foreign nutrition programs in 1979 congress reaffirmed the 80percent floor then a severe recession overtook farming in 1980 net farm income dropped 25 percent and this year is expected to rise only to 1979 levels return on investment for farmers in 1980 averaged 2 4 percent this problem was compounded by the restrictions placed on grain exports to the soviet union which helped keep grain prices low dairy farmers did have an adequate pricesupport program this had the unfortunate consequence however of encouraging farmers to switch their resources from other commodities to milk production and encouraging dairy farmers to expand their herds against this background it is not difficult to understand how we arrived at our current situation of course we have a surplus of dairy products when milk is virtually the only major commodity that yields farmers even a marginal profit we can expect farmers to produce a lot of milk unfortunately the administrations solution is to eliminate the profit in dairy farming rather than looking for ways to make other commodities more profitable however it is not accurate to portray dairy farmers as growing rich at the expense of consumers and taxpayers i represent one of the largest dairy districts in the country and i know that this is simply not the case again if we look at recent history we find that dairy farmers work long hours for low wages and their income has not kept pace with increases in the costs of production we also find that dairy products are among the best values available to todays consumers dairy farmers must make huge investments in land buildings equipment and livestock they must be on the job every day of the year their days are long and their work requires much knowledge and skill what do they earn for this effort in 1980 with price supports at 80 percent of parity dairy farmer income averaged 2 89 per hour according to university of wisconsin researchers that is 15 percent below the minimum wage unfortunately that 2 89 will look awfully good if this amendment passes farmers already gave up last aprils adjustment of the support price and it has fallen from 80 t~o 72 percent of parity now the gentleman from massachusetts offers the white house amendment which will give the secretary authority to hold the support price steady for the foreseeable futureat least the next fewv years some argue that because the dollar level of price supports cannot go below 13 10 we are not really cutting price supports this is true if production costs remain constant but as every farmer and businessman knows that day is far off last year dairy production costs rose 10 3 rcent meanwhile the prices received by farmers rose only 7 1 percent undcr this amendment those prices would hardly rise at all for consumers duiry prices have not increased as rapidly as other prices from march 1980 to march 1981 general consumer prices rose 10 6 percent while dairy prices rose only 10 1 percent and as i said the prices received by farmers rose only about 7 1 percent of greater significance is the fact that milk prices have declined in relation to the general wage rate the minutes of work required to purchase a gallon of milk have declined 44 percent over the past three decades the period during which price supports have been kept a 75 percent of parity or more so we can see that the american dairy farmer is not getting rich at the expense of the taxpayer and consumer on the contrary with limited government help he has kept his head above water by working long hours and improving productivity as i stated earlier the points raised in support of the gentlemans amendment are open to question for example the administration and the gentleman from massachusetts claim they are proposing an adequate program i disagree this amendment will cost dairy farmers over 1 billion annually when compared to the 75percent floor proposed by the house agriculture committee make no mistake about it we will be driving family farms out of business with this amendment large operators may be able to weather these losses but a great many small family farms will not the administration tells us this is the only way to lower dairy surpluses meanwhile the white house has stalled on imposing import controls on casein which displaced 333 million pounds of domestic nonfat dry milk in 1980 the administration has also cut important domestic nutrition programs which utilize dairy products and most disturbing is the fact the the president has given a foreign country new zealand veto power over further sales of government butter stocks overseas in each instance the administration has rejected other options for disposing of our surpluses finally there is a question of equity i certainly agree that the 1 886 billion the commodity credit corporation will spend this year on the dairy program is a lot of money but so is the 6 billion in tax breaks this congress gave to those earning over 100 000 in 1982 the same could be said for the 12 billion tax breaks given to the oil industry and the 25 billion given to big business by fiscal mr chairmar we must balance the budget but why are we putting farm families out of business re the same wve are giving huge tax breaks to the wealthiest individuals and corporations in our society the american dairy farmers had already accepteid a cut in price supports from 80 to 75 percent of parity the gentlemans amendment will for all practical purposes eliminate the parity floor on the support price i hope that my colleagues will reject the amendment and give the family farm a chance to survive"], [0.4870721697807312, 0.5129278302192688, 1, "i take this time today to discuss some of the weeks activities and to comment upon some of the debate that has occurred during some of those legislative process this is been a momentous week as far as the congress is concerned the continuing resolution the second budget resolution and foreign aid or foreign assistance authorizations and appropriations when we reflect back on all of this i think history will show that it was a week in which the true philosophy behind the socalled deficits and the budget of this administration and the reaganomics or supplyside economics has truly come forwvard we look at the second budget resolution and we see therein a statement that in this year we will have a 37 5 billion deficit and that is all that in 1983 we will have a 19 billion deficit and that is all that in 1984 we will have a billiondollar surplus and there is no one in this house no one in the senate no one in the administration no one in financial t~cles no economist that will beliri e that and yet that second budget resolution passed this house overwhelmingly and will pass the senate yet no one believes it because it is not true everybody agrees that this years deficit will exceed 60 billion and in all probability it will be 100 billion just commenting in passing the bill that we just passed today just a few minutes ago will add to that deficit for the purpose of foreign aid as i said during the debate on that bill it should be added too that was one bill that the president was keeping a scorecard on that the president wanted a 50percent increase in foreign aid at the same time if we reflect in that budget resolution that was passed the first time in the house and in the reconciliation bill billions of dollars were cut back on nutrition programs for our children educational programs for our youth loan and grant programs for college students mninimium social security for our elderly who are 75 and 85 years of ageall in the name of supposedly balancing the budget in august of this year that we passed a tax bill that gave billions of dollars to oil producers racehorse owners other special interest groups leasing provisions tax credits to large conglomerates and companies making big profits and now we are going to continue on down this road without any change this administration says that their plan will work at the same time this nation is facing disaster unemployment is increasing continues to increase inventories are up businesses are down industry is hurting and we are not going to do anything really to help them i think that many of us on this side of the aisle do have alternatives legitimnate alternatives both in the senate and in the house to correct these problems to reduce the deficits to make more money available tit lower interest rates for both business and individuals one is not to increase spending that is not thle answer one is to redo the tax bill that was done earlier this year to take back the money that wvas given to the big oil companies aind to oil producers the billions of dollars in changing the windfall profits tax another is to stop the leasing tax credit provision to repeal that to repeal thle provision in there for race horse owners to reduce the benefits that went to those in the very high income brackets by the tax bill reducing thle uipper limits on the unearned income and to put most of that back in place by doing that we will once again have additional revenues that we so desperately need in order to reduce our deficit without actually impacting anyone making less than 100 000 in this country and that is over 98 percent of the people of this country another is to provide for a delay in the 10 percent by reducing the 10percent tax cut that goes into effect next year to a 5 percent and also to skewer the tax rates to benefit those with incomes of under 50 000 by doing this and by reducing the deficit you automatically will reduce the interest rates because there will be more money available in the private sector for loan purposes by reducing the interest on the trilliondollar debt that this country now has and continues on upward spiraling higher and higher by reducing that interest rate and by doing these other things we can by 1984 have a balanced budget the alternative is to continue down the road of reaganomics and as we continue down that road in the words of the chairman of the budget committee in the other body a member of the presidents partythey predict that as of this year a deficit of 76 to 92 billion next year 96 to 136 billion and in 1984 103 to 165 billion and some even say 200 billion so that is what we look for from reaganomics a total deficit in the next 3 years of over 400 billion it took us 205 years to get to the first trillion under reaganomics if continued on for 8 years we will be passed the 2 trillion mark and this country will hopefully still survive but we will have been through at least 25 to 30 percent interest rates inflation at 15 to 20 percent unemployment at 9 to 10 percent it will be much worse than what we saw in the thirties and it must be turned around neither the president nor this congress has a lot of time to waste and dilly and dally about it it is necessary that the congress and the president take action as i said 119111 before in order to reduce the deficits and to get interest rates down keep inflation down and get industry back on the road"],

support of this bill as has been described h r 3520 permits the steel industry to take 3 additional years to comply with the clean air act deadlines for stationary sources this extension will permit the industry to invest funds it would have otherwise used for pollution control for steel plant modernization central to the agreement are two conditions first the industry must spend some moneys on pollution abatement each year second that once the 3year extension expired in 1985 the industry would have to be in full compliance with the 1982 standards these conditions will be judicially enforceable because the stretchout can only be obtained by individual steel plants seeking consent decrees which will lock them into these conditional agreements the legislation is based on the socalled tripartite steel agreement which was fashioned by the steel industry the steelworkers union and by the environmental community in 1979 the previous administration convened a committee of steel labor and government officials to examine those issues which had led to the decline of our domestic steelmaking capacity part of their investigation was devoted to the problem of capital utilization the committee found that environmental controls were costly and drew upon the industrys capital at a time when funds were needed for modernization the steel industry labor unions and epa officials suggested the stretchout as a means for creating additional funds for the industry the envirohmental community was called upon to review the stretchout and suggested the conditions cited above to insure that ultimately environmental standards would be achieved by the industry an amendment to the clean air act was required to codify this agreement h r 3520 fits the bill unfortunately this creative agreement is under fire some members of congress have referred to the legislation as ratification of a backroom political deal this characterization is immensely unfair congress was not by the agreement the house committee on commerce and energy has endorsed the legislation because it balances so well the economic and environmental burdens being shouldered by the industry but more important this legislation represents a symbolic victory which will have a wide application in the environmental field and in other areas of legislation importance as well government and society make decisions about the distribution of income every day in 1981 ronald reagan made the decision to hasten the decontrol of energy prices in the belief that the market and not the federal government should determine the price of energy this decision may be the most efficient way to price energy to encourage domestic production and to discipline consumers into wasting less energy but it has significant drawbacks in terms of inflation in terms of forcing the poor or the elderly to chose between heating and eating and in terms of centralizing the flow of capital toward the energy industry no member of congress and certainly no average citizen was able to influence this decision billions of dollars hung in the balance yet no one was able to raise questions is this fair is this equitable will my income increase will my income go down billions were at stake and these questions could not be asked the concept behind this legislation speaks to the essential unfairness of the decisionmaking process which resulted in energy price decontrol the steel industry regarded itself as a victim of the governments environmental regulations yet the industry was willing to support strict compliance with the clean air act by 1985 if the congress provided a 3year stretchout of the environmental deadlines environmentalists were equally amenable in supporting a 3year delay in steels compliance with the clean air act because they knew first of the positive economic benefits and second that compliance would be assured just 3 years late this concepttripartitism if you willreduces the controversy inherent in problems which overlap economic and environmental issues the use of tripartitism was effective during the consideration of the chrysler legislation industry and labor were forced to make significant concessions in order to achieve their desired goal federal loan guarantees for the corporation shortly the house will consider legislation reauthorizing conrail which contains major concessions required of labor local transit authorities and shippers to maintain the railroads op erations the tripartite concept should be applied to more issues particularly those which will be debated during the clean air act authorization later this year it is in this arena where the economic environmental and energy goals of our country appear to be in greatest conflict as lester thurow points out in his outstanding book zero sum society we have used economic growth in the past to avoid disadvantaging certain segments of society when allocating economic goods in the environmental sphere we could pay both for additional investment in production and investment in pollution control economic growth as thurow indicates was the social lubricant that kept groups working together without economic growth the decisionmaking process devoted to the question of balancing economic and environmental needs could degenerate into controversy environmentalists and consumers do not want to give up clean air the steel industry and labor do not want to give up their plants in order to satisfy environmental laws rather than forcing these groups to use the political process to stifle the dreams of their opponents the tripartite formula was used to accommodate everyones interests concessions were made for the common good and as a result of this bill everyone will be better off ultimately the best formula on which we can rely is sustained economic growth we need tax reform moderate energy prices and a commitment to a full employment economy nothing short of these three objectives will be sufficient to enable our society to advance and flourish until that time we need to continue to rely on processes like tripartitism to encourage shared sacrifices on

process since our committees worked very very hard on meeting the congressional mandates in terms of meeting the maximum budget requirements and as a result we are asked now to consider a substitute that the committees have not even seen i rise in opposition to the grammlatta amendments to the reconciliation proposal as it affects the recommendations of the committee on post office and civil service the committee was mandated by the first budget resolution to achieve spending reductions of over 5 billion within our area of jurisdiction this was one of the largest cuts required of any of the authorizing committees of the house the members of the post office and civil service committee considered many legislative changes that would have complied with the house mandate all but the handful contained in the committees reconciliation proposal were rejected for one reason or another our committee did not ask for these cutsthey were forced on the committee by the budget resolution however whether the house agrees or disagrees with the way the cuts were fashioned the committee fully complied with the mandate of the house in a prudent and responsible manner in fact we have actually exceeded our reconciliation instructions for fiscal year 1982 by over 100 million critics of the committees proposal complain that the cuts will hurt one group or another unfairly i agree and that is unfortunate i do not want to cut any ones benefits it seems to me the real issue today is not over the size of the cuts because the grammlatta substitute actually results in less overall outlay savings in fiscal years 1982 and 1983 the real issue today is whether the house will tell the authorizing committee not only how much to cut from its jurisdiction but specifically where to make the cuts the house budget act of 1974 was never intended to supplant the work of the authorizing committee and no member ever expected reconciliation to be used to second guess the expertise of the committees the committee on post office and civil service worked hard at adopting a package of spending cuts that spread the pain and suffering in as fair a manner as possible under very difficult circumstances the grammlatta substitute amendments would not cut one dime more from the budget than the committees proposal our recommendation is a delicate combination of cutsthey must stand together let me explain what the grammlatta substitute really does it reduces the present twiceayear costofliving allowance for 3 1 million civilian and military retirees to a onceayear adjustment it also reduces the october 1 1981 federal employees pay raise from the committees recommended 5 8 percent increase to a miserly 4 8 percent the money that would be cut from the annuities of retirees and the wages of federal workers under the grammlatta substitute would be used to continue the present system of double dipping by approximately 140 000 military retirees working for the federal government the remaining 50 million saved under the grammlatta substitute would also go to continue paying federal employees dual compensation when they are on active duty with a national guard or military reserve unitan entitlement incidentally that both president reagan and omb director david stockman oppose i also oppose cutting these programs but i am more adamantly opposed to cutting the twiceayear cola for 3 1 million federal retirees evidentally there is a misconception that federal retirees are better able than others to absorb these cuts let met set the record straight on that issue one out of four federal retirees must try to live on less than 500 a month40 percent of all federal retirees struggle to make ends meet but with 700 a month fully 75 percent of all the survivors of federal retirees receive less than 6 000 a year are these the people whose benefits grammlatta wants to cut i hope not i would like to remind my colleagues that candidate ronald reagan in october of last year made a solemn promise to federal retirees to keep the present system intact this is a commitment that has now been broken the house in 1976 eliminated a 1percent sweetener for retirees and substituted for that reduction in benefits the present twiceayear system i would hope the house would not also renege on that commitment proponents of these amendments say that federal retirees are overcompensated and that social security is indexed but once a year and this amendment will bring an overgenerous system into line with other programs i would strongly disagree with that and remind my colleagues that unlike social security a federal annuity is subject to federal and state income tax i would also point out the reconciliation bill already takes more than the proverbial pound of flesh from federal benefits just review with me for a moment what is happening this year that adversely affectsthe federal sector first the reconciliation bill cuts federal pay by 3 4 billion by imposing a 5 8 percent pay cap instead of the 13 5 percent required to keep our federal work force in line with the private sector incidentally this is the fourth straight year that a federal pay cap has been imposed in the years 1970 to 1980 federal white collar pay has trailed the private sector by 20 percent and is 35 percent behind the cpi for the same period certainly we should not cut a 5 8 percent pay raise any further president reagan has also imposed a massive reduction in force on the gov ernment that would eliminate over 100 000 federal jobs in 1981 and 1982 the senate rceunciliation bill contains a proposal that would shift almost 1 billion in health care costs from the medicare program to the federal employees health benefits program according to the office of personnel management and the health carriers this will result in premium increases of up to 100 percent for federal retirees and could actually destroy the program i say enough is enough the congress and the administration should stop dumping on the federal worker and retiree or the best run government in the world will be destroyed it is no coincidence that our country narrowly averted a disastrous air traffic controllers strike only this weeka strike threat created by frustration at continued pay caps and reductions in benefits if we continue down this road of singling out the federal worker and retiree for punitive treatment these strike threats will escalate and we can say goodbye to the peaceful and hhrmonious labor relations our country has long enjoyed with the federal work force in conclusion let me remind the house of what president franklin d roosevelt said during his presidency the fundamental purpose of government is to do the greatest good for the greatest number of people i am not happy with the committees cuts but we have done the best we could to protect the greatest number of people and i therefore urge the rejection of the grammlatta substitute"],

controversy surrounding the question of mineral leasing in our nations wilderness areas was one that began when secretary watt came to head the interior department in the state of montana this is a controversy that we wrestled with long before this administration and long before the congress became involved the opening vollies in this controversy took place in montana and the first battleground was the bob marshall wilderness in early 1978 a group of 200 to 300 montanans from all walks of life gathered in missoula mont to stage a protest outside of the regional foresters office the catal t for this demonstration was the forthcoming issuing of leases for oil and gas exploration or permits for seismic activity in montanas bob marshall wilderness the bob marshall is considered by many to be the flagship of the wilderness fleet outside the federal courthouse in missoula the chants and the signs were the clear do not bomb the bobl this expression bombing the bob was in reference to the use of explosives in seismic exploration it was believed by many people at that time that any seismic activity using explosives would be extremely detrimental to not only those people seeking the wilderness experience but more importantly to the survival of wildlife at the time of that demonstration there were 343 leases for oil and gas permits pending before tom coston the regional forester in that case he was particularly ruling on a request by consolidated geophysic georex a seismic exploration company to conduct seismic activity in the bob the regional forester denied geogeorexs application saying that need was not demonstrated and that there was considerable lack of public support for any other decision that decision was automatically appealed to max peterson the head of the forest service and it is at this point that the mountain states legal foundation headed by jim watt entered the picture the washington office ruled that the regional forester had made his determination on insufficient grounds and that the decision should be sent back to the regional level for another consideration the decision went back to the regional office president reagan was elected to office and jim watt became secretary of the interior department when the secretary was appointed there were many in montana who feared for the bob marshall on may 5 1981 secretary watt in an inner office memo directed his solicitor to work to reinterpret the law regarding mineral entry into wilderness areas so that it opened wilderness areas on may 21 1981 the forest service changed its regulations to provide that wilderness designation could no longer be the basis for denying a mineral lease permit or license suddenly the direction of our government seemed clear and it was to be inevitable that the bob marshall would be the first victim recognizing that an emergency existed i asked the interior committee of which i am a member to consider withdrawing the bob marshall under an emergency provision within the federal land management policy act the interior committee agreed with my request and on may 21 1981 the committee withdrew the bob marshall from any leasing activity there were those people at that time who felt that the bob marshall was an isolated incident and that no emergency really existed but then the forest service followed with proposals to lease in wyomings washakle wilderness in californias ventana and santa lucia wildernesses and arkansas canay creek wilderness suddenly montana did not stand alone and as the late jimmy durante would say everyone wanted to get into the act it was that concern that ultimately culminated into todays consideration i only offer this brief history for two reasons one is to show that this is not a new issueit is a problem that has been discussed in the west for some time and the other is to preface the importance of observations taken from a report prepared by the interior department following the withdrawal of the bob marshall one of the things required under the federal land management policy act decision was that the interior department prepare a report addressing the emergency that prompted withdrawal since this is the only report that i know of that directly discusses the outcome of oil and gas leasing in a wilderness area i think it is important for the full house to know what its findings were as i begin this discussion i want you to note that this is a report that was prepared last year by this department of interior and discusses the question of oil and gas leasing in the bob marshall i will discuss its findings in three categories these categories comprise the most oftenasked questions about leasing in wilderness areas the first question is will leasing be detrimental to the quality of a wilderness the second question is will seismic activity be detrimental to a wilderness area and the third area most importantly is will we significantly enhance our energy standing by allowing oil and gas leasing in wilderness areas will leasing be detrimental to the quality of a wilderness the phase following exploration is actual leasing once a lease is given its holder has the right to go through to production the report by interior is clear an oil and gas leasing program could have both short and long term effects on wilderness attributes during exploration such activities as helicopter flights seismic explosions vehicle traffic and well drilling could detract from the wilderness resource noise pollution visual degradation frorp roads and drill pads and areas of concentrated human use would generally be confined to areas of drainages that are subject to exploration ac tivities particular drainages subjected to exploration activities could have their wilderness characteristics altered substantially particularly during periods when roads and heavy equipment are used during the long oil and gas production period up to 50 years a wilderness may be fragmented by numerous roads and development in its main valleys while the actual area impacted by surface disturbance would be low the remaining area may be so fragmented that some of its current wilderness value would be lost entire drainages may become unsuitable for primitive recreation use for 50 to 100 years will seismic activity be detrimental to a wilderness area on page 15 of the interior report is stated the lack of roads would require extensive use of helicopter portable techniques environmental impact during this time is primarily limited to noise pollution from hellcopters and surface explosive charges let me place this observation in perspective it is estimated that of the 800 grizzly bears left in the lower 48 states approximately 400 live in the bob marshall the lower 48s largest bighorn sheep herd about 1 000 head inhabit this area had consolidated georex geophysics been allowed to explore it would have involved 270 000 pounds of explosives along 207 miles of seismic line this would require 5 700 separate explosions 60 pounds every 150200 feet at a rate of 50100 shots a day a crew of almost 30 people would be transported back and forth by helicopters in the wilderness area for approximately 3 months i point out that this is only one company and 343 lease applications were pendingall presumably needing some seismic activities summary the conclusion seems clear both seismic and leasing activity are detrimental to any wilderness area this price will be paid with very little if any gain in energy independence i submit that the price is too dear and the areas left to explore other than wilderness areas are too many for this legislation not to be enacted this is bipartisan legislation reported by the interior committee has reported to this body this bill incorporated the concerns of many americans who testified before the interior committee not only here in washington but in many states across the west a voice that began quietly in montana has risen across this country and its statement is concise do not condemn our last wild areas to development i submit that this congress cannot turn its back on that plea i conclude my colleagues and my friends by saying that all legislative bodies including the unitedstates congress often and with great dramatics and unabashed fanfare close the barn door on an empty barn do not let it happen this time our foresight should be 2020 let me say that americans have no fight with the oil companies pat williams has no fight with the oil companies we all understand that theirs is a roughneck and a dirty and a noisy and essential business americans welcome the oil companies we want them in our houses we welcome them into our recreation rooms we want them to come into the kitchen of our

represents a substantial departure from previous economic policies of higher spending and increased taxes last november 4 the american pcopole unmistakably recognized that it was these same policies which have led to sustained doubledigit inflation high unemployment and interest rates and a slowed national productivity growth i truly believe that unless we act now to change our past economic course these statistics based on the old policies of higher spending and taxation will continue to accumulate there are two very important reasons why i urge my colleagues to support the bipartisan substitute first it will restrain federal spenlding there can be no doubt that gloverment spending has literally exploded consider these facts payment of interest on the national debt for 1982 will almost equal the entire budget expenditures for fiscal year 1961 the national debt is more likely a national disgrace as it is currently just under 1 trillion washington presently spends 22 000 every second of every day in 1970 the government spent over 196 billion today we are considering a budget of 688 billion under the grammlatta substitute or roughly over 710 billion if all other proposed substitutes are considered by adopting the grammlatta bipartisan substitute we will restrain federal spending to 6 1 percent in 1982 as compared to previous spending growth of 16 percent from 1979 to 1981 federal spending and revenues will decline to 19 3 percent of gnp by 1984 as opposed to 23 0 percent and 21 2 p~ercent presently for 1981 furthermore the grammlatta substitute proposes smaller spending levels than has been proposed by any of the other budget alternatives being considered by the house by at least 21 billion in fact spending by the grammlatta substitute is 6 5 billion smaller than spending proposed by the administration the important point is that by adopting the grammlatta bipartisan substitute federal spending will still be larger than any prior year but it will be restrained many refer to the presidents proposal as cuttig the budget when actually all he is asking for is a reduction in the amount of increased spending for each year my second reason for supporting the bipartisan effort is that it leaves room for enactment of the reagan tax reform program which provides for sufficient tax relief to peopleespecially 97 million working peopleand to businesses the burden of taxes on individuals and businesses has become oppressive in 1965 only 6 percent of all taxpayers faced marginal tax rates of 25 percent or higher today almost40 percent of all taxpayers face rates of 25 percent or more the average worker must now pay his entire salary to taxes from january 1 to may 11 the previous administration estimated that tax receipts as a share of gnp would grow to the unprecedented level of 22 8 percent by 1984 ac cording to the house budget committee report page 31 in 1981 federal receipts are projected to exceed 21 percent for the first time since 1944 oliver wendell holmes jr once wrote the power to tax is the power to destroy the economic policies of the past several years have most certainly shackled american initiative and destroyed incentives to save work and investthe fundamentals of productivity the reagan tax plan relieves this tax burden first by keeping real taxes from increasing during the next few years and second by providing the necessary incentives to american workers and businesses to turn the economy around from a nogrowth situation to one of high growth president kennedy pointed this fact out in december of 1962 in a speech before the economic club of new york an economy hampered by restrictive tax rates will never produce enough revenue to balance the budgetjust as it will never produce enough jobs or enough profits in short it is a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high today and tax revenues are too lowand the soundest way to raise revenues in the long run is to cut rates now in the same way the reagan tax plan will reinvigorate the economy by restoring incentives for savings invest ment and entrepreneurship and by renewing optimism and confidence just as the kennedy tax cuts of 1964 and 1965 did enactment of tax relief in this form recommended by the president will allow the private sector to grow rapidly enough to provide new jobs without contributing to inflation and will restore the ability of the united states to compete effectively in world markets ilet us give the american people the new beginning that they voted for and still overwhelmingly support the administrations measures as embraced by the grammlatta bipartisan substitute will provide for a longterm foundation and commitment for stable fiscal and budgetary policy the federal budget will be balanced on economic strength and prosperity not artificially through increased taxes or spending we can no longer continue policies which wait and see before taking action president reagans fourpoint comprehensive package changes these past fickle economic policies one thing is certain if only a part of the package is passed by the congress we will get only a part of the solution as president reagan addressed the nation on february 5 1981 its time to recognize that weve come to a turning point were threatened with an economic calamity of tremendous proportions and the oldbusinessasusual treatment cant save us together we must chart a different course my dear colleagues the nation is watching us will we continue to enact only slightly modified economic policies which have brought us the economic predicament we currently find ourselves in or will we listen to the american people who overwhelmingly support the presidents economic recovery program and embark on a new beginning which allows a release from economic oppression and a renewed optimism for a proud andindependent people the chqice is ours for me this choice is all too clear i urge my colleagues to vote with the american people by voting for the grammlatta bipartisan substitute by following this course of action we will embark on a true program for economic recover which will allow our country to return to its

legislative copout there is absolutely no reason that this congress cannot address the real problems facing the social security system and enact comprehensive legislation to restore the financial soundness of this program which serves one out of every seven americans the fact is that social securitys financial problems are not new these problems will not go away the program has been operating in the red for the past 8 years although we have been aware of this congress has not acted to restore the financial integrity of the system h r 4331 as it has come to us from conference falls far short of addressing the basic problems facing social security first with passage of h r 4331 the social security system will continue to accumulate deficits presently the system is losing 12 300 every single minute of every day h r 4331 does not address this fact at all i would like to ask my colleagues how many of them would invest in a system that is losing 12 300 every single minute of every day i do not think any member would voluntarily participate in a program that is operating with a daily deficit of over 17 million yet that is the very extent of the financial problem which the social security system is presently facing we are forcing 115 million working americans to pay taxes into a system that has operated in deficit for 6 years and also faces a deficit as large as 80 billion over the next 5 years second h r 4331 fails to establish a prudent level of trust fund reserve balances on which the system may rely during unanticipated occurrences throughout the past decade trust fund reserve balances have been drained until today they are at their lowest levels ever reserves as a percent of outgo at the beginning of this year just over 2 months of reserves remained in the system this greatly contrasts with the 12year reserve level of 1950 or even with the 1 year reserve level of 1970 now some may feel that it is not essential to have exactly 1 years worth of reserves in the system this point is up to dispute but one thing is certain when the system is drained down to a few months of reserves it becomes vulnerable to unanticipated fluctuations in the economy which may occur the point is that in the past it has been the high trust fund reserve balances which have seen us through unanticipated economic downturns however today with trust fund balances at their lowest level ever we no longer can depend on that cushion i question the prudence of our failure to address this problem in h r 4331 a third consideration that is neglected in this measure before us is the systems longterm deficit over the next 75 years of 1 6 1trillionthis is almost twice our national debt future beneficiaries certainly have much to be concerned about in regard to their benefits since we are aware of this defirit we should responsibly begin coruwideration of steps which insure that we may allow for a smooth phasein of any changes that may be necessary furthermore in 50 years one out of every five americans will be over 65 years of age careful consideration will have to be givenin order to meet the concerns and needs of those who will be retiring in the next century and finally h r 4331 even viewed as a quickfix fails to address the loss of public confidence in the social security system this lack of confidence has resulted ina largedegree from the periodic financial crises that have occurred a new york times cbs poll showed that 54 percent of the american people no longer believe that the social security system will have the money available to pay them the full benefits they would be entitled to at retirement for those polled 25 to 34 years of age 75 percent doubted that social security will provide full benefits for their own retirement we must provide for longterm reforms that put the system on firm financial ground in this way we can assure the 115 million contributors to the system and the present 36 milion beneficiaries that they will be able to depend on social security in their time of need as a base of financial support and so i believe it comes down to a question of congressional responsibility unfortunately congress has not acted responsibly in overseeing the social security system we have not been the protector of the program its present financial state is testimony to this as i have already stated the program has been operating in the red for 6 years although we have been aware of this congress has not acted to restore the financial integrity of the system our main objective today should be to insure the continued stability of the social security system its problems will not go away by our sweeping them under the rugand that is exactly what this bill does all we are doing is buying time time that the system does not have h r 4331 is a stopgap measure at be~st by not addressing the problems i have mentioned we are shirkingour responsibility as elected representa tives we know what the problems are we have several options from which we may chooseas advanced in the senate finance committee and the house ways and means social security subcommittee all that is lacking is our congressional action it was the congress which originally enacted social security and it is the congress which must continue to protect it as a viable financially sound social insurance system i must warn my colleagues that evasive and dilatory action cannot persist without severe consequence to millions of beneficiaries who depend upon their earned social security benefits we can be certain that by delaying our legislative decisions they will not become any easier and so i1 must oppose h r 4331 on the basis that it is not responsible legislation"], [0.512664794921875, 0.512664794921875, 0, "i yield myself such time as i may consume i want to commend the gentleman from ohio for his patience and leadership on this legislation and alsothe staff who worked very hard the legislation now before us represents a great deal of work by the interior committee to perfect and fine tune a bill which authorizes federal aid in the reconstruction of the filene center theater at wolf trap farm park in virginia the filene center was orginally built over a decade ago with private funds it and the land upon which it sits in excess of 100 acres was donated to the federal government and is now a unit of our national park system operated by the national park service as the wolf trap farm park the wolf trap foundation works in close cooperation with the national park service and the foundation is principally responsible for providing the programs scheduled for the center the entire arrangement represents a close cooperative relationship between the government and the private sector after the catastrophic fire of last april which totally destroyed the center the administration proposed legislation which embodied a partnership in cost sharing between the government and the wolf trap foundation the center would be rebuilt on a 5050 cost sharing basis h r 6875 as initialy introduced embraced this costsharing approach the legislation before us while embodying a totally new text preserves that 5050 costsharing approach however the current bill text is much more detailed in the provisions of how this partnership will work it endeavors to more precisely define responsibilities timetables construction and performance standards and later operational arrangements for the overall park including the new center itself this bill is designed to provide the best working arrangements between the government and the foundation and hopefully protects with sensitivity and care the governments financial investment a great deal of credit for the wellthoughtout details of this bill is deserved by the chairman of the subcommittee on public lands and national parks the honorable john seiberling and particularly by his staff person loretta neumann the hearings and further staff investigations brought forth a great many details of concern and the bill provisions represent an effort to deal with these matters while i believe that both the bill and the committee report quite comprehensively address most matters related to the rebuilding there are a number of matters which i believe deserve further comment a significant concern has developed with regard to possible extraneous noise intrusion problems coming upon the center and adversely affecting the performances emanating from the nearby dulles road corriderairport access and yettobe constructed toll road in order to minimize that type of problem and also to minimize the extent and cost of mitigation effort to be undertaken by the highway interests it is crucially important that the site chosen for the reconstruction of the center be located in the best location within the park to separate it as far as possible from highway noise several alternate locations have been considered but the long favored choice of the foundation is to return to the original site some 300 feet from the existing highway corridor the alternate sites are farther distance from the corr dor there has been some concern that the foundation may desire a return to the original site more on a basis of sentiment than on a basis of it factually representing the best choice with regard to the most freedom from extraneous noise conflict it is crucially important that the federal investment here be amply protected by assuring that the most noisefree site be chosen unless the difference from other sites is only marginally better and or other factors such as increased cost strongly override such a choice the language of the bill section 4 d which gives final reconstruction decisions to the secretaryparticularly as to location and designwas strengthened by the full committee to emphasize this very concern and the feeling of the committee is strong and absolute that the secretary fully and purposefully exercise his authority here to assure that the final decision as to location and design for the center is made by him with total assurance that it is in the best interests of maximum reduced conflict with extraneous noise and maximum beneficial internal acoustical properties it well may be necessary for even more noise measurements analysis and evaluations to be made beyond those already completed in order to totally assure the proper conclusion as to the best location and design the department of transportation and the federal aviation administration should check this matter very closely as well as their interests have much at stake in the final center location and design decisions they will have to arrange and pay for necessary mitigation from unacceptable noise and they should help assure the minimization of such potential conflict and difficulties by assuring that the final reconstruction site is the best correlated to minimal noise conflict the final point i wish to make has to do with the cooperative relationship between the national park service and the wolf trap foundation which is so essential for the optimum operation of the overall park the bill provides for a cooperative agreement to constitute the basic document for setting forth this relationship and such an agreement is already in place at the moment and is working among other essential ingredients it is important that any new agreement address such subjects as both entities keeping each other totally informed of the others septemberf0 1982 planned public activities for the park in a timely manner the disposition and handling of food service and similar typically concession type operations the responsibility of all operational costs for all aspects of the park and the proper financial separation of the foundations parkrelated operations from its nonpark operations as it relates to the overall wolf trap farm park operation in regard to the latter it is important that the foundations operation of nonpark properties such as the barns be properly financially and otherwise separated from its governmentrelated wolf trap farm park operations to the extent there are current questions or problems related to these types of matters the

notwithstanding none of the provisions relating to revenues not one is a part of any bill reported to the house by the committee on ways and means not one what is more or perhaps i should say what is less the house not only did not originate this tax bill but we have not even reviewed it studied it considered amendments or modified it in any way in the house or in the committee charged with jurisdiction to which dor some reason the senate bill sporting the purloined house number was referred most of the public debate so far has dealt with the broad general issues of public policy and revenue aggregates very little has focused on the specific provisions of the billand for good reason after all how can any news or editorial account deal with more than three or four issues at a time there are over a hundred important changes in the tax code scattered through nearly700 pages of this bill the outlines available until today could not describe all the ramifications of these hundred provisions most members are aware of the issue of withholding on dividends and interest but few know that the same will apply to pension benefits in the rush to rescue the former no care was exercised on behalf of the latter as for failure of some to report such income and pay taxes on it all that was required was to impose stricter reporting requirements with triplicate 1099 forms to be attached to your federal and state tax returns just like your w2 that would have garnered half the revenue of this provision beyond that withholding is another way to take money directly out of the savings pool is that going to strengthen our economy another provision which directly damages the business recovery is the doubling of the unemployment tax levied on employers this is not needed to finance the extra weeks of benefits for that is covered by another tax on unemployment benefits but small businesses and other employers in laborintensive industries like our textiles will be severely damaged by doubling the tax it is another higher fixed cost which must be pai even when you are unprofitable no wonder the national federation of independent business is against this bill 7 to 1 because of this one measure there is another provision though that is even worse for them and their employees that is the package of changes to severely restrict pension funds the senate bill was more modest dealing only with limiting the tax benefits for very highincome individuals and limiting the amount they could borrow from their own pension fund the conference report went much further it will seriously impact 92 percent of all 600 000 pension plans in this country it will terminate an estimated onethird of them that is worse than erisa those that survive will have to file extensive amendments and reports at a cost of 2 5 billion that is probably the worst achievement of the bill then there is the severe erosion of the recently enacted accelerated de predation incentives the biggest change is the cancellation of changes now scheduled for 1986 and 1987 raising 28 billion in those 2 years alone ironically if that is an adequate word this major change will produce dhly 1 billion in the 3 years of the budget resolution to which this tax bill is a response this will levy 20 billion a year in the outyears in order to boost the first 3 years collections by a mere 1 percent no wonder the business community is unhappy with this bill this gives them unappreciated deceleration instead next on my list is the doubled excise tax on cigarettes this was done we are told to avoid levying any similar tax increase on whiskey wine beer or even cigars all these were exempted one product was singled out as the fall guy dont tax you dont tax me go tax the fellow behind that tree yet instead of a 100percent tax increase on cigarettes alone just a 25percent increase spread over the whole group of products would have afforded the same revenue at a lighter burden on any one no wonder those of us in the southeastern tobacco states are opposed to this unfair provision we have been told by house conferees that they did not need our votes for this bill that we were isolated and that we would stay that way another unheralded but damaging provision is that dealing with completed contract accounting the intent is fair to tax the earlyyear profits on a multiyear contract the gentleman from south carolina pointed out that it would be unfair to require such a contractor who had not yet been paid to have to borrow money to pay the tax on earnings not yet received he was right his amendment to correct this was disregarded then there is the unhappy insurance industry lured at first to endorse a tax of 1 billion on their business they helped design a way to do it without disrupting the competitive balance between stock companies and mutual companies this bill overreaches that mark and does disrupt that balance yet they gamely support the bill for fear they will be treated worse if they do not my colleagues these are not trivial little parts of this tax bill these seven provisions make up 38 billion worth or about 40 percent of the 98 billion total there

greatly needed to address a very serious and unique west coast problem which if it is not rectified soon could result in grave economic and environmental consequences for the area involved in connection with our water resources subcommittees july hearings on the clean water act the subcommittee received a detailed statement on the nature of the problems being addressed in this bill therefore in the interests of time i will only attempt to summarize the situation here today two nearly identical pulp mills are located 1 mile apart on a spit of land between the pacific ocean and humboldt bay just west of the northern california town of eureka both mills discharge their effluent into deep pacific ocean waters in an area of strong currents and turbulent conditions through separate outfalls about a halfmile long for more than 6 years the mills have been seeking administrative relief from the need to install unnecessary additional waste treatment facilities in 1977 the state of californias water quality control board following similar action by the states north coast regional water quality control board granted the very limited relief being sought by the mills in so doing the state board concluded among other things thatin summary it has been clearly shown in this particular case that neither the discharge of bod nor ph for which modifications were being sought results in a discernible impact or a threat of damage to the marine development the board further determined thatbased on the record before us we must conclude that there do not appear to be any environmental benefits which will be derived by requiring these dischargers to meet the guideline limitations for bod or ph unfortunately even though california had been delegated npdes program management responsibilities epa reversed the states decision on the grounds that california had no statutory authority to issue water quality based permit modifications for dischargers such as these that epa decision was subsequently upheld in the courts i believe it is important at this point to call to my colleagues attention a number of important facts related to some of the agency and judicial decisions that created the need for this legislation taken together i believe that they illustrate quite well the kind of problem these two mills have been facing for more than 6 years they also illustrate that the mills inability to receive a variance justified by serious and unique adverse nonwater quality environmental consequences should clearly be viewed as an unintended result in reaching its decision to approve the mills variance applications the california water quality control board noted that the dischargers presented extensive evidence both before the regional board and before the state board that there are no adverse environmental effects associated with the mills discharges the board noted testimony given by the executive director of the regional board that he knew of no evidence that indicates that in the case of these two discharges bod is a problem it also likewise noted with respect to ph that there is no evidence in the record to dispute the dischargers allegation that the high or low ph of their discharges causes no problem when diffused into seawater under these circumstances the state board reasoned thatin this case we have unrefuted evidence presented by the dischargers and concurred with by the regional board executive officer that the existing discharges result in no water quality problems second there is no expected or predictable water quality improvement to be achieved as the result of imposition of the epa guidelines in light of these facts the magnitude of the chemical and energy requirements and the potential air and land management problems asrelated with sludge disposal we can only conclude the evidence justifies the variance requested in appraising the evidence related to the nonwater quality environmental effects and energy requirements partly in terms of the potential environmental benefits to be gained as a result of the imposition of the epa guidelines the state board subjected its variancegranting decision to epa challenge on the grounds that a lack of effect on receiving water quality is not a legally permissible justification for granting a variance under the clean water act and its implementing regulations epas consideration of the state boards decision was limited to the narrow legal question of whether water quality considerations are valid grounds for variances from effluent limitations based upon best practicable technology the administrator concluded thatwhere the state board erred was in finding grounds for variances on the basis of nonwater quality environmental impacts because the board found these impacts to be the basis for variances when weighed against or considered in light of the lack of environmental improvement the administrator also clearly stated however that he was not finding that the state could not had it properly interpreted the act have found fundamental difference with regard to nonwater quality environmental inpact his statement was unequivocal i have not independently reviewed the factual record i therefore express no opinion as to whether the two mills could be found fundamentally different in terms solely of nonwater quality environmental impact this is a matter properly addressed in the first instance by the state the matter is further complicated by procedural questions related to the adequacy of the record used by epa to reach its decision the refusal of epa to grant the companies a hearing and other matters suffice it to say that by the time the pulp mills had exhausted their appellate rights with respect to the very narrow legal question at issue the possibility of receiving administrative relief for the pulp mills situation had become sufficiently clouded to warrant pursuing a legislative solution the mills therefore are faced with the following problems installation of the additional treatment facilities could cost as much as 15 million each in capital and another 1 to 2 million in additional annual operations and maintennance costs the costs of compliance however are not just dollar costs as alluded to earlier they also include significant environmental costs related to odor and other air pollution effects difficulties with state coastal conservation efforts and extremely difficult sludge disposal problems in light of this situation a coalition of industry environmental consumer local government and citizen groups has been working together for almost a year to attempt to assist the mills in finding the relief they seek support has come from the redwood chapter of the sierra club the northcoast environmental centera coalition of 12 environmental organizationsthe arcata and eureka chambers of commerce and numerous other local organizations and citizens resolutions have been adopted by the humboldt county board of supervisors the humboldt bay municipal water districts and the eureka city council urging relief for the mills the strong preference of most of the members of the coalition and my strong preference would have been to find an administrative solution to the problem unfortunately however for reasons already alluded to it does not appear that such an approach is feasible therefore in order for the mills to receive the relief they seek a legislative solution is necessary and that is what is being proposed in h r 7159 this bill has been crafted very carefully to limit its application to the very specialized kind of problem and unique set of circumstances i have described to you it has been drafted in a narrow strict and environmentally responsible fashion and is modeled after the clean water acts section 301 h with in my opinion additional safeguards to assure that the areas resources and the waters receiving the effluent are adequately protected h r 7159

addresses what we believe is a totally unique situation and it is meant to be and do nothing more the technical amendment that accompanies the bill is just thatpurely technical it is designed to avoid any interpretation of the bills paragraph a which would enable a discharger to qualify for the relief this provision provides on the theory that the state concerned had a permit program equivalent to the federal section 402 program on or before march 17 1977 in order to do this we have added langnage to make it clear that like california the state concerned must have actually received authority under 402 b from the federal environmental protection agency by that date i am hopeful and confident that the need for h r 7159 is apparent and that the solution contained in the bill is appropriate a great deal of effort has been expended to develop the consensus that exists in support of this bill with compromises having to be made by all of the competing interests involved in order to find an

ability to projert conventional force in strategic spots around the world we have underspent on training spare parts ammunition operations and maintenance i am pleased that this bill deals effectively

if you vote for my contract or to keep my base open ill vote for yours works only to the detriment of our genuine defense needs and has led to the underfunding of readiness that i have already described these practices have led not only to overspending but to putting money in the wrong places the unglamorous side of defensereadinessgives way to the glamorous state of the art procurement project while readinesstraining spare parts ammunition supplies operations and maintenance take a back seat everyone loves to take the well of the house to display a model of a new plane or missile when what we really need are more bullets and more hours of training we must also understand that defense spending cannot be infinite and that cost issues simply must be addressed our gnp is only so great and if we are going to make the investments necessary to expand itwhether they be in physical plants education scientific research job training energy development or the assurance to our citizenry at large that their participation in this effort will not result in destitution and wantthen we cannot in the short run expand our defense effort to the point where these other needs which are also necessary to our ultimate national security are neglected ultimately a healthy economy is more critical to our national security than the level of defense spending i had planned to offer an amendment today that reduced the totals appropriated in this~ bill for procurementexcept spare parts repair parts and ammunitionand r d by 3 percent i understand the gentleman from georgia will be offering a similar amendment at the 2 percent level and i have decided to support his effort i proposed my amendment because i feel the emphasis by the administration on procurement will beggar the unitedstates treasury bankroll costly unnecessary procurement programs and ultimately starve the most crucial areas of defense spending those relating to military readiness without making choices in determining our mix of strategic gadgetry the pentagon will ultimately be forced into the timehonored means of cutting defense costs chipping away at 0 m already we have seen the beginnings of this the centerpieces of the reagan defense package are the very costly bi and mx and the slight cutbacks in defense spending have come in 0 m i would like to focus on one area of defensestrategic nuclear forceswhere we as a nation must make some choices until recently our defense system has been based on the simple theory that a triad of nuclear retaliatory forces seabased airbased and landbasedwould stretch the soviets weapon systems thin but the unitedstates strategic forces is now working on a pentad not a triad we have five nuclear responses going landbased icbms submarinelaunched ballistic missiles slbms manned penetrating bombers airlaunched cruise missiles and sealaunched cruise missiles i particularly question the mx missile first a fixedsite missile makes no sense as a second strike weapon as former secretary of defense harold brown said recently all fixedsite targets will be vulnerable by the end of this decade second hardening existing silos to 5 000 psi will not make the mx invulnerable because slight increases in soviet missile accuracy or payload greatly offset increased hardness as does an increase in the number of warheads deployed against a site as was the case with the racetrack basing mode proposed by president carter absent the ratification of salt ii the hardened silo basing mode is simply not survivable consequently we still lack a credible mx basing mode and it is hard to see how one can design the missile itself without knowing its basing mode do we really want to spend 1 9 billion on a missilewhose predecessor was justified only under the terms of salt iibut whose current incarnation is supposedly justified only by the abandonment of salt 11 though i think there is a much better case for the bi thani for the mx on balanceand with some hestationi have decided that i cannot support the bi the basic case for a manned penetrating bomber is that after the soviets have fired a first round at our missile sites and we have responded the soviets will have mobile targets against which only manned penetrating bombers will be effective pla~inly the bi would be better for this mission than the b52 to some degree because of its smaller radar profile to a larger extent because it requires shorter runways than does the b52 and so theoretically could be dispersed over many more airports than could the b52s thus presenting more targets than soviet first strike capability could handle yet as a practical matter it is hard to conceive a nuclear war scenario under which the b1 with nuclear weapons would actually get to all those small town airports to fly again in any organized response against the soviets i am also troubled by the secretary of defenses own admission that the first bi squadron will not be ready to fly until 1987 but will not be able to penetrate soviet air defenses past 1989 or 1990 i strongly believe we should be focusing on cruise missiles and improving the accuracy and command control of slbms while the soviets can probably ultimately defend hardened small sites against cruise missiles the expense ratio is probably in our favor and they seem the best way of closing whatever short run window of vulnerability may exist in the long run it appears that the soviets have more of window of vulnerability than we because of the vulnerability of any fixedbased missiles on which the soviets have relied heavfl1y and our lead in slbms and submarine hiding and detection in fact unitedstates superiority in this area should make us invulnerable for many years to come to close let me repeat that we must make choices in our procurement of strategic weaponry failure to do so will harm our actual defense posture by starving 0 m not to mention as well as the unitedstates treasury i believe the best choices for elimination are the mx missile and the bi bomber i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting improved defense readiness while making some effort to eliminate the pork barrel approach to

strong support for the provision requiring the construction of flood protection along the upper cumberland river and i would like to commend the gentlemen from mississippi massachusetts alabama and indiana for their effective efforts in bringing this bill through conference the upper cumberland provision is of vital importance both to the physical safety of entire communities in my district as well as to my districts economic development i would like to describe the flooding problems we have faced and why it is that the provisions in this bill are so important southeastern kentucky has been plagued by severe flooding from time immemorial we have steep mountains which cause rapid runoffs these runoffs are made especially treacherous by the fact that we have very narrow valleys valleys which constrict the flow of the water and we have next to no warning of these floods since the mountains prevent the accurate forecasting and warning systems which are possible in other parts of the country and the hazards of this flooding are greatly magnified by the fact that many families live right along the river banks with the severe lack of level land most families and business es have no choice but to build along the rivers and this places them right in the track of the rushing waters in 1977 all of these threats and all of these geologic and hydrologic factors turned into cold reality with the worst flood on record along many por tions of the upper cumberland tug fork and levisa rivers barbourville ky was the scene of heroism which is rare in this day and age despite the rapidly rising waters and despite the personal danger they faced many couragious citizens stayed behind to pile sandbags on top of the levees their heroic efforts succeeded in keeping the torrential waters from flooding through the streets of barbourville pineville ky was not so fortunate all the protection they had simply was not good enough as the townspeople looked on the waters came rushing over the floodwalls into the town into their homes and into their businesses over the next tense hours volunteers rescued stranded men and women including many senior citizens from rooftops and car tops families found shelter in the local hospital and in the coming days and weeks they returned to their homes and businesses to start the backbreaking work of cleaning up the sediment which averaged about half a foot deep and which covered most of the town the damage was staggering immediate estimates were at least 27 million in damages nine hundred homes were destroyed or severely damaged property owners were forced into longterm debtdebt which continues to burden these communities property values plummeted and tax bases were de pleted and perhaps worst of all the flood added yet another burden to the backs of these communities which are trying so hard to help themselves in an area which has long suffered from chronic underdevelopment they have been striving to attract more businesses and jobs to the area this newest flood dashed many of those hopes in view of this record documenting the clearcut need for flood protection along the upper cumberland the congress specifically appropriated funds for the construction of flood protection but despite the black and white instructions in the law we have faced roadblock after roadblock in the construction of our flood protection first bureaucratic delays prevented any construction during fiscal year 1982despite the fact that funds had been appropriated specifically for that purpose and second the corps decided not to build the normal standard project flood protection protection to cover the worst flood that could reasonably be expected in an area but to build protection only just high enough to cover a flood of the magnitude of the flood of 1977 these proposals were altogether unacceptable and i am delighted that language has been included in the bill to correct them first the bill requires the fiscal year 1982 funds included in the energy and water appropriations act for fiscal year 1982 to be obligated still during this fiscal year i wholeheartedly applaud this clear unequivocable and unmistakeable instruction requiring the corps to proceed with construction without any further delay if we are going to build flood protection let us get on and build it every indication is that flooding is going to continueand will probably occur even more frequently in years to come and when those flood waters come rushing down the mountains and are ebbing toward the top of the floodwalls the men and women in my district are going to need more than studles more than promises and more than good will to save themthey are going to need fullfledged flood protebtion and nothing less will do them any good a second important provision in this bill requires the corps to construct the flood protection at the standard project flood level this is exactly the blunt message we have needed to set the record straight it is the intention of the congress to give the communities along the upper cumberland river full and complete flood protection and protection just to the flood of 1977 level is simply not good enough as the corps has stated in its own documents flooding in this region is sure to continueand it may even worsen as the region is developed while i respect the need to reduce federal spending any marginal savings in this case would be more than wiped out by even one major overtopping flood and where human health and life is concerned as is the case here there can be no excuse for pinching pennies in addition protection to the level of the flood of 1977 is absolutely inadequate to allow the economic develop ment of this area it would not free local communities from the flood insurance requirements it would prevent these communities from ever building on their few acres of level land most of which are located along the river banks thereby condemning them to continued economic stagnation and it would deny these communities any opportunity to attract businesses to the area a step which is essential if these communities are ever to help themselves the provisions in this bill give my district the life lease it desperately needs it will give us a foundation for the economic development of this whole region along the upper cumberland it will give hundreds of families the assurance that they can sleep without fear even when they hear a forecast for rain if a man were standing beneath a rushing tidal wave we would not suggest a study of his plight if a man were drowning we would not saw his lifeboat in half but this has been exactly the plight of these communities in my district when each day they wondered what new roadblock had been placed ahead of their flood protection the provisions in this bill give us the relief we need i commend my distinguished colleagues from alabama and indiana for their efforts in working with the other body to secure this effective and badly needed provision and i urge the sup port of my colleagues"], [0.511568546295166, 0.511568546295166, 0, "i would point out to my colleagues that i have seldom taken time on the floor by way of a special order but it occurred to me last week as the american public was watching the house struggle with our budget crisis and as president reagan after writig for several months for the leadership of this house to respond regarding his proposals for a budget went the extra mile in an effort to compromise only to have that budget compromise fall apart the country was left in a stalemate and in a circumstance that absolutely undermines our ability to turn about our economyand then as the speaker when discussing the matter with the press indicated that the real reason for the stalemate was a fundameltal philosophical difference between himself and president reagan and his administrationit seemed to me it was about time that some of us came before the american public to talk about our problems as they really are as a practical fact of life the american public in the last election finally had had enough of business as usual they rifled a message by way their ballot boxes and told us in the congress that it was time to get off that 25year pattern of spending and spending and more spending and a rate of growth of government that had gotten to the point where literally uncle sam needed to go on a diet the american public told this congress that no longer could we afford to be moving down that path toward more than a trillion dollar national debt we have reached a point where there is a good deal of talk about a 125 billion deficit for a single year the figures range between 90 and 180 billion depending on which statistician is talking the public recognizes the heart of the problem the fact is that just the interest on that national debt costs us nearly that entire 125 billion without the interest on that national debt we would have a balanced budget with president reagans program of last year i think it is about time that the american public join with us and ask this one question if indeed the leadership of this house does not agree with the reagan proposals for the 1983 budget for 1984 and 1985 then they have a grave responsibility to come before all of us and give us a clear picture of their alternative what is their alternative their alternative is very simple it is to once again go back to their business as usual that is more spending at the federal level more taxes and less defense for lack of a better term i thought it would be worthwhile to call that tip onomics for that is their proposal to proceed on the same path that has taken us to the point where we face economic crisis let us go back a bit and take a look at a few of the fact that are a part of recent history it is significant for us to remember that in 1976 when the majority party in this house the democrats led by the same leadership had control of the house of representatives and the senate but not the presidency at that point the interest rate was only 6 35 percent compared to a high 4 years later of almost 21 percent after they controlled both houses and the presidency it is critical for us to understand that when jimmy carter was elected president the consumer price index was at 5 8 percent and it rose ill the way to a high of 13 5 percent at the end of his administration the deficit pattern continued the economy began to go on the rocks and as a result of it the money markets expressed their lack of trust in the kind of leadership we were experiencing in this house that pushed intergst rates to that 21 percent high then there was a change in 1980 the president suggested we begin a modernday revolution he suggested the following steps first of all we must get on a path that would put our economic house in order and the way to begin is to recognize what every american family understands you cannot overspend your income year in and year out without eventually having to pay the piper as a practical fact of life the president recognized that time was running out and the first step that is necessary to turn that corner is to begin to trim back the rate at which government had been growing so president reagan took the jimmy carter proposals for 1982 and trimmed program after program i think it is important for all of us to recognize that in virtually every one of those instances where he was cutting back it was not a matter of cutting the actual dollars spent on those programs the year before it simply reduced the growth on the part of many of those programs that had been around and were exploding to higher levels each fiscal year the reductions were an effort to begin to bring responsibility to our spending patterns now at another level the president suggested that the people were fed up with unnecessary redtape and unnecessary regulation at the national level the president himself imposed absolutely astonishing changes in those agencies where he has direct executive control he eliminated some 3 000 pages of redtape that were unnecessary and represented new regulations the president itterally with his own pencil began to turn the corner on regulatory reform mr and mrs america can tell us if we have not been listening that when they go down to a big government office when they have got a problem too often the person across the desk wants to treat them like a number it is regulation impersonality big government not caring about people but just caring about their own programs the president was saying that it is about time that uncle went on a diet another part of the revolution was to suggest that we actually ought to begin or that we actually could begin going in a direction wherebywe took less and less of the average americans takehome pay for paying the bills of government virtually the president sponsored an economic program that cut tax rates across the board over a 3year period for every american family the point was this historically around congress we have enjoyed just before election time increasing a program here or there giving a new kind of wrinkle to any number of general category aid programs and then we decide even though the benefits are going to be sent out before election time that there is no way to pay for that now the president said nonsense from this point on the federal government is going to have to pay for it first in the past we had gotten used to giving some kind of a tax break just before the election as well it is easy enough to give a tax break say to some industry for instance in depreciation and then the following year after election if you think you do not have enough revenue to go in and eliminate that tax break because there are not too many constituents actually affected the reagan program reduced taxes for 35 million american families and indeed in the future with marginal tax rates in place it is going to be very difficult for democrats or others to increase those taxes again so at this point in time the leadership is attempting to eliminate that income tax break for all americans before it really is felt out there last year there was a little piece of it one and onefourth percent that few could even begin to feel in actual disposable income but they want to eliminate the future before it is in place because they know they will have a revolution on their hands if they try to raise taxes once the people get the tax break in their pockets tip onomics is designed to communicate to the average citizen what the goals of democratic economic policies actually are but we must be willing to ask this question why does this leadership insist upon continuing down the path of business as usual it is simple it is because the leadership of this house believes that every problem must be solved by a new government program or a bigger government program they actually believe it philosophically if you believe that then you probably will be supporting that kind of a pattern of government if you do not believe that then you must recognize this the leadership of the houseand i believe even including the speakerwhile they are very sincere is composed of democrats who are out of contact with the broad cross section of the american public democrats and republicans alike the democrats in my district do not want more government the democrats in my district are convinced that they are taxed enoughif not too much indeed the democrats in my district believe that it is long overdue for america to lead in the world and to lead from a position of strength not to be in a position of having less defense more spending higher taxes less defense that is tip onomics that is business as usual last week the president came before us once again when the compromise fell apart he asked each and every one of us to communicate our concerns to members of the house the reason that that message was most important is because of the reality that all 435 members of this house are running for reelection every 2 years the time to begin to communicate to them about this coming election is right now it is also fundamental to realize that we are in a circumstance at the moment that may very well be the turning in the crossroads as of this moment we are living with the reality that nobody said it was going to be easy when you have been on a path of 40 years of terrible economic policies of overspending of causing our children and grandchildren to be indebted for much of their lifetime it ik not easy to tu rn that around and there is bound to be some pain that is a part of it but just as important on the other side of that is the fact that there are so many things happening out there that will make a difference there is beginning to develop a softening of interest rates in the money markets i personally am convinced that we are just on the edge of pushing those high interest rates down it is basic for americans to realize this we had a high of 21 5 percent and those were the interest rates when president reagan came into office today they are approximately 16 5 percent that is better but not good enough but there is evidence that the pressures are on to begin to move those rates down do my colleagues remember a year ago none of us could hardly talk about another thing besides the inflation rate the best kept secret in the vorld is that inflation is no longer a problem the inflation rate at this point for the first 3 months of this year are running at an annual rate of 1 percent a huge reduction in the inflation as a result of sound economic policies beginning to be put into place above and beyond that it is fundamental for us to realize that there is new money flowing out there in the private marketplace which will provide tremendous opportunities for new investment new productivity and for jobs nobody said it was going to be easy it takes time for those programs to begin to have an impact but next i think it is basic for us to understand that the major roadblock at this moment to allowing those interest rates to really begin to decline is the fact that the money markets and others are waiting for us to demonstrate that we actually are going to come to a compromise that makes sense out of the 1983 budget a compromise that says that we can work together and the democrats and the republicans alike want to move in the direction of making sense out of our budget so in turn our economy can respond it is my view there are at least some of those within the leadership of this house those democrats who are not in touch with the american public the registered voter out there democrat or republican leaders in this house who actually do not want to see a compromise they want to see a stalemate continued because some actually cynically believe that if you leave the economy in chaos then come november that means extra victories for the majority party in this house extra victories that will allow them to continue the kind of control they have had for over 25 years extra victories that will allow them to continue business as usual remember uncle needs a diet and tip onomics means business as usual more government spending more taxes and less defense"], [0.511376678943634, 0.511376678943634, 0, "may i first begin by encouraging the gentleman from pennsylvania to participate in this special order as a fellow member who had a similar experience as i did over the past several weeks recently public attention has been focused on the growing economic political and social struggles in central america especially those in el salvador and nicaragua much of this public debate had been shaped by reports from several visiting congressmen and an international press corps that has been accused of sloppy if not biased reporting few people can claim to be an expert on the complex sociopolitical equation that frames this continuing drama a few hundred miles south of the border i did not believe that in the space of 5 days i would become an expert on the situation in central america but i did feel that i could formulate my approach to the debate on unitedstates policy that clearly lay ahead both more responsibly and more effectively if i acquired firsthand knowledge of the relevant issues i arrived in el salvador on february 17 with three principal concerns first is the turmoil in el salvador a political quagmire in which the united states might become militarily bogged down second was the salvadoran government making significant progress in controlling the human rights violations that had appalled unitedstates citizens and earned international condemnation third to what degree are the cuban and nicaraguan regimes supporting the salvadoran rebels as i see it the challenges we face is to synthesize the answers to those three questions in order to determine how the united states might foster a free and democratic system in el salvador without involving the unitedstates military i am disturbed by the partisan and prejudiced propaganda that emerges from both the left and the right on this issue and i seek to identify a path of accommodation not surprisingly i returned after this 6day trip with more questions than answers but i will insist on dispassionately posing those questions until credible answers emerge from the unitedstates foreign policy crucible in el salvador we were both well received and well treated by the government of president napoleon duarte we met with president duarte with defense minister guillermo garcia with unitedstates ambassador deane hinton with gen wallace h nutting and with leaders of the church and business community we took advantage of the presidents offer to travel wherever we pleased by visiting the village of san antonio abad and the mariona prison where many of the political prisoners of the government are currently held in san salvador i was favorably impressed by the sincerity and commitment of president duarte i believe that he enjoys broad support among his people and that he will continue to implement his popular program of political and economic reform he stressed however that the constituent assembly elections scheduled for march 28 are a critical element to the restoration of democracy in el salvador a position with which i strongly concur my favorable impression of the civilian government however is in contrast to my perception of el salvadors military leadership few of the military leaders with whom i met seem to embrace the democratic ideals of president duarte i believe that this attitude was largely responsible for the apparent coverup of human rights violations which i will discuss later furthermore as a result of my private meeting with president duarte i concluded that the military is not representing the will of the civilian government for example when i confronted president durate with the informal weapons requests which had been made earlier in the day by defense minister garcia he was shocked and he assured me that such a massive allocation of military aid was totally unnecessary the defense minister had informally requested enough helicopters to move 2 000 soldiers which i calculated would require the transfer of more than 180 helicopters the president on the other hand maintained that he needed only 10 or fewer helicopters at the present time as i met with government and military leaders i concentrated on the three concerns which i wished to confront and i think the issues began to come into focus i found that drawing analogies with the sequence of events that led us down the path toward extended involvement in vietnam were inescapable but for each similarity there were dozens of significant differences in vietnam there was a war of reunification between north and south vietnam in el salvador however it is a war of political and class division in vietnam the most dominant national figure was certainly ho chi minh the primary leader of the north in el salvador the most popular national figure is more than likely napoleon duarte himself americas ally in vietnam unitedstates troops were demanded by the governments we supported while in el salvador i was pleased to learn that unitedstates troops are neither required nor requested in fact they have been adamantly refused by no less a figure then defense minister garcia himself the 11st of differences between vietnam and el salvador can continue at some greater length but suffice it to say that the salient point is that we should learn lessons from our past involvement in vietnam but we must not allow this partial analogy to obscure our view of the reality the human rights question is equally difficult to fathom not only because one quickly concludes that both generals and guerrillas alike often distort the truth but because the question is shaped by historical and socio logical tradition as much as by current day standards of military professionalism nevertheless i could not help feeling that general garcias military forces exercised far too much autonomy and freedom from review judicial or otherwise in el salvador the local commanders especially in rural areas outside of the main cities have an au thoritarian power that transcends civilian control especially in the smaller areas distant from the oversight of the common commanders in el salvador we accepted the tragedy of san antonio abad as exemplary of the confusion that often surrounds alleged violations of human rights perpetrated in a war torn area and in light of this i sought to discern the truth about what occurred there i visited this town and heard the stories of local residents that on one night this past january members of the salvadoran armed forces dragged citizens from their homez and systematically murdered them those whose familie had been visited in the night retrieved the bodies of their lifeless relatives the next morning from a stack of 20 ii 918 when we confronted general garcia with this gruesome tale he and his lieutenants denied that the murders were systematic and offered another versionof the events he insisted that his soldiers surrounded the town in hopes of locating a guerrilla stronghold he contended that the soldiers were fired upon in the middle of the night and in the ensuing battle 20 civilians were caught in the crossfire we were shocked by the difference between the two stories and impressed by the difficulty of discerning the truth the most conclusive evidence however was contributed by a unitedstates embassy official who had viewed the bodies at the morgue and determined that most were shot in the back of the head at close range this story discredited the version of colonel palacios and general garcia and damaged their credibilit and the credibility of the military in el salvador at least in my eyes i concluded that the salvadora i military cor inand does not have ontrol over its frontlines forces and therefore cannot prevent further violations of the human rights of its citizens at this time i believe however that president duarte is dedicated to harnessing this traditionally uncontrollable military machine and will do what he can to correct the situation if we provide him the encouragement and the incentive to do so it is already clear that the tough international scrutiny to which general garcia is subjected is bringing him to the realization that he must clean up his act however i should point out that there are continuing violations of human rights equauy egregious from the left in el salvador those of us who hiar arguments that the revolutionary left must be supported ask back what evidence do we have to suggest that their civilian leadership can control their military were they in power there are clear examples of dramatic violations of human rights by the guerrillas stories which are equally hard to believe and which demand full scrutiny by unitedstates press public and politicians allfe on february 20 i left el salvador for nicaragua with the hope that i might be able to address my third concorn regarding the provision of aid for the rebels in el salvador by the nicaraguan government by cuban sources and of course by the soviets as well i also sought to identify a course of action of unitedstates foreign policy that might strengthen the democratic strains in that country and at the same time diminish the antagonisms which are clearly growing between the united states and nicaragua during our stay i met with comandante daniel ortega the leader of the ruling sandinista junta in nicaragua but also i met with alfonso robelo the leader of the opposition party in nicaragua and with enrique dreyfus a business leader who only 2 days before our arriv1 had been released from a cruel extended detainment in the managua prison i also met with church officials and others both within the sandinista ruling junta and without my visit unfortunately was framed by a background of strident antiamerican rhetoric due in part to the public commemoraton of the death of augusto sandino who i learned was the founder of the sandinista movement while i recognize that a residue of antiamerican sentiment might be expected in a country in which we have been so directly involved in past decades i was dismayed shocked and terrifiod to discover that this hatred is being perpetuated and employed by the government as a distraction for the masses from the obvious shortcomings of their owri political rule in meeting with the leaders of the sandinista regime i encountered an unwillingness on their part wo diminish their belligerent accusations leveled against the united states and i concluded that the sandinista government clearly prefers to tilt in fact overwhelmingly tilt toward the soviet union and cuba i asked daniel ortega comandante suppose i go back to the united states and somehow the unitedstates congress can be persuaded to change dramatically its relationship with nicaragua to take steps that would lead to a restoration of economic aid and to a guarantee of no external military intervention what then could i say to the unitedstates people to our congress that you would be willing to do in return would you for example be willing to say that you would not allow the soviets to build an air force base in nicaragua would you be persuaded to discourage nicaraguan support for other revolutionary movements in central america sadly i report that comandante ortega said no to all my offers for compromise while the sandinistas did enjoy broad support at the inception of their rule it is clear that this support is quickly eroding i was told that the original sandlnista movement was supported by almost 95 percent of the people of nicaragua 3 years ago but just last month i was informed that today only a third of the people in nicaragua support the course that country is following the sandinista government has lost the confidence of the middle class and the leadership of the catholic church just a week before my arrival all seven bishops of the catholic church in nicaragua condemned the sandinistas for t lie ruthless forced resettlement ol the miskito indians and the killing of innocent miskito indians who were unwilling to cooperate with the government in this resettlement program both the church and the middle class are condemning this government for its repression and sadly they have become the new victims of the sandinistas rhetorical abuse as a result i found my interview with enrique dreyfus and alfonso robelo particularly enlightening both of these leaders confirmed allegations that the repressive policies of the sandinista regime have caused a marked decrease in the popularity of the government i found the violations of human rights in nicaragua to be no less reprehensible than those in el salvador though obviously i recognize that the actual loss of life due to those violations and due to the continuing war in el salvador is considerably l ater i am particularly outraged however by the suffering that these miskito indians are enduring at the hands of the government the sandinistas have systematically relocated jailed and caused great suffering to thousands of indians in the northeast section of nicaragua we heard numerous reports about indians who lost their lives at the hands of government soldiers when the congressional delegation requested an opportunity to travel to the riverfronts along the coco river where these villages have been burned and where massacres allegedly have taken place we were flatly denied the chance to make a visit this is in clear contrast to our experience in el salvador where the duarte government allowed us a free rein and a free passport throughout the country my visit to managua clearly demonstrated the broad extent of cubas involvement in that country a role that neither the sandinist as nor the cubans seem to deny although mr ortega did not discuss the nicaraguan role in supplying the rebels in el salvador both mr dreyfus and mr rubelo confirmed that the transfer of military assistance is extensive this trip left me with a great many impressions that i needed to assess i had no doubt however about the need of our government to act fairly and decisively in an effort to bring peace and democracy to central america both to left and right wing governments following are several of my recommendations i believe that president duarte and the political and economic reforms he has implemented deserve our continuing support because the constitutent assembly elections scheduled for march 28 are a critical element of president duartes plan to restore democracy to his country we must affirm our belief in the importance of these elections and strive to insure that they are fair and representative attainment of this goal will be more feasible if we enlist the support of our nato and other latin american allies in overseeing the voting process this support of free elections should be accompanied by negotiations aimed at involving as many political groups as realistically possible in the government as has been suggested by bishop rivera y damas and president lopez portillo of mexico furthermore i applaud president reagans caribbean basin initiative as a recognition that economic growth can promote political stability in this region it seemed to me that the guerrillas effort to undermine the economic infrastructure of the country is at least as dangerous as an effort to overthrow the government president duarte for example has emphasized the need for buses pointing out that just in the past few weeks almost 200 buses have been destroyed in el salvador i am opposed to further military aid to el salvador at this time however not only because i believe that the military command has not adequately protected the citizens of el salvador from violations of human rights but also because i think that granting military aid at this time will strengthen the military faction of the government especially in these weeks leading up to the elections which cannot be supportive of a solution based on reconciliation achieved through peaceful means furthermore in recognition of the demonstrated gap in communication between the civilian and military leaders we must clarify that our support is for the civilian governments efforts to achieve a political and economic solution and not for the militarys attempts to achieve victory on the battlefield despite the unfriendly rhetoric which is emerging from nicaragua i believe that we must not pass up this chance to negotiate with the sandinistas but obviously we need a third party intermediary it is clear that we must use our leverage to do anything possible to discourage the nicaraguans from continuing to support the flow of arms to the rebels in el salvador for this reason i have supported the initiative proposed by president portillo of mexico to establish substantive negotiations with the sandinistas in this process however we must not ignore the violations of human rights that have been committed by the nicaraguan government just as we do not ignore the violations in el salvador finally i am convinced that unitedstates military intervention in nicaragua is not the avenue to the institution of peace and democracy in that country i believe that our evolving policy toward the turmoil in central america must stress the importance of fair and free elections and negotiations where appropriate in an effort to foster democracy and stability and to avert further military conflict i believe that the presidents caribbean basin initiative is this type of response and i am strongly supportive of our efforts to promote economic and hence political stability i cannot on the other hand support the notion that further military aid to el salvador at this time will be a constructive influence in this process especially when we are trying to do all that we can to encourage a moderate conclusion in the election process just 2 weeks away finally i maintain that if we are to continue to employ the human rights records of other countries as a criterion in the provision of unitedstates aid then we must apply that requirement fairly and consistently i would like to take this opportunity now see if there may be other members other colleagues who would like to participate"]], "top_unsure":

united states 200mile zone initially the level of the fee bore no relationship to the value of the resource being removed by foreign fleets and in fact did not even cover the administrative costs incurred by the united states because of the presence of these fleets the american fisherles promotion act passed in 1980 solved this problem by requiring that foreign fishing fees equal the administrative cost of having foreign fishermen in our zone the american fisheries promotion act solved another problem associated with the foreign fishing fee system the problem was that these fees were being placed in the general treasury and no benefit was being derived by the unitedstates fishing industry the act placed foreign fishing fees in a special fund to be used to assist the unitedstates fishing industry using foreign fishing fees for this purpose is only right because the once healthy and prosperous unitedstates fishing industry had been devastated economically by the predatory practices of foreign fishing fleets many of which were subsidized fish resources which were once abundant were overfished and on the brink of economic collapse when the 200mile act was passed the major part of the blame for this resource disaster must be laid at the feet of foreign fishing fleets which operated with little or no regard for the resource these same fleets which are now regulated by the fcma bear some responsibility to the unitedstates industry for the economic damage inflicted by overfishing the fees paid by these foreign fishermen should be used to provide developmental assistance for the unitedstates industry so that our fishermen can fully recover and resume their preeminent role as the harvesters and processors of the resources found in our 200mile zone h r 5662 continues the fisheries loan fund which is the repository of foreign fishing fees currently the act authorizes the use of these moneys to assist unitedstates fishermen who because of current economic conditions and competition with subsidized foreign fish imports are experiencing significant economic difficulties moneys which were already available in the fisheries loan fund and which were used to assist vessel owners with federally guaranteed loans not only permitted these fishermen to continue their operations and to recover economically but also to avoid defaulting on approximately 21 1 million in governmentguaranteed loans this type of shortterm assistance benefits the government as well as the fishermen and the u s economy it is clear however that foreign fishing fees can be used for many other purposes the subcommittee on fisheries and wildlife conservation and the environment is planning to investigate alternative uses for these funds i believe that these moneys can clearly be used to benefit the unitedstates industry for example part of the funds could be used to provide grants similar to saltonstallkennedy act grants for industry development the money could also be used to provide capital for a federal loan guarantee program to assist the processing industry or to assist higher risk ventures which are not now eligible to participate in the

is a model of what good government can do in the 15 years since the passage of the act we have seen tangible results registration among minority voters has risen and the number of minority elected officials has grown we have comet ar but who can say we have come far enough in 1965 when the voting rights act first became lawr poll taxes literacy tests and gerrymandering were common practices in many sections of the united states these actions motivated by racism effectively denied access to the political system to black americans this systematic exclusion in direct violation of the 15th amendment created two societies in america one white and one black this forced separation led to the violence and hatred that erupted in the late sixties recognizing this inequity congress set to finding a solution discrimination was prevalent in many areas of america but the most serious problems were found in the south in 1964 only 7 percent of voting age blacks were registered to vote in mississippi this appalling statistic was consistent throughout the region along with outlawing discriminatory practices the act required that certain jurisdictions wibh a history of discrimination clear any changes in voting procedures with the department of justice within 2 years after passage of the act 60 percent of voting age blacks in mississippi were registered it is ironic that only 15 years after its passage the voting rights act is under serious attack its opponents wisely do not question the intent of the act instead they seek to remove its teeth the preclearance provisions are the main issue in contention it is these provisions that give the act its enforcement powers that have made it as strong as it has been opponents argue against them in two ways first they say that the work of the act has been done that reform has been made that minority enfranchisement has been achieved that what we have now is good enough i submit that it is not according to a report issued by the unitedstates commission on civil rights registration rates for minorities continue to lag well behind the rates for whites registration figures for jurisdictions covered by the preclearance provisions of the act show that between 63 and 78 percent of whites were registered to vote contrasted with between 44 and 69 percent for minorities the commission concluded that serious barriers still exist for minority voters the second argument offered by enemies of the act is that the preclearance provisions discriminate against one section of the country the south they argue that the administrative burden is too great and not applied fairly to all of the united states i find this argument particularly specious in light of some of the jurisdictions covered by the act they include the state of alaska 3 counties in california 1 county in hawaii 17 towns in maine 9 towns in massachusetts including amhurst and the city of new york in sum the test applied by the act is fair and has been applied equally to all areas which have consistently discriminated against minorities finally opponents of the act argue that it costs too much that its provisions place a heavy burden on some states and localities i say that no price is too high to pay to insure denmocracy i say that we owe our citizens what is promised in the constitution a complete unhindered right to participate in this government for too long this right has been denied my feeling is that the voting rights act is opposed because it has worked so well it refuses to remain silent or to go away it has been here the past 15 years

burning coal or fossil energy our long suit that it was improper to have them burning coal because as all of us know no matter what is put into an electric utilitywhether it be coal natural gas or oilwe only get half of the end product out of the other side there is a conversion penalty for changing that form of energy we decidedall of usit was in our national interest to try to convert those utility plants where we can and put them on coal and move them off oil and natural gas wherever it is in short supply where we have to import from the opec nations where we pay hundreds of billions of dollars guess what that seems like a pretty good program i have not seen anybody here who would argue with that there are no people in the budget to do it that is defeating that policy by a backdoor

for which mr hammer will not be charged while the general accounting office recommended that mr hammer be charged for this bullionthe gaos recommendation was ignored thus mr hammer has obtained a 260 million bullion speculationwith no downside risk since the coins can always be redeemed some 260 million worth of gold and silver will suddenly disappear from fort knox and the taxpayer will get nothing for it where goldfinger failed mr hammer has appeared to succeed the taxpayers would be just as well off if their agents in washington sold the bullion outright and gave the entire 260 million

john dingell house aging chairman claude pepper house health and environment chairman henry a waxman and ways and means health subcommittee chairman andy jacobs in this effort to halt the administrations cruel and illconceived efforts to deregulate the nursing home industry the legislation which we are introducing today the national nursing home standards act of 1982 does two things first it prevents the secretary from imposing nursing home deregulation rules until 1984 second the legislation establishes a national commission on nursing home regulationa commission which will thoughtfully and rationally examine the utility quality and adequacy of existing regulations let us briefly reexamine the urgent need for this legislation on may 27 1982 the secretary of health and human services published his proposed nursing home deregulation rules in the federal register it became evident to us who have traditionally defended the rights of the frail elderly that the rules represented an abandonment of these institutionalized people the secretary proposed the inspection of nursing homes not less than once every 2 years a change from the current annual inspection requirement two problems exist with this proposal first the data show that nursing home patients average stay in these facilities is 2 years therefore patients might never be in contact with an inspection team second studies show that patients are getting older and sicker and therefore may not be capable of withstanding poor treatment for a 2year period waiting for an inspection team to arrive i am also alarmed by the secretarys recommendation that homes in which violations have been detected report by mail or by phone that such violations have been corrected if a nursing home operator has placed the frail elderly at risk by violating a fire ordinance then that home should be reinspectedstate agencies should not rely on something as little as a postcardto determine if the violation has been corrected finally i am very distressed by the secretarys recommendation that the joint commission on the accreditation of hospitals be permitted to determine if facilities should receive federal funds under medicare or medicald jcah is a private nonprofit entity that performs such a function for the accreditation of hospitals this recommendation is objectionable for several reasons first 42 unitedstatesc 1396aa 33 b is the operative language regarding the duties of state agencies to determine whether institutions should receive medicare or medicaid funds there is no authorization for the state agencies or the federal government to farm out this responsibility to anybody particularly jcah second jcah has a policy of keeping the results of its certification process confidential when jcah examines a hospital and finds a problem that problem is kept confidential in fact jcah surveys of hospitals are exempted from general and specific public disclosure requirements of the social security act the problem here is that jcah may well encounter a nursing home violation which should be referred to a state law enforcement official and even if the violation is not appropriate for that purpose a family deciding whether it should place its beloved relative in the home would find that information very helpful yet the information uncovered by the jcah during a nursing home inspection will be unavailable for that purpose third the track record of jcah in inspecting hospitals has been called into question in 1972 congress required hcfa to undertake periodic surveys to validate the work of jcah in accrediting hospitals the results are reported to congress annually in fiscal year 1980 61 percent of the hospitals in hcfas selective audit were found to have serious deficiencies 50 percent of those sampled violated the life safety code by contrast the results of state agency surveys of hospitals were found to be much more reliable given the deficiencies which i have listedelimination of the annual reinspection requirement permission to notify state agencies that violations have been corrected by phone or by mail and authorization of jcah to deem the status of nursing homes as proper beneficiaries of federal fundsi am plpased that our bill would prevent the department from making these regulations final the reservations which i have with the approach taken by the secretary of health and human services are shared by many i would like to introduce into the record an editorial from the july 24 1982 hartford courant which criticizes the proposal a statement reflecting similar views by the state of connecticut commission on long term care in nursing home facilities and the text of an editorial prepared by wcbstv which also condemns

oil production the saudi arabians also threatened the carter administration with oil cutbacks if the president complied with the congressional mandate to resume filling the strategic petroleum reserve a stance of competely unwarranted interference with american policy while saudi arabia moderated its oil prices to a minor degree after the 1978 f15 sale international analysts believe it did so more to assert its own independence within opec rather the aid the american oil consumer when former president carter pro posed the 1978 arms sale to the senate he wrote in a letter that the sale of planes to saudi arabia would cement their ties to the united states and advance the cause of moderation in the area however instead of supporting the first peace agreement to be reached between israel and egypt the saudis opposed the peacemaking efforts of the united states by leading the arab league in condemning the treaty and organizing an economic and political boycott of egypt in may 1979 president sadat fierely attacked the saudi arabian rulers for their continued efforts to sabotage the peace treaty charging the saudi government with paying several arab governments to break off diplomatic relations with egypt the saudi arabians have redoubled their support of the plo since the signing of twe camp david agreement currently they provide major finan cial assistance to the plo and support its terrorist activities against israel as recently as january 1981 arabia led the moslem states at the islamic conference at taif in calling for a jihad or holy war against israel at the

any palestinians thus protecting the house of saud against subversion or revolt indeed if the saudi monarch cannot survive open accomnodation with israel it is hardly a safe depository for all that

legislation to produce budget surpluses and place our government back on a sound financial footing my support for thesg balanced budget plans and other measures to reduce spending deficits is based on judgments that they would help put americans back to work provide a fairer tax system while retaining our commitments to the elderly and disadvantaged i find it ironic that this administration which seeks to leave its successor with a balanced budget constitutional amendment has 2 years in a row strongly opposed congressional legislation to balance the budget instead the administration persuaded the congress over my opposition to enact a program which will add 700 billion to the national debt by 1984 by cutting taxes three times faster than spending the administration has created record deficits and interest rates destroying all incentives for economic expansion and prolonging our national recession the administration is now trying to disguise the failure of their economic program by seeking a constitutional barrier to future deficit spending if the balanced budget constitutional amendment gains speedy approval in the congress and among the states what effect would it have if enforced in 1985 under present projections the house budget office reports that it would require at least 215 billion of spending cuts to pass a balanced budget in 1985 these cuts would have to come from either social security or national defense which account for twothirds of the budget or from virtually eliminating most other functions of the federal government for example in 1985 social security national defense and a rudimentary federal government will cost about 675 billion under current policies if these programs were not reduced the required 215 biillon in cuts to balance the budget would have to come from the 262 billion that is left in the budget for all other areas this means an 82 percent reduction in most government programs including law enforcement housing education highways aid to the handicapped job training research and development small business aid care for the poor and disaster assistance if no programs were protected an acrosstheboard cut of 23 percent in each government program would be required to balance the budget this would reduce national defense by 70 billion social security and medicald by 60 billion 6 billion reduction in both unemployment compensation and veterans programs and sizable cuts in everything else i do not believe that my constituents and our nation support these alternatives i am concerned that the administralions support for a balanced budget constitutional amendment is a thiny veiled threat to dismantle the social security system as we know it federal discretionary programs which make up most of governments structure have already taken the majority of the enacted cuts with 75 billion cut in the last 2 years furthermore the administration is opposing all attempts to reduce its 1 6 trillion 5year defense buildup if the administration will not support needed cuts in defense and most other government programs have been substantially reduced social security is the only program large enough where cuts could approach satisfying a constitutional amendment to balance the budget constantly the administration tells the american people that it will not cut social security but it was only 1 year ago when the administration proposed cutting early retirees benefits by 40 percent disability benefits by 30 percent and everybody elses pensions by 20 percent this past spring the administration endorsed legislation to immediately reduce social security benefits by 40 billion fortunately the congress has succeeded in blocking these radical attacks on social security the passage of a balanced budet constitutional amendment however would create greater leverage to enact drastic social security benefit cuts and push millions of elderly into poverty i urge my colleagues to consider this issue closely"], [0.00023490190505981445, 0.5002349019050598, 0, "at this point i would like to commend my colleagues on the interior appropriations subcommittee who have worked so tirelessly to insure consideration of the conference report to accompany the interior appropriations bill for fiscal year 1983 during the waning hours of the lameduck session of the 97th congress i am particularly pleased because of its national importance also the report condecember 18 1 982 tains several items of major importance for my home state of arkansas earlier this session i became embroiled in the unexpected battle to save the norfork fish hatchery from closure and am delighted that the conference report before us provides for its continued operation this hatchery was jeopardized when house subcommittee actions addded the arkansas facility to a list of fish hatcheries to be closed nationwide this unusual development occurred even though the norfork hatchery was not on the list of potential closing compiled by the unitedstates fish and wildlife service or the administration therefore i want to extend my personal thanks to chairman yates and mr mcdade for their cooperation and reversal of that recommendation in the early stage of the final legislative process fortunately the senate accepted ftom the beginning the unitedstates fish and wildlife agency recommendation to fund the norfork hatchery among the persuasive arguments made to the subcommittee were the multistate impact of the hatchery the remarkable return of about 66 for every federal tax dollar spent there and the historic mitigation commitment to the hatchery in connection with the construction of the norfork dam 40 years ago the norfork fish hatchery is one of the most efficiently managed and economically productive hatcheries of its kind in the country and congress has rightfully assured its continuance in addition i would like to express my appreciation to the senior senator from arkansas mr bumpers for including an additional 2 million in this report for continuing land acquisition for the buffalo national river and i am pleased that we in the house have agreed to that provision as the original sponsor in the hose of representatives back in the 90th congress of legislation to preserve this freeflowing river for the enjoyment of future generations and as the sponsor of measures increasing the original authorization for land acquisition for this project in the past i have a longstanding commitment to the development protection and maintenance of this area this additional allocation will provide for further positive actions needed to acquire remaining property my colleagues have heard me speak in the committee and on the floor of the beauty of the buffalo national river being unsurpassed and it is indeed fitting we should finish our land acquisition as well as begin development on a timely basis last of the 281 million allocated for construction costs under the forest service i am pleased that 50 000 has been allotted at senator bumpers request for road work in the mount magazine area of the ozark national forest in arkansas the conferees in the house also recognized the need for increased construction funding for the forest service due to reductions in the timber sales program levels i appreciate that support i am relieved that at least the interior appropriations bill for fiscal year 1983 will be enacted during this lameduck session but remain disappointed that the congress will not he able to consider the other appropriation bills and will once again be forced to resort to the procedure of operating under an umbrella bill or continuing resolution as a stopgap funding measure nevertheless i am hopeful that the president will sign this all important measure that speaks to so many of the natural resource needs for our countrys citizens e"], [0.00023514032363891602, 0.5002351403236389, 0, "well let me say to my friend the gentleman from iowa i talked to mr goreand i realize there is impatience with this colloquyi talked with the gentleman from iowa i talked with the administration i talked with our minority leader and frankly i will say again that i think that this is a healthy debate we are pursuing let me just make a couple of comments and then i will stop the concept of a freeze is not necessarily new the united states actively tried to get the soviet union to agree to a freeze during salt i when the unitedstates and soviet force levels were roughly equal at that time the soviets refused to agree to a freeze they chose instead to pursue an enormous very costly arms buildup in the 1970s over the same period of time the unitedstates defense effortsas i mentioned a little earlierby any index lagged badly in the last decade according to the secretary of defense the soviet union outspent the united states by 450 billion in military investment alone the improvement that they made in their strategic weapon delivery capability now jeopardizes the survivablity of strategic systems we once thought were secure now that president reagan has proposed a strategic modernization effort to redress the deficiencies now that the soviets have had a decade of massive military buildup behind them now that they are ahead frankly in many areas of nuclear and conventional capability leonid brezhnev says that now the soviet union is prepared to accept a nuclear weapon freeze let me say i am not suggesting that the gentleman from iowa or the gentleman from new york is buying the brezhnev line sorry to even bring it up but he has suggested that a weapon freeze would be good for his country at this point i think that we must first make sure that our good intentions do not lure this country into a position of inferiority thereby precluding us ultimately from reaching the goal that the gentleman from iowa would like to see which is to reduce armaments and to bring about a more stable nuclear balance in the world i know that there are many in the united states who believe that the soviet union is genuinely interested in fair and equitable arms control agreements we have had about a decade of negotiating with them and frankly as a past congressional representative at the salt talksnot that i am an expert but i have sat in several sessions in genevai have never found a more disingenuous set of negotiators than those from the soviet union we should not gamble away the defense of the united states and the attempt by this country to prevent a nuclear war on the good intentions of the soviet union the gentleman from illinois pointed out that if we were to freeze weapon production now we would end up canceling our mx b1 trident trident d5 missile and the c31 modernization programs among others we would we perpetuating some of the vulnerabilities in our forces and conceding strategic domi nance to the soviet union all in the hope that sometime in the future they would be willing to join with us in arms reductions twenty years ago this month presi dent kennedy warned against trusting the soviet commitment to arms control saying to us we know enough now about broken negotiations by the soviet unionsecret preparations and the advantages that they gain from a long test seriesnever to offer again an uninspected moratorium it seems to me that the events in af ghanistan and poland and ethiopia and angola and soviet involvement in central america and elsewhere in the world should be telling us something about with whom we are negotiating and should instill in us a sense of cau tion as i have said in the beginning of my remarks the president wants i believe to preserve peace to insure it for the future and says that we should not just freeze the production of nuclear armswe should be reducing them i agree with him i believe that rather than freezing existing inequities we should concentrate all of our efforts in achieving strategic arms reductions to equal verifiable levels we should seek an agreement that will reduce the nuclear arsenals on both sides to equal levels in a manner that would promote stability and reduce the risk of nuclear war ind to the extent that this debate may contrib ute to that goal i commend my friend from iowa and my friend from new york and thank them for their indulgence"]]}
