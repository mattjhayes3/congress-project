that day did not have time to insert all of my remarks into the record while my plan was defeated there continues to be interest in the package that mr obey and mr reuss and i put together in light of the outcome on the taxcut vote i wanted to insert this edited version of my remarks today some 144 members of the house voted for the tudallobeyreuss plan i want to take this opportunity to share this full record of my comments with my colleagues as well as with my constituents in southern arizona let me take you back 4 years because i want to make two points first in march of 1977 we had a new president in town we all said give the new guy a chance and he went on television to tell us he had a comprehensive energy program to deal with the countrys priority problem hie sent the plan to the congress and said could we please vote yes or no up or down as soon as possible surely in the next few months and send it back to the white house by the august recess but there was no billnot in august 1977 not even in august 1978 the bill that was finally approved in october 1978 was pretty badly mangled at that now let us move to 1981 we have another new president in town and most americans have been saying let us give him a chance by april he comes before the congress to tell us that our economy and our energy policy are both in a mess and heres his huge and difficult and complicated program to clean it up could we please act quickly and give the president and the country some answers preferably before the august recess well we have heard about our democratic leadership stalling or falling to move quickly it is a bum rap we have worked hard and we have dealtwith budget cuts of historic size now we have given a president a program based on dangerous farreaching unprecedented economic assumptions not in 18 months as was our response to president carter but in 16 weeks i have watched with increasing dismay these last few weeks as the leadership on the republican side rallied around the president almost unanimously without asking the kind of tough questions about his policy that were askedno demandedof president carters and some of my democratic friends many of them played a new round of a tired old game called my tax cut is bigger than your tax cut any number can play but this year the stakes were extraordinarily high and our countrys whole economic foundation is at stake again let me return to 1977 because there is another parallel there to what we face in 1981 back in 1977 when jimmy carter and his new team came to town they told us that they had promised during the campaign to balance the federal budget and that this pledge would be kept but they had just looked at the new numbers and they said well hold on we simply can not do it after all in 1977 or 1978 and actually 1979 did not look promising but they would guarantee that by 1980a new election yeara balanced budget would be a reality as it worked out we had a 60 billion deficit now here we are in 1981 the president and his team with david stockman in charge tell us that they promised to balance the budget and its a pledge that will be kept but they just looked at the new figures and they can not do it in 1981 or 1982 anid 1983 does niot look all that great but you can be sure that it will be balanced by 1984which happens to be a new election year now they have even backed away from that saying 1984 does not look so hot either maybe 1985 we can not wait that long i sense a real and dangerous skepticism in america today people really question whether the congress is doing anything or can do anything about the economic mess we are in or whether we are going to be serious about helping turn this country around i believe that noth~ing would do more to return confidence to our people and our financial and investment institutions than a balanced budget now i am not alone in that belief the noted wall street economist henry kaufman has declared to fight inflation head on the ne ed is for the government to achieve a balanced budget in fiscal 1982 this would chop inflationary expectations and of equal importance would reduce the role of the government as a powerful demander of credit thereby freeing savings to finance the private sector our substitute was the only bill in the house or senate which could have achieved that goal of a balanced budget and it would have done it without mirrors or rash assumptions and it did not touch the national defense approprations we have already approved our bill did not try to outpromise the gop we were not competing to see who could give the mnost to th oil companies or to investors who straddle the commodities market we did not seek to engage in a bidding war what our bill sought to do was this first to bring interest rates down and to begin the process now this year the reagan administration is budgeting 106 billion for interest on the national debtthe third highest item in the budget the 1982 budget depending on whose figures you use will have a deficit in the 50 billion to 60 billion range we need to take government out of the business of outbidding businesses and individuals in the financial markets in this way we can free the capital that our country so desperately needs for productive enterprises our measure sought to drastically reducc outlays for interest on the national debt mr kaufman agrees here as well in business week of july 13 1981 he said if the reagan tax cut is in place by october 1 we face a new significant increase in interest rates second our proposal sought to raise 6 billion through tax reforms including the elimination of the oil depletion allowance and of commodity tax straddles the revenue loss would have amounted to 13 billion in fiscal 1982 but the estimated budget surplus for the year would have been 2 billion and 20 billion by fiscal 1983 third the same tax reforms would have provided the money to give americans an honest tax break phased in during 1982 it would not have been a tax break financed with borrowed money which was part of the administrative plan that the house approved under the plan that is becoming law taxpayers making 15 000 a year or less or 41 percent of the total tax filers will get 8 5 percent of the 1982 tax cut but people making 50 000 or more a year or 5 6 percent of the population will get 35 1 percent of the 1982 tax cut who are we helping let me digress for a moment and relate to you an imaginary conversation between dave stockman and a taxpayer it reinforces some points ive tried to make dave stockman walks out of the white house and bumps into a man on the street who makes 15 000 a year is married and has two children the man introduces himself and recognizes stockman how are things going asks the man not bad replies stockmnan i have good news for you what a tax cut stockman answers terrific says the man how much will a guy in my bracket get youll get about 150 says stockman yeah answers the man well thatll get me through a 40 pair of jordache jeans for my teenage daughter a 15 pair of tennis shoes for my boy maybe a 30 night out for my wife and i i can buy two tanks of gas for 30 and have 35 left over for the supermarket not terrific but better than nothing frankly mr stockman the thing that really pleases me is that you guys apparently have balanced the budget after all these years and youve got money left over to cut our taxes well i have to be honest says stockman we havent balanced the budget instead the deficit has gone up from 40 billion to around 60 billion and if our program works the way this mr laffer out in california says and if our best case assumptitons carry we are going to have another 128 billion in deficits before 1984 hey really says the man then where will we get the money for me and other americans to have a tax cut stockman says well borrow it when i was a congressman i used to call that printing money or monetizing the debt but isnt interest a big item in the federal budget this year asks the taxpayer i heard its something like 80 billion well yes thats right and well have to have some more interest payments even larger ones next year if we have that additional 60 billion deficit i mentioned in fact weve already budgeted 106 billion just to pay interest next year wont all of that cut down the money supply that we need for capital investment in homes and buildings and all the rest said the man i suppose says stockman but dr laffer and jack kemp say weve got to try this for 3 years first ive got to leave mr stockman says the taxpayer but it seems to me wed be a lot better off if we passed up a tax cut this year and got inflation under control and interest rates lowered and moved quickly toward a balanced budgetand then talk about tax cuts end of story except that i want to add that a cbsnew york times poll of february supported by other polls in more recent weeks showed that by a margin of 7~0 to 23 percent people would rather have a balanced budget before a tax cut if we are going to go into debt and drive up the cost of interest on the national debt by having tax cuts at least we ought to put that money almost all of it we allocated into getting productive assets built and installed and giving people jobs and creating long term economic activity instead what we have adopted as public policy on which all our hopes rest is that not only is there a free lunch but we will give you a bonus for eating it it is a little like going to see a doctor dr reagan says we have diagnosed your condition and run all the tests we find that you have a strange combination of symptoms some of our tests show that you suffer from serious highblood pressure and other tests show that you suffer from serious lowblood pressure what we are going to do is give you two kinds of medicine a pill for lowblood pressure for the right side of your mouth and a pill for highblood pressure for the left side of your mouth swallow both of them fast and you will be well by the next election it will not work george bush was right when he called it voodoo economics in heated debate there are often key facts in dispute let me give you one which is not disputed for all the talk by candidate reagan about balanced budgets and all the talk by president reagan about balanced budgets the administration holds no hope for a balanced budget until 1984or maybe 1985 according to the administrations own optimistic figures and accepting all their assumptions we are promised at besti emphasize at bestwe are promised another 128 billion in new budget deficits over the next 3 years the numbers are stunning computer folks have an old saying garbage in garbage out what they mean is that if you give your programer bad information the computer will give you bad results let me touch on three of the major assumptions we are offered as a guarantee that this untested program is somehow going to work a taxcut multiplier of 5 as against previous history in our nation and others of 2 being the best result you can expect but the assumption in the reagankempstockman plan is 5a multiplier of 5which has never happened anywhere in the free world as far as i know even rudy penner of the american enterprise institute noted there is no reason to think that a kemproth cut has 2 3 or 4 times the power of any other tax cut we have tried the white house assumption that interest rates will drop to 9 percent by the end of 1982 check with your banker and ask him if he believes that inflation will be running at 6 2 percent by christmas 1982 and will drop even lower after that there is an old story about a politician who visited a small town gathered voters in the town square and let fly with a long speech that detailed his program when he finished he paused then declared ladies and gentlemen thems my views and if you dont like emn then ill change em if the standard economic assumptions do not give the right numbers dave stockman simply changes the assumptions but they are phony they are wrong and they will not prove out you cannot even find people on wall street who believe that a magic economic elixir has been discovered who says some samples irving shapiro chairman of the du pont co in the wall street journal of march 9 1981 all weve got to rely on is an economic theory no businessman can run his company on an untried business theory and neither can a government sam nakagama chief economist for the investment firm of kidder peabody in the journal of commerce february 11 1981 when a republican treasury secretary calls for tax cuts to be enacted before expenditure cuts and amid double digit inflation and a rearmament program it is an invitation to financial disaster and from the republican ranks senator barry goldwater quoted by the associated press in the tucson citizen february 13 1981 i dont think it kemproth will work although i know thats not a popular thing to say i dont think reducing the average income tax by 20 or 200 is going to make a great deal of difference senator howard baker t he tennessee republican and distinguished h 6008 co senate majority leader on face the nation august 2 1981 what were doing is really a riverboat gamble were gambling that this new economics will work a real basic point in all of this is that the udallobeyreuss plan would have attacked high interest rates and provided for a balanced budgetnot with gimmicks or a riverboat gamble but with a sound and solid approach we had a chance to enact a plan with a real assurance of a balanced budget and we voted for one with a real assurance of 128 billion more in deficits now we must go ahead with what we have and i will do my part to help see that the reagan plan works but i doubt that it will year after year the american people have demonstrated that they want a balanced budget and yet when the time came we gave the taxpayers more deficit spending i fear we have played a cruel trick on the nation and that we may pay dearly for it in the years ahead"], [0.48571085929870605, 0.514289140701294, 1, "i yield myself such time as i may require h r 6068 the intelligence authorization act for fiscal year 1983 is the fifth such bill in as many years reported out by the permanent select committee on intelligence like its predecessors it was approved unanimously in committee as it was by the committee on armed services this information was echoed by my colleague the gentleman from massachusetts who handled the rule on the majority side and our colleague the gentleman for arizona who handled the rule on the minority side i want to express to them my appreciation for their remarks concerning all the members of this particular committee and the nonpartisan manner in which it has operated as in past years this bill authorizes all the funds for the next fiscal year as well as supplemental funds in the current fiscal year for the intelligence and intelligencerelated activities of the unitedstates government the category of intelligence activities includes all the activities of the central intelligence agency the defense intelligence agency the national security agency other intelligence components of the department of defense and the departments of the army navy and air force the bureau of intelligence and research of the department of state the intelligence divisions of the federal bureau of investigation intelligence elements of the departments of the treasury and energy and the drug enforcement administration and the intelligence community staff of the director of central intelligence these activitles provide intelligence for the use of the president the cabinet the national security council and the joint chiefs of staff further this bill authorizes intelligencerelated activities of the department of defense which are programs that are integral to the defense force structure but which are similar to national intelligence programs and are often tasked for national intelligence purposes particularly in peacetime the similarity of programs and functions between the national intelligence programs and the intelligencerelated activities of the defense department is the reason that both are considered by the permanent select committee on intelligence and authorized in this bill we have worked to assure that the program areas arecomplementary and mutually supportive but not duplicative the referral of this bill to the committee on armed services has assured that the judgments we have made from an intelligence viewpoint are equally sound from a military perspective we have worked closely with that committee on a continuous basis and achieved a position agreeable to both committees even before referral most intelligence activities are classified and necessarily so in some cases even the very existence of the program or activity is held secret this sensitivity limits the description we can offer here on the floor the schedule of authorizations to accompany the bill and the classifled annex to the report have been available to members a number of members have reviewed these materials the subject material is complex but we have continued to revise these classified reports to improve their clarity the committee continues to recommend that the budget for intelligence not be disclosed the disclosure of a single budget number might not itself be harmiul but some explanation of the content and meaning of the number would be essential but such an explanation would be excessively revealing moreover the committee recognizes that intelligence is inherently secret and any disclosure is the beginning of an erosive process in discussing this point people often refer to the degree of disclosure of our military budgets and systems it is not a good analogy the existence of military systems must be known in order to have deterrent value if deterrence fails military systems are effective in battle because of their numbers the manner in which they are employed and the skill of the personnel using them conversely in the case of intelligence the mere awareness of an intelligence activity can easily reduce or eliminate its effectiveness may endanger lives and may lead to the collection of false information contrived by our adversaries to confuse or mislead us i would like to summarize briefly the organization of i r title i provides for the bulk of our intelligence and intelligencerelated activities as i said earlier funds and program details are in the classified schedule of authorizations and the annex to the report one exception is the authorization for the counterterrorism program of the fbi which is unclassified the bill provides 12 1 million for this function title ii provides necessary authorities for the intelligence community staff whose function is to assist the director of central intelligence with his responsibilities for overall coordination of intelligence and preparation of the budget the staff is made up of representatives of all elements of the intelligence community administratively it is treated as if part of the cia title iii provides authorization of 91 3 million for the central intelligence agency retirement and disability system this is a program established by congress in 1964 to provide for those cia personnel who perform hazardous duties or are in special situations usually abroad which may limit the length of their careers when title iii is read for amendment i will offer a technical amendment that would conform ciards as it is called so as to afford certain ciards retirees the opportunity to exercise options which can be made by their counterparts under the civil service retirement and disability system although current law now permits the president by executive order to conform ciards to prospective changes made to the civil service system the differences in question existed prior to this change in the law hence the need for the amendments title iv authorizes additional intelligence and intelligencerelated expenditures in fiscal year 1982 the details of this supplemental authorivation are found in the classified annex to the committees report title v consists of a provision prohibiting the unauthorized use of the defense intelligence agencys name initials or seal in a manner reasonably calculated to convey the impression that such use was authorized and authorizing the attorney general to seek to enjoin such unauthorized use this section is identical to those enacted last year protecting against the unauthorized use of the cia and nsa names initials or seals title vi contains a provision providing to spouses and former spouses of certain cia employees entitlements and rights in relation to retirement and survivors annuities comparable to those provided to spouses of foreign service officers by the foreign service act of 1980 this provision recognizes the enormous equity that cia spouses have in their employee spouses careersboth in terms of the assistance they provide to intelligence operations and their sacrifice of their own professional advancement the committee was thoroughly persuaded that these spouses deserve the same benefits as do foreign service officers spouses nonetheless the bills provisions are more stringent than those of the foreign service act since they require that spouses to qualify must serve overseas with their employee spouses one reason for the bipartisan support which h r 6068 enjoys is that all of the recommendations of the subcommittee on program and budget authorization adopted by the committee have been so painstakingly documented and reasoned in their approach i attribute the great success of this effortand the important and oftneeded guidance it has provided the intelligence communityto the judgment and character of the ranking minority member ken robinson of virginia he has been the rock upon which the work of the subcommittee has been built and he deserves the thanks not only of the congr6ss but of the nation for his great contribution in this area i should also add that the staff who assist the committee in its consideration of the intelligence and intelligencerelated budgets is first class i believe they are the finest the most professional of all who work on the intelligence budget in either the executive or legislative branches i would like to pay tribute and thanks to duane andrews jim bush marty faga annette smiley and patrica garber as in the last fiscal year this bill authorizes less than the administration requested but still permits real growth over last year some specific proposals have been recommended for deferral others for termination while a few have been increased let me close by stating that as in years past the committee has made and continues to make the classfied annex to its report available to all members of the house during business hours in the committees rooms i would urge members who have not yet had an opportunity to do so to read this report carefully i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.4858897924423218,

to~help the rich i hope we will not continue down a deadend street of believing in what president reagan calls the magic of the marketplace empirical evidence of six recessions in the postwar period resulting from similar tight monetary and regressive fiscal policies now being pursued documents the fallacy of feeding the fat and starving the lean economics for those who care to think objectively and to heed commonsense i am inserting into the record the report of the national advisory council on economic opportunity a governmental agency which the congress created warning us that the blunderuss budget cuts in social program will lead not to price stability and a sounder economy but more crime poverty welfare dependency and general social and economic chaos the councils statement follows the national advisory council on economic opportunity today sharply criticized the reagan administrations proposed cutbacks in federal incometransfer and antipoverty programs saying that the effect of these cuts will be to cause massive suffering as well as to undermine the work ethic and family life among the poor the administrations proposed cutbacks of these crucial federal programs warned the council in releasing its final report will severely deepen the crisis of poverty in the future and could drive whole segments of our society toward hopelessness and despair instead the report calls for passage of the economic opportunity act and continuation of the legal services corporation two programs that are essential to the wellbeing of the more than 29 million americans still living in poverty in a separate statement arthur 1 blaustein chairman of the council said by separating economic theory from social policy and pursuing the former at the expense of the latter the administration has adopted a strategy of brinksmanship that could lead to social chaos there is a price to be paid for the reduction of human and social services the price is that these cuibicks will not reduce crime they will increase it they will not reduce the use of drugs they will increase it they will not reduce alcoholism they will increase it they will not reduce physical and mental illness they will increase it they will not promote better family life they will destabilize it they will not increase respect for the law they will weaken it at present there exists an air of suspended disbelief over the radical changes that have occurred in the past two months that is because the layoffs the shutdowns the cutbacks and the reduced paychecks have not yet reached ground level but the day of reckoning will come shortly october 1 1981 will be remembered as a day of infamy for it will mark the worst massacre of social and human service programs in american history the report the american promise equal justice and economic opportunity addresses itself specifically to the issues of unemployment inflation women in poverty the implementation of human and social service programs citizen participation and volunteerism and the myths of poverty the 15member council established by congress in 1967 and appointed by the president is responsible for making an annual report to the president and congress on programs and policies aimed at helping the poor it is slated for abolition by this administration attacking what it termed persistent myths about poverty in the united states the council presented evidence that disputed what it termed the mistaken view of some economists that the reduction in the proverty population had been a result of growth ini the private economy the council maintained that for some time such growth has ceased to trickle down to the poor in the farm of more jobs better income and a more rewarding and productive role in society and the council reaffirmed its belief that only those comprehensive and national economic revitalization efforts targeted specifically toward dissadvantaged communities and the jobless would effectively combat poverty in the 1980s a strategy that the administration is abandoning in addition to releasing the report the council issued the following statement seventeen years ago this nation made an historic commitment to reduce if not eliminate poverty in america the economic opportunity act was conceived with moral conviction and dedicated to the proposition that all americans even the 36 million poor were entitled to both opportunity and equal access to the law the act itself called for a national effort to attack the causes of poverty and related social problems which were national in character and scope all the testimony given to the council over the past several years has shown that these federal programs do work that they do help people get out of poverty and that the delivery systems are providing the necessary basic human and social services thus after fifteen years of progress in our nations effort to relieve poverty when in fact the number of poor had by 1980 been reduced by 11 million and millions more have been kept above the poverty line this council is deeply concerned that the process will be reversed by recent policy decisions by the administration that will serve not only to increase the number of poor but to make their burden more severe the three aspects of the administrations economic recovery program that gravely concern the council are 1 the massive acrosstheboard cuts in social and human service programs 2 the abolition of delivery systems provided for in the economnic opportunity act and the legal services corporation act 3 the transfer of federal authority and program responsibility to the states through block grant programs in evaluating the impact of these changes on the poor we believe that each of these decisions taken alone would be painful but taken together they will be absolutely devastating this council under four presidents two republicansand two demo crats has consistently taken the position that the federal government must maintain active responsibility for pursuing the goals of the economic opportunity act this has never beena partisan issue and it should not be one now the council vigorously reaffirms its earlier recommendations that the economic opportunity act and the legal services corporation act should be reauthorized the council is well aware that the economic difficulties facing our nation are complex and often seem overwhelming but these difficulties cannot be used as an excuse for reneging on our social and moral commitments as a nation we are deeply troubled by the notion that national issues ones that require national policy and programs and that are a part of our national purpose should suddenly devolve to the states the issue is not federal versus 9tate responsibility rather it is the dimunition or avoidance of any national standards of responsibility and accountability to deflect suspend or fragment responsibility and accountability suggests that we are either renouncing or failing to assert our moral purpose as a nation worse than that the administration seems to be denying that this moral purpose exists the effect of the block grant proposal as opposed to the economic opportunity act and the legal services corporation act is to destroy existing support systems that are effective that have a proven capacity to deliver services and that utilize local planning and implementation capabilities they are being replaced by a new system that has a poor track record and is restrictively financed more bureaucratic less accountable ans more subject to intense political pressures the last point is extremely important in that effective and efficient use of limited federal funds is in danger of being thwarted by conflicting political interests in each state after reviewing the recent budget process it appears that there has been a massive transfer from basic human and social services to our military budget the council seriously questions whether it is in the national interest to relegate a substantial number and social service programs to the junkpile while we increase the stockpiling of weapons of mass destruction in an arms race where overkill has long been achieved moreover these changes are occuring without any serious national debate when advocates of balanced national priorities are dismissed by the president as representatives of special interests and critics of the administrations policy are referred to as demagogues in criticizing the administrations sharp cutbacks in social programs the councils statement emphasized the negative impact of these cutbacks on work and family life from an administration that places high priority on the importance of faily life and the work ethic it said this budget will be selfdefeating the council cited the following analyses drawn from its own research and other recent studies in support of its statement that these policies will actually encourage dependency instead of work family breakdown instead of family stability the council cited an estimate by the congressional budget office that proposed cuts in public service employment under the comprehensive employment and training act ceta would result in a net loss of between 210 000 and 330 000 jobs in fiscal years 1981 and 1982 causing a sharp rise in expenditures for welfare and unemployment insurance the loss of these jobs the council pointed out would be compounded by cuts in support services which range from child care to mass transit creating a spiral effect that will deal a devastating blow to the realistic job prospects of hundreds of tihousandsof disadvantaged workers the council cited an estimate by the wharton economic forecasting associates that about threequarters of a million jobs would be lost through cuts in ceta alone and an additional million as a result of the administrations program reductions as a whole the council singled out proposed cuts in the aid to families with dependent children afd c program as an example of how the reality of the administrations budget departs from its rhetoric citing independent studies by the congressional budget office and the university of chicagos center for the study of welfare policy the council noted that the bulk of cuts in afdc are concentrated on families who are presently working but do not now earn enough to maintain an adequate living the council pointed out that welfare recipients who work will have their incomes cut by an average of more than 20 percent versus a 4 percent reduction for those who do not work and in some states the administrations proposed changes will eliminate the difference between what an afdc family can receive if no one works and the income it can receive with a fulltime worker noting that this sharply penalizes the working poor the council commented that tile administration apparently feels that only the rich need incentives to work the council said that families with young childrenespecially minority families and families headed by womenwould be among the worst victims of thle hardships imposed by the administrations cuts citing an analysis by the congressional budgct office the council pointed out that of those families that are expected to lose a substantial portion of their spendable income from reductions in public service jobs af dc food stamps and the school lunch program over twothirds are headed by women and almost two out of five are nonwhite referring to thle university of chicago study the council noted that a singleparent faily with two children could lose up to 30 percent of its disposable income from reductions in afdc food stamps and child nutrition programs alone in rejecting the administrations contention that renewed economic growth will eventually trickle down to the poor to offset these losses the council declared that it flies in the face of everything we know about poverty today tile council cited new evidence in this years report affirming that growth in the private economy has had a declining role in reducing poverty and that virtually all of the reduction in poverty since the mid1960s has come about through the expansion of social insurance and incometransfer programs of the kind now under attack by the administration though poverty increased most dramatically in the hardhit declining cities of the northeast and midwest the report says poverty rates also remained disturbingly stable even in those cities characterized by strongoccasionally phenomenalgrowth in jobs and income in short economic growth has had little impact in decreasing poverty rates in recent years even in the boom cities of the southwest the stubborn persistence of poverty in the face of economic growth the council pointed out in its statement results in part from the changing nature of thle poverty population what tile report terms the new poor are increasingly a population of those whom the private economy has passed by even in good times thle council noted these peoplethe aged the disabled disadvantaged youth women heading families with small childrenare rarely hired by the private sector in 1978 a year of economic recovery thle unemployment rate among disadvantaged minority youth was 41 percent among afdc recipients one of the groups most harshly affected by the administrations cuts nearly 70 percent are clilldren more than twothiirdls of them 11 years old or younger among the adults thle overwhelming majority nre women heading fainiliesabout 80 percent of whom are either required as fulltime homemakers disabled or already in training at work or seeking work because few of these people can be absorbed into the private economy without special assistance and support said the council the massive suffering these program cuts will bring cannot be balanced by any credible longrange benefits from the administrations programeven under the hi 6769 most optimistic economic assumptions instead the council declared any economic renewal resulting from the administrations policies would take place at the expense of stable rewarding family lives and genuine work opportunities for the poor and their children mr lllaustein chairman of the council added that we are watching a great tragedy unfurl before us the steady drumbeat of rhetoric emanating from administration officials and shrewdly orchestrated by the white house is intended to create and has heretofore succeeded in creating a counterreality and new myths with respect to social policy for example by continuously referring to economic opportunity and equal justice programs as welfare programs the administration has misled the american public these programs are in fact designed to achieve the opposite to create jobs and economic opportunities and to encourage people who are dependent upon welfare to become productive citizens and taxpayers by seeking to eliminate these programs and substituting its own policies the administration will deny upware mobility to millions on welfare and will force many of the working poor into welfare dependency by shifting program authority from the federal government to the states through block grants the administration has created a bureaucratic nightmare that will result in government by provisional catastrophe by transferring huge amounts of funds from human and social services to defense the administration is not dampening inflation it is fueling it in order to gain support for its economic package the administration has conjured up the specter of an economic dunkirk what it is perpetuating is a social pearl harbor which will have a devastating impact on the poor who are defenseless as well as wiping out the modest gains made in the past fifteen years by women the elderly minorities and the youngthe most vulnerable segments of our society"], [0.48607397079467773, 0.5139260292053223, 1, "i think it is time to put the social security issue into perspective as a result of the reagan administrations scare tactics the public is confused and worried about the future of a program that has provided income security to americans for nearly half a century during his campaign

budget slasher david stockman have succeeded in eliminating the 122 minimum benefit this will hurt nearly 3 million americans at the bottom of the economic ladder now the administration is attempting to panic the congress into making benefits to most americans who have come to believe in the integrity of the system and to rely on it for security the president has proposed cutting 88 billion in early retirement disability and other benefits by 1986 attempting to frighten the american people into believing that the social security system will go broke unless he has his way this is a blatant example of overkill the measures proposed by the white house to protect the social security system it is clear that the president is interested in protecting something other than social security the tax bill that tie stampeded congress into accepting is guaranteed to produce huge budget deficits so he can keep his campaign promise to balance the budget by 1984 there is no question that the gigantic tax cut for the rich will reduce revenues and will require budget cuts beyond anything so far proposed reducing social security benefits is just another way to achieve these cuts some measures must be taken to insure social securitys immediate future but they need not be nearly as drastic as the white house proposes social security supports three separate programseach financed by a separate trust fund they are financed by a payroll tax on earningscurrently 6 65 percent for employees and 6 65 percent for employers up to a maximum of 29 775 a year first there is the old age and survivors insurance program that pays benefits to retired workers and their dependents and survivors next there is the disability insurance program that pays benefits to disabled workers and their dependents finally there is the health insurance program which is part a of the medicare program which pays for doctors bills is finance4 by monthly premiums paid by those enrolled in the program and from general tax revenues because i have encountered considerable confusion regarding some other programs i would like to set the record straight the supplemental security income program which provides a basic level of income for the aged blind and disabled is run by the social security aministration but is not part of the social security program it is paid for by general revenue tax funds and not from any of the social security trust funds a person does not have to work under social security to be eligible for ssi benefits this used to be called the old age assistance program when it was run by the states until a few years ago funds for the aid to the families with dependent children program afdc also come from general tax funds and are in no way related to social security it has surprised me to discover that many people think the programs are somehow related neither is the civil service retirement system related to social security this retirement system is funded by contributions from federal employees who are not covered by social security and matching funds from the employing agencies the social security program does have some problems that must be solved but solutions do not require the kind of severe remedies that the president has proposed in the past few years we have had historically high rates of inflation accompanied by high unemployment moreover wage rates have fallen behind price increases as a result social security has been paying out more and not collecting as much as had been anticipated it is expected that the economic picture will improve and that the social security outlook will brighten as well for the next 30 or 40 years until longrange problems begin to take hold it is apparent to me that this administration wants to mislead the public on the social security issue to achieve its own ends all through the tax debate mr reagan used the most optimistic economic assumptions to argue his case in his social security proposals he uses the very worst economic assumptions he cant have it both ways depending on which he wants to advance i dont want to mislead the people into thinking that there are no problems with the social security program the longrun problems are very serious they result from the fact that the population is aging at a time when the birthrate is declining social security is a payasyougo program where active workers pay the benefits of retired workers it is predicated on an everexpanding work force and today that work force is not growing what the reagan administration wants to do is solve the problems of the next century in the next few years none of us knows what is going to happen in the 21st century as in our private lives most of the things we worry about so much never happen none of us knows what the economic conditions will be like 30 or 40 years from now perhaps we will develop new energy sources that will expand our productive capacity beyond our wildest imagination we would not recklessly leap into solving predicted longrange problems when to do so will cause injury to millions of people right away the president wants to cut billions in benefits out of the program in the near future by discouraging early retirement 55 percent of full benefits rather than 80 percent allowed now at age 62 restricting eligibility for disability insurance limiting benefits to survivors and by taking other steps beyond what is needed it is not necessary to hurt millions of americans now when there is a good chance that such extreme measures will not be needed at allespecially if mr reagans assumptions for economic recovery should prove right in the meantime using the social security system to achieve shortterm economic ends such as a balanced budget is playing recklessly with the future of millions of americans there are a lot of things we can do we can amend the law to permit one fund to borrow from another we can allow the troubled old age and survivor insurance fund to borrow from the healthy medicare fund we can consider financing a portion of social security from general tax revenue funds there is an opportunity as well for creating standby loan authority from general funds whatever changes we decide to make should be thought through very carefully and should take effect sometime in the future we cannot simply say to americans who have spent all their working lives paying into a system that we are going to change the rules and they are going to have to make other arrangements do you say to a man or a woman 55 years old that they are going to have to start some kind of private fund for their retirement how much time do they have to build that fund many people made assumptions about retirement income based on social security they took out private insurance annuities and set up separate savings accounts or made other investments they figured out how much they would need based on how much they could expect from social security it would be heartless and unrealistic now to tell them they will have to find a way to increase their savings in the working years they have left working beyond 62 is fine for those people who want to and are able but recent studies by the social security administrat ion show that only 15 to 20 percent of those who opt out before 65 do so voluntarily most who retire before age 65 do so because of failing health or because they can no longer handle the job pressure in many cases the 62yearold worker who has labored 40 years in the steel mills or the auto plants is worn out if he works until he is 65 he may well be dead maybe that is what the administration is counting on there is something else to consider social security is a compact between the young and the old it was designed for a changing society where it is no longer possible for younger people to assume the responsibility of caring for their aged relatives because of changes in working and living conditions mr reagan wants us to return to the old world even though it is no longer possible if we fail to meet the income and medical needs of the older citizens we inevitably are going to shift this cost to the young who cannot afford it we would also create major problems in private pension funds that are tied to social security workers would demand higher employer contributions to make up the difference putting added pressure on price developments we simply cannot afford to destroy the confidence of a program that is so much a part of our society because we are worried about what might happen 30 or 40 years from nowor because mr reagan has gotten himself into an embarrassing revenue situation as the result of an illconceived tax bill"], [0.4862056374549866, 0.5137943625450134, 1, "as the

supported the jones version the grammlatta amendment passed and the president has claimed his first victory i congratulate him on final passage i voted for the amended budget resolution because even though i have reservations about the presidents economic program i believed he should have the chance to make it work i think it is important however to take an honest look at what this fight in the house of representatives this week was all about members of the house were faced with a choice between two very austere budgetsthe recommendations of the house budget committee the socalled jones resolution and the recommendations of president reagan the grammlatta resolution both represented the essence of president reagans economic plan both of these budgets made deep cuts in a wide variety of social programs both recognized the need to control the growth of federal spending both provided substantial tax cuts to individuals and to businesses to stimulate economic growth each resolution provided for a 45 billion increase in defense spending both of these resolutions set a very conservative budget in my opinion with the adoption of either budget president reagan would have won his econoniic plan the jones budget called for slightly smaller cuts in important human investment programs such as education child nutrition and youth training it also provided a somewhat smaller tax cut but it also has a deficit smaller than president reagans the grammlatta budget made deeper cuts in domestic programs provided higher tax cuts and a larger deficit both proposals were essentially very conservative documentsboth recognizing the need to cut back on runaway government spending and the need to provide incentives for individuals and businesses to invest for economic growth and make our economy healthy again it is a fallacy to say that a vote for the jones budget is a vote against the reagan program the jones budget cut 31 billion in spending and provided 38 billion in tax cutswhile moving more rapidly toward a balanced federal budget it did not reflect more of the same the jones budget called for a substantial change in the role of the federal government it is a budget that was responsive to voters demands to slash government spending and it was fashioned after the goals set by prei ldent reagan there was really very little difference betw~een the two proposals considered by the houseyet the president sold his version as the only acceptable one in recent weeks i have read thousands of cards and letters and talked with hundreds of individual constituents on my weekends at home i thought long and hard over the comments i received from the people i represent they were pretty evenly divided therefore i made my decision to vote in favor of the jones budget on the basis that it is slightly better for the state of michigan and it is a more humane budget than the grammlatta budget last year michigan ranked dead last in its return of federal dollars on taxes paid by o ur citizens the primary reason for this is that national defense money flows predominantly to the sun belt states and the west the major increases in defense spending called for by president reaganand included in both the jones and grammlatta budgetswill mean that even more tax dollars will be diverted away from michigan at the same time that increased defense spending will be diverting more of michigans tax dollars out of our state those programs that have helped our stateand the people of our stateto get through our states present financial and economic crisis h 2042 c are being cut significantly we have the highest unemployment rate in the countryand that means that there are fewer tax revenues to finance services provided by local governmentssuch as education and law enforcementand fewer dollars for state programssuch as mental health care and child welfare programs at a time when financial constraints are forcing cutbacks in these services provided by our local and state governments the federal government is cutting its contributions to these same services leaving it to the states to make up the difference the state of michigan does not have the money these cuts will be realized and felt throughout the eighth district and michigan the jones budget would have been slightly less harsh for example the grammlatta budget cuts funding for education by 25 perent this will cost saginaw schools 2 4 million and bay city schools 1 million the jones budget would have cut education by only 10 percentstill a significant cut the same is true for health carethe grammlatta budget cuts the federal contribution by 25 percent jones would have cut it by 10 percent both proposals require cuts in the school lunch program the city of saginaw would lose 5 9 percent of its school lunch funds under jones but 18 6 percent under grammlatta the lapeer school district loses 22 7 percent of its funds under jones but 69 5 percent under grammlatta one out of ten in michigan receive food stamp assistance the grammlatta budget cuts food stamps by 1 65 billion the jones budget called for a 1 billion cut the difference means 20 million in food benefits to the people of michigan who are using the program because unemployment in our state is twice the national average i could go on but as i stated earlier both the jones and the grammlatta budgets were very austere budgets in line with the presidents goals both called for cuts in federal programs almost acrosstheboard cuts that are substantial neither was a budget that just cut welfare these budgets both cut deep into almost all government services and in michigan it means cuts not just in federal services but also in those services provided by the state and local governments despite the reports in the media president reagan could not have lost on this vote in the house of representatives whether the jones budget was adopted or whether the grammlatta budget passed the president would have received a budget that makes deep cuts in federal spending provides investmentoriented tax cuts and markedly increases defense spending furthermore it is important to remember that the passage of a budget in the house is not a final step even had the jones budget been adopted in the house the final budget would have been a compromise negotiated with the senate passage of the jones budget however would have left some negotiating room with the senate as to who will receive the greatest tax cuts and which programs will recieve the biggest budget cuts the cuts would be maderegardless of the action taken by the house this week my vote for jones honored my commitment to reduce federal spending and cut taxes i have serious reservations about whether the reagan plan will workwhether it really can bring down inflation increase economic growth and balance the federal budget by 1984 the plan makes some very boldand empirically unsupportablepredictions about savings rates growth employment and inflation rates in the next several years alreadyat least according to todays newspapersthe stock market is pessimistic about the presidents projections if these predictions prove wrong we could have higher inflation record budget deficits and aneconomy in worse shape than it is today the plan represents a gambleand we are told that we should accept in on faith i hope in fact i pray that this economic plan will work i wish the president and his plan every success"], [0.4870910048484802, 0.5129089951515198, 1, "a heavy responsibility has been laid on all of us in this chamber today in the name of budgetary restraint we are called upon to defer and even dismantie a broad range of federal programs long regarded as essential to the wellbeing of our society but before we come to a decision on these proposals i believe it is imperative that we examine most carefully the mechanism that has been offered for arriving at that decision the reconciliation process the members should understand clearly that if this mechanism is accepted on this issue it will have a significant and i submit unfortunate impact on the way in which congress legislates now and in the future in formulating the congressional budget act the reconciliation concept was suggested by charles schultze who proposed that congress use the same method for finalizing its budget as is used by the executive branch the legislative history also supports the position that reconciliation was intended to implement the determinations made in the second or final budget resolution for a fiscal year but that was not the case last yearthe first time reconciliation was implemented on the spending sidenor is it the situation this year there are those who say that in these unprecedented economic times reconciliation is a necessary procedure but it must also be said that inclusion of reconciliation in the first budget resolution significantly diminishes the responsibilities of thq authorizing comnmittees for making policy decisions in a meaningful fashion it precludes meaningful analysis forecloses debate imposes serious time constraints and serves to undermine rather than strengthen the overall lekislative and budget processes if it is the decision of congress to reduce federal spending then so be it but i do not believe the mechanism for that decision should be reconciliation in the first budget resolution nor should reconciliation in any spending resolution call for spending reductions in the mutyears neither approach is contemplated by the budget act reconciliation was designed to bring spending in line with the budget ceiling for a particular year not future years section 310 of the budget act is clear on this as is section 301 b 2 which specifically limits ireconciliation to the enactment of spending legislation for the coming fiscal year we can achieve the reductions necessary in fiscal years 198284 by lowering the total budget ceilings for those years when we enact the budget resolutions attempting to force those reductions now prior to consideration of thle budget resolution for those years does violence to the budget act and robs congress of the flexibility it must have if federal spending is to be controlled and sound fiscal policy achieved in addition it is my understanding that the senate budget committee has directed the senate committees to cut through the reconciliation process authorization as wvell as direct spending programs in some cases this involves reductions in programs which have not as yet been authorized in all cases it involves matters which fall within the spending jurisdiction of the appropriations committees and should not under the budget act be targeted for reduction by the authorizing committees i for one hope that this house would resist anymovement in this direction in the upcoming conference on the budget resolution one of the primary purposes of the budget act was to fashion a process whereby the authorization and appropriation committees would make spending and fiscal decisions in an orderly and meaningful manner however that is not the situation we see today nearly 71 years after the adoption of the budget act recognizing this i believe that the time is now ripe to begin work on making the budget process an even more useful exercise by reaffirming the intended role of the authorizing committees in talking to other members i know that there is great interest in doing so and i am committed to wvorking with all members to insure thle success of that effort i would now like to address the issues contained in the socalled grammlatta substitute which are of concern to the committee on public works and transportation the funding levels assumed for some of our major program areas and the reconciliation instructions given to our committee with respect to public works issues the grammlatta substitute differ from the budget committee resolution in three specific program areas urban mass transit operating subsidies adap and the economic developmnent administration in function 400 transportation the grammlatta substitute reduces the administrations proposals for mass transit operating subsidies for fiscal year 1982 by 260 million in budget authority and 130 million in outlays through acceleration of the phaseout for these subsidies coiiversely the house budget committee resolution while assuming the presidents spending level for fiscal year 1982 rejects the phaseout and proposes for fiscal year 1983 an additional 400 million in budget authority and 200 million in outlays and for fiscal year 1984 750 million in budget authority and 500 million in outlays in function 450 community and regional development the graninilatta substitute restores for fiscal year 1982 100 million in budget authority and 12 million in outlays to thle administrations proposals for eda cvelopment loan and other grant programs it goes on however to assume its termination at the end of fiscal year 1982 thle budget committee resolution assumes for fiscal year 1982 a funding level of 350 million in budget authority and 100 million in outlays with sufficient funding for fiscal years 1983 and 1984 the grammlatta substitute also assumes thle administrations figures for adap 450 million in fiscal year 1982 and 324 million in budget authority for the airport trust funds facilities and equipment program the budget committee assumed in its resolution 750 million and 400 million respectively for these programs in all three instances i believe that the budget committees resolution more accurately strikes a balance between spending cuts and program needs of equal concern to me is the reconciliation directive contained in thle orammlatta substitute unlike the budget committee resolution it directs the committee on public works and transportation to achieve cuts in authorizations as well as spendinga practice which i have already indicated has raised a number of concerns on the senate side in addition it imposes on our committee an almost impossible task to address by june 15one short month awaylegislation in the area of eda regional commission highway safety mass transit operating subsidies federalaid highways epa construction grants tva and army corps of engineers water project construction grants just in the area of highways for example it must be said that it has always been our committees intention to undertake next year a comprehensive review of the whole federalaid highway program how are we to address in 1 month the needs and concerns of this program or any other and really do justice to the legislative process to do so i submit would turn the dream the president spoke of last tuesday evening into a nightmare i do not challenge the immediate need for restraint in this budget i ask only that in making our decisions we use a little discretion we have an enormous capital investment in the american economic structure that ii 1740 c cannot and must not be sacrificed for illusory shortterm benefits it is precisely because i share the presidents vision of a revitalized reindustrialized america that i urge continued adequate funding for the public works programs in which so much of our national treasure has been invested reductions across the whole range of federal activities may indeed be necessary at this time but they should not fall disproportionately upon the very programs on which rests all hope of longterm lasting economic stability private enterprise cannot do its job without a functioning system of public highways airports and airways mass transit water and sewer lines and a host of other services which government alone can provide but the sad truth is that this complex system is breaking down today because we have failed to protect our capital investment today our funding of public works as a percentage of the gross national product is less that half of what it was in 1965 1 the interstate highway system now almost completed after 25 years and some 80 billion of public money is wearing out faster than it can be repaired just about 1 in every 10 miles of the system is in need of immediate resurfacingand that is the very best of our highways bridges all over the country are collapsing sewers and water lines are rotting away city transit systems are breaking down billions of dollars in coal for export pile up in antiquated seaports and our airports are congested almost beyond belief for lack of development funds mr chairman i refuse to believe that this congress will accept as its public works policy build it and forget it the people of this nation have invested their toil and treasure in the public works foundations of our economy it is up to the congress now to protecl that

serious error in its central american policy if it attempts to analyze the recent elections in el salvador in the manner in which we analyze the elections in our own country the voter turnout on sunday clearly exceeded prevoting expectations though it does not at this time appear to be as big as the turnout in 1977 that voter participation is the product of several factors the elections were held largely in cities under the control of mayors appointed by the junta people who have a personal stake with an interest in generating the greatest voter turnout possible failure of the mayors to do so might have been seen as an indication of insufficient commitment to the junta and the military with predictable consequences fear by individual votes of retaliation by the right wing for failing

responsible for vicious atrocities and repression against the people elections have historically beenused by the right wing and the military to legitimize their position however as degraded as the democratic process has been in that country this election at least offered the salvadoran people a means of expressing their rejection of violence the election however does not mean that el salvador has a democracy the united states cannot regard elections during a civil war by a repressive government as the means by which a people democratically elect a legitimate government it would be the most dangerous kind of wishful thinking on the part of the united states to put behind us or now to excuse the circumstances under which this election was held or to believe that the election has ended them the cornerstone of the reagan administration policy on el salvador has been that the march 28 elections would produce an election victory for the christian democratic party and for president jose napolean duarte the administration sought support in congress and among the american people for continued and increasing military and economic aid to the government of el salvador on the grounds that the aid was necessary to strengthen the moderate civilian elements within the ruling junta the commitment of the christian democratic party to social and economic reform was used to justify a policy of unitedstates intervention and support for a rightwing oppressive military guilty of gross violations of human rights that unitedstates policy suffered from a fatal defect in that president duarte

used in the past to legitimatize a repressive right wing government in 1972 the military deprived president duarte of his rightful victory in the presidential election i became concerned that even if president duarte won this election the outcome would not alter the fundamental defect in the duarte governmentthe inability of civilian moderate forces to exercise control over the military my fear was that the election would legitimatize the de facto control that gen jose guillermo garcia exercises over the government and the people the election however did not produce the result around which the state department had structured unitedstates policy while the christian democratic party won over 40 percent of the vote the majority of the 60 seats in the legislative assembly will be held by right wing parties the extreme right wing nationalist republican alliance arena founded only last year by roberto daubuisson will be the second largest party with approximately 29 percent of the seats the right wing parties will now attempt to form a coalition government to exclude president duarte and the christian democrats the reagan administration will attempt to insure that some christian democrats are included in any new government the administration may also succeed in persuading the right wing coalition not to make daubuisson leader of a coalition government the administration correctly recognizes that it would be impossible for it to obtain support in congress for a government in which daubuisson is either the leader or highly visible the coalition government will not be any more deserving of military assistance from the united states if daubuisson is not a member of the government we should not delude ourselves into believing that all will go well daubilission is excluded from the government we should not think that our policy in el salvador suddenly went wrong only on sunday because duarte did not receive a majority of the votes our policy was wrong before then and is wrong now because it has emphasized support for the military in el salvador over civilian reformist elements within the government and among the people because the united states has failed to insist that the government of el salvador meet the conditions on aid imposed by congress in the foreign assistance act of 1981 as a result of my visit to el salvador i was convinced of the wisdom of the conditions that we in the congress imposed upon that aid we required among other conditions that the government of el salvador make a goodfaith effort to enter into negotiations with all political factions within el salvador that the government make progress toward ending the abuse of human rights by the military the conditions set in law by congress would constitute a sound basis for unitedstates policy in el salvador the united states cannot lose sight of the longrange implications of our policy in that country we cannot give elections in el salvador the same value that we would give to elections in the united states we cannot pretend that an election in el salvador forms the same basis for legitimate government that an election in the united states does our country enjoys longestablished democratic institutions americans were holding democratic elections in the united states before there was actually a united states such elections have almost never been held in el salvadorperhaps twice in its entire history i urge the house the congress the american people to reaffirm their commitment to human rights as a basis for unitedstates policy in el salvador i would very much like to see the united states persuade whatever government is formed in el salvador to undertake negotiations necessary to end the civil war through a political solution my concern is for the people of el salvador who have been the victims of violence from both the right and the left i am deeply concerned however that a coalition of rightwing parties will attempt to win a military victory that will escalate tremendously the violence within el salvador the real victims of such escalation will not be the forces of the leftwing or the rightwing they will be the inno cent the young the old women and children i do not believe that the united states should be providing arms that will be used to kill those innocent victims that concern should be fundamental to our policy whether the president of el salvador is jose napolean duarte or roberto daubuisson or some other person i ask unanimous consent to include in the record a penetrating analysis of the situation in el salvador

committe for the fine and outstanding work they have all done in putting this bill together the committee has spent hours after hours in committee meetings and caucus meetings and other meetings trying to put the best provisions together to make this an excellent tax bill everyone here has something against one provision or another everyone has a better idea on many provisions but i think on the whole what we have arrived at is a bill that brings together many many elements of our country and does provide for us a blueprint for the economic recovery that our president and all of us want there are three major differences between the two major tax bills before us today there has been a lot of talk in the media and around the country in the past few days that these two bills are essentially the same people have said that they are tweedledumn and tweedledee and that they are really calling for the same kind of tax cuts i do not think the people that are saying that have taken the time to really look at these two bills because there are essential and important differences that i hope all of us will consider the first and most important differenceand it is always the important difference in a tax cutis who gets it and how much do they get on the individual side if members will take the time to go out in the hall here and look at the charts before they vote they are going to find that there are some very real differences many of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have buttons on that say i plan to live and i hope we all do live but i think that people in this country are worried not just about what is going to happen 3 or 4 or 5 years from now they are worried about what is going to happen next year and the year after that i think the evidence is clear that if you make under 50 000 the house ways and means bill is better for you let me just read some figures about average tax cuts individuals between 5 000 and 10 000 income get 66 under the repubican plan and 138 under the democratic plan if you earn between 15 000 and 20 000 you get 246 under the republican plan but 342 under the democratic plan if you earn between 30 000 and 50 000 you get 751 under the republican plan but 1 011 under the democratic plan but if you earn over 200 000 you get 22 000 under the republican plan but only 10 000 under the democratic plan i understand what out colleagues are saying on the other side of the aisle that in the third and fourth and fifth and years after their tax cut will do better but that statement assumes i suppose that the congress is going to be disbanded this year and we are never going to come back we are never going to look again at a tax cut we are never going to consider cutting taxes again as the president said the other night we cut taxes five times in the last 10 years i think it is clear that congress can and will take a look at taxes in 2 years and enact tax cuts if it makes economic sense the second major difference between the bills has to do with the business cuts the republican version is geared primarily to businesses that are large and capitalintensive and our plan while it helps those businesses a grea deal also targets relief to buslness s that are small and medium sized and have a great deal of activity in services and information in what economists tell us is the future of our economic growth let me cite a statistic in the last 10 years we produced more jobs in ratio to population than at any time in our past we have accommodated the baby boom and the women in our population and we have done it while manufacturing jobs were going from 24 percent of the jobs in this country to 13 percent of the jobs that means that the growth in jobs has been in smalland mediumsized businesses in high technology and information and in services but i submit to the members that the republican bill does very very little for those businesses but does most of what it does for businesses where jobs are declining i only ask the members do we not want a bill that treats all businesssmall business medium business large business businesses that are capitalintensive and businesses that are laborintensive in a way that they can all grow and all prosper and all produce jobs the democratic version simply does that better whether one is talking about the graduated corporate rate whether one is talking about expensing over 1053 or whether one is talking about the lowering of the overall corporate rate all three are better for small and mediumsized businesses the last difference and perhaps the most important is the economy f would say to my friends on the other side of the aisle if we all live and i hope we do for 2 or 3 or 4 years that the plan that is being proposed today by the republicans will produce for us higher interest rates and higher deficits because of the effect of the lockedin third year and because of the effect of indexing the financial managers and economists of america tell us again and again that high deficits and interest rates are choking this country the republican bill lacks the flexibility we need to deal with high deficits i

bipartisan and noncontroversial bill and i am pleased to join with my colleagues in supporting its passage i first want to commend the members who have worked on this bill i think we have dealt with this bill in a responsible manner we have given our seabed mining companies what they need an interim legal framework under which they can proceed with their preparations for mining the seabed at the came time we have produced a bill that is supportive of our governments efforts to achieve a comprehensive law of the sea treaty and we have handled the timing of the legislation so as to minimize any adverse impact on the law of the sea conference in a true spirit of compromise the committee of lurisdiction have reeonciled all the differences among the varous versions of the bill which is what enables us to bring this bill before the house under suspension of the rules i think this is a remarkable achievement for which the members are to be congratulated i particularly commend the chairman of the merchant marine committee and his staff for their hard work and their constructive and cooperative attitude on this bill without their efforts we could not have produced this result this soon since it is at my suggestion that the floor manager is bringing this bill up under suspension of the rules i would like to comment on my reasons for suggesting that procedure at first glance this bill might seem too important and complex for that procedure however a similar bill passed the house in the last congress by a vote of 312 to 80 the changes that were made in the bill in this congress were carefully considered and agreed to by four different committees obviously no member is entirely satisfled with the bill but i am aware of no opposition on any of the four committees to passage of the bill in its current form in fact there is agreement among all the committees the administration and the mining industry that the earliest possible passage of the bill is imperative in view of the fact that the bill is both urgent and noncontroversial and in view of the crowded floor calendar i think the suspension procedure is appropriate the committee on foreign affairs has been involved with seabed mining legislation since it was first reported out of the merchant marine and interior committees in 1977 since that time the objective of the foreign affairs committee has remained the same to fashion a bill that would support and contribute to the achievement of this nations overriding interest in successfully concluding a law of the sea treaty while at the same time protecting the interests of our seabed mining industry this objective has required our attention to both the timing and the substance of the bill and in dealing with both timing and substance we have had to recognize the opinion of most countries of the worldeven though we may not agree with that opinionthat the united states does not have the right under international law to mine the seabed outside the context of a treaty premature enactment of legislation or enactment of legislation without certain necessary provisions could have scuttled the tre ty i join in bringing this bill to the floor at this time wit h the sincere intent and belief that it poses no threat to the negotiations or to those countries that do not have seabed mining capabilities several provisions of the bill are important in that regard first under the bill commercial mining of seabed nodules is prohibited before january 1 1988 this provision is intended to provide a reasonable period of time to bring a treaty into force before seabed mining begins second this is explicitly interim legislation on its own terms it will be superseded by a law of the sea treaty so that unitedstates seabed mining operations will be conducted under the terms of the treaty third while the bill states the intent of congress that the rights of us mining companies be protected in any treaty there is no statement as there was in earlier versions of the bill that the terms of the treaty should necessarily conform to the terms of the legislation finally should a treaty not be in force by january 1 1988 the bill provides that some of the proceeds of any seabed mining that may commence after that date must be deposited in a revenuesharing fund for future sharing with the international community under the terms of a treaty i want to say a few words about the socalled grandfather language in title 2 of the bill section 201 states that a law of the sea treaty should provide unitedstates mining companies assured and nondiscriminatory access under reasonable terms and conditions and security of tenure and that the attainment of these goals should be determined by the totality of the provisions of the treaty rather than by any one article or provision this section recognizes that a treaty negotiated by 150 countries with widely divergent interests cannot be expected to provide terms and conditions as favorable as unitedstates legislation drawn specifically to promote the development of our seabed mining industry the administration has testified many times and this section recognizes that a treaty will provide for additional financial obligations and other new requirements not contained in this legislation such as the transfer of technology on fair and reasonable terms and conditions it is our intent that section 201 does not exclude such treaty provisions section 201 simply states the realistic expectation that these and any other treaty provisions taken together must not impose significant new economic burdens that have the effect of preventing the continuation of mining operations on a viable economic basis i have said that no member is totally satisfied with this bill i would be remiss if i did not mention that i am deeply concerned about the implications of the unitedstates flag requirements in the bill the mining consortia are multinational in character and i do not understand how only one of the countries particiiating in a consortium can expect to reserve for itself the lions share of the shipping business associated with seabed mining foreign governments have expressed their opposition to these provisions in very strong terms in recognition that i would not have the votes i did not press for a procedure which would have permitted me to offer an amendment to delete or soften these provisions although i would have preferred to do so i can only express my hope that these provisions do not lead to the breakup of the consortia on the other hand i am gratified we were able to include sufficiently flexible provisions in the compromise bill with regard to the location of processing plants the successful conclusion of a law of the sea treaty is important to the national security of the united states when the united states entered these negotiations several years ago our principal objective was to secure provisions that would preserve the freedom of maritime movement necessary for unitedstates air and naval mobility and the projection of our national power as events in iran and afghanistan demonstrate this objective has never been mire important it is achieved in the current treaty text it is my sincere hope that our delegation to the law of the sea conference will be able to achieve a treaty that meets our interests in other areas as well that the senate will ratify such a treaty and that our mining industry will support such ratification ambassador richardson has written an article for foreign affairs examining the national security implications of a law of the sea treaty which i include at the end of my remarks in short i believe the bill before us meets the foreign policy and national security interests of this country as well as the interests of the seabed mining industry and i urge the members to vote for the motion to suspend the rules and pass the bill from foreign affairs spring 19801"]], "top_incorrect":

and regulations that are consistent with the intent of this legislative body this proposed regulation is not consistent with congressional intent second under the procedure that was employed by the commission in the formulation of this rule many grants were provided to the consumer advocate groups in fact 140 000 was made available to such groups to create the body of testimony that has been referred to by some of the speakers before me third on the proposed rule itself it has two fatal defects first it does not cover all sales for consumers therefore it is anticon sumer for at least 50 percent of the sales in the usedcar market fourth the major defect in this proposed rule is section 455 6 that section is intellectually dishonest it says that inspections are not required and then delineates in some 50 pages for 52 000 words tests or procedures that should be used to carry out the inspection those tests are contrary to the statement in section 455 6 that no inspections are required the federal trade commission resubmitted its trade regulation rule on the sale of used cars at the beginning of this session of congress pursuant to the congressional veto procedures of the ftc improvements act of 1980 although the disapproval resolution i introduced last session was favorably reported by the committee on energy and commerce section 21 of the improvements act requires resubmission of the rule in the event congress adjourns sine die prior to the expiration of the 90day review period and before actions necessary to disapprove the rule are completed accordingly the rule was resubmitted for congressional review and i found it necessary to introduce a new disapproval resolution house concurrent resolution 256 and its companion in the senate senate concurrent resolution 60 which is before the house today unfortunately the commission has come back with the identical usedcar rule signals from both houses were quite clear that there were serious objections to the rules known defect disclosure requirement in fact but for the delay in consideration of house concurrent resolution 178 last session the rule would have been disapproved and this entire exercise would be unnecessary both senate and house commerce committees favorably reported disapproval resolutions on the rule by votes of 14 to 4 and 27 to 14 respectively the house report indicated quite clearly its concerns with the defect disclosure provision moreover addional views urged the commission to modify the rule prior to its resubmission in order to assure congressional approval and to expedite the rules review however despite strong congressional urgings the rule was resubmitted in its identical form i find this particularly distressing because of the commissions apparent desire to stay on a colision course with the congress with respect to this issue we are here today because the federal trade commission just plain fouled up its assignment from this congress they have done well in drafting a regulation which will end the usedcar buyers questions about warranty coverage that is good and they have made a fine attempt at putting some real consumer teeth in usedcar sales that also is laudable but they have also added cost to the price of a usedcar and opened a pandoras box of lawsuits fines and outright neglect of usedcar problems with their known defects section i insist today that with the poorly drafted known defects section intact this regulation must not become law in recent years congress had abdicated a fundamental responsibility of oversight for federal agencies and the result has been a dramatic proliferation of immeasurable costly and often nonsensical rules and regulations affecting every entity in our great nation this bureaucratic explosion and impact has caused a feeling of harassment and intrusion for every citizen and businessag enterprise from main street to the farm and factory the time is now for congress to redeem itself and emancipate our citizens from this regulation mania by returning the oversight function to the legislative branch to insure that the policles and intent of the people as represented by the congress are prudently pursued and administered within strict policy guidelines this ftcproposed rule is an excellent point to commence and communicate that congress directs the nonelected agencies to carry out legislative policies or such nonconforming actions will be vetoed by congress this proposed rule relevant to the secondary objective of requiring certification of all known mechanical defects defies the explicit direction of the house commerce committee in its report of 1979 pertaining to the federal trade improvements act which stated congress never intended to give the commission authority under the provisions of public law 93637 or any other provision of law to require inspections of vehicles or to require any motor vehicle or any of its components be warranted the overall goal of this proposal which congress initiated by legislative policy namely to minimize fraud deception dishonesty verbal misrepresentation and deceit is laudable and enthusiastically endorsed for our citizens and consumers the primary goal of this proposed rule to implement congressional intent and policy is to disclose the existence of warranty coverage by dealers for the consumer is praiseworthy and needed this feature is vigorously endorsed by all parties affected by this proposed rule in addition there is no objection with the feature to institute an as is category as proposed by the rule also the recommendation to permit a prepurchase inspection by the buyers mechanic or other independent third party either on premises or off premises is endorsed as a positive approach however the proposed rules secondary goal to mandate the businessman or woman to attest to all known defects in their product in 14 major systems with the stated language in the proposed feature that a thorough inspection is not required is preposterous for example how can a business person attest unequivocally to defects in the engine system without an extensive examination it is impossible to establish the condition of an engines rings rods pistons camshaft points spark plugs and so forth without an actual examination however this proposal anticipates that a dealer knows of defects such a test inspection or review would obviously require dismantling certain areas to prudently evaluate the same another example could be the braking system how can our business person attest to defects without a physical examination of the system you cannot see worn brake shoes or metal on metal brake fluid leakage in the wheel cylinder faulty brake shoe springs or solenoid deficiencies without inspecting the same again you have to dismantle many features of the brake system to prudently evaluate the same it is my contention that no responsible dealer can inform you in writing of certain defects in a cars major systems without a thorough physical examination contrary to the proposed rules language on this known defects section stating that the dealer does not have to inspect used cars offered for sale to discover defects or for any other reason it is my judgment that a dealer could not absolutely attest to major defects and certain defects without external and internal examinationinspection of the cars major systems if a dealer persisted in not inspecting and attesting to defects he or she had better have a substantial supply of dollars to pay the 10 000 fines to ftc on a regular basis thus it is predictable that inspection or test evaluations would have to be adopted by any prudent business person this development would be a costly unintended feature by the proposed rule and these increased costs will naturally be passed on to the consumer for example a dealer who is responsibly attesting to known defects and has adopted a physical inspection procedure might likely do the following he or she would tend to undervalue the used car tradein as a hedge against the unknown costly defects that could surface later in a charge of concealment and then price the vehicle at a normal value as a further hedge to insure ample cash flow td facilitate an inspection system with undoubted increases in litigation this possible development is obviously anticonsumer and not in harmony with the stated intent to benefit consumers the result is an undesired price increase by some 150 to 300 for the buyer it is my judgment that numerous aspects of section 455 6 in this proposed rule can only cause mass confusion intentional and nonintentional misinterpretations nonuniformity questionable compliance inconsistent enforcement and beaucoup litigation in all 50 states i predict this because of the ambiguous nature of terms and intentions which clearly lack explicit definitional characteristics and the absence of administrative compliance guidelines it is further predictable by the proposed ftc rules discrimination against business community sales there will be an expansion of used cars traded in the casual market this unregulated market now accounts for some 50 percent of transactions and could easily expand to 60 or 70 percent by implementing this ftc rule the casual market provides no consumer protection for the buyer as the purchasor accepts the vehicle as is further one can predict with certainty that fertile legal minds will find a legal way to maximize sales in the casual market category finally on predictions if the known defects section is implemented in the complete rule it does not take a genius to project a major expansion in the category of no implied warrantyas it such designation will mean the consumer will pay all costs for any repairs needed when you buy the vehicle or after the time sale the dealer would make no written promises about the cars condition and again no true benefit for the consumer in conclusion this proposed ftc rule has several positive features benefitting the business community and the consumer further most of thege features in the proposed rule have captured the intent of congress for implementation of positive protection for the business person and consumer however it is section 455 6 of this proposed rule which is in violation of congressional intent and policy and needs to be removed so as to allow l ie other significant features of the rule proposal to be adopted and impleinented it is my understanding that the ftc can amend their rule to be in compliance with congressional intent by striking the controversial and confusing section i wholeheartedly urge the ftc to do this so the conforming positive features can move ahead for the benefit of all parties the controversial section 455 6 needs to b returned to the drawing boards its inclusion can only mean further decimation to an already crippled automobiletruck industry an industry which has seen 2 500 agencies close in the past year affecting some 125 000 employees a market too quickly eroding to foreign competition and now a proposed costly feature to the usedcar sector that will only lead to more increased transportation costs for the consumer this rule pretends to protect"], [0.5142488479614258, 0.5142488479614258, 0, "on july 16 1981 harry chapin singer songwriter humanitarian founder of world hunger year died in a tragic automobile accident known by so many of us in congress for his whirlwind dynamism and tireless unswerving commitment to ending world hunger harry chapin inspired an invigorating confidence that it was possible for policies and programs to be changed that the energies resources and great talents of our nation could be mobilized to breathe a fresh new life into the great humanitarian principles for which we want our nation to stand in one of his many finely crafted probing ballads harry queried now if a man tried to take his time on earth and prove before he died what one mans life could be worth well i wonder what would happen to this world during his short lifetime harry proved to so many people what his life was worth he was vision confidence inspiration unbridled energy and selfless dedication to others and his life matteredhe made a difference he constantly reminded us that hundreds of millions of people suffer from hunger and malnutrition that hunger makes every day for them a struggle whether or not their plight makes the nightly news or the morning paper as harry reviewed the cold statistics of hunger they became even more dramatic he reminded us that hunger is most vicious when it stalks the young that 100 000 children go blind each year because of vitamin deficiencies that in some poorer countries almost half the children die before reaching the age of 5 mostly from nutritionrelated diseases and that among the survivors handicaps of learning behavior and work capacity are widespread due to inadequate diets and recurring illness harry would repeat to himself and to millions of others that these conditions did not have to exist and people listened and they read and they learned that we do have the basic technological knowhow and resources to alleviate the hunger problem it became plain to those who began to familiarize themselvbs with the many dimensions and facets of the hunger problem that our task is formidable indeed but that is where harry came in many of my colleagues will attest to the fact that is was difficult if not impossible to avoid becoming totally enveloped in harrys electric enthusiasm he sparked a realization that the job was not going to get any easier that the time had come to roll up our sleeves to construct a comprehensive strategy against hunger more finely tuning those programs with a demonstrated record of success and terminating those programs which actually exacerbated the hunger problem i first met harry during the summer of 1977 he had come to washington seeking support for an idea he and his wife sandy had conceived creating a presidential commission on world hunger to find ways that our nation could develop more effective policies to combat hunger and malnutrition more comfortable in the jeans and casual shirts and shoes his fans recognized him in harry had come to town in a conservative threepiece suit that lobbying suit as harry liked to call it was to get quite a workout during the next year in between the hundreds of concerts he performedmore than half to benefit the hungerfighting activities of his world hunger year and food policy center organizationshe would return to washington to lobby for his hunger commission singlehandedly harry stormed the capitol along with me harry persuaded our former colleague rick nolan and senators pat leaiiy and bob dole to introduce a resolution urging the president to establish the commission he soon generated enough interest in the conmmission to attract 265 cosponsors in the house and 51 in the senate the presidential commission on world hunger was finally established in 1978 during the course of the next 2 years harry never missed a commission meeting often exhausted after a night of performing at a concert and the logistical nightmare of grabbing any available means of transportation to get back to washington for the commission meeting the next day harry nevertheless injected a spirit of infectious enthusiasm into those meetings he was the conscience of the commission everurging us to explore the deeply rooted causes of hunger and prodding us to produce a final report which did not equivocate did not pull any punches in detailing those actions our nation would have to take if the hunger problem was to be resolved harry chapin led our commissions efforts to involve the public in our deliberations and to explore ways to mobilize public opinion in support of comprehensive policy initiatives against hunger the commissions report did not reflect unanimous support for each of its findings or conclusions with differences of opinion noted in our report but we did provide the chief executive and the american public with some good thoughtful recommendations producing a document which has served as a vehicle to stimulate muchneeded public discussion about the dimensions of and threats posed by world hunger the end of the commission did not end harry chapins commitment to ending hunger it was but a new beginning meeting with him on a number of occasions during this past year harry expressed his everpresent concern that congress and the administration commit itself to developing new hunger policies he continued to pound upon the doors of staid indifference to the global suffering and instability that hunger breeds i always had to listen very carefully when harry spoke because he could pack into 5 minutes more thoughtful innovative ideas than anyone i have known in a conversion he was a master at conceptually changing gears launching a fusillade of incisive questions comments and proposals on a variety of topics it was as if he were afraid he would not have the time to discuss and to do all those things that truly mattered to him there is an empty space now where once there was boundless energy and unfettered contagious enthusiasm calling for an end to world hunger harry once asked and if our future lies on the final line are we brave enough to see the signals and the signs resolving the complicated global problem of hunger will not be an easy task it will be that much more difficult with the absence of a prodding insistent force such as harry chapin but world hunger does place our future on the final line harry took the time to see the signals and the signs of an awesome menacing problem which if left to fester would visit an unprecedented catastrophe on us all he bravely confronted powerful institutional impediments to change and individuals revering the status quo he underscored the urgent need for courageous decisions if our nation were to act against hunger while the best opportunities for success still existed we greatly miss harry chapin our heartfelt thoughts and prayers go out to his wife sandy and their five children jamie jason jond jenny and josh during this grievous period but those of us who harry touched so deeply who remember the hopefilled strains of his songs who recall his unfailing commitment to others will not let harrys vision and dream be forgotten i urge my colleagues to find in the spirit of harry chapin their own determination to channel the necessary resources

census bureau estimates there are between 3 5 and 6 million illegal aliens in the united states with an added half million entering each year other sources have suggested there are over 12 million

certification the majority has forever foreclosed the attorney general or the courts from offering relief where relief may be needed in other words we need our crops planted and picked despite possible hangups in the administrative process the safety valve continues to be a necessity another straitjacket provision of our committee amendments is the failure to allow an extension of time of employment for h2 workers beyond 8 months except those grandfathered in such as sheepherders timbermen and cattlemen being unable to predict what the future may hold in terms and needs of agricultural employment it would seem appropriate to provide for future contingencies to allow an extension for over 8 months in extenuating circumstances in the public interest the committee amendments also require a cap on admissions of h2 workers unless the department of labor can certify to the attorney general and to congress that it can adequately enforce the program i believe the department of labors failures should not be imposed on employers who may comply in good faith with the law and need workers a cap especially not this cap is not the proper way to assure enforcement this cap is based on the number of foreign workers admitted in the 1982 year prior to enactment of this legislation therefore this cap would be unrealistically low in view of protections of future needs of agricultural workers because of the new employer sanctions the committee amendments would prohibit the certification of h2 work ers where there is a strike or lockout concerning a labor dispute as de fined by ins regulations in establishing definitions for strike lockout and labor dispute it would seem the secretary of labor is the more appropriate authority to define such terms under his regulatory authority rather than establishing those definitions in the law particularly considering we have not had any testimony explaining the technicalities of interpretation of these terms by adopting the ins regulations the committee amendments recognize the agency with the least expertise in the area and ignore those agencies with more expertise over labor disputes such as the national labor relations board and the department of labor there are certain provisions in the committee amendments that are just unacceptable to those who endorse an equitable and workable h2 program for instance the committee amendments claim to equalize payments by employers by requiring employers to pay social security and unemployment to foreign h2 workers in my opinion such payments amount to a windfall for the h2 workers who would be getting more in their takehome pay than domestic workers this amounts to favored treatment to h2 workers and is not fair to unitedstates workers besides this equalization allows those payments to leave this country rather than staying home where they could improve our own economy as well as creaing a regulatory straitjacket for the agencies enforcing the h2 program the committee amendments fail to allow employers fair procedures in securing workers the committee amendments require employers to file an application for ceitification of foreign workers at least 80 days before date of need a time that may be long before an employer will even know if he will need workers this extensive time requirement accommodates only those who wish to create a disincentive to hire foreign workers under the present regulations and the committee amendments employers are required to accept domestic employees who apply for employment for 50 percent of the period for which foreign workers have been certified this requirement nay mean an employer will have to hire well over 100 percent of his needs instead i support the provisions of the original judiciary committee bill which would allow a certification to remain effective only if the employers continue to accept domestic workers up until the time the aliens depart for work with the employers in requiring the employers to hire domestic workers before foreign workers the obligation should only extend to those domestic workers who are able willing and qualified standards parallel to the judiciary committee standards my concern for labor standards protections for workers is the reason i attempted to work out a compromise with the majority of our committee the compromise never materialized instead of in effect codifying existing regulations as the committee amendments do i would require the secretary of labor in consultation with the attorney general and the department of agriculture to establish new employment standards which are at least comparable to those under current regulations some flexibility is needed and all current regulations may not be applicable to this new law in their present form there will be many changes in procedures and enforcement this whole bill will bring about berause of these new concepts for instance employer sanctions and amnesty there is a need for at least moderate flexibility in regulatory writing finally the committee amendments contain a private right of action it is my understanding such a provision is not needed to protect domestic workers the employment offer to domestic workers if accepted by them becomes an oral contract enforceable under current contract law additionally many foreign countries particularly the british west indies contract with employers in order to police the em ployers job offers therefore those countries can enforce those contracts against growers in this country another statutory right of action for either domestic or foreign workers is not needed should not be created and is redundant as to the discriminatory aspects of this legislation which mr hawkins amendments accepted by the committee seek to address i can appreciate his concern but oppose his means the committee amendments in effect authorize the immigration board to determine whether an applicant was discriminated against on the basis of race or national origin discrimination already outlawed by title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 title vii however already contains sufficient protection of applicants to allay the concern that employers would refuse to hire applicants who appear to be foreign under title vii employers are prohibited from failing to hire any individual because of such individuals race color or national origin title vii also establishes an elaborate administrative scheme for the handling of complaints of discrimination and allows complainants to bring suit in federal court to seek back pay reinstatement and other equitable relief title vii has proven to be an effective deterrent against employment discrimination and has provided victims of discrimination with sufficient remedies where violations have occurred at a time of fiscal austerity there is no need for congress to create another eeoc under present law only persons employing 15 or more employees are subject to title viis employment discrimination prohibitions the committee amendments by permitting the immigration board to hear complainte of unfair treatment filed aga tst persons employing more than three individuals would effectively eliminate this exemption under h r 7357 therefore mom and pop companies would not only be subject to criminal sanctions for violation of immigration laws they would have to defend themselves against employment discrimination claims as well the immigration legislation has already caused substantial concern within some segments of the business community not only are all segments of the business community concerned with a proposal creating a second eeoc to process cases involving national origin discrimination but members of congress should be concerned as well if some feel that eeoc only cares about race and sex claims then steps should be taken to deal with that problem such steps however should not include creation of still another civil rights agency we already have eeoc the department of labors office of federal contract compliance programs title vi enforcement agencies within each federal department and state and local fair employment practices commissions among others establishing a new civil rights bureaucracy will not solve the illegal alien problcm for these reasons i must oppose the committee amendment i would like to mention one additional committee amendment to this bill which i think makes good sense my colleague bill goodling offered an amendment to section 303 of the judiciary bill to provide for assistance to school districts charged with the responsibility of educating eligible legalized aliens the amendment recognizes a limited federal responsibility and merely conforms the federal educational assistance program in this act to the program structure designed by the refugee education assistance act of 1980 it is a good amendment it makes sense it was adopted unanimously in committee and i think the house ought to accept this amendment i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.5135326385498047, 0.5135326385498047, 0, "today along with seven of my colleagues i am introducing the petroleum disruption management act legislation designed to prevent or lessen varying degrees of petroleum disruptions there is an essential need for this legislation the expiration of the emergency petroleum allocation act of 1973 on september 30 of this year will leave a gaping hole in our ability to respond to emergency petroleum shortages unless a new and better national program is substituted for the epaaone that eliminates many of the former statutes shortcomingswe will be faceed with a multitude of state emergency plans which could in fact work to our disadvantage and actually exacerbate a potential regional or national petroleum disruption currently all is well on the petroleum supply front crude oil and petroleum products are plentiful however the glut of crude oil and products has given us a false sense of security the vast majority of energy experts view the glut as only a temporary phenomenon we will undoubtedly have another petroleum crisis it behooves us therefore to address the issue of emergency energy contingency planning particularly now that the political environment is calmer and the opportunity for a more thoughtful and effective approach is available if we wait until we are in the midst of another energy crisis to develop an emergency petroleum policy the result will be quite the opposite of what we want a crisis atmosphere may lead to the development of bad legislationlegislation that could likely result in stricter federal measures than perhaps are necessary instead we need to develop legislation now that will help minimize regional shortages before they become national crises while at the same time providing the president with authorities to deal with a national energy emergency the intent of the legislation is to give the president the flexibility and the necessary management tools to deal with petroleum disruptions in a timely and effective manner the options outlined in this bill would allow the marketplace to work to the maximum extent possible so that we do not have to depend on massive regulatory action by the federal government to find solutions to energy disruption problems the bill would require the president for instance to submit a report on the advisability of using tax incentives to encourage refiners to stockpile crude oil and products during periods of surplus more importantly it would require the president to develop four management programs which when approved by congress would be placed on the shelf for selection at a later time they would be removed for implemenjuly 28 1 981 tation only upon approval by congress the programs would be designed to address particular kinds of disruptions ranging from substantial regional shortages to severe national emergencies the four programs are based on the following first use of the strategic petroleum reserve second use of private dedicated reserves third implementation of national crude oil sharing and fourth use of petroleum product management techniques the first management tool would be used to deal with either regional shortages of a lesser magnitude or fullblown national emergencies to address either kind of situation the department of energy would be authorized to sell oil from the strategic petroleum reserve upon determination by the president of the need to respond to an imminent or existing disruption the second tooluse of private dedicated reserveswould serve as a transition program to deal with regional problems until the strategic petroleum reserve was filled to a desirable level the pdr would give regional refiners access to crude oil it would be operated as a limited exchange program between designated refiners with adequate supplies and qualified refiners who because of the disruption would be forced to operate below the national utilization rate to be eligible to receive crude oil from designated refiners those qualified refiners would be required to meet specified standards such as retrofitting their refineries having the capability to process heavy or sour crude oil and maintaining specified inventories as a result inefficient refiners would be prevented from gaining access to crude oil an exceptions procedure would allow other refiners to qualify for crude oil on a casebycase basis the third techniquea national crudeoilsharing programis designed to meet a severe national shortage refiners operating above the national average would be required to share crude oil with those refiners operating below the average the final techniquethe petroleum product management programwould only be used as a last resort in the event that all other management tools failed to produce an acceptable result the president would have the flexibilty to deal with an extreme emergency as he saw fiteiither by using price and allocation controls a national rebate program or any other plan he found acceptable at the time to the maximum extent possible the plan would be designed to protect the following public health safety and welfare national defense the maintenance of public services and the maintenance of agricultural operations related to the production processing and distribution of food a strong point of the legislation is its avoidance of a statistical trigger for the implementation of any of the management plans anyone who has studied the issue of contingency planning has found that it is virtually imposible to develop such a trigger given the vast array of potential regional and national shortage situations the most realistic and effective trigger is a political one key language in the bill would require the president and congress to act in concert in implementing one of the management programs at the same time the bill would automatically sunset the activating resolutions within 120 days unless reauthorized by congress thereby avoiding longterm government involvement in developing his contingency plans and in responding to petroleum disruptions the president would benefit from the advice of a cabinetlevel emergency energy council and energy advisory committee composed of industry representatives consumers and petroleum users the energy advisory committee in particular could be used to persuade industry to manage regional shortages thereby preventing the implementation of any of the four standby management plans this bill with its focus on sequential management sends the right signals to the country it asks government to develop a feasible plan during a noncrisis situation it asks the private sector to depend on selfhelp measures to meet its basic energy needs warning private industry not to expect a massive bailout by uncle sam in par ticular it tells small and independent refiners to retrofit and sour up if they want to become eligible for crude oil sharing during a disruption it builds tension into the system to prevent escalation to the final stage of sequentlil management by giving the advisory councils an opportunity to use jawboning and other measures short of federal intervention to solve disruption problems it only supplements the marketplace to protect national secarity public safety and health and our agricultural community and finally while it does give the president discretionary authorities to act during an emergency the authorities can be used only with the cooperation of congress during the spring of 1979 my home state of iowa and most of the midwest for that matter experienced severe shortages of diesel fuel yet the nation as a whole did not since fuel was in generally plentiful supply this is the kind of problem that i believe will be more typical of the energy problems that we will experience in the future while the diesel fuel shortages of 1979 gave the appearance of being a national problem they were in fact only characteristic of a regional disruption the 1979 experience highlights the fact that rural america is particularly vulnerable to supply disruptions when supplies get tight those refiners serving rural markets tend to be the first ones to feel the pinch because they are the ones who are crude deficient had we had a petroleum disruption management act on the books during the spring of 1979 i feel confident the high spot market prices and the shortages we experienced would have been prevented and they would have been prevented without massive government intervention i believe the concept of sequential management is an innovative and a realistic approach to a very tough issue i believe this bill can serve as a starting point as we study contingency planning issues and reach agreement on a suitable replacement for the emergency petroleum allocation adt i urge my colleagues to join with me by cosponsoring this legislation a fact sheet on the bill follows petroleum disrupton management act or purpose provide president with flexibility and management tool s to deal with varying degrees of potential regional and national petroleum disruptions allows for selection from those tools to beat respond to given circumstances in a disruption substitute for emergency petroleum allocation act preempt multitude of conflicting state emergency plans develop legislation in noncrisis environment designs set of tools before disruption occurs procedure require president to develop 4 management plans to be approved by congress and placed on standby to deal with disruptions disruption management plans 1 strategic petroleum reserve spr doe reports to congress on analysis of minimum volumes of reserves to be maintained as necessary for national defense needs spr plan to be modified to allow use of spr oil during substantial regional and national crude oil disruption once adequate volume is available 2 private dedicated reserve pdr provide crude access to deal with regional shortages designated refiner major seller operating in excess of national average would sell to qualified refiner small and independent a whose runs fall a specified percentage below average and b who cannot replace lost supplies through own efforts except by paying price in excess of weighted average price considering economicallybased quality differentials additional requirements may be placed on refiner to maintain qualified status reconfigure heavy sourup storage exceptions procedure would allow other refiners to apply for qualified status on a casebyase basis program operation price paid would not exceed weighted average price during prior 60 days for domestic and imported oil including adjustments for transportation gravity sulfur and handling our service charge reimbursement mechanism provided for designated refiners seller equalization pdr function could be replaced by spr once adequate fill levels for dealing with substantial disruption 3 national crude oil sharing program provides for sharing of crude oil among all regions and areas during national shortage any refiner operating above national average would sell to those operating below average weighted average price plus adjustments would apply 4 petroleum product authorities in the event of a national emergency president would have authority to implement price and allocation controls or an emergency use fee with with~out rebate or any other program specified i regulation would only be implemented as measure of last resort priorities same as those in current epaa legislation measures used prior to activation of plans dependence on private stocks and marketplace energy advisory committee composed of all segments of petroleum industry consumers and users to help persuade industry to manage regional shortages presidential study to determine advisability of providing tax incentives to encourage stockpiling during surplus and drawdown during shortage president can utilize 300 000 barrels of spr oil per day for 90 days without approval of congress to mitigate regional lyhortages implementation process trigger president determines with consent of congress that particular management plan should be pulled off shelf president may utilize spr or pdr to distribute and allocate crude oil if a substantial crude oil supply disruption exists or is imminent substantial disruption encompasses regional shortages whether due to price anomalies or supply restrictions president may implement spr national crude sharing or standby product authorities if severe petroleum supply interruption exists or is imminent or to comply with iea obligations such action also requires passage of a joint resolution by congress severe interruption covers national shortfalls congress may initiate and require any of the above actions through passage of a joint resolution presidential veto rights apply with congressional override of twothirds joint resolution minimum number of cosponsors for initiation and priority treatment for vote within a short period of time any program activated cannot exceed 120 days without reauthorization key features and advantages of this legislation n~o government intervention in the marketplace if no disruption gives president discretionary but not unlimited authorities keeps congress involved both as a potential initiator and as a check on excessive action allows for flexible and timely response to disruptions without specifying a mandatory numeric trigger deals with variety of disruptions thus minimizing adverse price and supply effects on agriculture and other sectors encourages selfhelp measures from private industry minimizes regional shortages before they become national crises sunsets any management program within 120 days"], [0.512535810470581, 0.512535810470581, 0, "mr speaker and members i remarked yesterday that the chief culprit behind continued high interest rates was deficit spending by the federal government the call for further budget cuts or at least a substantially reduced budget deficit since some prefer tax increases to achieve a balance has been sounded by a growing array of financial economic and political leaders accordingly i wish to present some disturbing facts which illustrate exactly how imminent our continued travel is down this road to fiscal ruin treasury statistics beginning in 1789 reveal that we experienced the lowest gross national debt in 1835 38 000 a drop from a wartime high of 127 3 million in 1815 for the first century and a half of our federal governments existence the debt fluctuated increasing during wars but subsiding afterward this cycle was repeated from the time of the war of independence through the war of 1812 and the war between the states to the first world war indeed from 1789 to 1942 the gross national debt rose to a total of 79 2 billion it took 154 years to get to 79 2 billion the debt for 1981 alone is estimated by the administration to be 79 6 billion and by the congressional budget office at 84 billionmore red ink in 1 year than in the first 154 in 1982 the deficit is variously estimated to be 42 billion to 80 billion although the debt roller coastered along a gradual upward path attaining 316 8 billion in 1964 that year marks a sort of watershed for in the years following the normal wartime surge during vietnam there has been no downward slide the opposite has been true the wartime years of 196573 saw the debt climb from 316 8 billion to 468 4 billion a 47 9percent icrease over a 9year span since 1973 on the other hand the debt has climbed to a stratospheric 1 trillion a 113 5percent increase in just 8 years the effect of this irresponsible spending spree on credit markets is not lost of the outstanding debts financed by the treasury 907 6 billion in 1980 holders of debt securities in clude commercial banks 100 9 billion mutual savings banks 5 3 billion federal rescrve banks 120 7 billion corporations 25 5 billion state and local governments 73 4 billion individual most of these being holders of savings bands 123 billion insurance companies 14 4 billion foreign and international investors 126 billion unitedstates government investment accounts 197 7 billion and finally miscellaneous accounts including assets for debt owned by savings and loans a total of 120 7 billion that totals 907 6 billion as of 1980 the question can really be asked how many mortgages would that sum of debt buy when you point the facts out there is nothing really new about them so the question comes into existence where can we cut federal spending in 1982 so as to bring this runaway monster that we currently have on our hands under control the members may recall that during the course of the past 3 or 4 days i have taken the well of the house in a special order to outline and read a portion of the 272 items that are reflected in the work product of the economic task force of the republican research committee indicating where we can make specific reductions in spending in 1982 today i would like to continue reading from that list as an indication to the members where we can make further reductions in spending for 1982 again 1 would ask the members when these items are mentioned would the adoption of these specific reductions in spending for 1982 adversely impact on the poor the downtrodden the handicapped and the deprived of our society i think if we are honest with ourselves in each instance the answer is no their adoption would not do so in the category entitled energy atomic energy defense activities here we have an option whereby if we limit the increase over 1980 to 39 1 percent the equivalent of the defense department increase rather than the proposed increase of 60 8 percent we could reduce expenditures in this item by 623 077 100 energy programs general science research operations expense we would allow a 10percent growth over what was spent in 1981 this would save 27 260 000 energy programs energy production demonstration and distribution we would allow a 20percent increase over 1980 the proposed expenditure is 102 4 percent above 1980 which we believe is excessive this would save 114 397 600 energy programs energy conservationarea and regional development we would eliminate this program we do not believe that its continued existence as a function of the energy department of our government is in any way necessary this would save 16 million energy programs strategic petroleum reserves we would eliminate federal financing of this program we think that its financing can be functioned via public bonds this would delete 3 607 775 000 energy programs economic regulation we would eliminate this because we have in this phase of deregulation largely reduced the staff requirements of the department of energy and this would result in a savings of 40 400 000 energy progr ams federal energy regulatory commission we would eliminate the gas and oil regulation aspects of this program on the grounds that the deregulation of oil which our nation has embarked upon makes redundant the continued bureacuracy which heretofore has performed this function this would save 51 167 000 power marketing administration southeast power administration operations and maintenance we would allow 10 percent above 198 the proposed increase here is 324 2 percent over what was spent in 1981 the adoption of this item would save 5 133 600 power marketing administration southwest power administration operations and maintenance here we would allow 20 percent over what we spent in 1980 the proposed items suggests that we spend in 1982 80 5 percent over what was spent in 1980 this would save if adopted 9 817 400 power marketing administration western area power administration construction rehabilitation operations and maintenance we would allow a 10percent increase above what was spent in 1981 the proposed increase for this item is 27 8 percent over what was spent in 1981 which in our view is excessive if this item is implemented it would save 55 536 300 power marketing administration western area power administration emergency fund we would delete this on the ground that there are sufficient reserves in other accounts therefore this would save 234 000 department administration information policy and regulation we would cut 10 percent from what they spent in 1980 these activities in the department of energy we feel can be served by other functions and are unnecessary if this item is adopted it would save 60 062 400 departmentwide in the departmnent of energy correcting their auditing procedures pursuant to the recommendations of the general accounting office would save 19 800 000 members in this category of the department of energy it will be interesting to note that these proposed savings if adopted total 13 for a sum total of 4 693 660 400 in the department of commerce the following items are suggested for deletion modification for fiscal year promotion of industry and commerce international trade administration operations and administration we would allow a 20percent increase over 1980 the proposed outlays for this item represent a 102 1percent increase over 1980 we believe that this is clearly excessive and cannot be justified on any basis of rational thought the adoption of this item would result in a savings of 65 468 800 promotion of industry and commerce international trade administration trust funds we would allow a 20percent increase above 1980 the proposal is for a 123 4percent increase in just 2 years we think this is markedly excessive adoption of this item would save 6 390 400 science and technology noaa fishermens contingency fund we would retain it at the 1981 level the proposed outlays based on the projected 2 332 4percent increase in losses from 1980 we feel is extravagant to say the least this would save if the item was adopted 400 000 science and technology foreign fishing observer fund we do not believe in this time of tight money and excessive cost for credit that we should be establishing a foreign fishig observer fund in the department of commerce and this elimination would save the taxpayers 750 000 science and technology science and tech research services we would allow 10 percent growth over 1981 this would save 9 191 000 ocean shipping maritime administration ship construction we would eliminate this program we believe that the construction of ships to carry the goods of this nation to foreign soil should be left in private hands the adoption of this program would save 145 million ocean shipping maritime administration operating subsidies we would eliminate this we believe that the cost of transportation of goods should be paid by the shippers not by the taxpayers this would save 417 148 000 then finally in this category the department of commerce departmentwide savings auditing procedure corrections recommended by the general accounting office if implemented would save 112 626 000 in summary let me relate that these projected savings from the department of commerce if adopted totaling eight items would save the taxpayers 756 974 200 at a time when the treasury departmfent every week is conducting a public auction for the raising of money and paying 14 or 15 percent for that money in order to finance the activities of the federal government and provide liquidity for the deficit estimated for the fiscal year that we are now in as nearly to 80 billion i think it is high time that we serving in this institution have the courage to recognize what the basic cost of the high cost of credit is in this cou~ntry that is the irresponsible spending habits of the institution in which we serve the house of representatives the buck stops here spending is out of control year after year deficit after deficit and 30 percent of the existing deficit and outstanding debt of the united states of close to a trillion dollars has been created in the last 5 years alone it cannot go on this way indefinitely and the way we can stop the excessive demand for credit by this establishment is having the courage in this body to vote the suggested changes whereby we delete this excessive level of spending that has been proposed for fiscal year 1982 i thank the members and the speaker for their time"], [0.5124890208244324, 0.5124890208244324, 0, "this is it we have had a tremendous amount of discussion on the fiscal year 1983 budget it is now time to discuss and act on the need for a balanced budget resolution this budget contains all the elements that so many of my colleagues in this body have talked about for the last 7 and 8 months there is no addon deficit in this budget this budget will sent the strongest signal both to main street and wall street and will be a tremendous incentive to bring down interest rates i have heard that need expressed time and time again especially from this side of the aisle i would like to review with the members of this body the facts supporting the rousselot balanced budget substitute amendment to the first concurrent budget resolution for fiscal year 1983 the balanced budget substitute ac complishes the following balances outlays with anticipated revenues at 701 75 billion for fiscal year 1983 by restraining increases in spending in comparison the budget committee recommends a deficit of nearly 100 billion recognizes the unexpended and unobligated federal fund balances that have been accumulating while the bureaucracies try to figure out how to spend the money which has been authorized by the end of fiscal year 1983 over a billion in unobligated funds will have accumulated for the various bureaucracies to spend in addition a like amount will have accumulated in pension reserves total unobligated balances are substantial the federal bureaucracy will not starve under the balanced budget substitute takes into account waste and fraud in the government which is encouraged by excessive federal spending according to the justice department fraud may be costing the government as must as 25 billion per year fiscal belt tightening will encourage the federal agencies to be more careful with the peoples money the balanced budget substitute offered in previous years has experienced growing support among the members of the house in 1975 when i first introduced it it received 95 aye votes in 1978 it received 170 aye votes and in may 1980 this balanced budget resolution received 191 ayes to 218 noes only a 27vote margin the reason the reason is simple the balanced budget substitute is based on an economic model which soundly stresses the interrelationships between large deficits and low productivity high tax rates and low productivity and high interest ratescaused by excessive money growth and federal borrow ingand increasing tax rates together these factors influence our tax revenues and rate of economic growth unfortunately the interrelationships of these factors is not well understood by some of the members of this body large deficits and higher tax rates will impede our nations economic development the members of this house have a chance to vote on our balanced budget substitute which does incorporate the interrelationship of these factors a yea vote will be for less government lower taxes no deficits less inflation lower interest rates and more productivity and greater employment opportunities a nay vote will be for more government bigger deficits more inflation higher interest rates less productivity and more unemployment this will slow down federal spending exactly the way many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have talked about for the last several months spending will be at a level of 701 75 billion revenues at 701 75 billion for a balanced budget this will be a tremendous incentive to all of the various sectors of the economy that in congress we have finally lived up to our responsibility to live within our means we have talked about it we have discussed it we have rehashed it now you can vote for it right now with one positive constructive vote many of our colleagues have said they are concerned about small business and agriculture and all of the other phases of our economy that are now in recession this is the responsible budget resolution to vote for to give encouragement and stimulus to small business how do we do that the national federation of independent business nfib an organization with inexcess of 650 000 members has sent each of the members of congress a letter which said we endorse this budget resolution as the best way to provide stimulus and help to small business why because it takes away the tremendous addon deficit that all i repeat all the other resolutions contain there will be no new deficit spending required under this resolution that means that there will be less competition by the treasury of the united states in the marketplace to be borrowing so much money economist after economist has said if congress would only live up to its responsibility and not add so much to the deficit we know there would be it tremendous reaction in the marketplace we would not need all of that new interest to be charged by the federal government it would be brought down to a real level of reductions remember that the third or fourth largest item in any of these budgets is the interest charged on the current 1 100 billion debt all other resolutions talk about and address themselves to adding to that tremendous burden that the american people and the marketplace already carries now we believe that it is important to have this congress go on record and say that now is the time to bring down spending to such a level that the treasury does not have to go out and borrow so much in our resolution we also contemplate after october 1 1982 freezing all increases in federal payments to individuals that would be i will say to my colleagues after the 7 4percent increase that is contemplated for social security so that would not be touched i knew the members would be glad to hear that but all other payments would be frozen at the level of october 1 the overwhelming majority of our former secretaries of the treasury of this nation has saidand you read it on monday may 24 in the washington postcongress should accept its responsibility to freeze the payments to individuals beginning in october 1982 and show the american people that this government can live within its means it is imperative that the federal deficit be significantly reduced we ask that of everybody else but we always make ourselves an exception these are former secretaries of the treasury men with judgment from having to manage that tremendous deficit for long periods of time this resolutionand remember it is setting targets for spending for 1983 1984 and 1985can do that now we do not have to wait so many of my colleagues have projected time and time again and said oh well get to a balanced budget sometime in the future many many times in the chamber ever since we have had a budget process starting in 1974 committee chairman after committee chairman has come up here and said oh we should have a balanced budget but we cant do it this year and we cant do it next year well get to it a little latter the american people are asking why not now why cannot congress live within its means everybody else does approving an addon debt of 100 billion to the already enormous feder al deficit will escalate inflation and interest rates and will decrease the earning power of americas working taxpayers it will crowd out investment and production and cripple the ability of individuals and the private sector to save invest expand and develop new resources and technologies this is what stimulates our economy and creates the permanent meaningful jobs that our nation in seeking we can balance the budget in fiscal year 1983 by reining in wastefulspending and by expanding the tax base by maintaining the present economic recovery program that sparks economic growth in 1978 senator william proxmime joined me in criticizing the excessive deficits that are added to the federal budget year after year in the additional views to the joint economic committee report of 1978 he said i believe that both the presidents proposed 500 billion budget and this committees estimate of expenditures of 500 to 505 billion are too high these expenditures represent an enormous burden on american taxpayers they should be cut by a minimum of 25 billion and better yet by 35 billion in order to provide a freeze on federal outlays of about 165 billion as the distinguished financial expert henry kaufman proposed before the house committee on the budget further as one who has routinely examined the budgets of numerous government agencies as a member of the senate appropriations committee i assert without fear of contradiction that there is not a single general government function where a 5 to 7 percent cut of the funds could not result in a more efficient or less wasteful program combined with better services to the american public one can name the function and know from experience that the budget could be cut without harming the function the everincreasing deficits like those recommended by the majority constitute a trend so ominous that even many of the liberal economists are claiming that we are deficitaddicted they admit that deficits are no longer stabilizing to the economy and that rather than simply acting as an occasional stimulus deficits have occurred in greater magnitude and regularity every year the weakness of our past economic policies is that it removes the discipline of the balanced budget further politically popular but economical unproductive expenditures can be easily clothed in the virtue of deficitcreating stimulus packages it is time to place rastraints on increases in spending while many of the chairmen of various house committees have lamented about the deficit that is facing us they are at the same time recommending increases of more than 50 billion in spending apparently the philosophical difference is that they want more and more spending and more and more taxes i believe we should have less spending less taxes and more prodperity there has been some good economic indications in the news recently inflation has 1ll but disappeared as a major issue housing starts were up in february by 6 percent from january and nearly 12 percent from the october low building permits for privately owned housing units were up 14 percent in february from october indicating more future increases in housing starts the industrial production index increased 1 6 percent in february the first rise since last july a nearrecord 57 percent of the workingage population is employed the record is 59 percent income from wages and salaries rose 7 7 billion in the period from january to february the deficit for the first 5 months or this fiscal year is 2 billion less than the deficit for the same period in fiscal year 1981 and finally interest rates though still unacceptably high have taken a drop in the past year the prime rate which was over 20 percont last summer has dropped to 16 5 percent there are sigr of economic recovery the unitedstates eroniomy is entering the early stages of a recovery the consumer price index has declined for the first time in 17 years air travel which traditionally signals a change in consumer sentiment is picking up and the sales of unitedstates made autosmanaged to increase 6 1 percent for the middle 10 days of april compared with the same period last year the semiconductor industry one of the last sectors of the economy to cave in is showing signs of being about the first to rebound the time is now for this congress to take action to balance the federal budget and to place our nation on an economically sound basis i want to say that i recognize the hard work of the members of the budget committee and the many difficulties that they have faced but the appalling fact is that even after all their hard work all the difficult choices they have brought to the floor of the house a resolution which projects deficits exceeding 100 billion that means that if we are to pass this resolution a majority of members of the unitedstates house of representatives must go on record as stating that the deficits which are appropriated for this year or the next or the one after that are ok that is baloney perhaps a majority of you here can cast such a vote by supporting the committee budget i certainly am convinced that a majority of the american people would not cast any such vote i certainly will not i support the presidents program for economic recovery because the president has shown the determination to control rampant federal spending i have continued to not only support but to advocate many of his restraints proposed for government spending but coupled with that we have huge deficitsdeficits which are now apparent to us all but which also have put a hamstring on the control of federal spending if we are to have any hope of getting on a sound economic basis if we are to reduce interest rates if we are to encourage jobcreating economic growth if we are to continue to hold down inflation then i believe the present budget resolution must be substantially reshaped the figures submitted by the budget resolution simply are too high on the spending side and as a result too high on the deficih side in addition they fund this sperding with increased revenues even the revenues are too high let us not forget that this means higher and higher taxes for our constituents the projected deficits are too alarming to be permitted to stand i do not contend that these deficits can be cut without discomfort but the longer we pyt off getting on a sound ecoriomic basis the more difficult it will be for everybodythe rich and the poor alike the defense department must be aware for example that while a strong national defense is essential it cannot be maintained in the long run without a sound economy and a soundly based financial structure eqtitlement programs cannot be exempt from reductions except where we are awaiting the report of the committee which is now studying the entire scope of the social security program with the mission of preserving its solvency we must have a credible program of deficit reductionotherwise the critical element of business and consumer confidence will be lacking and a soundly based and sustainable economic recovery will not be forthcoming i have discussed this subject with many prominent and noted economists and they overwhelmingly agree that while the seeds of recovery are in the groundit does not insure a bumper crop what is needed to tend to these seeds the necessary nutrients and water and sunshine is a drop a substantial drop in interest rates these economists all agree that an elimination of the federal deficit would be just what the farmer ordered for these seeds what remains to be seen are the strength the scope and the duration of any such recovery and the determi nation of that will depend to a significant extent on what is done by the congress in acting on the budget the immediate and actual conse quences of our budgetary decisions are considerable but the psychological effects are even greater in summary i cannot support the budget submitted by the budget committee for two basic reasons one spending is too high and two the deficits are too great what i can support is the alterna tive budget resolution substitute i and several of my colleagues in the house including two members of the budget committee have introducedthe bal anced budget substityte for the past 11 ydars i have offered my balanced budget substitute resolution the need for this resolution is even more pressing this year it is imperative that the congress send a signaland a strong oneto wall street and the business community the deficits incurred by the rampant federal spending of previous years is effecting the economy of this country a lot of people lend money or have money loaned to them by others they know about deficits and they know we have got to somehow do something about it if not we will have another period of superinflation the federal reserve is going to be forced to loosen money enormously to prevent a disaster unless we have fiscal restraint here in the congress any approach that does not substan tially reduce deficits will not be credible to those that lend money interest rates will not come down if large deficits are passed by the congress people have become educated about our deficit our colleague on the senate side senator pete domenici has stated on the floor of the senate that the budget process for all its shortcomings has finally convinced people that they ought to look at the budget for a few years into the future make some projections and say something is wrong or gee things are great can you imagine how the business community would respond if we told them that we had a balanced budget in 1983 i can tell youthey would say that interest rates would go down that this is the signal that wall street has been waiting for now can you imagine what these same lenders will say it we produced a fiscal year 1983 budget with the deficits skyrocketing or even camouflaged with a social security budget shifted to the side surely interest rates would not be lowered it is now time to solve these deficit prob lems it is unrealistic to expect interest rates to come down when a 100 billion 1983 federal deficit coupled with federal offbudget borrowing will consume 80 percent of the personal savings of americans as the federal govenment borrows more and more money it leaves only a tiny residue of savings which can be used for personal and business loans that scarcity of available savings keeps interest rates high and if we do not bring interest rates down dramatically and i am talking not 2 to 4 but 6 to 8 percentage points we will face higher unemployment ever greater numbers of bankruptcies and the prospect of a return to double digit inflation as pressures mount to increase the money supply to finance federal borrowing courage is what is needed the balanced budget substitute creates hardship for some americansbut it is a fair and equitable discomfort it calls for spending restraints in all federal programs no one is exempt the american people want to go back to work our resolution will accomplish this otherwise we will have a weak economy high unemployment and further deficit spending let us bear in mind that while reducing the interest rateswe will be putting americans back to work while balancing the budget is not easyand by no means politically popular in all circlesit is necessary it is a budget that can initiate action and a budget that will show americans that we mean action and can do it in a limited timeframe judging by our current fiscal policy the congress has no intention of balancing the budget through an expanding economy todays high interest rates are wiping out all the economic gains that we could be making in response to the tax cuts that were enacted last year 1981 day by day inflation has been increasing the tax burden levied on labor and capital in so doing it is virtually guaranteeing a recession inflation is a monetary phenomenon and until we start trading tobacco leaves in the economy as our forefathers did inflation will continue to be a monetary phenomenoncaused by too much money chasing too few goods if we are trying to slow down inflation we should slow down the federal reserves printing pressesnot the productive economyand the only way feasible to do this is to eliminate deficit spending despite all the myths we must face the cold facts as to what budget deficits are and are not budget deficits represent an obligation that the government has to those citizens from whom it has borrowed it is an obligation to levy taxes on the general citizenry upon the maturity of the debt in some instances the budget deficit is financed via the federal reserve banks printing presses and this can be inflationary historically the feds role in financing the debt has been partly to blame for our current high interest rates the real problems with running budget deficits is that in most cases they are simply an expedient way of redistributing earnings from one segment of our society to another segment by forcing future generations to pay for the tab unfortunately todays generation of taxpayers is already paying part of the tab with deficits growing the federal governments obligation to increase tax rates has also been growing as a consequence our nations financial managers have been systematically turning down high risk projects with paybacks too far off in the future the bottom line has been that investment has been dropping off over a period of years and along with it productivity the only reason investment has not fallen completely out of bed is because of the tax cuts we enacted last session there can be no doubt of the need to balance the fed eral budget large deficits associated with increased federal spending either contribute to inflation or serve only to stifle investment because of the expectation of higher taxes in future years nor can there be any doubt that the drafters of our constitution ever intended to provide the congress with a free ride to spend to their hearts content by virtue of inflation and higher taxes they adopted provisions to limit the federal governmentbut adoption of the 18th amendment has lead to the emergence of powerful special interest groups in society who are competing for larger and larger shares of a growing federal spending pie the congress is in need of a new set of fiscal rules which automatically limits the growth and the size of the federal pie by constraining the power to raise taxes either through inflation or by direct vote ironically the moie the federal government has spent the less productive our economy has become congress must renavigate its fiscal course and reduce the size and scope of federal government we must put an end to the unconscionable federal intrusions into the workings of our national economy congress has the power to restrain federal government spending and balance the budget now 701 75 billion is a tremendous amount of money and let us talk about how it affects the poor according to our budget committees statistics the average poor family has spent for it on its behalf for a family of four roughly 17 000 a year by the federal government now we admit that many of those dollars do not actually reach those poor families they are chewed up by the bureaucracies in all kinds of overhead expenditures under this budget resolution that average would still be maintained in addition with the efforts that are not underway to eliminate the bureaucracy and make sure that more of those dollars genuinely go to the poor that is still a very tidy sum it is a sum to be allocated to each poor family in this country so if the attempt is made to say there is nothing in here for the poor people that just is not true the levels of expenditure in all of these functional categories that you have seen clearly are at the same level or almost the same level as 198182 and we cannot make the judgment that it will be adequate for all the poor and all the needy but it is there what we are saying is that if there is a sacrifice to be made in future increases in spending it should be evenhanded and fair and across the board that is what we recommend in this balancedbudget resolution now the spending levels as the members well know are still estab lished after we pass the budget resolution the way that that is allocated is still done by each committee the authorizing committees and in the case of revenues the committee on ways and means i would for the record just like to explain the methodology used to determine projected receipts for fiscal year 1983 the march 1982 monthly treasury statement provides us with 6month totals for federal receipts for fiscal year 1982 these figures are then extrapolated for the full year based upon previous 6month proportions thus 6 me as treasry report 6 m ful w ercent march 1979 201 597 465 940 43 27 march 1980 228 681 520 050 43 97 march 1981 260 635 599 212 43 49 average 43 58 march 1982 289 590 664 502 43 58 less 2 5 percent to amount for eiec of to percent tax cut on 4th quarter of fiscal year 16 612 estimated fullyear iiscal year 1982 receipts 647 890 determining fiscal year 1983 receipts is admittedly more hazardous using this method of computation slight variations in economic assumptions can wreak havoc upon any projectionsand they have but it is necessary to arrive at an approximate figure if for no other reason than to be able to gage spending therefore just carry the formula one step further the fiscal year 1982 total of 647 890 million represents an 8 11 percent increase over 1981 receipts this sum plus a similar 8 11 percent increase for fiscal year 1983 yields 700 434 less 2 5 percent for the thirdyear tax cut nets 682 923the projected fiscal year 1983 total to answer the obvious questions first applying an 8 11 percent increase is not unreasonable since the average annual increase over the past 3 years has been 11 65 percent significantly despite the recession 6month revenues this year are 11 11 percent higher than for the comparable period last year so the lower percentage increase of 8 11 percent is not overly optimistic second the july 1983 thirdyear increment of the tax cut package enacted last year will reduce revenues by 10 percent for the year since there remains only the final quarter of he fiscal year however the effect on receipts would be an approximate 2 5 percent reduction third the resulting net increase from fiscal year 1982 to 1983 of 5 4 percent is not incomparable to the 4 7 percent average increase for 1964 and 1965 following enactment of the kennedy tax

administration and members of the house of representatives and the senate decided to eliminate the minimum benefit in the budget reconciliation process this change was not undertaken without considerable research about its potential effect on older citizens removal of the minimum benefit was recommended precisely because it is an unearned benefita welfare type of income supplement that a recipient is not entitled to from his or her payroll tax contributions maintaining these unearned minimum benefits will cost 7 billionputting unnecessary pressure on the already stresseoi trust funds it is important here to recognize that there are two different kinds of minimum social security beneficiaries one group of beneficiaries has worked for years under social security but at low wages the formula that is used to determine their benefits is purposefully weighted so that they can receive more than they actually should based on their payroll tax contributions these longterm lowwage earners receive benefits that are higher so that they can have a better standard of living after retirement these people who have worked at least 19 years under the system are completely protected as they should be from any benefit changes there is a second group of persons who receive a minimum benefit and who are the subject of current discussion this group has as a rule worked for a short time under social security at high wages based on total lifetime earnings the average individual receiving this minimum benefit could have paid less than 355 in social security payroll taxes over their lifetime and receive a benefit of 2 122 in 1982 this amount would also be increased annually to reflect changes in the cpi in certain instances a couple could receive at least 3 183 in 1982 by paying as little as 3 in payroll taxes over their entire working lifetime it has been found that on the average a husband and wife getting an initial minimum benefit in 1982 would be paid more than 100 000 during their retirement lifetime from the social security trust funds for this average couple that would be about 300 times what they paid into the system these cannot be considered earned benefits now it is important that we are all clear about those that will be affected by the change there are presently 3 million persons receiving the minimum benefit research undertaken byf the general accounting office shows that only 17 percent of the minimum benefit recipients are truly needy and that 74 percent do not depend primarily on social security for retirement income the general accounting office also estimates that 450 000 minimum beneficiaries are already receiving federal pensions averaging 16 000 annually in addition 50 000 have retired spouses who are estimated to receive an average of 18 500 in federal pensions and 300 000 have spouses who are earning an average 21 100 this accounts for 800 000 of the 3 million current minimum benefit recipients another 1 2 million are only technical minimum beneficiaries actually these individuals received more than the minimum benefit because they are entitled to dual benefitstheir total benefit payment is based not only on their own low earnings but on the earnings and social security taxes of their spouse their total benefit would be unaffected by elimination of the minimum benefit also in this group are 200 000 persons who have earned benefits that are equal to the minimum benefit because earned benefits would not be affected these people would not lose any benefits of those receiving the minimum benefit 500 000 are also receiving supplemental security income which is adjusted for receipt of other income therefore those people who would lose the social security minimum benefit would have that same amount replaced under the ssi program an important step was taken to eliminate possible hardships for many of the needy persons receiving social security minimum benefits under the present law one is not eligible for ssi unless he or she is 65 blind or disabled under our new proposal when the minimum benefit is eliminated people who are between the ages of 60 and 64 will be considered eligible for benefits under ssi if they meet other eligibility requirements i think it is particularly important to understand all these facts in light of the charade undertaken by the democrats in the house of representatives today the democrats introduced a resolution that strongly urges that the necessary steps be taken to insure that social security benefits are nor reduced for those currently receiving them they did this knowing that this resolution is not binding and has no force to bring about any change it was used in a partisan effort to improve the popularity of the democratic party statements were continually made that 3 million needy older persons would be hurt by the elimination of the minimum benefit even though this is clearly not the case beside the availability of ssi needy individuals will also be eligible for other federal programs such as food stamps and medicaid benefits the administration and the republican leadership of the house did not want to make this important effort to improve the system an emotional and partisan issue they did not want to be ~placed in a negative role for their attempts to strengthen the system for the wage earners to diffuse this growing bitterness most republicans including myself will vote with the democrats in support of the resolution in closing because of what i have just said i will fully understand the proposal to eliminate the minimum july 21 1 981 co benefit because it is not accomplishing the purpose for which it was originally intended most of the people who receive it were not the low wage earners for whom it was developed moreover many beneficiaries receive adequate income from other sources i believe that it is in the broader national interest to stabilize the system and keep it viable for current and future beneficiaries in doing so we must continue to honor our 46yearold contract wvith the american worker without jeopardizing senior citizens who depend on social security as their primary means of support if high unemployment and high inflation continue to have a negative impact on the social security system we must attempt to correct the deficits by phasing in changes over a long enough transitional period to allow future retirees time to make appropriate plans this resolution today is a charade e"], [0.5121106505393982, 0.5121106505393982, 0, "curing the economic problems of michigan and other northern industrial states will require both creative solutions and unprecedented cooperation my colleague mr pursell of michigan has taken a very thoughtful and pragmatic leadership role in this effort his recent speech to the new england society of newspaper editors and publishers is an outstanding analysis of this dilemma and i include his remarks in the record as follows oxiz nationindxvxsxmze by carl 1 pursml it is certainly an honor for this congressman from michigan to bring his message to this gathering of the distinguished new england society of newspaper editors and publishers the topic at hand requires the critical examination broad perspective and practical application characteristic of editors and publishers a group known for getting to the point and demanding appropriate action ironically it may have been one of our most wellknown editors and publishers whose words are most associated with the problems of the northeast midwest region everyone remembers the wordsf of the new york tribunes horace greeley when he said go west young man those words were more than advisory they were prophetic from now until the year 2000 the census bureau expects the population of the socalled sun belt to grow at a rate four times that of the 18 states of the northeast and midwest the real reason as you know is not climate but jobs and while employment opportunities grow in the south and west the capital investment that creates jobs is lagging in our region during the past decade capital investment in the sun belt was nearly twice that of the northeast midwcst bome of the socalled experts have wit nessed this trend and proclaimed it inevitable as though it were some kind of modern extension to the concept of manifest destiny and seeing these developments in those terms these experts have solemnly advised the people of our region to stop their economic suffering forthwith and move to where the jobs are i think we would all question such advice you may not recall as readily another svored quote of horace greely the wusion that times that were are better than those that are has probably pervaded all ages i strongly believe that it is also an illusion to think that the times to be will not be better than those that are in short the best days for our region are ahead of us not in the golden days of the past by and large jobs are where you make them and with the proper balanced concern for the needs of the nation at large we can stand and act in accordance with that fact a continental country such as ours can do no less for it would make powerful little sense to move generation after generation of americans across our great land mass in quest of an elusive and everchanging job market such a policy would not only be economically infective but just plain inhumane our very history argues against it dec ades ago the federal government began to pursue a deliberate policy of investing billions of dollars in the economic revival of the south and development of the west massive amounts of dollars were poured into rural electrification projects like tva port construction military bases defense projects space programs oil subsidies tobacco and peanuts allotments and on and on the great northeast and midwest peoples never thought to question this policy because they were and are above all else americans with the greater interest of their nation at heart they never once thought that their own prosperity would suffer for having extended the hand of the federal government on behalf of their fellow americans in other regions but the times they are achanging the moment has come to realize that in economic terms the west has been won and the south has been reconstructed now it is time to draw a lesson from history and be reminded that what worked for the south and west will also work for the north and midwest which is ravished by an industrial complex badly in need of reconstruction and modernization needless to say our region desperately requires the industrial revenue base needed to rebuild its cities and to modernize its aging network of bridges road water and sewer systems yet despite these gaping needs the 18 states of the northeast and midwest collectively sent 165 billion more of their treasure to washington than they got back between 1975 and 1979 my state of micli gan gets back about 66 cents for every dollar going to our nations capital if we continue as we have we face an economnic balkanization that will serve no ones best interestsleast of all the nations one of the most vital tests for america today is whether we can frame a rational national economic development plan and in so doing avoid the terrible pitfall of creating economic upheavals that pit one region against another the truth is our various regions are parts of a single economic whole they are dependent on one another with each offering unique strengths and special resources the others lack the 18 states of the northeast and midwest spend too much time emphasizing problems rather than proclaiming how much we have to offer that the nation needs and can benefit from for example the great lakes st lawrence system and other sources provide the worlds largest supply of fresh water a vast expensive infrastructure including huge plant capacities and an integrated transportation system is in place and capable oi serving millions of people in large cities and smaller communities in an effective manner at far less than the cost of replacing it from the ground up our varied terrain provides opportunity for a wide assortment of activities while a continuous round of changing seasons presents excellent working conditions i might add at this point that the nickname frost belt is a misnomer for our climate is among the most temperate in the world minerals timber and other raw materials are abundant throughout and a varied mix of oil gas coal and hydroelectric energy remain in plentiful supply soil climate and other factors enable the region to not only feed its people but to export food and fiber throughout the world we have some of the worlds finest schools unparalleled research capabilities and a strong feeling of individual pride and community loyalty that cannot be measured the regions greatest resource is of course its peoplea skilled and motivated work force ready and willing to continue making productive contributions in existing industries while ready to meet the special demands of new technologies in congress i have been working primarily through two groups in an effort to secure equitable treatment of all regions by the federal government and to promote the positive contributions our region can make to the nation first the bipartisan northeast midwest congressional coalition of which i am a member of the steering committee and cochairman of its budget task force secondly an ad hoc group of northern republicans commonly referred to as the gypsy moths of which i am chairman most of the efforts of these two groups this yearlike those of congresshave centered around president reagans economic recovery program as you undoubtedly know i actively support the basic components of the presidents program and voted for the key implementing legislation when it came before the house of representatives namely reducing federal spending so as to beat inflation and bring down interest rates reducing individual and business taxes to provide investment capital and leave more money in the hands of workers and working to develop a bigger national economic pie rather than struggling over a shrinking pie that sets region against region and interest group against interest group while strongly supporting the presidents bottom line i believe that a certain amount of negotiating should take place in order to avoid certain rcgional distortions and other difficulties for example i had introduced legislation to phase in the tax cut over a fiveyear period rather than three years my greatest concerns related to the regional effects of rapidly raising defense spending while significantly decreasing domestic programs meanwhile conservative southern democrats now known as the boll weevils continue their traditional demands as the price for votes on key legislation year after year no matter who is president the boll weevils fight for three basic areas of immense benefit to their region public works 2 oil tax breaks and 3 defense spending let me give a typical example of each of these areas 1 the controversial tennesseetombigee projecta waterway running parallel to the mississippi riverreceived administration support and the house passed its fiscal year 1982 appropriations by a vote of 208 to 198 it is estimated that this project alone will eventually cost about 3 billion 2 oil tax breaks in the economic recovery act including exemptions to the windfall profits tax will cost over 12 billion during the iext three years 3 the administrations 15year defense plan calls for 1 46 trillion through fiscal year 1986 this is a particular boon to the sun belt as 80 percent of all dod employees are concentrated in the south and west california and georgia alone have more than all of the 18 states in our region combined in fact over the last decade defense department employment in the northeast midwest actually declined by about 30 percent it is our view that several billion dollars could be shifted from the proposed lncrrase in defense to needed domestic programs of vital importance to our region while not in any way harming national security in fact such a move could be helpful before completing his term of office earlier this year the distinguished comptroller general elmer b staats identified up to 10 billion in dod mismanagement and waste the house republican research committee has outlined as much as 25 billion savings through reductions in waste fraud abuse along with a restructuring of the procurement process in addition we are concerned that a too rapid increase in defense spending could even have a harmful effect on the military experts have predicted shortages of skilled labor in defense industriesespecially in the south capacity will be strained and managerial oversight stretched thin resulting in substantial costs overruns while my coalition and glypsy moth colleagues generally agree that a responsible trimming of the defense request will focus needed attention on the best way to achieve a truly effective military and strengthen defense by strengthening the economy there is less agreement on what domestic programs should be given the greatest emphasis this is due to the great diversity within our region the priorities of downtown manhattan are often not the same as those of the hills of vermont we fuund that out when we tried to help jim jeffords get that tax credit for wood burning stoves nevertheless we have had modest success during the past yea r in negotiating for the region for example president regan personally pledged i o me his support for continuation of a 3 4 billion test program targeting defense spending to high unemployment areasthe socalled maybank program the administratiorn agreed to shift approximately 2 7 billion ir budget priorities in the omnibus reconciliation act enacted in august from that originally called for in the spring this included funds for health medicaid education student loans vocational education youth training transportation amtrak conrail and mass transit as well as for energy conservation programs such as low income energy assistance and weatherization projects provisions were added to the tax bill to encourage rehabilitation of existing plants rather than moving operations to the south and west cooperative research and develop activities between private industry and universities and special tax treatment of tools used in automobile production i am proud of our work and i am thankful for the progress we have made but it is only a beginning representing a relatively small part of the effort needed to ensure lasting success so much of our work has been simply to retain what i call maintenance programs such as food stamps school lunches health care unemployment benefits and others vitally important but which do not contribute directly to our future growth and development needless to say we must continue this work but it must also be expanded ceta positions must be replaced by productive jobs in the private sector not welfare benefits health research must provide answers that replace health care benefits with preventative health practices high technology applications must supply the jobs laid off autoworkers cannot find on the assembly line if people are to live productive lives in the intercity they must be able to provide themselves with adequate housing transportation and education as a county commissioner i struggled with these issues hoping that the property tax along with revenues from state and federal government would provide the resources for meeting local needs as a state senator i struggled with the same problems but from a slightly different perspective that time i hoped that the income and sales taxes coupled with uncle sams contributions would balance the budget now as a member of congress i find that i am looking for answers to the same problems from yet another perspective while each level of government is working toward many of the same goals there exists a profound degree of fragmentation and isolation particular federal programs may or may not meet the peculiar needs of a certain community but the mayor or city manager grabs whatever federal funds are available and works them into a patchwork of federal state and local revenues in an effort to meet a strained budget state officials present their federal budget priorities not in terms of which programs are most effective but which ones will provide the most dollars as they work desperately to balance their budgets meanwhile mimbcrs of congress are presented with such a vast array of demands and corresponding programs that they can hardly keep up with their content and legislative status to say nothing of their implementation unfortunately government officials do not have a monopoly on this parochial method for dealing with problems competition and lack of communication are often the rule in relations between labor and management private industry and the schools producing future employees and yes cocasionally even between leader of the press and the communities they serve where 0 where do we stop and take a coordinated look at the needs of a particualr community or region and develop a comprehensive plan for its development and operation instead we continue living in a vacuum from year to year with little planning on a longterm basis and even less coordination among related jurisdictions in my view if we truly are to deal with our problems in an effective manner we must address the chaotic situation li have just described we must do it by region within states and we must do it by region within the united states in that regard i would like to share briefly with you two proposals i have advanced together with the detroit news i have suggested a statewide leadership conference in my home state of michigan to serve as a catalytic mechanism for key decisionmakers to sit down together and hammer out a comprehensive agenda it would consist of a working group of 6075 peoplelarge enough to reflect the spectrum of michigans people and interests but small enough to allow meaningful interaction with one another some years ago i organized a similar broadbased conference to set an agenda for the future of communities around my home town it has been extremely successful in identifying goals and producing results secondly i discussed with president reagan and subsequently presented the white house with a draft of a proposal for creation of a northeast midwest economic advisory council the general purpose of which would be to assemble members of congress governors mayors and other representatives of

from the white house to the capitol to visit with the leadership of the other body and the leadership of the house it was the culmination of a long and serious effort to develop a compromise accept able to the leaders of both parties and the leaders of both branches of the legislature and to the executive branch after 3 hours of discussion it was obvious that there was no ground for compromise i think the underlying explanation of most value to the american c itizen looking at a period of high interest rates high unemployment asking what is happening in washington the most accurate explanation was given by the majority leader of the other body howard baker of tennessee and the speaker of this house tip oneill who both said in separate interviews what it boiled down to was a question of different philosophies speaker oneill was statesmanlike and candid in his assessment of president reagan he said i think he is a sincere man who genuinely believes that his tax cut program will work similarly those of us who disagree with speaker oneill should give him his due he also is asincere man since 1l52 as a member of this house for 30 years he has worked to build a liberal welfare state for 30 years as a member of this house he has worked to build that liberi welfare state for 28 years he has been in the majority he has belonged to the people who have run the house of representatives and for those 28 years that majority with speaker oneill as part of it has worked to build the liberal wel^are state he has presided over deficits under four presidents as majority leader under richard nixon as speaker under gerald ford under jimmy carter and under ronald reagan he is accustomed to the politics of the liberal warfare state by 1980 his efforts had produced 21percent interest rates 13 percent inflation rates a decaying automobile industry a collapsing housing industry and a country faced with a crisis in small business and in jobs his party had become the party of weak defense big spending high taxes high interest rates and job destruction faced with repudiating a lifetimes work by compromising with the president or walking away from the chance for a compromise and sticking to the liberal welfare state principles that had guided his career i think the speaker did something which was honorable and consistent with his own record but there are many members of this congress who happen to be democrats but have not had the same career do not have the same commitment and we are now seeking to build a bipartisan coalition of democrats and republicans who have given up on the centralized liberal welfare state who realize that the politics of big government big spending high taxes high interest rates will destroy jobs and will put americans out of work we hope the democrats of the younger generation we hope the democrats who are not committed to the liberal welfare state we hope the democrats who understand the economic sickness of 1980 will join with us if we cannot have a compromise of leaders then let us have a compromise of members let us work together to find a budget which will put people back to work will bring down interest rates and will bring together the members of both parties in an effort to find a real solution we ask no one to switch parties although we are delighted with those who do so we ask no one to give up their traditional ties all we ask is the democrats willing to place country above partisanship look at the current economic crisis and agree to join us the type of medicine that would make america healthy is simple first keep the tax cut which on july 1 will increase the number of real dollars in americans paychecks which will give americans a better chance to go out in their neighborhood to buy a car to buy a house to make the investments and the savings that will get this country moving again second cut federal spending including some cuts in defense spending in order to bring down the deficit so that the federal government will not borrow so mqch money so that the interest rates will fall so that small business can survive so that we can go back to creating jobs in the automobile and housing industries third pass a constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget that will by itself bring down interest rates as the money markets come to realize that we have in fact reached a historic watershed and that we are moving on to an era in which the government will be disciplined and in which we will have to begin balancing the budget every year that by itself passing a constitutional

chance to have real prosperity citizens who are impatient who have grown angry watching people laid off watching businesses go bankrupt or the senior politicians talk citizens can do something first

emphasis on research and education in the food and agricultural sciences it is no secret why america leads the world in the production of food fiber and forest products the effort to put our country in that leadership role began as far back as 1862 when our government entered into a longstanding commitment to endorse and support public expenditures at state landgrant colleges and universities for agricultural research and education programs for the extension of technical knowledge from the science laboratories to the user farmers and ranchers of this nation this effort also included as well programs that enhanced the living conditions and standards for farm and rural people and people throughout our country this commitment reached its climax in 1939 when approximately 39 percent of all federal research and development funds were allocated to agricultural research and education unfortunately by 1975 funds for agricultural research and education had sunk to approximately 2 percent of the federal r d budget fortunately for the american farmer and consumer these earlier efforts paid such rich dividends that our nation gained the capability to produce a cornucopia of food fiber and forest products far outstripping the capabilities of our competitors moreover our agriculture industry with only about 3 percent of the nations labor force as farmers produces such an abundance of food and fvber that our own people enjoy the best quality diet purchased with a smaller percent of disposable income of any people in the world in the history of man this remarkable feat has been made possible through extensive technological developments adopted by our farm producers and processors these developments and adoptions have as their basis the research and educational institutions our landgrant colleges and the 1890 institutions across the nation agriculture is one bright spot for america in the world marketplace while our nation is blessed with natural resources necessary for extensive agricultural production as well as a favorable climate in much of the nation the might and importance of the industry are dependent on other factors primarily past technological development we must continue to develop new technology if we are to maintain our world market position two decades ago most americans held the notion that products made in japan were cheap handmade trinkets with little durability what a change has taken placel where in the world will similar changes take place to enable farm producers to outcompete american producers only if we maintain a commitment to those factors that have enabled the american agricultural industry to grow in magnitude and importance will we maintain our ability to sell significant amounts of our production to the world and pay for the vast qualities of raw products we must import from other nations to fuel and feed our own industries and provide jobs for american labor and only by selling to the world market can we share in meeting the needs of hungry undernourished people of the world it is known that the worldwide demand for food and fiber will increase throughout tile rest of this century it is anticipated that people of the world will seek a better quality diet which will include more animal products in other areas of the world there have been examples of dramatic improvements in agricultural production india long riddled with famine is now producing enough wheat to meet most of its domestic needs this is a direct result of unitedstates wheat research advanced by normand borlaug at cimmyt in mexico and subsequently adapted in india similarly rice production in asia has significantly increased as a result of research at the international rice research institute in the philippines we in this nation have experienced approximatey a twofold increase in crop yields since 1940 largely a result of technology initiated over a century ago we know that there are substantial dividends for investments in technological developments in tuture agricultural production some have said that the importance of agriculture is equal to if not greater than that of our national defense system in regards to maintaining a strong competitive agriculture the soviet union and peoples republic of china are placing the highest priority on food production research with emphasis not only on output but on stable production from year to year we feel that the future of america can be no better than the future of the agricultural industry it is within the national interest to provide public support for agricultural research and education while we know there will be demand for farm products we should not take for granted the possibility that american agriculture will fill that demand without competition in most recent years productivity on american farms has been plateauing some of the reasons for this plateauing are soil erosion reduced soil organic matter soil compaction chemical residues more less productive land in production increased pressure on prime land for nonfarm uses fewer options for water fertilizer and pesticides increased regulatory constraints and decreased support for agricultural research and extension in real dollars this plateauing is not the result of not having any remaining potential to realize from continued research and education while approximately half of the agricultural reseach in the united states is funded with private funds we do not feel the nation should rely more heavily on this funding source furthermore many necessary projects would never be undertaken were we to rely on private initiative funding of food and agricultural research involves the expense of having things ready to go when research is required being prepared demands maintenance and replacement of research tools flocks herds barns feed milking parlors machinery field stations land orchards crops irrigation equipment and greenhouses we see a need for consistent formula funding of the hatch act as these funds are the basis for maintaining research systems benefits to farmers from research which reduces the cost of producing food fiber and forest products spill across county and state lines when we develop improved technology early acceptors and implementors benefit but in the long run the true benefactor is the american consumer research benefits everyone in the supermarkets therefore it is appropriate to maintain significant federal funding federal funds provide an element of federal influence this influence is in the form of coordination of efforts and results in minimizing duplications federal involvement also provides for upward and outward movement of information the usda science and education agenciesars csrs and extensionare examples of effective federal agencies further csrs and extension which manage federal state partnership research and education programs are federal agencies with relatively limited staffs that provide valuable coordination points for these programs the next generation of researchers and teachers and demonstrators have some exciting opportunities the results of their efforts can be even more dramatic than the results of the past researchers can keep american agriculture great with greater photosyn thetic efficiency improved biological nitrogen fixation genetic improvement and cell fusion techniques great er resistance to competing biological systems more efficiency in nutrient uptake and conversion reduction in losses from nitrification and denitrification greater resistance to environmental stresses and identification of hormonal systems and mechanisms to mention but a few areas chemically synthesized nitrogen fertilizer represents the largest single industrial input into agricultural production onethird of the fossile fuel energy consumed in food production is for this use each pound of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer requires an input of 30 cubic feet of natural gas when applied to the land much of this fertilizer can be lost to leaching by rain or to volitalization to the air the amount lost will depend on variance in the weather consider the significance of research that could result in a crop such as corn fixing nitrogen from the air solar energy is clean renewable and nonpolluting agriculture is the only major industry that directly depends on solar energy we farm the sun plants are literally biological sun traps and we ought to invest more of our resources to learn more about this magical process we recognize and agree with the need to reduce government spending we also recognize the dramatic returns available from investments in agricultural research and education we are convinced that the commitment should be increased and that the federal partner must participate in the increases we hope that the future will have increases even more extensive than those proposed by the administration in this years budget i am proud to report that the president and the secretary of agriculture are both in full support of the need for maintaining our leadership role in american agriculture now and into the future in this regard is is

in elementary and secondary education funds and 700 million more for student financial aid programs i do not believe it is wise to cut off 600 million more or half the youth employment and training programs to do so would be to eliminate good investments in human resources that will make people more productive in the future equally vital is the wellbeing of our population yet the latta substitute calls for a cut of 2 3 billion in our child nutrition programs and a 25percent decrease in funding for discretionary health programs which provide care for poor and other medically underserved people these are devastating reductions for our capital budget the latta substitute means deeper cuts in amtrak conrail and mass transit it will effectively halt federal alternative energy

dupont offer they are the right kind of people of course the fact that they promise to retain conocos top management did not hurt their chances its tough to go out and find another six figures salary on short notice and mobil well let me quote mr willard grimmn a well known merger expert who said that mergers of this type are primary tools for achieving comparies growth goals namely to lessen risk and obtain better cash flow the key phrase here is to lessen risk this from the industry that insists they need all those profits so they can throw the dice in search of more energy resources to free the united states from foreign sources these three companies i can assure you are not dice throwers and they are not out on the frontier of risk they are looking for the sure thing the instant winner or in the vernacular of the race track the sailboat race an ironic note about a merger with mobil is that conoco finds their advances so repulsive that conoco threatens to sue mobil on the grounds that a merger with them would violate antitrust laws since when have the corporate giants showed such sensitivity to antitrust laws the next logical question is who will finance these forays into merger land now any eighth grader will tell you that it is better to use someone elses capital and not your own so of course most of the primary and secondary suitors have established lines of credit with their friends the bankers mobil has established a 8 billion line of credit with a group on international banks led by citibank texaco has arranged a 5 5 billion line of credit marathon oil co has arranged a 5 billion line of credit with chase manhattan bank cities service co has arranged a 1 billion loan this is all occuring during a period of time in our country when it is difficult to get a loan for a house or a car with skyhigh interest rates for working men and women and at a time when congressional budget conferences are trying to decide if middle class college students should get loans and banks are testifying to congressional committees on the same subject that they do not wish to become involved in such small loans i dont know how my colleagues feel on this subject but it is difficult for me to stand by as congress votes for budget cuts in essential services and not speak out aginst this carnival of avarice that continues day after day commenting on the accelerating pace of merger moves the economist robert lekachman remarked the reagan administration which promised an investment boom has instead unleashed the wildest collection of mergers and takeover events since napoleon conquered most of europe the merger of conoco and any of the suitors will not result in any real economic growth for this country but is merely a redistribution of the wealth among the wealthiest giants of corporate american industry today you cannot get a loan to buy a house a car or to put your children through school but if you want to buy an oil company have i got a deal for

sponsored by congressmen jones and damouns and endorsed by the house committee on merchant marine and fisheries establishes a fund to provide coastal states with a means to maintain ocean resources management and development i am a cosponsor of this legislation and as a representative from maine and a resident of a coastal area there i believe the concept embodied in h r 5543 is a significant one the bill establishes a stable source of funding to insure the continuation of important coastal and marine resource programs that serve both national and state interests as the need for management of our coastal and ocean resources increase it is essential that we give the relevant agencies adequate financial support so that the goals of the coastal management laws enacted by congress can be carried out this proposed legislation gives the states and federal government the opportunity to continue the essential partnership which was established in the coastal zone management act of 1972 and which congress has since recognized as an internal part of ocean resource management the partnership initiated in those laws has led to a balanced and coordinated decisionmaking process that sets up guidelines for a variety of activities occurring in the coastal zone the fisheries conservation zone and on the outer continental shelf h r 5543 includes provisions that insure the continued funding of the coastal zone management act and the national sea grant college program which are the cornerstone of national oceanrelated planning and research activities these laws were enacted in response to rapidly increasing pressures on this nations coastal resources which have not diminished in any way since then in fact in view of the recently approved outer continental shelf accelerated 5year leasing plan i would submit that the pressures on our marine resources are greater than ever as multiple and competing uses take place in areas of national concern or under federal jurisdiction states coastal and marine resource management agencies inevitably become deeply involved in addressing national concerns maintaining federal support of programs such as coastal zone management and sea grant as proposed in h r 5543 is an entirely appropriate role for the federal government to play the money allocated through the ocean and coastal resources management and development fund will be transferred to the states through an already wellestablished program that was set up to help the coastal states handle the pressures of a federal activity offshore drilling that federal activity now seems to be a top federal priority and we cannot ignore the impact this has on coastal communities the czm program is a very diverse one and each federally approved state program is designed to meet the needs of that particular state to obtain federal approval the state plan must take into account the national interest and also coordinate activities with local governments and the public this program therefore represents the necessary and important balance among federal state and local concerns and presents the rare opportunity for communication so that as many of those interests as possible can be recognized the resulting programs now acquired by 27 states and territories focus on the review and analysis of ocs exploration and development plans assessment and analysis of the impacts of proposed uses of marine and coastal zone resources expanded enforcement responsibility in all areas of environmental concern and resource management in the coastal zone and expanded biological research activities again i do not think it is appropriate for the federal government to turn its back on these projects especially at a time when accelerated offshore leasing is certain to generate additional state concerns we cannot simply say that we are no longer concerned with offshore fisheries problems or the impact of energy development on the coastal zone because in doing so we will damage the partnership we have so carefully crafted h r 5543 establishes a fair and equitable method of providing a continuing federal role in that partnership it must be recognized that our marine and coastal resources need to be conserved and managed and that this must be considered as a policy of importance the enactment of the 200mile limit law in 1976 represents the unitedstates claim to jurisdiction over the resources out to 200 miles and the appropriate conservation and management those resources impact heavily on coastal areas the entire nation benefits from the planning that occurs through existing laws h r 5543 recognizes in its funding formula the need for congress to pay heed to existing pressures on coastal communities as well as planning for future activities i urge my colleagues to support h r 5543 so that we may in fact recognize and address the needs of coastal communities e"], [0.0002668797969818115, 0.4997331202030182, 0, "this bill h r 5536 would authorize a feasibility study of the prairie bend unit in central nebraska the prairie bend project was originally proposed in 1976 it would provide direct irrigation water for approximately 70 000 acres in central nebraska and will also help to recharge local ground water tables in an additional 136 000 acres of an area which has suffered some of the most significant declines of any area of nebraska in recent years the project enjoys overwhelming local support and the support of the governor of nebraska the nebraska natural resources commission the interagency water coordinating committee and the entire nebraska delegation in the unitedstates house of representatives similar legislation has been introduced in the senate and is included in the omnibus feasibility study bill which is currently awaiting consideration in that body funds for commencing the feasibility study in fiscal 1983 are expected to be included in the energy and water appropriation measure to be considered later this year the study would develop and assess multiobjective alternatives to irrigate up to about 70 000 acres of land using water from the platte river stabilize ground water in an area of about 136 000 total acres provide outdoor recreation maintain and enhance habitat for waterfowl including the endangered whooping crane enhance the quality of ground water and other beneficial uses the study would evaluate the availability of water resources in the area for all beneficial uses and the physical and economic feasibility of alternatives the prairie bend unit is located in a predominately agricultural area with several ruralorientated towns the closest large metropolis is grand island nebr a city of over 30 000 population private well irrigation development has resulted in declines in ground water levels causing increased pumping lifts operating costs and energy use some of the area and towns are experiencing deteriorating ground water quality and are having to seek other locations for wells for domestic and municipal uses pumping may be affecting the wet meadow complexes which are necessary habitat for the endangered whooping cranes and other migratory water fowl also some of the creeks and drains in the area experience frequent flooding development of a multipurpose project would maintain a reliable irrigation economy by means of conjunctive use of ground and surface water provide flood protection assist in maintaining desired habitat for migratory birds including the sandhill and whooping cranes and other wildlife provide for waterbased recreation a sports fishery save energy and improve ground water quality and regulate streamflows the central nebraska conservancy association and the central platte natural resource districts are sponsors of the project and are seeking authorization for feasibility studies the central nebraska conservation association has water right application on file with the state of nebraska to divert a portion of the platte river in the offseason for irrigation and offstream storage they have held numerous meetings within the area and have obtained overwhelming local support i would like to point out that this bill has the support of the administration and the bureau of reclamation has expressed its willingness to move forward with the study as soon as funds are made available the potential effects of actual construction of the prairie bend project upon the habitat of the sandhill cranes and the endangered whooping crane is an important issue the area downstream from the proposed project area is a prime habitat of these graceful and magnificent birds and of course any adverse impact upon that area must be given the most serious consideration before any project can be authorized in fact during committee consideration of this bill i supported an amendment to specifically require a detailed study of those effects even though i was confident that the environmental impact statement associated with the feasibility study would do so in the absence of such an amendment one particular aspect of the bill the costsharing arrangement by which the local sponsoring agencies have agreed to accept a substantial portion of the cost is a significant step for the congress to take in authorizing feasibility studies for water projects the willingness of the potential beneficiaries to bear that cost is indicative of the strong support in the local area and will serve as an example for future project sponsors that they will henceforth be expected to contribute to meeting the cost of these projects and the associated studies the adoption of this bill by the house as well as the previous bill marks the dawning of a new day in water resource development with the inclusion of these costsharing provisions with these comments i urge my colleagues to lend their support to the passage of this measure under suspension of the rules i yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from
