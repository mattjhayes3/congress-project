{"top_correct": [[0.0, 1.0, 1, "i want to begin by welcoming our new members and by thanking the gentlewoman from ohio congresswoman marcia fudge for her leadership of the congressional black caucus during the 113th congress thanks to her dedication and tireless work this caucus is better positioned to address the diverse challenges of the african american community i also want to thank the new cbc chair the honorable congressman g k butterfield of north carolina i am confident that he will do a great job leading this caucus with steadfast commitment to justice and to building an america that works for everyone let me also thank my counterpart the honorable congresswoman robin kelly for joining me in leading the cbc special orders this year i am truly honored to take on this new role and i look forward to working with her as we help carry out the critical mission of this caucus 50 years ago in the midst of the civil rights movement hundreds of brave men and women gathered in selma alabama to begin a long arduous march to montgomery in support of the fundamental truth that every american regardless of what they look like has the right to vote on march 7 1965 600 men and women set out from selma following the death of 26yearold jimmie lee jackson a deacon from marion alabama who died from gunshot wounds inflicted by a state trooper at a nonviolent demonstration theirs was a peaceful nonviolent march but it was met with fierce brutality it would take the marchers two more attempts to arrive at montgomery but on march 25 after a 12day journey they did arrive since that day our country has made significant strides in achieving equality and justice for all but significant challenges remain unmet tonight we will examine where we have come from where we are and where we would like to go as a society we must be ready to go in 1965 selma became the focal point of voter registration efforts in the south at the time only 2 percent of the citys eligible african american voters had been able to register the impact of selma to the montgomery march was profound as dr king said selma produced the voting rights legislation of 1965 the voting rights act of 1965 banned discriminatory voting requirements that disenfranchised african american voters throughout this country yet today the dream of full equality is still something many african americans can only dream of where we are nearly 6 years after the end of the recession people still struggle to find work and the gap between the rich and poor continues to grow for african americans this situation is severe given the disproportionate effect of unemployment on our communities at the same time there remains widespread poverty a defining challenge of our time this persistent economic inequality threatens to undercut the gains that african american communities have made and it undermines the idea of economic mobility the idea that if you work hard in this country and have ambition you can get ahead the economic crisis is not only facing african american communities where we are in education education is the most important economic investment we can make now and for future generations yet across the country we still have seen cuts to education at all levels and attacks on critical programs like head start and pell grants these attacks undermine the ability of african americans to get aheadthat is why i strongly support president obamas new bold initiative for free access to community collegesso too do efforts to dismantle social safety net programs which our communities depend on those efforts are irresponsible unjust and contrary to who we are as americans the congressional black caucus will make criminal justice reform a centerpiece of our agenda we will work to reduce the epidemic of poverty in this country we will work to create educational opportunities for african american children and we will support efforts to strengthen our 105 historically black colleges and universities the cbc also remains committed to fighting against efforts to dismantle the social safety net we are determined to restore section 5 of the voting rights act and to make sure everyone regardless of what they look like or where they come from has equal access to the polls and we resolve to ensure that increasing diversity in this nation is reflected in american corporations together these policies will bring us closer as a nation where we are empowering the communities of african americans and they will benefit from the full equality and live the american dream there is no doubt that we are in difficult times in this nation injustices are widespread and threaten some of our most fundamental rights but we will find no answers in apathy no comfort in complacency as we always have we will continue the march for progress for freedom for justice and for equality for all it is my honor and privilege now that i yield to the distinguished gentlewoman from illinois ms"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "last week congress concluded with a spotlight on gun safety and the yawning chasm between the attitudes of the republicancontrolled congress and the needs and desires of the american people why should america be the only developed nation on the planet that cannot protect its families from gun violence obviously there are no simple solutions in a nation where there is a gun for every adult where a halfdozen people have been killed in recent years by their pets and even babies kill parents and their siblings with guns too many people feel that more guns and fewer protections is the solution obscuring the fact that the overwhelming majority of the american public agrees that there are things we can do and that it is irresponsible and cynical not to try for more than 24 hours last week my democratic colleagues and i discussed many of these solutions on the floor of the house demanding action on three for instance over 90 percent of the american public and a majority of gun owners agreed that there should be no anonymous secret purchases of weapons there should be a universal background check people who cannot buy firearms at a gun store should not be able to buy guns over the internet or at gun shows anonymously the american public supports us in our efforts to make it harder for people the government has deemed too dangerous to buy a plane ticket to purchase assault weapons and it is past time to eliminate the outrageous prohibition against the centers for disease control to even study the epidemic of gun violence that kills three or four americans every hour these solutions are not really that hard they would be a signal that we are serious about trying to change the gun violence equation that kills about 90 people every day i returned to oregon last week and had encouraging meetings with dozens of people who have been leading the charge in my home state who are redoubling their efforts they have demonstrated that steps can be taken through the political process and are committed to building upon their commonsense actions for example they led the charge to prevent people with a history of domestic violence and restraining orders from purchasing guns the oregon legislature finally enacted universal background checks like we are seeking at the federal level and the oregon house of representatives even passed legislation last session that would have closed the socalled charleston loophole where law enforcement has a 10day delay for a purchase if the police are unable to determine that purchasers qualifications i was impressed and encouraged that these ordinary citizens so devoted to this cause are committing to taking on the issue further at the state and local level and making it an issue in the political elections in the fall wherever they can it is only that type of activity that will overcome the inertia the temerity and the cynicism of people who are apologists for gun violence the same way we embarked upon a decadeslong crusade to reduce traffic fatalities that cut that death rate in half we need to embark on a similar crusade to reduce gun violence the members who took to the floor over 24 hours showed a powerful expression of policy and emotion that used to be seen on the floor of this house but is sadly seldom in evidence today but it is not too late congress should do its part to at least allow the issue the attention and the consideration we would give to any other public health crisis and end the shame of being the only developed nation on the planet that cannot protect its families from gun violence"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "mr chair let me thank our ranking member congresswoman mccollum for yielding and for her tremendous leadership of this subcommittee mr chair the fiscal year fy 2016 interior and environment bill before us would place health and safety of all americans at risk it dangerously cuts finding by 246 million from fy2015 levels and is 3 1 billion less than the presidents fy2016 request the deep cuts to this bill would undermine our air quality land water and conservation funding and will have devastating impacts on all communities in my home state of california and across the country whats worsethis bill slashes funding for the environmental protection agency epa by more than 700 million dollarsfrom fy2015 levels and funds the agency at more than a billion dollars less than the presidents fy2016 request these profound cuts would significantly harm the clean water fund and the safe drinking water fundcritical programs that ensure the safety of our drinking water and our children it also includes 40 million in cuts to the historic preservation fund hpp which would weaken the national park services nps ability to preserve sites significant in the civil rights movement this includes sites like the selma to montgomery national historic trail where many of us participated in the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of bloody sunday furthermore there are also egregious policy riders in this bill that would block clean air protections such as the epas clean power plan too many families particularly those in lowincome vulnerable communities already suffer from poor air quality because of dirty carbon pollution we know that communities of color are disproportionately affected by pollutionrelated illnesses including asthma according to the american academy of allergy asthma and immunology one in six african american and one in nine latino children suffer from asthma there are other toxic policy riders that would block the protection of our imperiled wildlife under the endangered species act like the greater sage grouse population the endangered species act is the only law that has safeguarded more than 2 000 plants and wildlife from extinction this law enjoys broad support from nearly 85 percent of americans and yet here we are again with a bill that seeks to undermine decades of animal protection and runs counter to vast public support mr chair we need to continue to fight to defend our environment address climate change and make real meaningful impacts on reducing greenhouse gas emissions so we protect our environment our children and our future unfortunately the bill before us does just the opposite i hope that as this process moves forward we can address the insufficient funding allocations and backwards policy riders that would harm every american and put our precious environment at risk"], [0.0, 1.0, 1, "on april 24 we will mark the 100th anniversary of the armenian genocide 100 years ago 1 5 million armenians along with the syrians and greeks were slaughtered by the ottoman empire in the first genocide of the 20th century the sheer scale of genocide thwarts our capacity to comprehend it 1 5 million armenians killed 6 million jews killed in the holocaust 1 million tutsis the numbers become abstractions sanitized by their enormity it is only when we consider each of those lives individually that the full horror comes into focus the victims of genocide are more than victimsthey are human beings the armenians massacred from 1915 to 1923 were men women and children who were targeted in what was then an unprecedented campaign to wipe out an entire people it is our duty in the modern day to remember those lost and to bear witness that the campaign to destroy the armenian people failed we do so by speaking the truth and we do so by speaking the names of those 1 5 million and by keeping both the way they lived and the way they died alive in our memory earlier this month i asked my thousands of armenian constituents and millions of armenians around the country and the world to submit the names and stories of their family members who were killed 100 years ago the response was overwhelming thousands of people sent the names and stories of ancestors killed in the genocidethe names of infants and toddlers ripped from their mothers arms the names of children and the elderly dying of exhaustion and starvation on a forced march to deir ezzor the names of women and girls raped and brutalized and killed the names of clergy tortured and burned alive in their own churches the names of men robbed of their possessions of their homes and of their lives each victim has a name and a story from glendale to yerevan to jordan and every corner of the world where armenian diaspora lives families sent me those names and those stories it is my honor to read some of those names this hour knowing that it would take more than 1 000 hours more than 50 days to read all of them turkey may deny the genocide our administration may lack the courage to recognize the genocide our congress may lack the courage to recognize the genocide but no one can deny the humanity of its victims and no one can deny our right to speak the truth one hundred years ago 1 5 million armenians were killed in the armenian genocide these are their names george tutunjian harutsun

bringing clarity to this debate today democrats have always believed that innovation is what keeps america number one i think that that is a view that is shared by all of us in the congress our commitment on our side of the aisle i know is to science and to research and development which create jobs launch entire new industries and give the miraculous power to cure for americans to continue to lead in the 21st century for us to meet the challenges of our time for us to secure a strong and sustainable future for americas families and the next generation we must commit to fueling the engines of innovation when president kennedy challenged americans to reach for the moon he reminded us that america must lead in innovation the vows of this nation can only be fulfilled if we are first and therefore we intend to be first our leadership in science and in industry our hopes for peace and security our obligations to ourselves as well as to others all require us to make this effort however according to the american academy of arts and sciences these days the united states has dropped to 10th place in national r d investment as a percentage of the gdp as their report makes clear unless basic research becomes a higher government priority than it has been in recent decades the potential for fundamental scientific breakthroughs and future technological advances will be severely constrained instead of meeting this urgent need and challenge republicans are coming to the floor of this house today with not one but two bills that do violence to that aspiration first of all we have the socalled republican r d bill a completely unpaidfor permanent and deficitexploding tax extension democrats support the r d tax credit and we will be offering a motion to recommit for a 2year extension to give congressdemocrats and republicanstime to work together to pass comprehensive tax reform that closes loopholes and pays for making this tax credit permanent with this bill alone republicans will explode the deficit by 182 billion this is just a part of a larger package of permanent completely unpaidfor republican tax measures this year that will add almost 600 billion to the deficitover half a trillion dollars added to the deficitincluding this bill their bill to hand 269 billion to the 5 400 richest families in america 5 400 families and their estate tax bill would be getting the benefit of 269 billion paid for by the middle class in our country depriving us of investments in our childrens future the fact is that house republicans have spent this entire congress blowing up the deficit with unpaidfor tax giveaways overwhelmingly tilted toward wealthy special interests my colleagues hear this it is worth noting that this bill on the floor has nothing to do with enterprising startups that are unable to claim the r d tax credit some of you have said to me well we have all these startups in my district by and large they cannot benefit from this bill the way it is written we would like to have written our motion to recommit to go further to do that but the parliamentarians say because you prevent it in your base bill we cant go further this is what is really stunning in the look of it all on the same day as you are saying we are going to do a gotcha bill on r d and challenge you all who support r d not to vote for our approach on the very same daylest anybody think that this is an overwhelming interest in r d on the republican side of the aislerepublicans are bringing to the floor a competes act that completely undermines everything to do with science and innovation in our country it completely upsets our innovation agenda in the 110th congress we put forth the innovation agenda a bill developed in a totally nonpartisan way anna eshoo zoe lofgren and george miller took the lead going across the country getting input nonpartisan input academic input venture capital input technological input into an innovation agenda that innovation agenda really calls for making permanent and modernizing the r d tax credit we see the relationship between science technology innovation and progress to keep america number one with r d tax credits but not done this way as we do here this is a trap in order to keep us from investing in innovation agenda and that was something that bart gordon as chair of the science and technology committee fought for and achieved arpae you know that to name one thing but instead today republicans are bringing a bill that totally does violence to all this i hope members will listen to and support the alternative presented by congresswoman eddie bernice johnson our ranking member on the committee but anyway the original competes act by the democratic congress was supported by an overwhelming number of republicans a majority of the republicans defied their leadership and voted for the competes act in the 110th congress and that original bill passed in a bipartisan way we laid the foundation for new industries that provide jobs for our workers that open new markets for american products that ensure that we continue to rise above the gathering storm norm augustine and others led the way to show what the gathering storm was unless we made those investments in science and technology as i said we created arpae so important this republican bill betrays everything that the competes act did the republican bill betrays everything that the competes act did it is an assault on science and a plan to surrender american leadership on innovation instead of investing in research and development their bill slashes funding for essential initiatives at the national science foundation the national institute of standards and technology the office of science and technology policy the department of energy research it cuts energy efficiency and renewable energy r d by 496 million it is huge halfabilliondollar cut nearly 30 percent below what was appropriated last year it cuts arpae by 140 million 50 percent below the level in the energy and water appropriations bill passed last week most insidiously republicans are attacking science they dont even want to hear just because you dont want to hear it doesnt mean it isnt true in this competes bill that they are presenting they are trying to silence the climate environmental and social science they have consistently tried to ignore the republican bill goes so far as to forbid federal agencies such as epa and ferc from using any research funded or developed by doe a brazen attempt to divorce their decisions from scientific inquiry so again the very idea that on this floor today they come out with this masquerade of r d tax credits 182 billion added to the deficit with the impression that they care about r d r d into what r d into nothing that is about innovation to keep america number one these republican bills represent a perfect manifestation of republican trickledown economics the choice that our country has to make in the economy as we go forward is trickledown economics versus middle class economics trickledown theories have not worked they are what got us in trouble in 2008 and it is exactly what the republicans are trying to take us back to today is one manifestation of that republicans are seeking to ransack our nations investments in the future our commitment to science our commitment to our childrens education our commitment to bigger paychecks and our commitment to better infrastructure for every american family we need to come together in a bipartisan way and that is very possible we did it with the competes act before to pay for r d tax credit extension we need to reject this republican assault on science that will happen later today we need to invest in the future of innovation of our country of hardworking american families we need to reject failed trickledown economic theories and accept that the success of our nation depends on bigger paychecks for americas working families r d tax credits made permanent and modernized are a significant part of that but they are not a part of it if they take us deeper into debt preventing us from making the investments in the future i urge my colleagues to vote no on this fiscally irresponsible r d bill no on their destructive competes act and yes on the proposal made by congresswoman eddie bernice johnson who i thank for her great leadership for keeping america number one"], [2.687921494270995e-07, 2.687921494270995e-07, 0, "recently a unitedstates district court judge ruled that the administrations subsidy funding scheme for

consciences their hearts their emotions so often we dont talk about that on the floor of this august body the house of representatives but that is where it ought to flow because indeed we here both in the housethe peoples houseand the senate were sent to represent people people of a great nation people of a blessed nation a nation that has honored the worth the purpose and the value of life itself since its inception we were formed of people with great ideals great value great courage and indeed formed with their blood given for the rights and freedoms of all individuals for us to concern ourselves with protecting the most innocent among us even those that are among us in the womb i think of my new granddaughter in the womb right now in my daughters body waiting for in just a month and a half the opportunity to breathe air itself and become a functioning human being cared for growing and ultimately becoming all that god intended for her i would say the same for any human being born or unborn that we must protect i certainly thank the gentleman from arizona for his courage to push for this with unwillingness to bend and bow under those that would say oh get over it stop defending something that is indefensible i would say thank god for defending something that is totally defensible as was mentioned earlier we were founded on principles principles that were firm and correct the founders and framers long understood the power of truths versus human wisdom truths and wisdom that said we hold these truths to be selfevident that all men are created equal and endowed by their creator by their creator with certain unalienable rights among them the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness john adams said our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people it is wholly inadequate to the government of any other and indeed what we have seen in videos in recent days has evidenced that when you step out of that moral principle you go into things unthinkable and grotesque it has been said that righteousness exalts a nation but sin is a reproach to any land how could we not feel reproached in looking at videos of a licensed doctor who is willing to take and sell body parts and to countenance pain as something that is just part of the process and to be totally unconsidered i spent a good deal of my early adult life in the pulpit ministering to people from an authority far greater than this government or even this constitution the greatest document on the face of this earth manmade but the psalmists said behold children are a gift of the lord the fruit of the womb is a reward that is true certain commentators will denigrate me for bringing up these truths and so be it but they are truths jeremiah the prophet speaking of god said before i formed you in the womb i knew you before you were born i set you apart the psalmist david who became king david said for you formed my inward parts you wove me in my mothers womb does that sound like what that doctor was doing in the womb weaving carefully forming no she was destroying we must fight back against that evil he want on to say i will give thanks to you for i am fearfully and wonderfully made wonderful are your works and my soul knows it very well my frame was not hidden from you when i was made in secret and skillfully wrought in the depths of the earth your eyes have seen my unformed substance and in your book were all written the days that were ordained for me when as yet there was not one of them i thank the gentleman from arizona i thank him for his courage and standing for life itself and acknowledging the fact that the creator has formed something of greatness and we must not stand in the way but do everything possible to reject the pain to reject the defeat to reject the conquering of the human spirit beginning right in the womb may god help us in this country to repent to seek his healing to do right and to spare the innocent among

a critical part of the conversation we are having specifically this amendment asks treasury to include in their report the historical levels of federal revenue including information on corporate and individual federal income taxes while we may disagree on the merits of the underlying bill i hope that we can agree that it is important to have a complete picture of the federal budget when looking at debt and deficit issues when we look closer at our current revenue policies a fuller picture emerges this picture could change our perspective on the need to cut programs that americans hold so high and instead raise questions about the need to close loopholes that prevent us from investing in areas of the budget that support the middle class and working families here are a few reasons that we may want to consider changes to this conversation corporations used to contribute 1 out of every 3 in federal revenue today it is 1 out of every 10 at the same time corporations are more profitable than almost ever before american taxpayers are losing about 90 billion every year due to offshore tax loopholes in the 1950s corporate taxes were about 6 percent of the economy today they are 1 9 percent all in all federal revenue contributed by corporate taxes has dropped by twothirds over the last six decades this amendment would also allow treasury to look at individual tax rates so that we can examine if the wealthy are really paying their fair share currently many tax loopholes are reserved for wealthy americans these tax giveaways are leaving the middle class to pick up their tab some multimillionaires and billionaires are paying a lower effective tax rate than the average american family this is wrong hard work should never be taxed at a higher rate than making money off wall street our tax code is full of tax loopholes and tax breaks benefiting big corporations and the rich when they dont pay their fair share of the taxes the rest of us pick up the tab american families end up paying higher taxes or getting fewer services and the country goes deeper into debt if corporations and the rich paid their fair share then the economy will work better for everyone instead of making seniors pay more for medicare or cutting social security benefits we should close loopholes that allow large corporations to hide profits offshore instead of cutting funding for repairing our roads and bridges we should end huge tax subsidies to oil and gas companies making record profits instead of cutting funding for teachers and firefighters we should ask multimillionaires and billionaires to pay at least as high a tax rate as those public servants pay americas richest corporations should not be able to dodge fair taxes to pay lower rates than middle class families it is time to address corporate tax dodging and invest in america again if we close these tax loopholes for corporations that ship jobs overseas and hide profits offshore we can raise billions of dollars to invest in america we could make our classrooms less crowded improve roads and bridges and provide more security for the american people unfortunately the bill we are voting on today leaves out this entire conversation and instead offers false choices of austerity or default please i hope my colleagues will join me in asking for a fuller picture of our tax policies by supporting this amendment i

who understand the tragedy of taking a childs life before it is fully born i know there are some people like our friend donald trump who say planned parenthood has done a lot more good but the trouble is so often planned parenthood takes money from the federal government and then just refers the women out of course that has been perpetuated by this administration in its making it sound like planned parenthood does mammograms and other things that they dont do they refer people to other people why not have that money not get held up at planned parenthood why not have that money go directly to the thousands of healthcare providers that actually provide the care that the women are seeking and not have it go to planned parenthood so that they can get money from the government and then keep their abortion business going that also leads right into this article today from the national review jim geraghty regarding obamacare headline deductibles increased in 41 states under obamacare it reads freedom partners unveils a new deductibles tracker showing how much deductibles have increased on average in each state i know this will shock you but most people are finding their deductibles are going up and in some cases way up their analysis shows deductibles have increased in 41 states under obamacarein some states like mississippi by over 1 000 seventeen states representing over half of total exchange enrollment are seeing doubledigit spikes the largest increases were in mississippi which went up 39 percent washington state went up 31 percent south carolina went up 26 percent louisiana went up 24 percent florida went up 23 percent minnesota and vermont went up 22 percent arizona went up 21 percent north carolina went up 20 percent what makes it so incredibly difficult is knowing there are federal dollars that are being used for abortion and being used for purposes that are against the religious beliefs of so many americans when we think that the whole object we were told for having obamacare and passing it against the will of the majority of the american people was so that we could make sure everybody had insurance now it appears that there has not been much change in the net number of people covered under insurance oh yes it is true there are some people who were paying for their insurance who no longer have itthey cant afford it anymore it is true that we have some people who were not paying for it who are having it provided now but it really appears to have been more a transfer of working peoples money to people who were not working it appears that we have been moving into a socialist agenda for some time and that goes back to what president obama said when he first ran telling joe the plumber that he wanted it to be about spreading the wealth around the pilgrims found out that at least in this world if you try to share and share alikethe early new testament tried it and it didnt workand if you start allowing people who are not working to have the same benefits as those who work you will have more and more people who are not working i hear from so many of my constituentsi know i hear from others of my friends here in congressthat constituents are hurting their insurance is costing more and like this article points out the deductibles have gone higher ask one of my staff who is not making very much if you make 30 000 and if you have a deductible of 6 000 as a healthy young person what that basically means is that every dime you are paying into health care is not going to help your health care whatsoever you are paying for the new irs agents the new navigators and the new government union workers who will never spray bactine on anybodys cut who will never put a bandaid on they will just keep adding forms adding requirements taking more time away from the true healthcare providers and more money away from the true healthcare providers for bureaucrats i know back when i was an exchange student in the soviet union and when i went and toured some of the most uptodate facilities in what was the soviet union at the time i thanked god that i lived in america i thanked god that we had such incredible health care and that i didnt have to rely on what appeared to have been 30 or 40yearold antiquated healthcare methods and equipment for my health care even living in the small town of mount pleasant as i did i knew we had a lot better healthcare facilities in my hometown where i was growing up than they did in one of the largest citieswell the largest city in ukrainekiev where i toured facilities i toured a medical school and i couldnt believe how far behind our medical schools that they were it is what happens when you continue moving towards socialized health care i know mr trump initially wanted the government to provide everybodys health care but apparently in his being informed that conservatives dont like that he is now saying no that that is not where he is going we know that president obama back before he was president was caught on video saying that we want to go to single payerin other words socialized medicinewhere the government is in charge of everybodys health care i know i have got conservative friends who say louie we dont have to worry we dont have to fight obamacare because socialized medicine always fails they are wrong socialism always fails as margaret thatcher said eventually you run out of other peoples money you incentivize not working and penalize working and that is what we are doing here in america now we are moving in that direction toward socialism the only time true capitalism true free liberty entrepreneurism in the marketplace fails is when it starts moving into socialist tendencies and adopting socialist ways then that can spell doom for capitalism those who want to have a dictatorial federal national government that is where they want to see things go but it is ironic that when a free market society struggles it is when they start incorporating socialist tendencies and rewarding improper conduct or nonworking then you have a lot more people not working you incentivize people not to hire you penalize people for hiring you penalize people for hiring more than 50 people like obamacare does i have talked to people that still say that they could hire more but they are not going to because of obamacare that means there are people walking around today going from business to business looking for a job that will not find that business that will hire them because of obamacare when you have young people with 5 6 7 000 deductible health insurance they are paying for the bureaucracy they are not paying for health care apparently some religious beliefs dictate against birth control mine doesnt my christian beliefs but i absolutely respect the religious beliefs of those who are against it they should not have to pay for people to violate their religious beliefs that used to be the way this country grew and was blessed by god but as we turn further and further away from what was a blessing to america then the world hurts i have seen it in africa the middle east asia south america when we are not strongas i have said numerous times quoting a south african gentleman when you get weak we suffer please tell people in washington to quit getting weaker we suffer when you are weaker these kind of programs obamacare make us weaker when we provide the resources the ability for the largest supporter of terrorism in the world to have over 100 billion which they say some of it is for sure going to be spent on more terrorism that is the kind of activity that will not be blessed that is the kind of activity that brings a nations demise so health care is costing more deductibles are going up people are paying more for higher deductibles less coverage yes there are some who because of the government subsidies are saying well mines a little less than it was before but the people that are working are paying more and it is devastating it is critical that those of us who have a voice in this city make our voices heard for those in our districts you cant be listening to the talking heads in this town and think you have heard from america i mean look at politico last week they said i had a close race tuesday with one opponent spending tremendously more than i did two opponents i won with 82 percent so that is what politico calls a close race i know that i didnt win with 82 percent because of my looks and certainly not because of the way i sound it is because i make my voice heard for the huge majority of people in east texas with all the common sense they have got that is what i am hearing from them they are outraged that we have allowed obamacare to last as long as it has they are suffering they are outraged that this administration has turned on our friend israel and seeing that iran is rewarded for their massive misconduct as they have continued to be the largest supporter of terrorism in the world with this administration as an accomplice as an enabler there are consequences to nations and governments that enable crime and misconduct and terrorism and abuse for those who believe in the bible it was hosea god was explaining why he was about to come down on the children of israel i love the rather loose translation when he says that it is because they have selected leaders who were not my choice so people around the country can say all they want well this president is not my president this governor is not my governor this person is not my elected representative i dont agree with them but everyone in the country will suffer the consequences of poor choices as leaders that is the way selfgovernment works now i have been reporting from this very podium for years about the misuse and abuse and providing our security by homeland security i am very grateful to judicial watch in their lawsuit against homeland security they have been able to obtain records that verify what some of us have known to be true because of whistleblowers providing us information while some whether cnn and other places belittle what we have said we knew what we were talking about but we couldnt give the sources judicial watch this headline says homeland security records reveal officials ordered terrorist watch list scrubbed it says judicial watch announced today that it obtained 183 pages of documents from the department of homeland security revealing that the obama administration scrubbed the law enforcement agencys terrorist screening database in order to protect what it considered the civil rights of suspected islamic terrorist groups the documents appear to confirm charges that obama administration changes created a massive hands off list removed data from the terrorist watch list could have helped prevent the san bernardino terrorist attack i would also submit that we have seen the emaili believe senator grassley requested more information about it to my knowledge we have not seen additional explanations or information about the email about a persons terrorist ties indication that he was a radical islamist the email response was oh this guys on the secretary of homeland securitys handsoff list we have read stories about the white house allowing at least one or more individuals with terrorist ties to come to the white house there are consequences for ignoring the law ignoring the lawbreakers and not protecting our homeland the article says the new documents were produced in response to a judicial watch february 2015 freedom of information act foia lawsuit filed back on february 13 2015 it should be noted i mean that that is over a year ago the freedom of information act request should have been answered promptly but this administration is too caught up in trying to cover up their own tracks that is why we havent even gotten the attorney general to provide members of congress the documents showing support for terrorism the boxes of documents that were provided to people who were convicted of supporting terrorism the justice department provided it to them i have asked repeatedly and the most i have gotten is reference to a few web sites they covered up their own wrongdoing they have covered up ties to terrorism they have covered up for people who have supported terrorism and there are consequences for that you learn more when you leave this town washington d c but when you have people in africa egypt jordan uae india and afghanistan telling you that your administration in america is supporting violence by not standing up against radical islam and when you hear that from muslim leaders who recognize the failures of this administration then you know that the whole world is seeing what is going on and it is only here that people have become so blind i know there are people in the republican establishment that just cannot believe that a man like trump who has spent his whole life taking one position could be leading so big in different contests and yes my friend ted cruz is doing quite well it is nice to see somebody that has been consistently doing well but around the world they see what is going on the republican establishment doesnt seem to understand people are furious they are furious about obamacare they are furious that we turned on our friend israel they are furious that we have enabled iran to continue their terrorist ways all of this at the same timeof course this wasdonald trumps big issue that shot him to the top is border security this article from today from krwg news border crime taking a toll on residents in southwest new mexico arizona says residents of new mexicos bootheel and parts of southern arizona say human smuggling and drug trafficking is taking its toll on the region the deming headlight reports that residents are scheduled thursday to express their concerns to federal officials during a meeting at the animas community center in animas new mexico judy keeler a longtime resident of the rural border region says her home was recently burglarized and its not an unusual episode for other residents residents have said state highway 80 has become a favorite for mexican cartel drug runners who manage to navigate out of the peloncillo mountains along the arizonanew mexico border they want an even more increased presence from the unitedstates border patrol apparently they are not going to get it we still hear people say there is no way to secure our entire border but this brings back a recollection in history one of my least favorite presidents woodrow wilson secured the border after pancho villa had some of his thugs come across the border and kill american families americans back then with good sense said we cant have that they spurred the president on until he sent tens of thousands of what we call national guard troops now and they secured the border nobody came across our border that we did not want to come across he did it back in the early 1900s and we cant do it now well the truth is we could do it now but you have to have an administration with the will to provide for the common defense of the american people instead we have enabled a massive amount of crime across the border regions that is spilling into other areas of the country drugs are spreading around the country we have heard also from the fbi director himself there are isis cells and there are isis investigations in every state in the union so when are they going to be triggered we know that when they are triggered with reports like we have just read here the administration has continued to cleanse our homeland security records to purge training material for the fbi for intelligence for homeland security so they dont actually learn exactly what radical islam is they dont actually learn the verses in the koran that are relied upon by radical islamists when we do finally have a muslim leader like president sissi in egypt who stands up in front of a room of muslim imams and demands that they take back their region from the radical islamists this administration chooses to try to punish him and not help him like this administration did and wanted to do more for the muslim brotherhood i am tired of hearing from foreign muslim leaders their question why is your country still helping the muslim brotherhood dont they know dont you know the muslim brotherhood has been at war with you since 1979 and you keep helping them well that is the way you lose a country you lose it we have got our choice fiscal irresponsibility which is immoral instead of doing like all preceding generations in this country which have always had as their theme we want to make our country better for our children than we had it now we have gone through a couple of generations who have said you know what forget the future generations we want future generations money spent on us now fifty years ago seventyfive years ago one hundred years ago even when cars were first invented you would not have seen a bumper sticker like is not uncommon today retired persons say we are spending our childrens inheritance you wouldnt see that because they wanted to make the country better than they had it i know you personally and you and i and our colleagues we talk about it we have talked about it todayheated conference because we want a better country even than we have had with more opportunity more freedoms as we see freedom slipping away adam kredo has a story here the flow of illegal immigrant children into the united states is expected to rise to recordbreaking numbers in 2016 as deportations decrease according to leading members of the senates judiciary committee at least 20 455 unaccompanied minors have been caught during fiscal year 2016 along the unitedstates mexico border as of last month according to committee chairman senator chuck grassley who warned that if this trend continues the number of illegal minors could eclipse a massive 2014 surge that strained the resources of the department of homeland security and prompted investigations into the obama administrations handling of the issue now one of many problems is you have people that are coming to america because there are more opportunities here which begs the question why are there more opportunities here than there are in their home country when you analyze the situation what you find is the reason they dont have businesses booming in their home country is because of graft or corruption or a corrupt government or a dictatorship because as the old saying goes capital is a coward money to capitalize or invest always goes to where it feels safestthat is why it is capital is a coward and it is not very safe in countries where the government is corrupt the rule of law is not applied across the board and the laws are not enforced across the board one of the great ironies in the world right now is that people are leaving countries where there is violence and the rule of law is not enforced they are coming to america where for most of our history we have done a better job than most any country ever in enforcing the law across the board once here illegally those same people are saying now that we are here we want you not to enforce the law across the board we want you to ignore your law on immigration and law on becoming citizens ignore it if we do that it will make us like the corrupt countries they came from and make us a land of no opportunity where people will have to go to some other country where they enforce the law i have had even members of congress say well if it all goes bad we will all pack up and head to australia but i was talking to some people from australia this year and i mentioned that to them and they didnt laugh they looked very somber they said you know if something happens to the united states you are not going to be coming to australia because china will take us over like that if the united states is not standing strong they said our country australia will be gone china would grab us up in a heartbeat it is important that america stand strong you cant stand strong when you are financially bankrupt you cant stand strong when you are morally bankrupt we seem to have our choice of ways we could meet our demise our military is being degraded under this administration the navy going back to its size back inwas it the early 1900s before world war i weakness is provocative i havent heard anybody else notice maybe there is no correlation maybe there is it seems historically from my study of history that when a nations enemy sees that nations biggest friend pulling away and not being as good a friend then that enemy is provoked to attack but it was in may of 2010 when this administration sided with israels enemies in demanding that israel disclose all their weapons systems including any potential nukes i was shocked by that the united states had never sided with all of israels enemies like that before i thought about the bible story of king hezekiah when the babylonian leaders had come to visit and schmoozed with him and isaiah asked him what have you done with the babylonian leaders of course this is a texas paraphrased version but he bragged about i have taken them and shown them all of our treasure the most literal translation from the hebrew says and i showed them all the defenses we have in our arsenal our armory isaiah explained you are going to lose the country you dont show your enemyyou dont even show your friendsall of your defenses and yet we were demanding that of israel within 48 hours israels enemies launched a flotilla to go challenge the lawful blockade of the gaza strip all that israel was doing was trying to prevent more rockets from going in because the rockets were being launched at them every daytotally legal they were trying to defend themselves against rocket attacks and created a terrible situation at the blockade but as america continues to help fund irans desire to support terrorism and as this administration has turned its back on nations like nigeria ethiopia kenya i hear from leaders in those countries where they say you know all we wanted was a little help against our enemy of course in nigeria having been there and having met with so many of the parents of girls who were kidnapped by boko haram radical islamists we then hear that our administration here says oh yeah we will give you some help but you have got to change your religious beliefs you have got to change your laws so it supports samesex marriage and you fund abortion and then we will give you more help the president in kenya basically said at a news conference in effect you take care of your country you are not going to come tell us what our religious beliefs and laws should be as a nigerian catholic bishop stated our religious beliefs are not for salenot to president obama not to anybody but there are consequences in world history when one nation tries to destroy the religious beliefs of another countrytheir closely firmly held religious beliefs there are consequences when a nation forgets to say thank you god for all of our blessings thank you god for protecting us thank you for allowing us to live in the greatest country a country in which there is more opportunity more assets per person than anywhere in the world this is the one country where the number one health problem for our nations poor is obesity it is a terrible problem that we need to deal with but where in history do you have a country where the nations poor have as their number one health problem obesity this nation has been blessed beyond anything that people could have ever dreamed when this nation was founded but the founders did see one thing they saw the threat of giving more and more power to a federal government i was fortunate to call justice scalia a friend a group of seniors from my hometown of tyler texas from my church green acres baptist came up to washington d c they said hey you are supposed to be friends with justice scalia we would love to meet him that is one thing we really want to do in washington so i called over and justice scalia bless his heart he said sure come on over so they arranged it we had the meeting he walks in they are all seated there the seniors from my church and justice scalia could be very talkative i treasure meals with him exchanging jokes and stories it made you feel good about the world he walks in and leans up against the table at the front so you want to meet me what is your question what questions have you got it kind of took them by surprise one said do you think we are the freest nation in history because of our bill of rights justice scalia in his inimitable style said oh gosh no no the soviet union had a better bill of rights than we did i had forgotten i made an a on a paper in college that i did about the bill of rights and the constitution of the soviet union yeah they were promised all kinds of rights but the government was given the power to erode all of the rights that were said to be protected he said no the reason that we are the freest country in history is because our founders did not trust government and so they wanted to make it as hard as possible to pass laws see the founders thought that gridlock was a blessing gridlock was a great thing because it meant that as people anticipated passing laws it would be tough because many laws regulate what you can and cant do the more laws you pass just as this administration has shown the american people as it has set alltime records for the most pages of regulationsthere are over 79 000 new pages of regulations every year how can anybody make a living with that kind of regulation coming out year after year certainly for the last 7 incredible the founders knew that they wanted to make it hard for any governmental agency any government bureaucracy to create laws that took away freedom because they had some libertarian tendencies justice scalia said so they wanted it hard to pass laws so what do they do they create a legislature with two houses and certainly that was part of the compromise but in england the house of lords is not particularly powerful but they wanted both houses with the power to stop what the other one was doing they wanted it very difficult in one house to pass a law i think they would cringe if they saw all the bills that are just passed with unanimous consent or on suspension that we do more and more and more because they wanted it tough to pass laws i have friends say you guys should be in session more often i say you dont know what you are asking for because every day we are in session we pass some new bill we pass some new law many of those laws take away freedoms of americans the founders knew that that is why justice scalia said they created two houses if one house got a law through it the other one could stop it cold but that wasnt enough to protect our freedom we want an executive but not one like a prime minister the prime minister is elected by the legislature we dont want that we want it tough we want independence so we are going to have a chief executive a president that is elected totally separate from the legislature even if the house and senate finally agree on something we will give him the power to just say no i am not going to let it happen but that is not enough we want more gridlock so lets create a judicial branch as they did in article iii that could turn around and say no the house senate and the president may have agreed but we dont agree it is not consistent with the constitution justice scalia said that is why we are the freest nation in history because our founders did not trust government so it concerns me when i see voters begin to think that our hope is going to arrive on air force one one of my greatest thrills was becoming friends with chuck colson as chuck colson said our hope will not arrive on air force one the old saying the axiom is true democracy ensures a people are governed no better than they deserve if you want a good president you have got to be a good country an immoral country is not going to elect a great leader they are going to elect an immoral leader when you see christians who believe that the only way to the saving grace of jesus is to ask for forgiveness and as the bible says believe in the lord jesus christ and you will be saved it is amazing to see christian leaders saying they are going to put their faith in a guy that says he has never had to ask for forgiveness but that was modified later to well i dont think gods concerned with trivial things like that if i were god i wouldnt be but thank god i am not god he seems to care about every individual if you believe the bible that is what it says and then if there is not enough bad news this comes from kpnx today attorney general report possible smuggling trail between the middle east and arizona border we have talked about that before long before the attorney general indicated that there appeared to be a trail between the middle east and the arizona border we have this story this week from stephen dinan from the washington times top border chief to agents who object to obama amnesty look for another job there you are when the head of the border agency says they are not going to enforce the laws that exist then one of two things either that is what the country deserves because it has become immoral and lawless or the country rises up and says we will never have another administration like this as long as we are alive we are going to make sure we have an administration that enforces the law no matter who it is apparently since people govern no better than they deserve we now find out that hillarys highly paid it guru at the state department had no actual national security experience so apparently we elected an administration that ensured people were governed no better than they deserve and apparently they felt like we didnt deserve a state department with national security experience is it any wonderi thank godthat there have been more benghazis under that kind of attitude one was too many we see yesterday that the justice department grants immunity to the staffer who set up the clinton email server i have been a prosecutor i have been a judge i have been a chief justice when someone grants immunity they are closing in on a prosecution that is the intent you dont grant immunity to someone and someone doesnt normally seek immunity unless they are concerned that they may have violated the law they seek immunity because they violated the law immunity is granted when with the prosecution the investigatorsin this case the fbifeel that laws are being violated so we are going to grant immunity to this person so that we can get the person further up but i still maintain that as long as hillary clinton does not condemn or expose the obama administration to any of the truth about what went on in benghazi and about the handsoff list of terrorists and homeland security i do not see her getting indicted it is a good insurance policy another article from the new york times as campaign unfolds so do inquiries into hillary clintons emails so many voters dont seem to care why because people are governed no better than they deserve if they are more concerned about themselves than their children they are going to get what they deserve well we had mitt romney come out today just before we voted condemning donald trump as phony and a fraud everybody knows that people across this country are furious with the establishment so if that idea was donald trumpsto get mitt romney to come out and condemn himit was a brilliant plan because that is like asking mary levy to tell you how to win the super bowl after he lost four of them in any event this country is in grave danger i was all over the 12 counties that i represent this country has so many great citizens they deserve better than what they are getting i hope and pray the majority in the country will wake up and see the dangers to our own national defense to our own national security from government intrusions into our private lives from drugs that are coming in through mexico and from terrorists that are coming into this country the fbi director himself says we have got them in every state we are in big trouble it is time the american people woke up and said as our parents did we dont care what has happened before we are going to

for more than 612 long years americas families and workers have been waiting for the obama administration to join with congress to pass measures that will adequately restore jobs and growth to our land the job clearly has not been finished throughout the obama administration americas growth rate has been historically anemic the truest measure of unemploymentthe rate that includes both discouraged workers and those who cannot find a fulltime jobremains over 10 percent our labor force participation rate remains mired among historic lows median real household income meanwhile is 5 percent lower than in june 2009 when the recession officially ended median incomes are supposed to rise during economic recoveries not fall the obama administration has managed to buck the historical trend however the president at least pays lip service to the need to unleash construction projects if one thinks back to the start of the obama administration one can remember president obamas plan to solve the great recession with the nearly 1 trillion stimulus bill the stimulus was supposed to work according to the president because america had shovelready projects from which new goodpaying jobs would be created once the stimulus was enacted and the money was doled out while many including myself disagreed with the fundamental premise of the stimulus bill the president blamed his stimulus bills failure on the lack of shovelready projects as he put it shovelready was not as shovelready as we expected that is the problem that todays legislationthe rapid actis intended to solve this legislation fulfills poststimulus bill calls of leaders in congress the white house the presidents council on jobs and competitiveness and the private sector to streamline the review of federal construction permit applications it contains well thought out balanced reforms that provide for more efficient and effective decisionmaking stated succinctly the rapid act gives lead federal agencies more responsibility to conduct and conclude efficient interagency reviews of permit requests demands that any entity challenging a final permitting decision in court first have presented the substance of its claims during the agency review process and requires that lawsuits challenging permitting decisions be filed within 6 months of the decisions not 6 years as the law currently allows these are simple but powerful reforms that will allow good projects to move forward more quickly delivering highquality jobs and improvements to americans daily lives prior iterations of the rapid act passed the house three times during the 112th and 113th congresses each time with bipartisan support once enacted this legislation will help to create millions of highpaying jobs and make government

community is a very split district politically but everyone agrees whether they are democrat independent or republican they want their family to be safe and secure they want their community to be safe and secure and this bill does that so it is time that we work together to get this thing passed so thank you"], [0.3423847556114197, 0.8423847556114197, 1, "i yield myself such time as i may consume i

violence in recent months has shown us that the threat of violent extremism isnt isolated to particular countries or regions more and more we see the danger posed by terrorists and foreign fighters when they can cross borders unimpeded so the united states along with our allies and partners need to do whatever we can to stop those dangerous individuals as they cross from country to country this bill would help us move in that direction here at home this legislation would ramp up coordination among government agencies dealing with this problem i would call on the administration for a specific plan laying out how we are going to meet this challenge around the world it would help governments by speeding the transfer of software and technology we can use to track people entering a country to collect biometric data and to figure out what sort of risks they might present it would prioritize the sharing of specific border security systems with foreign partners it would put a particular focus on countries where this danger is particularly acute it would establish minimum standards for international border security and makes it clear that governments that dont take this problem seriously are putting their american foreign assistance at risk this legislation provides commonsense steps to ensure our own security and that of our allies and partners i again thank mr zeldin for all his

hasnt happened in the first 10 months we can point fingers all we want but it is not getting done and this is a way to force this congress to do its job it is that simple this is not about walking
