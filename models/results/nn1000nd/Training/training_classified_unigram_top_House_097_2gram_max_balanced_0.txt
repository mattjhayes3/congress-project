in the pending measure is intended to have any effect on the personnel funding levels for the latter two va healthcare accounts research and mamoe he stated that to the maximum extent practicable the reduction is intended to have no effect on appropriations for personnel under those accourits any funding reduction in the research account or mamoe account is intended to be made primarily from nonpersonnel budget categories finally recognizing that the personnel levels that we have discussed up to this point were based on personnel costs prior to the october 1981 federal civilian pay raise gon into effect i have also discussed with mr bolan~d the effect if any the pay raise costs would have on the levels of employment intended to be funded under this resolution according to the distinguished gentleman from massachusetts with regard to personnel costs in this or any other appropriations act pay raise costs have no effect whatever on the number of frees for which approprijse

alone will not turn the tide but it will make sure that the small business administration is doing its full share in assisting the sector of the economy that needs help desperately the impetus for this bill came from the administration which asked for higher funding levels for programs aimed at the economically and socially disadvantaged this bill accomplishes that the administration asked that all direct loans except handicapped loans and mesbic loans be ended this bill accomplishes that also in place of direct loans the distinguished rankiig member of the committee joe mcdade proposed a distressed area loan program to provide leveraged funds to areas of high unemployment i cosponsored that proposal and i commend my good friend for such a constructive approach to this countrys severe unemployment problem this proposal puts money where it is needed in high unemployment areas and uses it for what is most needed to create jobs it is a proposal we can all support this bill also

arbitrary order made by the office of management and budget which the small business administration followed reluctantly the pollution control program has been shut down cold zero guarantees have been

written so that it would be interpreted to stop forced acceptance of open homosexual conduct if an individual openly professes this conduct and is discriminated against we do not want him to have legal aid in iis defense to compel acceptance of his open conduct if on the other hand he keeps his conduct to himself and does not bring it into issue then he can walk into any legal aid society as a private individual and get help on a traffic ticket or assault case or even be hired by them a homosexual who wants help on a traffic ticket can now be discriminated against this sounds terrible but a crucial question must be asked who was responsible for bringing into issue the mans homosexuality if the individual seeking help has done so discrimination is consistent with our end if the attorney from whom the help is sought injects the issue based upon conclusive information a consistent end is still arrived at if the attorney injects the issue based upon mere suspicion and the person is discriminated against his position is no worse than one which any of us might find ourselves in simply because another individual doesnt like the way we look the long and the short of the matter is that those who openly profess and promote homosexual conduct do not deserve protection of that conduct under law this is my intention if they want to keep their conduct in their private lives and not bring it into issue publicly they have the same rights as any other individual for protection under law whether it be help on a traffic ticket a case of assault robbery or whatever my amendment stops any public promotion of homosexual conduct defeating the promulgation of the regulations has the same effect any individual who brings into issue his homosexual conduct cannot receive protection under law if they keep their conduct to themselves they obviously have the same rights of any other individual in society"]]}
