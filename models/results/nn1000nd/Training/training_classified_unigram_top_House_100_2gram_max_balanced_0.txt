this house defeated the administrations request for military aid to the contres that day today the choice before us is more difficult we must decide whether to support a modified humanitarian aid package to aid the victims of war or set a strategy that will result in approving the administrations military aid package the choice today is military aid or humanitarian aid by the nature of that choice it forces approval of an aid package that hopefully begins to heal the terrible wounds of war and moves our government a small step forward toward facilitating peace in central america the key to finding a peaceful solution to the conflicts in central america has and will be adherence to the guatemala peace process led by costa rican president oscar arias the basis of our policy in that region must be to work with and respect the other nations of central america to obtain a diplomatic solution through the peace effort underway they requested that we stop military aid we showed respect for the peace process and people of central america when we defeated a request for military assistance 1 month ago and the house must continue in that path for peace by defeating any and all military aid requests so that the peace process can continue toward a permanent ceasefire and a return to regional stability the time has come to undo the destruction of life fostered over the past 7 years to the tune of 1 billion now is the time for the american people to regain control of our options in nicaragua now is the time to pressure the administration to hold bilateral and multilateral talks with nicaragua and now is the time to turn our resources in the region from supplying weapons of war to building instruments of peace the bitter choice is that in order to prevent the passage of military assistance to the contras we must provide some modified humanitarian aid to victims of the war in nicaragua and the contras we nrc have a congressional majority and majority of americans working fervently toward peace we have a strong coalition in the house committed to rejecting lethal and nonlethal military aid we must retain that coalition the democratic aid package is not perfect qnd it does not take the preferred step which would be an end to all forms of aid to the contras however this package does make some important strides toward encouraging compliance with the central american peace plan as well as a necessary step toward an orderly and humane withdrawal of united states military aid to the contras for the first time since 1979 a truly humanitarian aid package will be sent to the people of nicaragua president arias is on record stating that this package is not inconsistent with the spirit and letter to the peace accord this package sets an essential precedent by designating half of the 30 million for the children victims of war over 10 000 orphans and thousands of youthful casualties have been caused from land mines attacks on civilian villages and targeting of health clinics in nicaragua this 14 6 million childrens survival assistance will be distributed by the agency for international development to private voluntary organizations like the red cross and the united nations children fund already in operation within nicaragua and along the honduran and costa rican borders to noncombatant children under the age of 15 the aid will be distributed by giving highest priority to those children on both sides of the war with the greatest need for assistance by making available prosthetic devices and rehabilitation provide medicine and immunization for more than 100 000 children assist burn victims and provide relief to all nicaraguan children physically injured or displaced by the nicaraguan conflict no funds will go to or through the government of nicaragua this humanitarian aid package will also include 1 4 million in assistance to the miskito indians through the international red cross so long as there is a cessation of hostilities and progress toward a negotiated ceasefire continues the miskito indians and the government of nicaragua reached a ceasefire agreement earlier this year the democratic package also includes an immediate end to all lethal aid to the contras including weapons and ammunition the leadership of congress and the gao will monitor the shipment of food blankets and medical supplies to the contras which will be accomplished by dod private contractors to assure no lethal aid is quietly included deliveries will be inspected onsite by officials of the gao while oversight of the operation lies with the intelligence committees of congress if a ceasefire is in place before the end of june 1988 then unitedstates humanitarian assistance automatically continues through international agencies in accordance with a ceasefire agree ment ii no ceasefire is in place by the end of june unitedstates assistance comes to a halt the one clear fact is that this war despite the efforts of the administration is winding down the humanitarian aid package is not designed to encourage continued warfare but to assist those who have fought in the transition to peace the contras are not nor will they ever be the solution to the conflict in central america that policy has failed for 7 years and never again will the america people tolerate millions of taxpayer dollars to go unaccounted for and countless spending violations to occur in carrying out this administrations thoughtless policy toward central america the humanitarian aid package that i will support today prevents misuse of the public trust and money it also prevents the escalation of the war in nicaragua this alternative ensures a commitment by our government to economic development social justice and true humanitarian aid to the children of nicaragua the primary effort for peace in central america must continue to rest with people of that region not the united states a negotiated ceasefire can only be accomplished by factions currently involved in the conflict continuing to meet and work out their differences american negotiators did not bring about the peace accord the five central american presidents accomplished the agreement not imposed on them from the outside and it is up to those leaders to bring about a lasting ceasefire and cessation of the conflict although our vote today will not finally end the war it can help end the administrations united states military option in nicaragua it will strengthen the congressional coalition aimed at supporting peace and ending military aid it will strengthen president arias and the peace plan by keeping diplomatic solutions alive let todays vote reflect another chapter in the effort to explore every avenue for peace while moving toward diplomacy human rights and multilateral solutions in central america"], [0.009289205074310303, 0.9907107949256897, 1, "i ask unanimous consent that the managers may have until midnight wednesday june

of representatives it contained an amendment which banned the use of unitedstates passports for the purpose of helping nicaraguan military operations or military operations of communist guerrilla groups in central america as this bill comes back from conference it contains no such language i am told that it was a rather strange process that developed to assure that that language would not be included in this bill so i am going to relate the story as i heard it and if anybody has any reason to doubt anything i say i would appreciate being corrected on the situation i am told that that particular amendment was eliminated first of all on a straight party line vote in conference that the democrats all voted in favor of american passports being used to help nicaraguan military operations and communist military groups and that the republicans all voted against that proposition i think it is important to understand that on this issue the two parties were divided but the democrats also in their straight party line vote decided not to support the position of this house by which this house had gone on record in taking that position and the democrats specifically decided the position of this house should not be defended and should not prevail in the conference now i have also been informed that there was a reason why the democrats took that straight party line position beyond the fact that there seems to be a constant desire around this body to help the sandinistas down there we seem to be able to put all kinds of limitations on freedom fighters in central america or on el salvador or on some of our friends but when it comes to the communist guerrilla groups or the sandinistas we seem to be able then to slide by and help them but i am also told that the majority staff was actually told that if my language my amendment on this was included in the conference report being brought to this floor that that bill would never reach this floor that the democratic leadership on that side was bound and determined that we were not going to have any kind of language brought to this floor that included my amendment now i will tell you that i find that to be rather disturbing it seems to be that the house position was clear it deserved to be defended if certain leaders in this house do not like what the house decides by majority vote i do not think they have the right to pressure that committee in ways to keep legislation off this floor simply to get certain language out that is not the democratic process it once again goes back to the kind of tyranny that seems to prevail in this place with regard to issues i think of real importance i find it disturbing i do not think it is the right way to proceed i feel very strongly that it shows how far we will go in this congress to protect the communist military in nicaragua but it also says a lot about this house that despite the positions taken by the majority the majority will get thwarted

your party and that your votesthose were the days when you had to vote as speaker you only have to vote when you feel like it or to break a tieyou said that your votes were not reflective of your true feelings on national security and defense i said i am going to remember this conversation jim and i am going to remember this moment and right where we are standing because i expect you to start
