the wealthiest people in this country had they not tried this trick we would be in a different position here today this year the final year of the 20th century has been a disappointing one for the

casualties is long a patients bill of rights campaign finance reform medicare prescription drug benefits smaller class sizes and sensible gun safety reform is also being killed since the columbine tragedy occurred more than 6 months ago the republican leadership has consistently stifled every attempt to pass common sense gun safety measures and yet 13 children every day are killed by guns with

cuts 2 9 billion from education services cuts 1 7 billion from labor with cuts to workforce development and safety investments and cuts more than 1 billion from critical health programs and next week we will be forced to vote on this bill that undermines so many of our nations priorities why because the republican house leadership passed a bad budget resolution that puts tax cuts for the wealthiest americans above investments to promote americas education workforce and health services their 175 billion tax cut exceeds the projected budget surplus and requires deep cuts in nondefense discretionary appropriations and here we are again voting on a measure that would provide over 50 billion to the wealthiest 2 percent of taxpayers how much is enough when will republicans be satisfied with the amount of money they have given to the wealthy and turn their attention to the majority of americans who want a good education a strong work force and a healthy future this bill will cost 50 billion per year when fully phased in this monstrous hole in the federal budget will undoubtedly translate into cuts from areas that the american people care about just as the proposed 175 billion republican tax cut translated into cuts in yesterdays proposed labor hhs education appropriations bill when we prioritize tax cuts over health education and labor we make sacrifices and these sacrifices affect everybody the repeal of the estate tax does nothing for working families most american families would not receive a single dollar of tax relief from this bill so i want the american people to know what they are sacrificing in order to provide a tax cut to the wealthiest two percent of their fellow citizens republicans have proposed cutting 1 billion from targeted investments in education to improve teacher quality and recruit new teachers denying afterschool services to 1 6 million kids and eliminating headstart assistance to 50 000 kids they have also proposed cutting nih 439 million below current services and cutting 16 million from clintons request for battered womens shelters these are the kinds of sacrifices that americans are being asked to make in exchange for a tax cut that would give 300 billion to the 400 richest americans 300 billion is enough to pay for a prescription drug benefit for seniors for 10 years the republican majority placed the needs of big business over working people yesterday by voting to once again delay the implementation of new ergonomics regulations which protect working people from repetitive motion injuries and here they are again asking working families to make sacrifices so that the wealthy can reap benefits slowing our progress in health education and labor in order to make room for tax cuts for the wealthy does not

point and i am deeply disappointed by what has happened to americas education priorities in the last 72 hours on sunday night after 3 days of no negotiations republicans met facetoface with democrats on a good faith basis to resolve our differences on education democrats asked republicans whether they had full authority to negotiate a final deal and they answered yes in an example of bipartisan compromise both sides came together and both sides sought common ground negotiators toiled late into the evening each side made concessions as must be done in a bipartisan compromise and consensus was reached through sensible dialogue i give great credit to the gentleman from florida and i give great credit to the gentleman from wisconsin and the senators who were involved the bill that came out of that room was a bipartisan bill that would have lifted up every community and every school in this country this bill included full funding for 100 000 new teachers teacher training afterschool programs and a billion dollars for school repair and school modernization less than 12 hours after the agreement was reached the leaders of the republican party ripped this deal apart as a favor to a business lobby the republican leadership bowed to business lobbyists who according to the washington post were making and i quote urgent calls to the hill to try to block this compromise simply because they did not like worker safety provisions that protected workers from repetitive stress injuries this republicanled congress scuttled a bipartisan agreement that would have provided local districts with the means to hire new teachers and build new classrooms so that we could get smaller classroom sizes so that our children could be better educated i guess it is not a surprise because republican leaders have spent the last 6 years frustrating americas agenda a bipartisan agenda by giving in to special interests on every one of these issues the republican leadership has taken the side of the special interests over americas agenda we tried to get an affordable effective prescription medicine program we forced it on to the agenda with the help of republican members and it was scuttled in conference and it is not going anywhere because i guess the pharmaceutical companies did not want it we worked with republicans to force on to the agenda of this house an effective and enforceable patients bill of rights and it has been stifled in a conference committee because i guess the insurance companies did not want it we could have had targeted tax cuts for college and longterm care and child care but instead we passed huge tax cuts for the top 1 percent of americans instead of getting something done in a bipartisan way that we could have gotten done we fought for sensible gun safety legislation but it is stifled in a conference committee i guess as a favor to the national rifle association we have tried to get a sensible increase in the minimum wage but it too is stifled even though it has strong bipartisan support we forced on to the agenda of this house campaign finance reform which is desperately desired by the people of this country and it too passed by a bipartisan vote in this house and it has been stifled in a conference committee there is a pattern here there is a pattern bipartisan efforts which even passed by bipartisan votes on the floor are being held hostage by the special interests of this country and by the republican leadership that is running this congress the speaker said 2 years ago that the trains were going to run on time and that we would finish our budget in regular order well it is 4 weeks into the fiscal year we are 6 days away from a general election and we have not gotten the work done that we could have gotten done if the leadership of this congress would have simply let the bipartisan majority that was trying to break out and do these things to be able to do them and as a result we have a dysfunctional congress we have an ineffectual congress education is our most important priority we have schools with cracked walls and no airconditioning and leaky windows we have cornices falling off of buildings we have kids in temporary structures in movable classrooms in inadequate facilities in the wealthiest nation on earth our children deserve our help in getting them the worldclass education that every child in this country deserves let us pass this resolution let us stay here in these next days and let us get the job done for americas children we may not be able to do the health issues campaign reform gun

behalf of our conference and i know there are many who are eager to come to the floor today and have expressed their desire to come to speak about the prospect of passing real tax relief for the american people the debate over this topic is an interesting one and it is one that we have heard part of so far tonight but i want to tell the other side of that story and alert house members and those throughout the country who are perhaps monitoring tonights proceedings precisely what is at stake with the debate on the projected taxpayers surplus or overpayment of tax revenues and the prospect of tax relief for american families we just heard the previous speaker talk about his assurances that the government will manage the taxpayers money and they will propose to do it well i have no question or doubt about that i believe all members of congress are sincere and that those of us who are charged with the responsibility of keeping track of the taxpayers cash would like to do that in a responsible way and would like to manage that money well but that really neglects the underlying debate and that is who should be managing the money of the taxpayers now those dollars that have legitimate cause to come to washington to be spent should be managed well certainly and that is our job as members of congress but the fact of the matter is the american taxpayers are overpaying when it comes to their taxes they are sending more cash to washington d c than is necessary to legitimately run the government so the question becomes what do we do with the projected taxpayers surplus now the core principles of tomorrows debate and the debate that is ongoing in washington in fact the difference between liberals those we just heard and conservatives that we will hear now is on the following basis conservatives the republican party believes in personal freedom and that is as opposed to our opponents objectives those we just heard of government control and i emphasize the notion of government control again by citing the quote that we had just heard on the floor that government will manage the taxpayers money conservatives believe in personal freedom our opponents on the house floor who oppose tax relief believe that government should control the taxpayers cash republicans are for lower taxes versus higher taxes republicans are for limited government versus big government we are also for economic growth versus the bureaucratic control of our economy and we are for more jobs versus red tape the debate on tax relief and what to do with the tax overpayment could not be boiled down any more simply than that which we see here so let me carry on on those very points and let me start by referring to some of my own constituents i like many other members of congress meet with constituents as often as i possibly can in fact i hold a town meeting in my congressional district every monday morning before i hop on a plane to come here to washington i also send out public opinion surveys to my constituency and ask them to give me their opinions on a host of issues i ask questions like what is the single most important issue facing the country today what is the single most important issue facing your family what do you think are the biggest challenges for our schools and so on i just grabbed a handful as i was walking out of the office today we read these as they come in question number seven on my congressman bob schaffer public opinion survey is what should be done with any federal budget surpluses a respondent kirk and kathy brush from fort collins colorado write in true surpluses should result in tax cuts here is another one again question no 7 what should be done with any federal budget surpluses to strengthen social security and reduce taxes that from james sanden of fort collins colorado mr and mrs gerald simmons say of the surpluses any surpluses should be returned to the taxpayers ihave more here is a gentleman who sent a letter in with his response this is another individual from fort collins colorado mr ray mr ray says that taxes are the number one issue when it comes to the surplus relief for retired persons living on pension income while the contribution to most allocated pension accounts were made taxdeferred and the earnings deferred i believe the tax upon withdrawal should be less than the rate for ordinary income after all that money which mostly goes into the stock market enables corporations to have additional capital to expand thereby advancing our economy which generates additional revenue for the government he hits it right on the head here is another one the mcfarlands mr and mrs mcf arland they wrote in again the question what should be done with the federal budget surpluses my constituents the mcfarlands tell me it should be returned to the taxpayers who worked all of their lives to earn it dont you agree mr and mrs mcfarland if they were here on the floor which they are not but i would tell them as i do tell them when i see them back home that i do agree with them and frankly the majority of members of congress agree with them as well and certainly this is the sentiment expressed by the mcfarlands that will be carried on the house floor tomorrow and upon which we will move forward with returning some of their hardearned dollars back to them and all of their friends and neighbors as well the bill which we will be considering tomorrow h r 2488 provides approximately 864 billion in broadbased tax relief the proposal is highlighted by a 10 percent acrosstheboard reduction in individual income taxes the bill reduces the impact of the marriage tax penalty by increasing the standard deduction from married couples to twice that of a single person i could not bring newlyweds onto the house floor tonight but i brought a picture of some here is a standard newlywed couple on their wedding night what they are about to find out when they pay taxes for the first time filing jointly is that this federal government will penalize them assuming they are an average family to the extent of about 1 400 per year thatis as a result of a number of taxes that when combined and when considered together just increase put a portion of their income into higher tax brackets and they will be penalized for getting married imagine that in a country as great as ours with a rich tradition of the most essential and central social unit being the family and the institution of marriage why on earth would we penalize marriage why would we punish people for joining in lifelong unions in a way that results in the most civil society in the history of human civilization it is wrong everyone knows it is wrong but there is really only one party here in washington who cares about this family and who cares about the tax burden and wants to do something to prevent them from getting hit with this unfortunate penalty upon their wedding day and each year thereafter you see there are many of us who believe that american people know how to do better with their own income that they should not send it here to washington unless it is absolutely necessary to run the basic programs and services that we have to in fact what we have seen through a number of presidents is the power of tax relief on the american economy president kennedy and president reagan behind him both found that by reducing the overall tax rate in other words the rate applied to general income to determine federal taxes by reducing the tax rate the federal government actually increased revenues that is right that is hard for people to grasp in many cases but it is not all that hard if we just look at the economic history in recent years in our country lowering the effective tax rate on the american people leaves more cash in the economy more cash in the economy creates more jobs creates more wealth when more people are working and being productive and increasing incomes although they are paying a lower tax rate they are paying more dollars to the federal government in fact in the years of the reagan administration and the kennedy administration before them the result of tax rate reductions was increased revenues to the federal government and so once again what we see in the core principles is that by focusing on personal freedom of the american people leaving excess taxes in the pockets of those who earn those dollars we believe that we will see increased economic productivity in the country again that is contrasted with our opponents objective of government control people in washington like government control do not get me wrong if you are part of this washington culture you would certainly understand that fortunately most members of congress are not part of that culture they go home on weekends and talk to constituents as i do but for those who like it here in washington they like your money here too because my goodness they get to make the big decisions with it they get the lobbyist waiting outside their door who wants to take them out to lunch or dinner or on the trips and try to figure out how they can get their hands on that cash so if you like being a part of that sort of thing why keeping more of the american taxpayers cash in washington can be kind of exciting i am one who happens to have a wife and four children and before entering the united states congress was part of the free market economy and trying to run a small business i can tell you there is greater hopeand optimism and prosperity for the american people if we focus on americans rather than on government i want to talk also tonight again focusing on the conflict in vision that the two parties in washington have when it comes to taxes this is a quote from the president of the united states in buffalo new york just a couple of months ago talking about this budget surplus he was celebrating the surplus as many people in washington like to do here is what he said we could give it back the budget surplus we could give it all back to you and hope you spend it right but once again we could give it back to you and hope you spend it right but and the but was that we perhaps cannot hope that american taxpayers will spend it right excuse me but spend what right it here is the taxpayers money it does not belong to people in washington it is the hardearned wealth of the american people it is not something that rightfully belongs under the domain of politicians here in washington d c it does belong to the american people and it should be returned as soon as we possibly can the tax relief measure also includes a number of provisions for education tax relief specifically the bill expands the acceptable use of taxfree expenditures from education savings accounts to include elementary and secondary school expenses it increases to 2 000 annually from 500 under current law the maximum amount of contributions to education savings accounts it allows taxfree withdrawals from qualified tuition plans that are maintained by private educational institutions and it includes a public construction initiative when the family here who gets married and gets saddled with their 1 400 marriage tax penalty progresses in the maturity of their marriage and contemplate children and perhaps have them and send them to school they are also taxed to an additional degree education of course is a good thing i think everyone in congress would agree with that but there is no reason our tax burden should make it more difficult for families like this to secure a good quality education for their child or children and that is what this provision of the tax package is all about the other side will try to suggest that these are rich people here that they are wealthy and therefore somehow do not deserve the tax cut but these are average american families the same kind of average american families who benefit from our tax relief package we are providing tax relief to make greater education opportunity possible for millions and millions of american children we are doing that again by taking less out of the pockets of the families who work hard to earn it not doing as our opponents suggest of keeping those dollars hoarding them here in washington d c and controlling their use based upon the priorities of bureaucrats we stand for something very much different on the republican side of the aisle the tax measure also includes provisions that are designed to reform pensions and enhance retirement security specifically the bill increases portability of pensions so employers may roll over plans from one job to the next we provide additional salary catchup contributions for workers over the age of 50 these are individuals who may deposit additional amounts into certain retirement accounts the bill also lowers the vesting requirement of pension plans so employees are vested after 3 years instead of 5 it increases the contribution and benefit limits in defined contribution and benefit plans and it also simplifies pension systems to help businesses offer and improve their pension plans that is an important provision as i mentioned i mentioned the mcfarlands from fort collins colorado they are retirees again they say that the federal government should return any surplus to the taxpayers who worked all of their lives to earn it they want to know if i agree of course i do let me go back to the comments from mr ray in colorado he is asking for relief for retired persons living on pension income and that is what we are doing we are listening to people like mr ray real people average americans not wealthy not extraordinarily endowed with huge amounts of cash in their personal bank accounts but average americans earning average incomes or on average pensions those are the beneficiaries of the republican tax plan that we will vote on and presumably pass tomorrow the bill also reduces the individual capital gains tax rate from its current rate of 20 percent to 15 percent and from 10 percent to 7 5 percent those are for taxpayers in the 15 percent individual income tax bracket this is an important provision this is one that the president says he opposes lowering the taxes on those who invest those who create wealth helps the country create more wealth it almost does not matter what part of the country one lives in they are treated almost weekly to news headlines like these from colorado here is one from the denver post average income up 6 1 percent in colorado here is another one from the denver post a headline welfare rolls drop 42 percent here are some quotes from that article an article written by angela cortez she interviewed a woman named teri higgins who was a former welfare recipient and says that welfare reform has meant a new way of life after being on welfare for 3 years she is completely selfsufficient she was a fulltime student halfway through her associates degree in business administration when welfare reform kicked in nearly 2 years ago under the new system she had to work so she decided on a work study program at a community college in denver within a year the 37yearold single mother of three boys went from being a welfare recipient to the office manager in a business setting i will not cite the specific location but in a business setting in colorado she says listen to this quote this is remarkable a real statement of what a strong economy means for real people what made a difference were the extra things like gas vouchers day care so i could go to school and a lot of emotional support from counselors she once lived in a shelter with her children before entering the arapahoe county social services system she says she still struggles i make a decent wage but its still hard to make ends meet but when i sit down and write checks out for all my bills and everything is paid that is really a good feeling the specific components of welfare reform were certainly important but what makes these dramatic numbers possible this sea change and shift from welfare dependency to economic independence is not just the reform efforts but it is a strong economy the kind of strong economy that results from employers providing jobs that results from entrepreneurs making the kinds of investments that make our economy strong the kind of investments which we enjoy to a far greater degree when we unleash the economic ingenuity of the american people and reduce the tax burden that the american people are saddled with there is lots more workers coming off welfare to get job help economic success filters its way down to charities here is a story about how the strong economy in america is helping charities receive more funds because businesses are contributing more to communitybased charities that help people and are accountable to those folks back home in our districts jobless rate in colorado hits record low i point out all of these headlines because these headlines are the way we help see our democrats friends on the other side of the aisle believe in the principle that i showed you earlier not in personal freedom their goal and their vision is government control you see government can be very charitable government can help a lot of people when it takes your cash and spends it on the governmentrun charity of the politicians choice but personal freedom tax freedom greater amounts of liberty lower tax rates allows for american entrepreneurs allows for the free market to rise up and treat us still more to these wonderful headlines about former government dependents becoming selfsufficient and living the american dream and being treated as real americans there is more in this tax package it gradually eliminates the estate and gift tax over a 10year period also another topic important to me and my constituents back home in colorado my district consists of the eastern plains of the state 21 counties in colorado generally everything that is flat many people think of the mountains and the mountains that start right down the front range of the center of the state but everything east of that out to nebraska and kansas is part of the high prairie high plains and it is one of the richest agriculture areas on the planet many of the farms and ranches that have been established were established by homesteaders people who headed west in search of new opportunity and really led to the sense of rugged individualism and independence that represents the west and families like to pass their farms on down to their children family farmers look forward to that to leaving that legacy for their kids and the agricultural lifestyle of the west is something that all westerners are very proud of but when the old farmer starts to get old and have a difficult time working the land teaches his children how to manage the ag business and work the farm he eventually starts thinking about how he is going to hand that asset over to his children and keep that farm in the family the estate and gift tax makes that virtually impossible for many farmers and i know you in your district see a lot of farmers just as i do those who are confronted with the farm sale to sell parts of the farm off the equipment the inventory in order to pay the taxes in order to when a family member when the head of the household dies and tries to pass that farm on to his or her children this bill gradually eliminates the estate and gift tax over a 10year period let me state that again it eliminates the estate and gift tax not just tinker with it not just fiddle around the edges but envisions a day when we will no longer be taxed upon death the measure also includes provisions to make health care and longterm care more affordable and accessible for example the bill provides 100 percent deduction for health insurance premiums and longterm care insurance premiums now again i ask my colleagues to think about that for a moment you see back in world war ii when all of the young men were overseas fighting the war and winning we had a real work problem a labor shortage here in the united states the government imposed a wage freeze and employers had a hard time keeping people in the factories and it was at that point in time that the federal government the congress created section 106 of the irs tax code section 106 is that provision that says well you cannot at the time cannot increase wages but we can make it easy for you to provide this benefit of health insurance for your employees we will give you 100 percent deductibility if your business is large enough small business owners did not get that benefit neither did their employees but we believe fully that any contribution any investment that an employer whether you are a large employer or a small one makes into a health insurance program for their employees should not also be taxed on that investment they should receive 100 percent deduction for health insurance premiums now this will go a long way to helping health insurance become more affordable more available for more people in the workforce than those who have a difficult time affording health insurance today and once again i want to contrast this value with those or with that which is represented by our democrat friends over on the other side of the aisle my colleagues may recall that the first lady had proposed to socialize the health care industry in the united stafes to have government basically run health care and run one gigantic insuranceproviding mechanism for the american people well that idea was rejected as being somewhat ludicrous thank goodness for that because the sentiments of the american people are in quite the opposite direction the american people realize that if you tax employers less if you tax health care coverage less if you remove the tax burdens on those who wish to provide health insurance for themselves and their families guess what you will have more health insurance coverage for yourself for your families for employees the bill also provides an additional exemption which is currently at 2 750 for individuals who care for the elderly and who care for elderly family members in their homes it expands the availability of medical savings accounts and makes these medical savings accounts permanent and it allows employers to offer longterm care insurance to cafeteria plans now some of our democrat friends on the other side of the aisle and you did not have to listen very long just a few minutes ago to hear them say that the tax cuts in the republican bill favor the rich well this is what they are talking about those tax cuts which are designed to make it easier for employers to provide health insurance for their employees to make it easier for those individuals who stay home to take care of elderly family members those are the rich people that they speak of with such venom and such disdain but it is these employers who are providing the jobs these employers who would like to offer higher incomes that would like to offer greater benefits that would like to offer health insurance coverage for more employees and a better insurance product perhaps sometimes the barrier is simply the expense the expense of the federal government the cost of being an american citizen we want to lower that we want to lower that to help real people average families real citizens who are working very hard today and every day and sending too muchmoney to the federal government under the present set of circumstances the bill also authorizes the housing and urban development secretary to designate 20 renewal communities in both urban and rural areas allowing them to qualify for special tax incentives now these renewal communities are communities that are designed to help those who seek lowincome housing these provisions are designed to create jobs stimulate investment and assist families in impoverished neighborhoods now once again if you look at who gets the special tax incentive it is really not the individual who moves into the lowincome housing unit it is the developer and the construction people who build that renewal community who actually do the construction so from the democrats perspective this looks like a rich person getting a tax break but in reality we are talking about 20 new communities around the country in urban and rural settings where lowincome families will have the new hope the new promise of housing and home ownership an opportunity that today they do not have under our present high tax system the provision also phases out the bill also phases out the alternative minimum tax for both individuals and corporations it extends the number of expiring tax credits including the research and development tax credit for 5 years through june 2004 the work opportunity and the welfare to work tax credit through december 2001 again the welfare to work tax credit here is another tax that our democrat friends will say goes to rich people in america what is the welfare to work tax credit well this is a tax credit that tries to achieve the goals that are implied in the name those individuals who help welfare recipients move out of welfare and into selfsufficiency the ultimate beneficiary of that transaction is not the employer exclusively the rich guy as the democrats would describe that entrepreneur the real beneficiaries are the people who have no jobs today those who are having a difficult time making transition from welfare to work those who have still not seen the benefits of the republican welfare reform initiative that was passed in 1994 and implemented at the state level across the country those are the individuals who still need our help still deserve our compassion and still need our attention providing this tax credit will put many many more back to work and once again treat them like real americans the bill also provides an abovetheline deduction for individuals currently individuals may under the provision individuals may take the deduction whether or not they itemize a deduction for prescription drug insurance coverage for medicare beneficiaries contingent upon certain medicare changes this suggests a bigger plan that we are moving toward once again the president announced that he wanted to dip into the social security savings the social security trust fund to pay for an additional entitlement additional benefit with respect to prescription drugs our idea is very different and that is to allow individuals to take a deduction whether or not they itemize for prescription drug coverage for those who are in the medicare program this means keeping those dollars in your pocket not sending them here to washington keeping those dollars in your pocket just think about that for a moment under the current law a taxpayer senior citizen sends their tax payments to the federal government they come here to washington we politicians sit around here and establish the priorities for the nation and if we decide it is prescription drugs then we will take the nations wealth and spend it on that particular priority on that given day and at the next election we will decide it is another priority and maybe we will change the priorities at that point in time to serve our election causes and we redistribute the wealth of the american people well that is just nuts as my colleagues know what we really ought to do is just not bring it here to washington in the first place let us just be efficient about it why do we not why do we not just leave that cash in the hands of those who have worked all of their lives people just like the mcfarlands who worked all of their lives to earn it leave it in their pockets let them spend it as they see fit let them spend it on a growing economy that helps us pay down the national debt quicker saves social security more completely and pay for those truly legitimate causes the federal government has constitutional jurisdiction over the provision also includes a number of revenue offset provisions accounting for approximately 5 billion over 10 years and that means that we will attempt to spend less in many areas eliminate a lot of waste in our government and a lot of other provisions that frankly the american people do not want and do not need and will never miss in order to help make this tax relief possible let me provide a little background for a moment do you remember when the republican party took the majority of the congress we did so on the basis of the contract with america 10 bold promises that we issued to the american people if elected we will deliver and bring to the house floor for a vote 10 various provisions one of those was the 1995 tax fairness and debt reduction act and that provided americans with comprehensive tax relief that bill included a 500 per child tax credit outlined measures to alleviate the marriage tax penalty it created taxfree american dream savings accounts it repealed the 1993 tax increase on social security benefits and provided a 50 percent exclusion for capital gains and we indexed that for inflation now these are tax provisions which many of which we already have but the president vetoed that measure and we had to try it again in 1997 we provided further additional tax relief we provided tax relief through the education saving accounts 1998 we passed a taxpayer relief act again reducing the tax burden on american families and giving americans new rights in defending themselves against the intrusive practices of the internal revenue service our 2000 budget proposal provided real leadership by setting aside dollars in our longterm budgets longterm budget to allow for tax relief to take place and did so while protecting social security protecting medicare increasing spending on our national defense and outlining a plan that allows us to create the best education system in the world now we have heard the president talk about the budget surplus we expect over the next 10 years to have approximately 3 trillion in surpluses here in washington those are dollars that the federal government receives over and above the expenditures of the federal government at that point in time it is a little bit complicated and confusing because some of those dollars are devoted directly to the social security trust fund or attributable to social security taxes those are dollars we do not want to touch we want to leave those dollars for social security in fact over that 10year period what the republican plan entails is providing a dollar of tax relief for every 2 of social security savings the president does not agree with us that we ought to lock that social security fund away put it aside and leave it exclusively for social security the president would prefer to spend a portion of those dollars reduce the size of the allowable tax relief package and increase the spending of the federal government and ultimately the size of the bureaucracy in washington d c let me talk about some of the provisions that i just enumerated and in perhaps a little bit more detail the bill provides for 534 2 billion in family tax relief over the next 10 years as i say i mentioned this earlier let me mention that number again 534 2 billion over the next 10 years for family tax relief now if one makes over 40 000 the democrats believe one is rich and believes that one should not earn one should not be able to save that additional income one should continue to send it here to washington d c so that it can be squandered and wasted and controlled by people here in washington well average families are the ones who benefit from the republican tax package that we will vote on tomorrow let me restate that it reduces the individual income tax rate by 10 percent over a 10year period think about what a 10 percent reduction in ones income tax obligation to the federal government will mean for many states for example the state of colorado is a perfect one the state income tax is indexed to the federal income tak rate so a reduction in federal income taxes corresponds to an equivalent reduction in ones state income taxes as well by the year 2009 our bill reduces the 15 percent 28 percent 31 percent 36 percent and 39 6 percent tax rates to 13 5 percent 25 2 percent 27 9 percent 32 4 percent 35 7 percent respectively those are the individual tax brackets of every american who earns income unless one is a very low income falls within one of those tax brackets let us use the 31 percent tax bracket as an example most americans are in that ballpark if one is paying 31 percent of ones income in taxes today next year we propose for 2001 from 2001 to 2004 we propose that that rate drop to 30 3 percent then from 2005 to 2007 to 29 5 percent in fiscal year 2008 we want that rate to drop to 28 7 percent and after 2009 we want that rate to drop to 27 9 percent it is a pretty substantial reduction about a 3 percent reduction in income taxes for individuals in that category i mentioned the student loan interest rates because i know there are many students today who are trying to finance their college education their college degrees through debt financing this congress passed legislation last year that affected the student loan interest rates somewhat there was a scheduled decrease in those interest rates we slowed that decrease a little bit it was not the best part of the bill certainly but nonetheless there is some attention being paid here in washington to the cost of financing college education we are going to adjust that student loan interest deduction for married couples who file joint returns to twice that of a single taxpayer so that the married couple that i showed you their photo of a little earlier those individuals will see some relief when they try to secure a greater education opportunity for themselves let me talk about the alternative minimum tax for a moment as well the bill reduces and phases in a repeal of the alternative minimum tax for individuals the bill accomplishes this by gradually reducing amt liability specifically beginning in the year 2003 only 80 percent of the full amt liability will be imposed the bill reduces this percentage to 70 percent in 2004 60 percent in 2005 50 percent in 2006 and 2007 and the tax is fully repealed after 2007 the repeal of the individual amt eliminates the present law marriage penalty in the individual amt the bill also makes permanent the provisions allowing nonrefundable personal tax credits to be used fully without regard to the amt this was originally designed to ensure that high income taxpayers pay some minimum tax and not escape their fair share of the income tax burden there will be a significant increase in the number of middleincome taxpayers subjected to the alternative minimum tax currently about 600 000 taxpayers are subject to the amt but estimates indicate that more than 20 million taxpayers will be subject to that tax by 2007 as i mentioned when it comes to savings and investment the republican tax package provides 77 1 billion in tax relief to encourage savings and investment over the next 10 years i mentioned capital gains taxes i think capital gains tax relief is a rather important topic to discuss this is the tax that is applied to increases in earnings the growth portion of investments that many people make sometimes it isa financial transaction sometimes it is the sale of property maybe ones home right now there is a 20 percent tax rate applied to that for most people some people in lower income tax brackets pay a lower tax but for most people that is a 20 percent application to any interest any financial growth that accrues as a result of the sale of an asset or so on as i mentioned that capital gains tax causes an awful lot of the nations wealth to go nonproductive to be held in nonproductive holdings nonproductive assets and those that could be generating more wealth for the american people i have actually met people who take their cash and put it in the proverbial under the mattress there are people who really do that sort of thing they are afraid of being hit by the capital gains tax rates of 20 percent and so they will do ridiculous things with that cash sometimes to avoid paying taxes they despise the irs that much alan greenspan the chairman of the federal reserve board estimated to the senate finance committee that there is approximately 11 trillion in capital private sector capital that is available in the economy and it is underutilized and that what congress should do is focus on a sound tax policy that encourages the american peopler to unleash a portion or all if possible of that 11 trillion into the free market economy imagine what that could do for the country well our imaginatioft does not have to be that long in duration because tomorrow this provision is slated for a vote on this floor that capital gains tax rate reduction is the tax that makes job creation possible it is that provision that portion of our tax code which encourages the kinds of investments that creates wealth creates opportunity allows individuals to become financially independent selfsufficient and to avoid the government dependency that many americans fear and seem to be trapped in today there is also a partial exclusion for interest and dividends the bill allows individuals to exclude up to 200 400 for married couples filing jointly of income earned in any given taxable year this provision is phased in and will take full effect in december of 2002 the current definition of gross income includes all income from whatever source derived that expands the net greatly from the current law thus it makes no exceptions for smaller amounts of savings and investment income earned by taxpayers that when subject to the tax rate of most small investors discourages savings and investment for low and middle income taxpayers once again this is a provision that our democrat friends will try to suggest applies only to the wealthy but as we can see we are talking very plainly about average middleincome taxpayers the kind of people that go to work every day go to work work hard come home raise their children maintain their families go to church get involved in the softball game on the h6002 co weekends and go back to work and do it all again those are the folks we are reaching out to i mentioned school construction before that is another provision of the tax bill we want to encourage school construction let me elaborate a little bit on that component of the tax package h r 2488 increases to 4 years the period during which a state or local government may avoid paying arbitrage rebates to the federal government on public school construction bonds under the current law state and local governments may issue taxexempt bonds to finance school construction activities as well as a variety of other public facilities and services the prcceeds from those bonds may be invested but state and municipal governments must pay profits to the federal government this revenue must be repaid to the federal government in 5year intervals however certain bonds qualify for exemption from repayments in the case of school construction bonds the current law requires that money from the sale of the bonds must be spent within 24 months of their sale 1n the following increments 10 percent of the bond revenue must be spent within the first 6 months of being issued 45 percent must be spent within the first 12 months 75 percent within the first 18 months and 100 percent within the first 2 years our bill expands this interval period to a total of 4 years and finally the bill increases the amount of governmental bonds for public schools that localities may issue without being subject to the arbitrage rebate requirement from 5 million to 10 million the bill is designed to give school districts greater flexibility when issuing bonds in building public schools let me focus on that for a moment because once again we hear the president and many of our friends on the democrat side of the aisle talking about investing in our local schools and in our local communities and once again their vision involves having the american taxpayers work hard pay more taxes than they need to and send those dollars here to washington d c so that members of congress andlobbyists and bureaucrats from over at the white house can all get together and decide how those funds will be redistributed across america to help the people that they want to help so the dollars come to washington a certain portion of those are lost and wasted in the transaction a smaller portion of those dollars go back to our states those states that are privileged to receive those dollars back to construct schools and to be spent on worthwhile endeavors our solution is much different our solution is to leave that money back home in the first place to reduce the tax burden on the investments that are made to help finance the construction of schools not only does it make more"], [0.0004215066437609494,

basic fundamental question that is is it right is it fair that under our tax code a married working couple where both a husband and wife are in the workforce that they pay higher taxes just because they are married is it right that 25 million married working couples 50 million taxpayers pay on average 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married we call that 1 400 the marriage tax penalty it affects married couples who because they have two incomes they are forced to file jointly they are pushed into a higher tax bracket and they pay higher taxes it is a marriage tax penalty and it is wrong let me introduce to the house some constituents of mine michelle and shad hallihan two public school teachers from a community of manhattan just south of joliet illinois shad is a teacher at joliet high school michelle at manhattan junior high their combined income is about 62 000 they are middleclass teachers they are homeowners of course since they were married they have since had a child little ben remember their family someone new in their lives and they are so proud of little ben here who is growing very quickly their marriage tax penalty is about 1 000 a year that they pay just because they are married i think it is a fair question is it right is it fair that shad and michelle hallihan two public school teachers who work very hard every day have a new little boy in their lives have to pay higher taxes send money to washington just because they are married i am proud to say this conference report before it eliminates the marriage tax penalty that good people hardworking middleclass people like shad and michelle hallihan pay every year because they are married under our conference report we help those who itemize their taxes as well as those who do not now my friends on the other side of the aisle say that if one is middle class and one itemizes ones taxes usually because one is a homeowner or one gives money to ones institutions of faith or church or synagogue or charity one is rich and one does not deserve marriage tax relief well republicans and fortunately 48 democrats believe we should help the middleclass homeowners who give money to charity they are not rich they work hard shad and michelle hallihan make 62 000 a year they itemize their taxes now we help those who do not itemize their taxes in this conference by doubling the standard deduction that is used by those who do not itemize their taxes we double that for joint filers to twice that as singles for those who are itemizers like michelle and shad hallihan and little ben who are homeowners so they are forced to itemize we widen the 15 percent bracket that is the basic tax bracket that affects everybody we widen that so joint filers married couples like shad and michelle with two incomes can earn twice as much as a single filer and be in the same tax bracket the same 15 percent tax bracket what i think is most exciting about this bill not only do we help middleclass families who are homeowners and give money to church and charity who itemize those taxes as well as those who do not is that it is effective this year when we pass this legislation and put it on the presidents desk today the president will have an opportunity if he signs it into law to help married couples 25 million married working couples this year because i would point out that doubling the standard deduction which helps those who do not itemize and widening the 15 percent tax bracket which helps those who do itemize such as homeowners and those that give money to church and charity that they will receive marriage tax relief this year because this legislation is effective january 1 of 2000 think about that when my friends on the other side of the aisle and bill clinton and al gore raised taxes in 1993 they made their tax increase retroactive which meant they went back in the tax year and took ones money well this year we have an opportunity to give marriage tax relief this year which means we go back to january 1 of this year if one is married one of 25 million married working couples who suffer the marriage tax penalty one is going to see marriage tax relief this year in tax year 2000 that is a great opportunity if one believes in fairness in the tax code as we do it is time to make the tax code more fair and more simple we want to eliminate the marriage tax penalty now my friends on the other side of the aisle have been making lots of excuses they really do not want to eliminate the marriage tax penalty because they would much rather spend shad and michelles money they believe it is better spent here in washington than shad and michelle hallihan can spend it back in joliet illinois think about it the average marriage tax penalty for good hardworking middleclass married couples like shad and michelle hallihan 1 400 1 400 is 1 years tuition at joliet community college our local community college it is 3 months of day care for little ben at a local child care center in joliet illinois it is a washer and dryer for their home it is 3 000 diapers for little ben the marriage tax penalty of 1 400 is really money for real people let us do the right thing let us pass this rule let us pass this legislation let us wipe out the marriage tax penalty for 25 million married working couples"], [0.00042563676834106445,

rightwing friends h r 4577 fails to make needed investments in public education and the domestic workforce and as the result would undermine american competitiveness in the 21st century this bill has already received what has now become its customary and welldeserved veto threat from the clinton administration it is clearly going nowhere and should be soundly defeated this bill was doomed from its inception because the economic premise upon which it is based is flawed earlier this year before the appropriations process began the republican leadership decided to resume its efforts to push for big tax cuts for the rich they attached hundreds of billions of dollars of these tax cuts to the minimum wage bill and the budget resolution this decision to squander the surplus rather than invest it severely reduced the funds available to meet many of our nations critical needs overall the bill provides 2 9 billion less than the president requested for the department of education and 1 7 billion less for the department of labor as the result education job training workplace safety and other programs are either frozen or cut significantly reducing the level of services that can be provided for example the bill would slash title i funding forcing school districts to cut back on assistance to disadvantaged students the clinton clay class size reduction initiative is gutted leaving school districts without the resources to hire and train 20 000 more topquality teachers adequate funding is denied for afterschool and summer programs intended to improve student achievement and reduce juvenile crime and no funds are provided to renovate crumbling and unsafe schools at the same time efforts are ongoing in the congress to erase limits on theimmigration of foreign workers to fill hightech jobs this bill would make steep cuts in the funding of training programs aimed at helping domestic workers fill them and other positions dislocated workers and atrisk youth are particularly hard hit by these cuts even though they are the one most in need of skills training by failing to adequately invest in our own workforce the republican leadership is jeopardizing american competitiveness and prosperity this bill also jeopardizes worker health and safety by shortchanging osha and blocking issuance of the ergonomics rule intended to prevent about 300 000 workplace injuries a year the wilson amendment would add insult to injury by cutting 25 million more from osha this appropriations bill is a disaster it fails to adequately invest in education and in the

it requiring the attention of the public the first causes the ghosts of ponzi sam insull and phineas barnum to hover over this chamber in smiling admiration is this a tax cut or is it not the answer is no one knows for sure the bill is tied to receipts and deficits so in some years there may be a tax cut in some years there may not indeed if the national debt does not go down there will be no tax cut now it is hard to speculate how this works or whether there will be a tax cut when how or how much because all the negotiations were done by the republicans alone in closed meetings and the printed version has not been available to analyze or discuss in proper legislative fashion according to the sketchy reports i have been able to receive it will possibly work something like this after an initial 1 percent across the board tax cut all further cuts will be conditioned on whether the total national debt including that related to social security and most trust funds goes down now i cannot tell anyone exactly what that means but i believe i can be excused because the republicans have not said and apparently they cannot either so here we have a remarkable republican tax cut a here you see it now you dont tax cutmaybe you get it maybe you dont now if this massive punitive tax cut really goes into effect lets look at some of its most deficient aspects the republican tax bill would blow a three trillion dollar hole in the budget and threaten the vitality of medicare and social security the republican tax scheme does nothing to extend the life of the social security and medicare trust funds it eats the entire surplus leaving absolutely nothing to ensure the longterm solvency of medicare or social security it soaks up all of the money it leaves nothing to protect or reform medicare or social security it also ensures that there will be no money left over to fund a medicare prescription drug benefit the republican plan also spends all of the nonsocial security surpluses and leaves nothing for debt reduction rather than paying down a large portion of the national debt the republicans would be adding to it when one includes the 141 billion of additional interest payments that are required to finance the tax cut onbudget deficits are likely to appear the bill will force education veterans programs federal health research environmental programs farm programs our national defense and other vital programs to be slashed the republican tax bill will require an average 27 percent cut in all domestic spending programs by 2009 to cite just one example if the majority sticks to their budget caps 1 4 billion would be cut from veterans health programswhich are already universally recognized as woefully under funded in point of fact our veterans programs are an outright disgrace and the republican bill exacerbates the problem the republican scheme will also explode the deficit and threaten our growth over the longterm last year for the first time in thirty years the federal budget was in surplus the republican bill will reverse that course because it will cost as much as 3 trillion in the outyears although it is cleverly and carefully masked the republican bill explodes the deficit in the out years and will produce higher deficits higher interest rates and cripple economic expansion rather than paying down the debt as proposed by the president the republican tax scheme adds to the debt finally the plan put forth by the republican leadership would only benefit the wealthiest americans according to citizens for tax justice the wealthiest one percent of taxpayers would receive 45 percent of the benefits sixtyfive percent of the total tax cut will benefit the top ten percent of taxpayers those with incomes over 115 000 in aggregate 90 percent of taxpayers will receive less than a third of the benefits included in this package that is simply unfair and americans know it congress must use the surplus for medicare and social security first then we can consider responsible tax proposals that sustain our growth and do not threaten our economic prosperity the democratic alternative is the responsible approach and i urge its adoption in short my republican colleagues have crafted either one of the slyest now you see it now you dont scams in the history of government or they have crafted one of the most irresponsible tax cuts ever designed to cripple government and to endanger essential programs like medicare and social security moreover they did it in a sneaky partisan way totally disregarding traditional open legislative practices no wonder the tax program here is so bad it must be defeated and i urge a no vote"], [0.0004551410675048828, 0.9995448589324951, 1, "i rise in strong opposition to the republican budget resolution in order to make room for 150 billion of irresponsible tax cuts the republicans cut budget authority for nondefense discretionary programs by a total of 138 billion over 5 years below the baseline needed to maintain program levels as a result this would among other things cut 310 000 lowincome women infants and children off wic assistance in 2001 alone and more in years thereafter cut 1 000 fbi agents and 800 drug enforcement agents by 2005 cut liheap to only 164 000 low income families in 2001 just as oil prices are skyrocketing provide pell grants to 316 000 fewer lowincome students by 2005 eliminate head start for more than 40 000 children and their families by 2005 and raid the social security surplus to pay for its tax cuts it is time for the republicans to stop trying to cut taxes on the backs of americas seniors working families and children it is also time for the republicans to stop claiming that we cant afford to spend more on important programs like education and health when they are pouring more and more money into defense we have 11 million children who are not covered by health insurance we have a head start program so chronically underfunded that only 2 out of every 5 eligible children can get in and we have 26 000 schoolsserving 14 million kids that need major repair or replacement this past fall 53 2 million unitedstates students returned to school for the fourth year in a row we set a record for enrollment rates447 000 more children than last year and public high school enrollment is expected to increase by 11 percent between 1998 and 2008on top of a 16 percent jump since 1988 schools are straining to accommodate the influx of students setting up classrooms in trailers hallways and closets the unitedstates department of education estimates that 6 000 new schools must be built by 2006 at a cost of billions of dollars to handle this overflow yet the republicans have chosen to cut nondefense discretionary spending like education furthermore 46 percent of todays schools lack adequate electrical wiring to support the fullscale use of technology and our schools are still suffering from a digital divide schools with 90 percent or more of minority students have less access to computers17 students per computer compared with only 10 students per computer in schools with less than 25 percent minority students yet instead of focusing on these important issues the republicans are increasing defense spending by 17 4 billion the biggest percentage increase in the dod budget 11 percent is not for what is really needed like pay raises or operations and maintenance countless numbers of our soldiers are on food stamps but the republican budget focuses more on building new weapons than helping to retain our soldiers and to improve their quality of life our longterm national security depends not just on how many bombs and missiles we build but how well we can retain our soldiers and how we can prepare our children for the highlycompetitive global economy they will face the democratic alternative focuses on these important issues it focuses on the needs of americans by extending the solvency of both social security and medicare and protecting 100 percent of the social security surplus providing a voluntary prescription drug benefit for all schools through medicare and issuing reconciliation instructions to the ways and means committee to make it real providing more debt reduction than the republican budget by not spending all of the onbudget surplus the democratic alternative maintains onbudget surpluses for the next ten years unlike the republican budget thus the entire debt would be eliminated by 2013 under the democratic alternative maintaining funding for nondefense discretionary programs at the level needed to adjust for inflation providing targeted tax cuts to average families of 78 billion over five years and 263 billion over ten years and offsetting this cost by closing corporate loopholes and shutting down corporate tax shelters and by including initiatives to extend access to health care and health insurance and reforming the health care system for military retirees what we do in this budget will affect more than what we do next yearit will affect what we do years down the road we must prepare for our future we must provide

us independent and insulated us in these kinds of situations but in fact we chose to go another route and that was massive increases in consumption the failure to go for the efficiencies the failure to recognize what was readily available on the market and use that here domestically or to sell it overseas and yet even now we continue to see the other side of the aisle and governor bush suggesting if we just had one more drilling of oil the fact is we have increased the production of oil in america over the last 10 years rather dramatically the hottest oil play in the world is the gulf of mexico oil companies have spent tens of billions of dollars to be able to go in and to drill there and it has obviously been worth their while it is a fantastic find because of new technologies in

here and get our country in shape as the gentleman has suggested and as the vice president has suggested over the last decade we have done just the opposite we have made ourselves more dependent and like any other addiction it is very difficult to break but we ought to stop it at this point and recognize the peril it places us in internationally the peril it places our economy in and the unneeded expenditures by americans for energy that is not necessarily simply because of the waste that is involved that was clearly one of the choices that was presented in the debate last night about whether

old executive office building to be known as the dwight d eisenhower executive office building the house version of this legislation was introduced earlier this year by me and the gentleman from texas in the senate s 1652 was introduced by senator chafee and because of his untimely death became one of his last legislative accomplishments i thank the senator for his leadership on this matter and express my condolences to his family and to the citizens of rhode island kansans wish to claim dwight d eisenhower as our own but senator chafee has reminded us that no state has ownership of this

to work to make this country and this world a better place born in denison texas and raised in abilene kansas ike came from humble beginnings and grew to be one of the most influential figures in our nations history ike is an american hero andfew would disagree that his accomplishments warrant the numerous monuments that pay tribute to him across our great land this is an appropriate time to bring the life of dwight d eisenhower to the attention of members of congress and the amer ican people last week we celebrated the anniversary of the presidents birth this week cspay is highlighting the

here in our nations capital to honor and remember president eisenhower it is a fitting tribute to name a great building the old executive office building for this great american the old executive office building is symbolic of ikes career constructed in 1871 19 years before ikes birth the executive building was first the home of the state war and navy departments ike had a personal connection to the old executive office building he was first assigned there in 1927 as aide to general john j pershing following his victories in europe ike returned to the building as the army chief of staff general eisenhower served in the state war and navy building a total of 7 years and 2 months on january 19 1955 ike made history by holding the first televised presidential press conference on the buildings fourth floor knowing of this connection it is not surprising that as president eisenhower was fundamental to the buildings survival in 1957 according to the white house historian and scholar william seale the advisory committee on presidential office space recommended that the building be demolished and replaced with an expensive modern structure mr seale reports that the architect in charge of the project tried to persuade president eisenhower who recently had suffered a heart attack that a new building would not have as many stairs to climb nonsense said ike my doctors require i

building or outside this hill really cares about it but therefore it ought to be possible to have an honest discussion about what this is really all about this in my view is a repeal of the committee on the budget it really is saying we are done with it but we are not going to do it directly because we do it by three mechanisms one is we say that the budget document has to be signed by the president now let us just suppose in the worst case we have george bush as president and a democratic house of representatives and a republican senate and they fight and they fight and they fight and we never get a budget resolution done now what happens is the government paralyzed do we close down no we just go on and they make it easier by repealing the may 15 deadline the committee on appropriations just goes about their business as though there was no budget resolution we do not need a budget resolution essentially is what this says because if it gets snarled up in a fight between the white house and the houses here we will just go right ahead but the real hooker the real fast ball in under ones fingers in this bill is the automatic cr this establishes an automatic cr that goes

people are underpaid living in poor housing it is because congress has failed its job it is that simple the day the republican majority took over congress there were 392 ships at this date it is 318

the ranking member the gentleman from illinois the gentleman from florida the chairman of the subcommittee on health and the gentleman from illinois the ranking member of that subcommittee for developing a true bipartisan proposal to address some of the pay inequities that were brought to the attention of our committee on veterans affairs in response to some of these concerns i introduced last fall h r 2660 which i entitled put your money where your mouth is the va dentist equity act in response to a variety of concerns of va dentists this spring the gentleman from florida conducted a hearing of the subcommittee on health where we heard stirring testimony from dentists who have devoted their careers to the department of veterans affairs members representing the national association of va physicians and dentists the american dental association the american association of oral and maxillofacial surgeons raised concerns about the precipitous decline in recent yvears in the number of dentists practicing in the va and raised concerns about vas ability to recruit new dentists into the system now and in the future these concerns are based on the facts that the dental workforce in va is rapidly declining only 4 years ago the va had more than 900 dentists now we have less than 800 and in individual sites the changes have been even more pronounced in testimony to the subcommittee the national association of va physicians and dentists discussed general practice dentists at one facility in the northeast dropping from 8 to only 2 positions now we know that almost 70 percent of va dentists are eligible for retirement in the next 3 years and that va dentists are paid less than defense dentists dentists in academia or dentists in private practice in fact they make almost onethird less than dentists working in these settings so i am very glad that h r 5109 includes many of the provisions that were in my earlier bill and will include the recruitment and retention of va dentists i want to say for our legislative record that although there is a range of salaries that are printed for dentists that will give them some equity with regard to physicians we hear concerns in specific medical centers that the top of that range for dentists is never fully utilized i think it is fair to say that our committee expects that the full range especially the top range when eligible of the salary schedules that are in h r 5109 be utilized by individual medical centers now i do have one disappointment in this bill that despite a strong sentiment in the full committee on veterans affairs to move a chiropractic health care benefit amendment in this bill we are apparently unable to reach an agreement to introduce direct access full scope of practice chiropractic care into the va health care system in this year chiropractic is the fastest growing and second largest primary health care profession chiropractors are a highly trained and licensed professional health care workforce it is time to put va health care on a par with other government health care programs and recognize chiropractic as a vital component of our health care system in fact we said that a year ago in our millennium health care bill these are technical corrections to that bill a year ago we asked the va to develop a chiropractic plan within 90 days to give chiropractic services to our veterans the va did not do this i met with the assistant secretary for health after the 90 days were up with various representatives of the national chiropractic associations we stressed to the assistant secretary how important it was to act on this and we got frankly bureaucratic inertia bureaucratic resistance and literally very little was done by a year later when we have the corrections for va on the

who are already making six figures but frankly i would like to see the same solicitude for the legislative branch of government and by that i specifically am thinking of the people who work for us i am not talking about members i am talking about our staffs the people who make us look a lot better than we are i find it ironic that a gentleman who was very active in denying us that opportunity to compensate our own employees with a costofliving increase a number of years ago is now very concerned about the pay of the highestpaid judges in this country i have nothing against adequate judicial salaries but i also think we have a problem when the average length of stay for a young congressional staffer on the hill is less than 3 years and i think there is a serious problem when the house of representatives on average pays its top legislative staffers 15 000 to 25 000 less on average than the united states senate does i have forgotten whether it is 15 000 or 25 000 so i will supply the
