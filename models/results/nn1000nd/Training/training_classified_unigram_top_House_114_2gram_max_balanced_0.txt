vast majority of our constituents want us to do something about preventing more gun violence in this country mass shootings have become unacceptably commonplace in the united states of america and we have a responsibility to do more to keep guns out of the wrong hands the shooting in orlando was the largest mass shooting in our countrys history this is a moment of truth and we cannot have another moment of silence without some action we are pleading with the speaker of the house and we are pleading with our republican colleagues to allow us to bring two bipartisan bills to the floor for consideration so that we can debate them and vote on them one is the no fly no buy legislation if you are too dangerous to fly on an airplane because you are on the terrorist watch list according to the fbi then you are too dangerous to buy a gun it shouldnt be controversial the second is to eliminate the loopholes in our background check system which says that you have to go through a background check if you go to a licensed gun dealer but that you can get around that by going to a gun show or by buying a gun online overwhelming numbers of democrats and republicans according to the latest public opinion polls think both of these ideas are smart commonsense approaches the only thing that is standing in the way is the republican leadership in this house please schedule these bills for a vote no we will not be satisfied with the nra bill that you want to bring to the floor this week that basically is nothing but a press release but will not keep guns out of the hands of people who are suspected of being terrorists i hope that we can reach some sort of accomodation with our republican friends we are not going away this issue is too important and it is about time we acted silence and

muster the courage to hold a vote on two proposals that are supported by roughly 90 percent of this country and that can save american lives the american people deserve to be heard they deserve a vote if the unitedstates homeland security community places a person on the fbi terrorist watch list or determines that a person is too dangerous to board an airplane then surely we can agree that person is too dangerous to buy a firearm this week the majority will introduce a bill that pretends to close this gap in our homeland security laws but in reality it would create a system in which it is both legal and likely for suspected terrorists to buy a firearm the republican measure takes no fly no buy and turns it into no fly no problem under their proposal if a known or suspected terrorist attempts to buy a weapon they will be denied that ability for a mere 3 days from the moment they attempt to purchase that firearm the following things must happen all within 72 hours to prevent that purchase the attorney general must file a petition in federal court the court must schedule a hearing the suspect must be provided actual notice and the opportunity to appear at that hearing with a lawyer the court must rule on the petition and if all those things do not occur in 3 days the suspect is legally entitled to buy a weapon not only does the republican bill set an impossible timeline it also requires the justice department to meet an extremely high burden of proof a sale would only be prevented if the court finds probable cause that the suspect has committed or will commit an act of terrorism the republican proposal is specifically designed to ensure the justice department fails and the suspect is allowed to buy a gun it is a fig leaf to cover up the republicans refusal to take any meaningful action on gun violence it is no surprise that this bill is supported by the gun lobby instead of spending our time on toothless ineffective proposals we should vote on the original no fly no buy bill that will keep guns out of the hands of suspected terrorists we are also demanding a vote on a bipartisan proposal to require that commercial gun purchases include a background check background checks for all i have yet to hear one good explanation on why this should not be the law of the land if a dangerous person cannot pass a background check at a licensed gun dealer they should not be able to avoid a background check by going to a gun show or purchasing a firearm over the internet in states that have closed loopholes in their background check laws 48 percent fewer

with the increase in cost many americans have seen a sharp decrease in their choices there are fewer plans available restricting the ability of hardworking families to choose coverage that is

corps of engineers rule relating to the definition of waters of the united states under the clean water act the rule provides for consideration of h r 1644 under a structured rule making four amendments in order three from the democrats and one from the republicans h r 3662 under a closed rule and s j res 22 also under a closed rule like many americans i have grave concerns about the administrations nuclear agreement with iran since the agreements adoption in july iran has shown no goodwill or intention of improving its relationship with the west in many ways the iranian regime has increased its aggressive attitude toward the united states and our allies against u n security council resolutions the rogue nation has expanded its ballistic missile program testing two missiles as recently as last fall just on december 26 an iranian military ship fired a rocket near unitedstates and french military vessels in the persian gulf these incidents occurred just months before crippling international sanctions against the country are scheduled to be lifted further iran continues to be a state sponsor of terrorism a direct threat to our closest ally in the region israel continues rampant human rights abuses and continues the wrongful imprisonment of five american citizens president obama and senior administration officials have claimed that the nuclear agreement and lifting of economic sanctions which could return as much as 100 billion in frozen assets to tehran will help iran down a more moderate path however reality appears to show the contrary is occurring just weeks after the deal was signed supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei stated that we wont allow american political economic or cultural influence in iran and just last week the supreme leader told a gathering of prayer leaders that americans have set their eyes covetously on elections but the great and vigilant nation of iran will act contrary to the enemies will whether it be in elections or on other issues and as before will punch them in the mouth while president obama may find something positive in irans actions and statements i believe congress owes it to the american people to view iran with skepticism and concern h r 3662 the iran terror finance transparency act requires the president to certify that those individuals and entities receiving sanctions relief under the iranian nuclear deal are not involved in irans support for terrorism its human rights abuses or its ballistic missile program by passing this legislation congress can help ensure that the unitedstates will continue to sanction and deter terrorism and illegal ballistic missile tests within the state of iran in arguing for the nuclear deals adoption the president committed to congress and to the american people that our sanctions on iran for its support of terrorism its human rights abuses its ballistic missile program will continue to be fully enforced this legislation gives us the opportunity to hold the president to his word and conduct the necessary oversight to ensure that sanctions are enforced additionally this rule will provide for consideration of two other very critical measures that will help protect american businesses and families from the administrations regulatory overreach this rule provides for consideration of h r 1644 legislation that was drafted in response to the office of surface mining reclamation and enforcements ongoing rulemaking process that seeks to govern the interaction between surface mining operations and streams it is commonly referred to as the stream buffer zone rule in december 2008 the outgoing bush administration published its final stream buffer zone rule this rule was the product of over 5 years of deliberation extensive scientific research environmental analyses public comment and a concurrence from the environmental protection agency put simply this rule was developed the right way with transparency unbiased research scientific integrity stakeholder engagement and most importantly public involvement however shortly after the final 2008 rule was released several environmental groups filed a lawsuit against the osm ultimately leading to a settlement agreement between osm and the environmental groups after numerous missed deadlines the environmental organizations renewed the litigation the administration agreed with the complaint as a result the court vacated the 2008 rule and osm subsequently restarted the rulemaking process since that time the entire process has lacked transparency oversight conducted by the house committee on natural resources of which i am a member revealed that the settlement agreements expedited timeframe coupled with an inexperienced contractor and gross mismanagement of the rulemaking process resulted in major issues with the administrations rule now this may sound just a little familiar it is the very same sue and settle practice that the house addressed just last week with the passage of h r 712 the sunshine for regulatory decrees and settlements act the outcome is another example of why sue and settle leads to poor rulemakings and onerous regulations that significantly harm the people businesses and jobs they are supposed to be supporting backroom deals between environmental groups and federal agencies do not lead to sound regulations but instead circumvent the rulemaking process to serve the interest of a select few namely special interests and environmental groups for 6 years osm has been rewriting this rule and the ongoing process has now cost the taxpayers over 10 million though this is only a small fraction of the cost it will have on businesses and hardworking american families the stream protection rule will drastically reduce our access to coal which accounts for nearly half of our countrys electricity leading to higher electricity costs and significant job losses according to a study from the national mining association the number of direct mining jobs that could be lost is between 40 000 and 77 000 and the total job losses is between 112 000 and 280 000 a fact that is underscored by the nations second largest oil company arch coal filing for bankruptcy largely due to the increased cost of federal regulations that happened just this week for these reasons it is imperative that we pass h r 1644 legislation that delays the rules implementation increases scientific transparency for rulemakings affecting mining directs a transparent third party to evaluate the existing stream buffer zone rule and reduces duplicative regulation this rule also makes in order legislation dealing with an issue that i hear about very often in my congressional district it strikes the controversial waters of the united states or wotus rule s j res 22 is a resolution of disapproval of the presidents wotus rule that was passed by the senate in bipartisan fashion and it is now time for the house to consider and pass this important measure this legislation was crafted in response to the wotus rule promulgated by the epa and the army corps of engineers which redefines and vastly expands the scope of water subject to federal jurisdiction under the clean water act by issuing this rule these agencies have given themselves broad new power over water and land across the united states like many of my constituents i am very concerned with this massive federal overreach it goes far beyond the agencies statutory authority and could impose significant costs not only on american farmers and small businesses but on states and local governments the rule is another federal power grab that has more to do with controlling land use decisions than protecting access to clean water s j res 22 utilizes the congressional review act to block this harmful regulation and it is time to send this critical measure to the presidents desk i urge my colleagues to support this commonsense legislation and the rule providing for its consideration the rule we consider here today provides for the consideration of three bills that are critically important for the future of this country we must pass h r 1644 and s j res 22 to protect american families and businesses from the rampant executive overreach that will be the defining achievement of the obama administration furthermore the united states must stand with our allies

the world i stand ready to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure that the obama administrations shortsighted nuclear agreement does not unravel decades of work by the

seniors than their previous proposals the republican budget would end the medicare guarantee for seniors by converting medicare into a voucher payment that would not keep pace with medical inflation shifting billions of dollars in medical costs onto our senior citizens the republican budget would repeal the affordable care act and would jeopardize the health insurance for millions of americans even though the budget assumes all of the revenue collected by the affordable care act to pay for the affordable care act all of those taxes remain in the budget the republican budget includes a total of 6 5 trillion in spending cuts largely unspecified if this level of cuts were ever made it would devastate our investments and jobs education research and would essentially eliminate any new transportation projects on top of these devastating cuts to vital programs that support and uplift hardworking american families the republican budget calls for trillions of dollars in tax cuts that would primarily benefit millionaires and billionaires and then they claim the tax cuts would be revenue neutral suggesting that we are to believe that trillions of dollars in new taxes would be imposed to pay for those tax cuts for the wealthy but despite this the republican budget is not a credible plan are we really going to dismantle medicare are we really going to cut hundreds of billions of dollars out of education and job training and transportation are we really going to raise trillions of dollars in new taxes to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy i dont think so but the

decadeabove the presidents request for programs that have been instrumental in lifting millions of americans out of poverty some of these proposals include restoration of cuts to the supplemental nutrition assistance program expanding access to affordable housing increasing access to quality and affordable education increasing funding for job training and trade adjustment assistance adjusting the earned income tax credit and child tax credit to inflation as well as decreasing the age where you can benefit for the earned income tax credit down to 21 years of age thanks to the leadership of congressman jim clyburn our budget also ensures that federal resources are targeted more efficiently toward eradicating poverty by targeting federal spending toward persistent areas of poverty through

children exposed to high lead levels however the congressional black caucus appreciates unfortunately that flint is not the only community in america impacted by lead exposure this is why our budget includes funds to help not only flint but also other communities across the nation deal with the effects of lead exposure unlike the republican budget the cbc budget clearly shows how we pay for these additional investments our budget sets a new revenue target of 4 trillion over the next 10 years above the current revenue baseline to demonstrate how this is achievable and realistic our budget suggests several specific alternatives totaling 7 trillion that the house and senate committees can choose from to reach that target we ask for 4 trillion in new additional and specifically outline at least 7 trillion to choose from we do this by specifically talking about closing specific corporate loopholes treating capital gains and dividends as regular income a reasonable fee for financial transactions restoring the estate tax to levels paid over a few years ago specific items where you can choose from and in fact if we just cancel the bushera tax cuts we would have almost 4 trillion in new revenue right there at the end of the day our budget realistically reduces the deficit by approximately 3 2 trillion over the next decade compared to the congressional budget offices march 2016

not have passed this resolution in 2006 we went on to pass it in 2007 and it passed in the house with a vote of 4100 in 2008 it passed in the house of representatives by 4030 in 2009 by 4240 in 2010 by 4210 in 2010 of course and thereafter we stopped passing resolutions on the floor of the house although we may still present them and talk about them on the floor of the house so tonight this is what we will do i would like to mention the mission of the naacp which is to ensure the political educational social and economic equality of all personsnot just of black people not just of people of color but of all people the naacp also desires to eliminate racial hatred and racial discrimination these are lofty and noble goals because we understand that we have had much racial hatred and much racial discrimination in this country and the naacp took it upon itself to eliminate as much of it as possible it has done a good job i might add lets look at a little bit of the history of the naacp back on february 12 1909 a group of people decided that it was going to do something about the lynchings that were taking place in this country literally in this country between 1889 and 1918 thousands of african americans were lynchedthousands lynching was done with mob violence people were taken to trees and they were lynched it was done a good many times with impunity no one was ever prosecuted it was a grave injustice and there were people in this country who decided that they were going to do something about this injustice among the people who met initially were mary white ovington oswald garrison villard william english walling and ida wellsbarnett these persons met and issued a clarion call some 60 persons answered that call hence the naacp was born the naacp did not have its first african american as an executive secretary until 1920 it is important for us to note that many of the founders of the naacpin fact most of themwere not of african ancestry the first executive secretaries of the organization were all persons who were of european ancestry in fact the first five executive secretaries were white they were not black in 1934 the naacp had its first black board chairpersonlouis t wright dr wright became chairperson after the naacp had had a good number of white chairpersons so the naacp has never been and is not now an organization for blacks only the naacp has always stood for an integrated society and has been an integrated organization since its inception in 1954 the naacp under the leadership and counsel of the honorable thurgood marshall who became a justice of the supreme court won the lawsuit of brown v board of education this was a giant leap forward for us because this lawsuit integrated to a certain extent schools throughout the country the word that was appropriately used at the time was desegregated these schools were ordered to be desegregated with all deliberate speed and all deliberate speed can sometimes take a lot longer than one might expect a good many years later there are still those who would contend that we have not fully integrated our school systems across the length and breadth of the country in 1955 an naacp member the honorable rosa parks an african american lady decided that she was going to take a stand and she took that stand by taking a seat she took a seat on a bus in so doing she ignited a spark that started a civil rights movement by the way there are many people who contend that she did this because she was tired well she may have been tired but she did it because she wanted to take a stand she was tired of societys relegating her to the back of the bus and she took a stand against it hence we had the montgomery bus boycott which lasted more than a year at the end of that boycott the bus linethe transportation systemwas integrated in alabama and of course later on throughout the country an interesting note on this point about the integration and desegregation of bus lines there was a threejudge panel that actually heard the litigation associated with this transportation issue on that threejudge panel there were judges who had a great debate about this but there was one frank m johnson a federal district court judge who took the position that we could apply the brown decision to public transportation this was the very first time it was done was under the leadership of that threejudge panel and by the honorable frank m johnson again i point these things out because it is important to note that there were others who were there with the naacp to help us along the way frank m johnson by the way was a republican appointee who was appointed by president eisenhower and he went on to help us to integrate schools throughout the south and integrate the department of public safety he went on to help us with the facilitation of voting rights acts and with the implementation of laws that prohibited persons from discriminating against persons in workplace environments he really played a significant role as did many other persons who were associated with the naacp in a vicarious way because i dont have evidence of his having been a member i want to move forward if i may next to 2008 i move forward to 2008 because this is when the naacp supported the passage of the emmett till unsolved civil rights crime act of 2007 there are many unsolved cases in the history of this country with reference to things that happened to african americans the naacp pushed for and supported legislation such that we can have the opportunity to bring some of the dastards to justice who have caused great harm to people who were doing no harm to anyone the naacp has fought for this in 2009 the naacp celebrated its centennial anniversary and the theme at that time was bold dreams and big victories obviously a good theme because the naacp has won many big victories in 2012 the naacp supported the smart and safe campaign which brought attention to the overpopulated prisons and mass incarceration in this country people who study these issues are well aware that in this country we have an overpopulation of persons who are incarcerated much of this has to do with mandatory sentencing laws much of it has to do with laws that allow persons who are convicted of one type of offense with drugs to receive a harsher penaltycocaine for example then if you have crack cocaine you will get a stiffer penalty as opposed to its being some other type of cocaine the point is that these harsh sentencing laws have caused a good many people to be incarcerated who quite frankly should not be incarcerated for as long as they are incarcerated some of these three strikes and you are out laws have also caused persons to go to prison for a minor offense because it happened to be the third offense so the naacp is fighting against this"], [0.949817068874836, 0.05018293112516403, 1, "and davis who cosponsored this piece of

nonpartisan director of the congressional budget office that apparently what our republican colleagues worked so hard to do was to take affordable health care away from 22 million americans at the same time we have heard all sorts of misinformation and distortions on this floor about planned parenthood which is an organization that provides women and their families with health care that provides cancer screenings and that provides family planning on national television when asked whether there was any evidence that planned parenthood had broken any law even republican chairman chaffetz of the committee on oversight and government reform who investigated planned parenthood said no im not suggesting that they broke the law in fact that was the finding of other committees here yet our republican colleagues have now set up a witch hunt special committee to go after planned parenthood ironically they claim to be doing an investigation but here on the floor they have obviously already reached a conclusion and have decided to defund an organization that helps provide health care to american women and families so rolled into one bill you have something that would deny access to health care to 22 million americans and at the same time deny important health services to millions of american women and their families when our republican colleagues pose this question and say that the president is going to be faced with a tough choice i can assure them it is not a tough choice for the president because it is not a tough choice when it comes to whether or not we take affordable health care away from 22 million americans that should be an easy choice for all of us we are not going to do it it also shouldnt be a tough choice as to whether or not we defund planned parenthood and the services they provide to american women and families that is not going to be a tough choice for the president the republican leader was absolutely right when he talked about the consequences of the 2016 elections because we are fortunate that today we have a president who will not sign that bill but who will instead veto that bill our colleagues are absolutely right if you had a different president including as far as i know all of them on the republican side they would be signing this bill so this is an important statement of what our republican colleagues think is the top priority on the first day of 2016 which is to get rid of affordable health care for 22 million americans lets talk about that with the american public because i believe that the american public
