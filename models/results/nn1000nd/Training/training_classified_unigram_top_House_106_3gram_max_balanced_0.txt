discretionary appropriations and here we are again voting on a measure that would provide over 50 billion to the wealthiest 2 percent of taxpayers how much is enough when will republicans be satisfied with the amount of money they have given to the wealthy and turn their attention to the majority of americans who want a good education a strong work force and a healthy future this bill will cost 50

education priorities in the last 72 hours on sunday night after 3 days of no negotiations republicans met facetoface with democrats on a good faith basis to resolve our differences on education democrats asked republicans whether they had full authority to negotiate a final deal and they answered yes in an example of bipartisan compromise both sides came together and both sides sought common ground negotiators toiled late into the evening each side made concessions as must be done in a bipartisan compromise and consensus was reached through sensible dialogue i give great credit to the gentleman from florida and i give great credit to the gentleman from wisconsin and the senators who were involved the bill that came out of that room was a bipartisan bill that would have lifted up every community and every school in this country this bill included full funding for 100 000 new teachers teacher training afterschool programs and a billion dollars for school repair and school modernization less than 12 hours after the agreement was reached the leaders of the republican party ripped this deal apart as a favor to a business lobby the republican leadership bowed to business lobbyists who according to the washington post were making and i quote urgent calls to the hill to try to block this compromise simply because they did not like worker safety provisions that protected workers from repetitive stress injuries this republicanled congress scuttled a bipartisan agreement that would have provided local districts with the means to hire new teachers and build new classrooms so that we could get smaller classroom sizes so that our children could be better educated i guess it is not a surprise because republican leaders have spent the last 6 years frustrating americas agenda a bipartisan agenda by giving in to special interests on every one of these issues the republican leadership has taken the side of the special interests over americas agenda we tried to get an affordable effective prescription medicine program we forced it on to the agenda with the help of republican members and it was scuttled in conference and it is not going anywhere because i guess the pharmaceutical companies did not want it we worked with republicans to force on to the agenda of this house an effective and enforceable patients bill of rights and it has been stifled in a conference committee because i guess the insurance companies did not want it we could have had targeted tax cuts for college and longterm care and child care but instead we passed huge tax cuts for the top 1 percent of americans instead of getting something done in a bipartisan way that we could have gotten done we fought for sensible gun safety legislation but it is stifled in a conference committee i guess as a favor to the national rifle association we have tried to get a sensible increase in the minimum wage but it too is stifled even though it has strong bipartisan support we forced on to the agenda of this house campaign finance reform which is desperately desired by the people of this country and it too passed by a bipartisan vote in this house and it has been stifled in a conference committee there is a pattern here there is a pattern bipartisan efforts which even passed by bipartisan votes on the floor are being held hostage by the special interests of this country and by the republican leadership that is running this congress the speaker said 2 years ago that the trains were going to run on time and that we would finish our budget in regular order well it is 4 weeks into the fiscal year we are 6 days away from a general election and we have not gotten the work done that we could have gotten done if the leadership of this congress would have simply let the

public the first causes the ghosts of ponzi sam insull and phineas barnum to hover over this chamber in smiling admiration is this a tax cut or is it not the answer is no one knows for sure the bill is tied to receipts and deficits so in some years there may be a tax cut in some years there may not indeed if the national debt does not go down there will be no tax cut now it is hard to speculate how this works or whether there will be a tax cut when how or how much because all the negotiations were done by the republicans alone in closed meetings and the printed version has not been available to analyze or discuss in proper legislative fashion according to the sketchy reports i have been able to receive it will possibly work something like this after an initial 1 percent across the board tax cut all further cuts will be conditioned on whether the total national debt including that related to social security and most trust funds goes down now i cannot tell anyone exactly what that means but i believe i can be excused because the republicans have not said and apparently they cannot either so here we have a remarkable republican tax cut a here you see it now you dont tax cutmaybe you get it maybe you dont now if this massive punitive tax cut really goes into effect lets look at some of its most deficient aspects the republican tax bill would blow a three trillion dollar hole in the budget and threaten the vitality of medicare and social security the republican tax scheme does nothing to extend the life of the social security and medicare trust funds it eats the entire surplus leaving absolutely nothing to ensure the longterm solvency of medicare or social security it soaks up all of the money it leaves nothing to protect or reform medicare or social security it also ensures that there will be no money left over to fund a medicare prescription drug benefit the republican plan also spends all of the nonsocial security surpluses and leaves nothing for debt reduction rather than paying down a large portion of the national debt the republicans would be adding to it when one includes the 141 billion of additional interest payments that are required to finance the tax cut onbudget deficits are likely to appear the bill will force education veterans programs federal health research environmental programs farm programs our national defense and other vital programs to be slashed the republican tax bill will require an average 27 percent cut in all domestic spending programs by 2009 to cite just one example if the majority sticks to their budget caps 1 4 billion would be cut from veterans health programswhich are already universally recognized as woefully under funded in point of fact our veterans programs are an outright disgrace and the republican bill exacerbates the problem the republican scheme will also explode the deficit and threaten our growth over the longterm last year for the first time in thirty years the federal budget was in surplus the republican bill will reverse that course because it will cost as much as 3 trillion in the outyears although it is cleverly and carefully masked the republican bill explodes the deficit in the out years and will produce higher deficits higher interest rates and cripple economic expansion rather than paying down the debt as proposed by the president the republican tax scheme adds to the debt finally the plan put forth by the republican leadership would only benefit the wealthiest americans according to citizens for tax justice the wealthiest one percent of taxpayers would receive 45 percent of the benefits sixtyfive percent of the total tax cut will benefit the top ten percent of taxpayers those with incomes over 115 000 in aggregate 90 percent of taxpayers will receive less than a third of the benefits included in this package that is simply unfair and americans know it congress must use the surplus for medicare and social security first then we can consider responsible tax proposals that sustain our growth and do not threaten our economic prosperity the democratic alternative is the responsible approach and i urge its adoption in short my republican colleagues have crafted either one of the slyest now you see it now you dont scams in the history of government or they have crafted one of the most irresponsible tax cuts ever designed to cripple government and to endanger essential programs like medicare and social security moreover they did it in a sneaky partisan way totally disregarding traditional open legislative practices no wonder the

handed the special interests a victory i am deeply disappointed with this reimportation provision in this bill there is now widespread agreement that this measure will do next to nothing for the american people a lobbyist for a major drug company told the new york times that he doubted that anyone will realize a penny of savings from this legislation last month democrats and republicans were working hard to craft effective importation legislation that contains strong safety standards reimportation was on its way to becoming a real achievement for the american consumer to be sure reimportation was never a substitute for a medicare prescription benefit that offered a guaranteed benefit and lower medicine prices for all seniors but it was a step in the right direction a rare example of what we as a congress could do when we set aside our differences and come together to help the people of this country but a few days ago just as we were about to move forward the bipartisan dynamic ran into a brick wall a brick wall of a leadership unbending to compromise unwilling to detach itself from special interests to pursue a larger agenda operating behind closed doors after a bipartisan agreement had almost been reached the republican leadership torpedoed a sound reimportation measure that could have resulted in lower prices for millions of consumers looking for political cover after repeatedly blocking a medicare prescription benefit the republican leadership put out a sham reimportation measure that is not worth the government paper that it is printed on riddled with loopholes this measure allows pharmaceutical companies to circumvent the new law and it sunsets in 5 years so whatever benefits come from the bill the american people can be sure that they will disappear soon and we are told that the people in the industry that would do this will not even set it up if there is a 5year sunset provision the measure as it now stands is nothing more than a capitulation to the special interests at whose bidding the republican leadership works listen to what people are saying about the watered down measure the new york times today reported that doubts are growing about legislation to allow imports of lowpriced prescription drugs and no one in the government or the drug industry can say how it will work or even whether it will work the health policy coordinator at the white house said this measure is now unworkable what happened to the bipartisan sensible measure that we should be voting on today why did the leadership torpedo that bill and replace it with a meaningless measure that does nothing for real people the answer lies in a leadership that is so tied to special interests that it blocks major initiatives at the expense of the american people congress has wasted 2 years now trying to accomplish something meaningful for the american consumer but this leadership has been more devoted to the powerful lobbies than to working families the leadership blocked campaign finance reform a patients bill of rights a medicare prescription benefit gun safety legislation and a modest increase in the minimum wage as favors to hmos insurance companies pharmaceutical companies big business and the nra i and many of my colleagues will support this measure because it contains disaster relief and hunger relief for many in our country but time is running out on this congress we have only a few days to do something meaningful for the american people reimportation is dead but i believe with all my heart there is time to do something with the peoples agenda we can still pass the bipartisan bills that majorities in congress have already supported that the president says he will sign and that the american people want i

to see that our senior citizens have a decent prescription drug benefit with medicare we stand here this evening the greatest nation that has ever been in the history of the world there has never been another country that has the economic the military and the political power that this country does and yet our senior citizens many of them millions of them are going to go to bed tonight and not have enough to eat or not have the medicine they need because our prescription drug manufacturers are simply robbing them of that medicare was even admitted to being a success by governor bush yesterday even knowing that the former speaker mr gingrich and his colleagues in the majority have vowed for years that they would see medicare wither on the vine i believe is the way they put it what we know and we do not have to spend all of august in the first congressional district of arkansas to find this out we can go to any congressional district in the country this is a real problem for real people and it is causing real pain and it is time that we do something about it as congress takes the next month or so to wrap up legislative business for this year there is simply no excuse for leaving seniors and the disabled without a reliable prescription drug benefit under medicare the republican leadership has reluctantly been forced to put forward what they call a plan because of the overwhelming public outcry created by rapidly escalating outrageously profitable prescription drug prices charged by manufacturers being forced to develop a plan the best republican leaders have been able to do is to listen to their friends in the pharmaceutical industry if they had traveled with any of us over august and listened to the stories that we heard every one of us heard and they are heartbreaking these are people that worked hard played by the rules and thought they had made the right decisions to provide for their senior years they would know that we have got to do something about this problem and it is time to have a prescription drug benefit for medicare the democratic plan will use the purchasing power of our seniors covered by medicare to negotiate large discounts from drug makers i believe governor bush said yesterday that that would be a dangerous thing to do it might actually reduce by a little bit the outrageous profits of these drug companies they might actually even have to cut back on some of the tremendous salaries that they pay the people that run these companies and that would be too bad to cut some of those folks back under maybe 100 million a year the republican plan is a cynical game being played with our seniors health a shameful attempt to deceive our seniors they have proposed a large first step toward privatizing medicare and forcing our seniors to deal with private insurance companies to get the care and the prescription drugs that they need the insurance companies say they do not want it they do not want anything to do with it that is why we have to have medicare medicare is a success you can ask the republicans what does it cover and they will tell you well we dont know then you can say how much does it pay and they will say we dont know then you can say what are the premiums and they will say we dont know they do not want to see drug companies exorbitant profits damaged that is what the interest is in the plan that governor bush put forward yesterday that and continuing to try to destroy medicare as we know it their plan only provides subsidies to their insurance companies the donors and the pharmaceutical companies profits rather than giving any direct assistance to our seniors it does nothing to see that americans can buy prescription medicine at the same price as every other country in the world and we pay two to three times as much in this country their plan is based on the discredited theory that private insurers will offer affordable prescription insurance if they are given enough government subsidies but the hmos and the insurance companies just simply say this will not work it is also unlikely that the country will be able to pay for prescription drug coverage under medicare because the republicans are continuing their attempts to squander any available moneys on tax cuts that are disproportionately benefitting the wealthy the american people want a prescription drug benefit for our seniors and it is time for this congress and the next president to recognize the tremendous need that our seniors have and do the right thing and pass a legitimate prescription drug benefit for

my constituents during the district work period conducting 15 town meetings and i wanted to report today on really the response to the republican agenda of good schools and low taxes and a secure retirement for all americans i have the privilege of representing a very very diverse district the south side of chicago in the south suburbs of cook and will counties as well as a lot of rural and bedroom communities and one always listens for the common concerns when they represent a diverse district of cities suburbs and country during the last two weeks i got a pretty good response people were very supportive of the republican agenda of strengthening our local schools of lowering the tax burden for the middle class of making for a secure retirement for all americans by strengthening medicare and social security i would like to take a few minutes just to talk about some of those specifics of our republican agenda and of course let me begin with the republican efforts to strengthen social security and to strengthen medicare for the next three generations i am often asked a common question over the last several years that i have had the privilege of being in the congress and that question is when are you politicians in washington going to stop raiding the social security trust fund i was pleased to tell my constituents that this is the year we are going to do that this is the year we are going to wall off the social security trust fund and say hands off and my constituents frankly were pretty shocked when they learned that the clintongore budget actually raids the social security trust fund by 351 billion i think it is important to note that when we compare republican efforts to wall off the social security trust fund which means 100 percent of social security according to this chart for social security versus the clintongore proposal for 62 percent of the social security trust fund going to social security and the other 38 percent being spent on other things that is what this means the president wants to spend 38 percent of social security on new government programs republicans of course want to wall off the social security trust fund essentially putting trust back in the trust fund with 100 percent of social security for social security and that is a big victory i also want to note that the republican budget sets aside almost 400 billion more than the clintongore budget for medicare and social security now our second priority in our agenda of course is lower taxes for the middle class and i am one who believes that when the tax burden for the average family in illinois is about 40 percent of their income going to local state and federal government for taxes that that tax burden is too high and we need to lower the tax burden particularly for the middle class and when we talk about the tax burden i find that constituents whether it is at the union hall or the vfw or the local chamber of commerce they tell me that the tax code is too complicated requires too much paperwork and the majority of people have to hire someone else to fill out the tax forms and i also point out that the tax burden is really unfair as we work this year to lower the tax burden i believe that our top priority should be to simplify the tax code to address the unfairness in the tax code and of course we need to begin by eliminating the marriage tax penalty is it right is it fair that 21 million married working couples on average pay 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married 1 400 more than an identical couple living together outside a marriage that is wrong that our tax code punishes marriage the marriage tax elimination act has 230 cosponsors let us get it done this year let us simplify the tax code and eliminate the marriage tax penalty of course the republican agenda a secure retirement and lower taxes also includes strengthening our local schools and we want to strengthen our local schools by empowering our local school boards and our local teachers and our local parents to run their schools and giving them the flexibility of course to meet the needs of local communities and that is an important shift because previously for 30 to 40 years all the power was moving to washington and i talk with local school administrators and school board members they tell me maybe in illinois 6 percent of our public schools budget comes from washington but so does twothirds of the paperwork and almost 100 percent of the mandates micromanaging how our schools are run we want to let local schools run themselves and meet the needs of their local communities and that is why we want to pass the ed flex legislation my hope it will be on the presidents desk fairly soon the other concern that local school board members also share with me is they say as my colleagues know youve increased funding at the federal level by 10 percent even while youve been balancing the budget increasing funding for education but if you look at how those dollars have been spent only 70 cents of every dollar actually reaches the classroom thirty cents is lost in the washington bureaucracy our goal is to ensure that more dollars get to the classroom with a goal of 95 cents on the dollar reaching the classroom and if we compare that to the current cost of delivering those funds to our looal schools that is a 25 percent funding increase above and beyond what they are currently receiving we are providing 22 billion in federal funding for our local schools it is just wrong that 30 cents on the dollar currently is lost in washington let us help our local schools let us lower the tax burden for the middle class let us secure retirement by strengthening medicare and social security"]],

the gentleman from new jersey as was mentioned and the gentleman from new york one of the cosponsors we have worked as a team and i think this is a very important resolution for house consideration today the resolution before us today condemns the brutal murder of northern ireland defense attorney rosemary nelson and calls for the british government to launch an independent inquiry into rosemarys killing the resolution also calls for judicial inquiry into the allegations of official collusion in the 1989 murder of defense attorney patrick finucane and an independent investigation into broader allegations of harassment of defense attorneys by northern irelands police force known as the royal ulster constabulary or the ruc rosemary nelson was a champion of due process rights and a conscientious and courageous attorney in northern ireland she was the wife of paul nelson and the mother of three young children sara gavin and christopher her murder on march 15 1999 was a cowardly act by those who are the enemies of peace and enemies of justice in northern ireland her death is a loss felt not just by her family and friends but by all who advocate fundamental human rights consideration of this resolution today is particularly timely as officials in northern ireland the republic of ireland and the u k continue to question the ability of the ruc to properly conduct this murder investigation in fact last week the european parliament passed its own resolution offered by dublins representative bernie malone which calls for a fully independent team of investigators to conduct the inquiry as a means of securing confidence and objectivity anyone who knows anything about human rights in northern ireland would have little confidence that the ruc could produce a credible or a transparent or thorough investigation of the murder of a catholic defense attorney the history of intimidation of defense attorneys by the ruc has been documented by my subcommittee as well as by the united nations commission on human rights thus there is little reason to believe that rosemary nelson who was mistreated by members of the ruc throughout her professional life as an attorney would now be treated respectfully and justly in death i first met rosemary nelson in belfast a few years ago when she shared with me her genuine concern for the administration of justice in the northern ireland she explained how as an attorney she had been physically and verbally assaulted by ruc members and how they sent death threats to her through her clients many of her clients were harassed as well notwithstanding these threats rosemary still carried an exhaustive docket which included several highprofile political cases such as representing the family of robert hamill who was beaten to death by a sectarian mob and representing the residents of garvaghy road in their bid to stop controversial marches through the neighborhood through her work she became an international advocate for the rule of law and the right of the accused to a comprehensive defense and an impartial hearing of their case for this however rosemary was often the subject of harassment and intimidation for her service to her clients rosemary nelson paid the ultimate price with her life the victim of a car bomb in september of last year just 7 months ago rosemary testified before my subcommittee she told us how she feared she feared the ruc she reported that she had been quote and i quote from her testimony physically assaulted by a number of ruc officers and that the harassment included threats against my personal safety including death threats she said she had no confidence in receiving help from her government because in the end her complaints about the ruc would be investigated by the ruc testifying along with rosemary nelson was a man by the name of mr cumaraswamy a u n special rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers who led an extensive human rights investigative team to the uk and published a report in 1998 mr cumaraswamy stated that he found evidence and i quote him of consistent and systematic close quote ruc harassment and intimidation of defense lawyers in northern ireland his report was quite critical of the excessive authority granted to the ruc by the socalled emergency laws and he expressed dismay that the government had not moved decisively to protect lawyers that were under threat mr cumaraswamy recommended a judicial inquiry into the threats and the intimidation of rosemary nelson and other defense attorneys last week at the un commission on human rights at their annual summit in geneva mr cumaraswamy reported that in the years since the release of his report about the great dangers facing northern irelands defense attorneys that the ruc had shown and these are his words complete indifference he accused the ruc chief constable ronnie flanagan and i quote him again of allowing the situation to deteriorate and like the rest of us the special rapporteur says he has and these are his words again a nagging feeling that the ruc involvement in what is now a murder investigation could affect and taint the impartiality and the credibility of that investigation and yet our friends in the blair government seem unmoved despite rosemary nelsons testimony her concerns and the concerns now raised by human rights experts around the world the british government has forfeited the investigation of rosemary nelsons murder to the very agency she feared and mistrusted the most it does not seem to phase them that a report just released by northern irelands police watchdog the governments independent commission for police complaints the icpc said that ruc investigators investigating the death threats against rosemary nelson were themselves evasive and disinterested it also found an illdisguised hostility to mrs nelson on the part of some police officers astonishingly even the police from the bereaved family even the pleas from the father himself the husband and father of the three children paul nelson he went to geneva just the other day and his quote if the icpc had no confidence in the ability of the ruc to investigate the death threats against rosemary how can my family he says be expected to have confidence in their ability indeed their willingness to effectively investigate her murder the bill before us the resolution before us today truly captures mr nelsons sense of despair and reflects the growing international consensus that the british government needs to act decisively and remove any and all doubts about the investigation into rosemary nelsons murder ruc ronnie flanagan has rejected the call for an rucfree investigation and has instead been spinning his wheels trying to create the image of impartiality and external influence on his investigation it does not cut nobody is buying it and we need now an rucfree investigation let me just conclude by noting that the major international human rights organizations including amnesty international the lawyers committee for human rights british irish human rights watch the committee for the administration of justice human rights watch and the genevabased commission of jurists all support the call for an independent inquiry that is what we tried to do in this resolution the time is long past for this to happen and i hope we get the full support of this body in support of this resolution the resolution before us today condemns the brutal murder of northern ireland defense attorney rosemary nelson and calls on the british government to launch an independent inquiry into rosemarys killing the resolution also calls for a judicial inquiry into allegations of official collusion in the 1989 murder of

in northern ireland his report was quite critical of the excessive authority granted to the ruc through the socalled emergency laws and he expressed dismay that the government had not moved decisively to protect lawyers under threat mr cumaraswamy recommended a judicial inquiryinto the threats and intimidation rosemary nelson and other defense attorneys had received he endorsed the establishment of a police ombudsman and he called on the british government to provide protection for defense attorneys who had been harassed today it is hard not to wonder if only the british government had taken the special rapporteurs recommendations more seriously rosemary nelson might have been better protected and still with us today but last week at theu n commission on human rights annual summit in geneva mr cumaraswamy reported that in the year since the release of the un report about the grave dangers facing northern irelands defense attomeys the ruc has shown complete indifference he accused ruc chief constable ronnie flanagan of allowing the situation to deteriorate and like the rest of us the special rapporteur says he has a nagging feeling that ruc involvement in what is now a murder

the ruc it doesnt seem to faze them that a report just released by northern irelands police watchdog the governments independent commission for police complaints icpc said that ruc officers investigating the death threats against rosemary nelson were themselves evasive and disinterested it also found an illdisguised hostility to mrs nelson on the part of some police officers astonishingly even the pleas of the bereaved family have fallen on deaf ears at stormont castle as a result rosemary nelsons husband paul went to geneva last week to gain outside help in his push for an independent investigation into the murder of his wife he has said very simply if the icpc had no confidence in the ability of the ruc to investigate the death threats against rosemary how can my family be expected to have confidence in their abilityindeed their willingness to effectively investigate her murder the bill before us today captures mr nelsons sense of despair and reflects the growing international consensus that the british government needs to act decisively to remove any and all doubts about the investigation into rosemary nelsons murder ruc chief ronnie flanagan has rejected the call for an rucfree investigation and has instead been spinning his wheels trying to create an image of impartiality and external influence in his inves tigation but its all an illusion while the chief constables diversionary tactics have flattered some even one or two in our own fbithe people in the affected community have not been fooled this week both the irish news and the irish times reported that despite mr flanagans posturing about external influences on the investigation community witnesses have been reluctant to talk to the police and who can blame them local residents remain skeptical of the rucs window dressing and have no confidence in an investigation that has already swapped one nonruc lead investigator for another they dont buy an investigation that advertises itself as a 50member outside investigate force even though 40 members of the team are ruc and only 10 are not they have low expectations and little trust in an investigative team that tells people its working hard on the crime but cant get the date of the murder right and issues a telephone hotline number thats already been disconnected or never put in service the camouflage on mr flanagans socalled independent outside inquiry has already worn thin because of thedocumented open hostility that ruc officers displayed towards rosemary nelson the ruc simply does not have the credibility to answer the burdensome questions who killed rosemary nelson who ordered her murder and did the ruc officers who threatened her life in the past either instigate condone or coverup her killing in order for this investigation to be beyond reproach and to have the confidence and cooperation of the catholic community that rosemary nelson adeptly represented it must be organized managed directed and run by someone other than the ruc anything short of that may have surface appeal but it still leaves too much of the grueling investigation under the charge of an organization of which the murder victim herself was extremely suspect and to whom the local people are afraid to talk the major international human rights groups including amnesty international lawyers committee for human rights british irish human rights watch the committee for the administration of justice human rights watch and the genevabased international commission of jurist support the call for an independent inquiry one of the major tenets of the 1998 good friday agreement is its promise of an acceptable police force that will secure due process rightsrather than thwart themfor members of both communities in northern ireland the success of the peace process is predicated on the governments ability to deliver on a police force that will protect fundamental human rights and to demonstrate to the people of northern

mark the 210th anniversary of the unitedstates coast guard since 1790 the men and women of the coast guard have demonstrated that they are always ready semper paratus to carry out their critical duties todays coast guard has primary responsibility for the promotion of safety of life and property at sea that is easy to say and difficult to do because there are days when the seas are calm and there are days when the seas are stormy there are evenings when the stars are out and the twilight is beautiful and there are evenings when the storm rages the icebreakers are out there and the storm ensures that the hours the coast guard is on duty will be very very dangerous but they do their job in spite of all that the coast guard is responsible for enforcing all federal laws at sea and under the sea in all of the united states waters and the united states territories they maintain the aids to navigation which is something we almost never think of until we are in a boat and we do not want to run aground as a result of that as a result of the coast guards professional efficient persistent adherence to those aids of navigation the mariners whether they are on the high seas in our coastal waters or in our rivers they are safe the protection of the marine environment which is one of the major responsibilities exclusively designated to the unitedstates coast guard under all circumstances in all weather in all seas throughout the entire many thousands of miles of the unitedstates coastline and the unitedstates citizens are protected from the vast array of problems surrounding pollution including oil pollution from the vast array of oil tankers and cruise ships that navigate through our waters domestic and international icebreaking activities from the north sea to the majestic great lakes to the arctic circle to the antarctic circle and to the jewel of estuaries the chesapeake bay those waters are protected they are navigable in all weather to ensure that schoolchildren if they live on an island like smith island in the chesapeake that they can get to school in spite of the ice they might not be disappointed but because of the coast guard they ensure that they get their education or to all the barges and the ships that travel throughout the nations waters and especially in the antarctic or the arctic the unitedstates coast guard icebreakers are on duty 24 hours a day sometimes in the antarctic they are cutting through ice that is 12 feet thick it is a lonely duty but the courageous coast guard people ensure that it is done the safety and security of vessels ports waterways and facilities are all ensured by the coast guard and the gentleman from minnesota mentioned the fisheries out 200 miles the exclusive economic zone as it is called is constantly under siege by the foreign fishing vessel fleet and who is out there to protect the economics and the marine ecosystem but the unitedstates coast guard as a military service and a branch of the armed forces the coast guard also maintains a readiness to operate as a specialized service with the navy upon the declaration of war whenever the president directs and we do not have to wait for a declaration of war we know that there are very often illegal immigrants that go on tramp steamers go on a number of vessels recently in the caribbean i was on a coast guard cutter that was directed to intervene in any vessel that they thought there were illegal immigrants in one incident there was a what we might call a tramp steamer a merchant marine fishing vessel from an asian country filled with over 50 illegal hostile immigrants a small group of coast guard people led by an officer who was a professional young woman boarded that tramp steamer arrested those illegal immigrants without incident and assured that they were taken into custody the coast guard is a mighty fine outfit and during all the wars that they were involved in including vietnam and i was in vietnam in the mid1960s with the marine corps and i have to say that the marine corps has a beautiful hymn the gentleman from north carolina said the coast guard their song is a beautiful song and it is i would give a vote that the most beautiful song is the marine corps hymn but the second most beautiful would be the coast guard hymn but the coast guard served its nation in vietnam and sometimes yes those young coasties had barbecues on the back of those coast guard cutters in safe waters but more often than not the coast guard gave up those barbecues for dangerous patrols to protect american interests and the interests

dramatically a very troubling fact given the economy the low unemployment and poverty rates health insurance is a critical component of personal financial fitness and we should be doing all we can to help people afford health insurance you can be for patients rights and for coverage of uninsured americans this legislation provides tax deductions for people who pay 50 percent of the cost of health insurance and longterm care insurance the gao has said this will expand coverage to 40 million americans 25 million of whom are uninsured does it matter whether you help 25 million of the 43 million uninsured you bet it does and by making insurance more affordable you can help them get into the health care system we all value and depend on we spend 100 billion in tax breaks for people who have employerprovided insurance regardless of their income so why should we not treat those who pay their own premiums exactly the same way it is a matter of fairness it is a matter of access to critical benefits health insurance in addition this bill expands availability to msas i have visited a company in my district a manufacturing company these are working people and they have chosen msas they have a choice and they choose msas why because they can spend msa dollars on dental benefits vision benefits home health care benefits drug benefits a far broader range of benefits than most employer plans provide because they can spend those msa dollars on anything eligible in the tax code why would we not want to offer them that choice do we not trust them i think it is terrific to have sure coverage and the sicker you are the better off you would be in an msa because once you meet that deductible and you can spend it on everything then you get catastrophic coverage and that is the best deal for a really sick person in addition the bill provides new and more affordable choices for small businesses so they can offer coverage to their employees in short let me say that this is a great bill we should support it and if we do not open up access we need our heads examined because that is the real problem out there we can do patients bill of rights and access this week in this house i am pleased to rise in strong support of this legislation that will help people afford health insurance the number of uninsured people has risen dramatically over the past yeara troubling fact given the growth in our economy and low unemployment and poverty rates health insurance is a critical component of personal financial fitness we should be doing all we can to help people afford health insurance this legislation will expand access to health insurance first it will offer tax deductions for people who pay at least 50 of the cost of their health and longterm care insurance at my request the gao has examined the impact of a health deduction and concluded that 40 million people would have been eligible in 1997 for a tax deduction for health insurance of these 40 million 25 million were uninsured we are currently providing over 100 billion in tax breaks to people who have employerprovided insurance regardless of their income we should do no less for people who have to pay their own premiums its a matter of fairness its a matter of access to health insurance in addition to helping the uninsured through premium deductibility this bill expands the availability of medical savings accounts msas msas are a preferred way for some people to cover their health insurance costs i have visited a small company in my district that offers msas to their employees i heard directly from the workers that they prefer msas because their health care dollars cover a far broader range of health benefits better benefits than almost all employers provided plansdental vision home care drugs and gain access to a broad range of doctors instead of a narrow group covered through an hmo in addition this bill provides new and more affordable choices for small businesses to offer coverage to their employees only 28 of employers with less than 25 workers offer health insurance the main reason for small employers not offering health insurance is the higher costs they face their small size means they cannot spread the risk associated with a few unhealthy employees they also face higher administrative costs if we are going to address the problem of uninsured americans we must help small businesses which are one of the fastest growing employment sectors afford to offer health insurance coverage people working for small businesses account for 16 of the under65 population but 28 of the uninsured this legislation will help small employers pool together to afford the cost of insuring their workers it will also create access to health insurance and health care services for people in urban and rural areas by allowing community health centers to serve as insurance networks it is critical that we address the problem of the uninsured cbo estimates that for every 1 increase in health insurance costs 400 000 people lose their health insurance if we consider managed care reform legislation without taking steps to increase access to health insurance we are turning a blind eye to the 44 million americans who have no health insurance option plus those who will lose their litigation runs premiums up our efforts to improve health insurance quality must include equal commitment to increasing the number of insured americans h r 2990 takes these steps i urge its adoption"]]}
