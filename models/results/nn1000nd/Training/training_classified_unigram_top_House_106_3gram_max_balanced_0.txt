would hope that could be brought to my attention so i could yield the second half of the hour to him this is my first speech of the 106th congress i would like to welcome back my old colleagues and welcome our new colleagues my new colleagues i have not had a chance to introduce myself to all of them let me take this opportunity to do so i am brad sherman i hail from americas bestnamed city sherman oaks california periodically i seek an opportunity to give a rather long speech detailing a number of different topics this saves the house from having to listen to a number of short speeches each on a separate topic i often give these speeches at the beginning or the end of a session i have a number of topics i would like to address today the first of these is the current unpleasantness occurring in the senate the problems involving monica lewinsky the president et cetera first i would like to point out that it is unprecedented in our lifetimes that an impeachment would be sent by this house over to the other body on a 99 percent partisan vote with 99 percent of the one party voting against the impeachment resolution i think it is a shame a shame on this house that we would send an impeachment resolution to the senate under those circumstances i came to the floor last month actually in december to voice my opinion that in not allowing members to vote on censure and then sending over articles of impeachment on a partisan basis that this house had gone astray i said at that time that i would call this house a kangaroo court but that would be an insult to marsupials everywhere that shame has hung in this chamber until yesterday because i think we owe a debt of gratitude to prosecutor ken starr for doing something so outrageous that it has distracted america from the mistake we made here in december ken starr knows we all know that the president is not going to be removed from office yet a leak emerges from ken starrs office that he thinks that he will criminally indict and perhaps prosecute a sitting president this is not only a constitutional outrage it represents perhaps the worst prosecutorial judgment ever displayed ken starr has in the words of george stephanopolous pursued the president with the hateful tenacity of captain ahab and it is time for this misjudgment to stop it is bizarre that ken starr seeing that the president will not be removed from office has begun to fantasize that he will barge into the oval office and place handcuffs on the president of the united states perhaps during some meeting with a foreign head of state we must take actions to show that this pipsqueak cannot barge into the oval office and cannot seek to undermine the executive branch of government i recognize and we all recognize that president clinton remains subject to the rule of law while he is president he can be impeached and has been by this house and could be removed by the senate as soon as he leaves the white house he is subject to all manner of criminal action and of course is subject to civil action as well we need to look longterm at what this means for the presidency i ask those on the republican side of the aisle to remember that some day it may be one of theirs who is sitting as president imagine some future president and imagine his enemies or should i say her enemies begin immediately upon inauguration day to conspire and they gather a few million dollars to carry it out i used the word conspire conspiracy is not the right word they simply gather together to begin a plan to undermine some new president they gather a few million dollars together and the first thing they do is announce that they will pay a 1 million book advance to any secret service agent willing to write a book titled embarrassing things i learned while guarding the president imagine that they place an ad in the star tabloid or should i call it the ken starr tabloid the ad goes something like this have you been abducted by a ufo was the president working with the aliens if so contact us we will give you 1 million and we will help you sue the president for everything that went on on the spaceship and by the way if that ufo abduction happened if the spacecraft happened to land in any one of these three or four counties where we have in some obscure county somewhere in america a friendly prosecutor then we will also be able to urge that obscure prosecutor to bring criminal action against the president i am not sure that a lawsuit or criminal prosecution for participation in an ufo abduction against a president of the united states would last all that long it might be thrown out of court but i give this as an illustration of the road we are going down that road is that the enemies of every president those who are most blinded by their hatred of that president will begin to try to destroy a president by finding out secrets and embarrassing tidbits from the secret service by convincing people to begin civil suits that will distract the president and embarrass him or her and by trying to convince local prosecutors around the country even in the most obscure counties to bring criminal actions against the president for these reasons i think it is important that this house adopt and i look forward to beginning to draft a presidential protection act the basic tenets of this act would be three in number the first is that those who work for the secret service would be required to keep what they learn confidential even if they want to write a book they should not be allowed to do so based on secrets they learned on the job second of course they should enjoy a privilege from being compelled to testify about those secrets there might be a few exceptions but imagine a situation where a secret service agent could testify about how long this meeting took place or how many times the president contacted this or that adviser imagine the chilling effect it would have if a president felt he could not reach out or she could not reach out to advisers around the country because the names of those advisers or even the nature of what they discuss could be a matter of public discovery second a presidential protection act or rather a presidency protection act should provide that as to all criminal actions or attempts at criminal prosecution that we toll the statute of limitations so if there is a 5year statute of limitations on a particular crime that any day that occurs while an individual is serving in the white house as president would not count toward that 5year period then we provide that there will be no criminal indictments or trials of anyone while they are president of the united states we could provide that under certain circumstances testimony could be taken in case some witness might die or become unavailable in the years that someone served in the white house but clearly no president of the united states should have to worry for a minute about the criminal law systern being visited upon him or her by a politicallymotivated prosecutor finally we need to have a very similar proceedings dealing with civil suits that the statute of limitations is tolled that is to say in nonlegal jargon the suit is put in the freezer and it can be tried after a presidency is completed i know that the supreme court ruled in the jones vs clinton case that you could sue a sitting president the supreme court noted that the congress could change that result the supreme court argued that a civil suit against the president would not be an undue distraction clearly later events have proven otherwise i am frankly surprised given the number and the power of certain individuals who hate this president that there have not been a dozen or a hundred other civil lawsuits trumpedup real or imagined for this or that reason brought against the president i make these comments not to invite such highly destructive behavior but rather to illustrate why the house and the senate must act to make it clear that any civil lawsuit against the president is put in the freezer that the statute is tolled until the presidency is over as i pointed out such a statute would be just as protective of a republican president as a democratic president and given the heightened level of partisanship that has occurred as a result of those who are scheming to try to destroy president clinton given the fact that that higher level of partisanship unfortunately is beginning to afflict both parties i think it is critical that we act now to make sure that small groups of wellfinanced individuals cannot destroy a presidency i will be circulating a letter to my colleagues urging that they sign onto a bill but even before that urging that they give me their comments or meet with me in the drafting of a bill so that i can have bipartisan input into how it is drafted i am considering and would like my colleagues to comment on whether on an emergency basis we need to adopt a bill just dealing with criminal prosecutions and making it very clear to ken starr that he is not empowered and no prosecutor is empowered to go barging into the oval office with a pair of handcuffs the very possibility the very argument that that could legally occur undermines our system of government and makes us a laughingstock around the world i would now like to shift to international relations as many of my colleagues know i served on the committee on international relations i do want to comment about our friendship with greece and the republic of cyprus we all know that the very essence of democracy and so many of the values that are at the core of americanism developed in greece greece and cyprus want nothing more at this point than to defend themselves from the possibility of air attack and have sought air defense missiles i regret very much that the administration pressured the government of cyprus not to deploy air defense missiles that had been acquired i agree with the administration cyprus should not have acquired missiles from russia cyprus should have acquired missiles built in the 24th congressional district in california when the united states is willing to sell greece and cyprus the air defense mechanisms that it needs there will be no need for greece and cyprus to try to buy these from other places and potentially have russian technicians on greek or cyprian soil these are defensive weapons they add to the stability of the aegean we ought to change our policy and make it very clear to cyprus and greece that we are willing to sell defensive weapons to those two countries on the one proviso that the manufacturers be located in the 24th congressional district i had the honor to accompany the president of the united states on his trip to the middle east in december i want to applaud the president for making that visit i also want to point out that the president was warmly welcomed by all the various legislators and officials of the palestinian authority and the palestinian national council but after the president left yasser arafat made statements in support of iraq and calling for an arab meeting to condemn american policy with regard to iraq just a few days after the president departed and we all departed he was once again talking about a unilateral declaration of statehood there is nothing worse for the peace process than a unilateral declaration of statehood by the palestinian authority here this year in congress we need to make it clear that immediately without further action upon any declaration of statehood made on a unilateral basis by the palestinian authority all american aid to that authority stops and all american representatives at all international organizations especially the world bank and similar organizations must vote against any aid to the palestinian authority after such a destabilizing effort i want to applaud the administration for remaining involved and dedicated to peace in the middle east but point out that pressuring israel is not the way to achieve that peace israel has been pro america whether we had a republican administration or a democratic administration a republican house or a democratic house we should remain dedicated allies of israel whether the government in jerusalem is likud or labour the new party being organized and headed by isaac mordecai and others in looking at the situation in the middle east we need to focus on both the shortterm and longterm needs for security all too much of the focus has quite naturally been on the shortterm needs as if land for peace meant a peace consisting nothing more than a month without a terrorist incident or a year without a bomb any such shallow definition of peace will not generate the kind of treaty that is eventually necessary for a final agreement with the palestinians can we ask the israelis to make the kinds of concessions even in part that the palestinians are asking for if peace means only peace with the palestinians instead as part of any peace agreement yasser arafat personally and the entire palestinian authority must be willing to become apostles for peace must be willing to go to every arab capital every islamic capital and urge the recognition of israel trade relations with israel and most important of all a general recognition that israel is a permanent inherent part of the middle east there are those in the arab world who describe israel as just the second of the crusader states nonislamic states created in the holy land that lasted less than two centuries that cannot continue we cannot have arab children educated for war or taught that israel is eventually to be driven in the ocean for that reason we need to change arab education just as much as we need to make any changes in any of the borders between zone a zone b and zone c of the west bank a b and c being different levels of palestinian authority and israeli military control land for peace must involve sowing the seeds of peace knowing that it will take a generation or two or three for them to bear fruit but sowing the seeds of peace in an organized and systemic matter throughout the middle east this is critical to israels longterm security because any student of history will tell us and any student of current military affairs will tell us that if israel ever faces the possibility of losing another war or some war in the future it will not be to an army based in ramallah if israel must fear for its security in the sense of potentially losing a war it must fear armies based in baghdad teheran cairo or damascus not only is this a reflection of current military realities or potential future military realities and when i say current military realities clearly israel will not lose a war in the next decade or two no combination of its enemies or potential enemies could beat it but we must look not one or two decades but one or two centuries in the future and recognize that at various times in the past egypt syria babylon now iraq and persia now iran have all conquered the holy land we must create a situation where it is as unthinkable in cairo to erase israel from the map as it would be unthinkable in paris to think of erasing the netherlands or belgium from the map i should also focus on the importance in the peace process to improving the palestinian economy a recent report by the israeli government shows israels dedication on this subject but the fact remains that there are close to 200 000 guest workers in israel workers occupying jobs that could be held by palestinians without displacing a single israeli these guest workers hail from such countries as the philippines and thailand of course we in this body are interested in the future success of the thai economy and the philippine economy yet when it comes to policy in the middle east isriels contribution to the economic recovery of thailand is not as important for the middle east as is economic development of the palestinian authority and of palestinians in general i had a chance to talk to palestinian legislators i feared that as a matter of being politically correct or proud that they would reject or poohpooh or minimize the concept of palestinians working almost exclusively in nonprestigious jobs in the israeli economy what i found among palestinian leaders to the very highest levels was practicality and an understanding of how important it is that especially young palestinian men have a future for themselves and their families and not bitterness and the time on their hands to plot to join hamas and other terrorist groups with that in mind i would suggest that as part of an overall peace process and only in return for palestinian concessions that israel endeavor to provide to the palestinians rather than to guest workers those jobs within its economy for which israelis will not be hired this could be done through a flat prohibition on guest workers other than those arriving from the palestinian authority or some sort of tax on employers who employ guest workers from outside the palestinian areas but whatever steps are taken the need for palestinian jobs is as important as it may seem as just a practical aspect not on the same level as issues of war and peace yet it is i believe critical toward forming the kind of peaceful relationship that will last into the future a second part of this came up when i visited the industrial estate at gaza this is the proudest economic achievement of the palestinian authority and is a site where american aid has been successful in creating a desalinization plant to provide industrial quality water and some drinking quality water for industry at a site which if everything works out well should employ 20 000 palestinians there is however one thing that keeps this site from being as effective as it could be attracting the kind of investment that it would want and of course i hope this site goes further but there should be a second avenue toward palestinian employment in the industrial sectors and that would be an industrial site on the israeli side of the border designed to provide investors with israeli levels of security israeli government israeli levels of assurance that there will never be an expropriation israeli levels of assurance that the currency will always be convertible all of the reasons that investors prefer to invest in developed countries and at the same time be accessible by palestinian workers who would come to work there without necessarily having access to the rest of israel imagine the opportunity to invest in an area where you have a developed countrys government and of course corruption exists in all governments but much less in developed countries than in most developing countries israeli level security israeli level absence of corruption and the risk of corruption or the belief that there might be corruption even if the palestinian authority is able to create a corruptionfree government it will always suffer from the general belief of investors that a third world country is more difficult to do business in than a developed country imagine all of the benefits of investing in a developed country and at the same time having access to the american markets through the unitedstates israel free trade agreement and at the same time having access to israeli technology and engineers and business acumen and at the same time having access to low cost industrial labor provided by the palestinians i should point out that we will see future developments that the palestinians may be eager to have industrial jobs today with israel providing some of the more technological expertise i am confident that if we are able to achieve peace in the middle east the palestinians will develop their own industrial and engineering expertise it is written nowhere in any sacred text that the palestinians will always live in a third world country or third world economy we now want to shift our attention to our relationships with china in focusing on china we see three abominations the first is chinese policy toward proliferation wherever we see the risk of proliferation whether it be in iran or pakistan or north korea there is evidence that china has provided either nuclear weapons or the technology to build them or missiles or the technology to build missiles certainly china cannot enjoy the friendly relations with the united states which it seeks if it is going to be the source of such dangerous proliferation the second abomination is chinas work on human rights where human rights activists were arrested so very recently in another step backward for china finally but i think most importantly is chinas adverse impact on human rights in the united states through its decision to avoid importing from america china sends us 66 billion of exports one cannot go into any store and not find goods made in china yet china accepts only 11 billion of american exports 66 billion to 11 billion is arguably the most lopsided trading relationship in the history of mankind and womankind 66to11 sometimes that means unitedstates workers lose their jobs because chinese imports come in and take those jobs away sometimes though the goods being imported from china could not be profitably manufactured here in the united states but i would argue that if we bought our tennis shoes from india if we bought our garments from bangladesh that if 100 toy companies could be formed in the caribbean that these caribbean countries that bangladesh that india would be recycling those dollars into the united states that they would be buying billions of dollars of our goods if we would be buying additional billions of dollars of their goods not even necessarily on a barter or quid pro quo basis but any economic development in a free country means that the citizens and businesses are free to buy american the trade deficit we have with china is not the product of free economic decisions it is not necessarily the product of any law that the chinese government has published it is a result of oral instructions unprovable to major chinese enterprises to buy american last those who would say the solution is to admit china into the world trade organization must ask themselves what chinese enterprise would buy american goods if a local communist party commissar said orally in a telephone conversation we know we have changed the law we know that it is legal to buy these american goods without tariffs we had to change the law but mr chinese businessman the commissar could easily say if you decide to buy american goods you will be sent to the reeducation camp what could we do bring a charge before the wto this would be a situation and it happens now and would happen in the future until the chinese government agrees that a country that they sell 66 billion of goods to must be a country they are willing to buy 66 billion of goods from the problem we have in this house is what lever do we use to try to force a strong bargalning position i would point out that we are in an amazingly strong bargaining position if we could just go without tennis shoes for a month if we could just satisfy our need for toys elsewhere for a month the chinese economy would be brought to its knees and we would have the kind of negotiations that we need instead we cannot even threaten china with the possibility that we would play fairly and expose them to anything like the trade barriers that our products are subject to the administration unfortunately will not bargain hard and the only device available to us here is to deny most favored nation status to china and that is too draconian a penalty what we need to do is make it clear that if we deny most favored nation status to china that at least the first year or two or three of that denial that we will not adopt all and to the full extent the taxes and tariffs on chinese goods that such an action would call for clearly we do not need to treat chinese goods the way we treat goods from cuba or north korea or libya or other countries that do not enjoy most favored nation status we will never have the votes on this floor to impose that level of tariff on chinese goods so what we must do and i had an opportunity to talk to our colleague the gentleman from new jersey about this and it will be an unusual combination if i and the gentleman from new jersey ever do anything together is provide by statute and even if it is vetoed its meaning would be clear that if and when we deny most favored nation status to china that we would expose its goods to only 20 percent of the tariffs otherwise applicable by that decision so for example if china can import into the united states a pair of tennis shoes with only a one dollar tariff given the fact that china enjoys mfn status and in the absence of mfn status the tax would be 11 which would cripple chinas ability to send those tennis shoes to the united states that we would provide that in the first year of mfn denial the tariff would be only the tariff applicable to mfn countries plus ten percent of the additional tariff imposed on nonmfn countries in this example we would add one dollar of tariff to the dollar we place now on chinese tennis shoes and then a year later we would add another dollar and after that perhaps another dollar so that the immediate effect on unitedstates chinese trade is substantial but not so enormous that members of this congress are unwilling to vote for it i look forward to working with as many of my colleagues as are interested to craft some mechanism to deprive china of some of the benefits that it enjoys under mfn the gentleman from new jersey had an interesting bill to at least deny mfn to those products made in enterprises owned by the peoples libervation army and while that is i think a good thing for us to do i would point out that we cannot count on china to properly identify for us which enterprises are so owned and which enterprise manufactured which goods i would now turn our attention to the budget and comment on the current debate as to who deserves credit for our booming economy today is it the federal reserve board and its chairman alan greenspan or the political system chiefly president clinton i would argue that it is the latter mr greenspan has done an outstanding job and shown tremendous capacity but what he has done is pretty much the same as his predecessors would have done the same as most i would say all mainstream economists would have called upon him to do there is no particular genius in knowing that interest rates can be low and inflation rates will be kept low if we run a declining federal deficit or better yet a surplus at the federal level for many years those of us concerned with the unitedstates economy for many years mainstream economists have said that it would not take a genius to give us low interest rates and low inflation rates if we had fiscally responsible management of the federal government and then they would go on to say but of course that is politically impossible under president clintons leadership we have done the impossible we have shown that democracy can be fiscally responsible keep in mind the new euro that was adopted in europe in order to join this new currency the rule was that european countries and they all had a very hard time meeting this standard would have to have a national deficit of only 3 percent of their gross national product not a single european country even thought of running a surplus in its national government for any democracy to not cut taxes all the way to running a huge deficit to not increase spending at least until the outer limits of a possible deficit are reached for any democracy to say no to those who want to spend money and no or not very much to those who want to cut taxes requires a level of political genius seen in only one place in the world in recent decades and that is here in washington now i would point out that at the beginning of 1998 our republican colleagues suggested an 800 billion let me stress this an 800 billion tax cut over i believe a 5year period a tax cut of almost a trillion dollars had we adopted that provision we might have been popular for a day or a week or a month but in fact we would have crippled this outstanding economic recovery now i am for tax cuts when we were able to say no to a trillion dollars worth of tax cuts and instead what was before this house was 80 billion less than onetenth of what had been proposed before i voted for it and i hope that we have some genuine tax cuts that we can actually afford keep in mind a decision to vote for 80 billion in tax cuts instead of 800 billion in tax cuts is 720 billion of saying no to our own constituents and that is something we need to have the courage to do i hope in a minute to talk about the nature of the kind of tax cut that we would adopt but i want to point out that there has been agreement that we should save 62 percent of the upcoming surplus for social security reaching agreement on that is not enough we need our colleagues on the republican side of the aisle to agree that we reserve 15 percent of the surplus for medicare because it does our seniors little good to tell themthat social security is safe until the year 2055 and of course we should reach a way to say 2075 but even saying that social security is safe until 2055 rings hollow unless we can make sure that medicare is there too another element of the budget that i think is very important and for which i praise the president is dealing with the land and water conservation fund we have a number of special funds that are part of the federal government we have a transportation fund it is funded with tax dollars paid by motorists when they buy gasoline we assured those taxpayers we would spend the money for road improvements and repair and for many years until last year we cheated them out of that promise by spending less out of the transportation fund and using that to hide the deficit we were running in the general fund we finally are treating the transportation fund as a separate sacrosanct fund we have a social security fund it is funded by employer and employee contributions that are to be used exclusively for social security that fund needs to be sacrosanct and used for those purposes and least known of the three special funds i will mention is the land and water conservation fund it is funded out of federal royalties from offshore oil drilling and takes in roughly 900 million a year for many years we spent only a tiny fraction of the land and water conservation fund on its intended purpose keep in mind when that fund was created in 1965 it was a grand compromise and an outstanding deal it said that if our environment is going to be impaired by offshore oil drilling as it is in various places and should not be but it is then the funds that result from that should be used to preserve our environment in other places and should be set aside to buy land to conserve our heritage well when i first got to congress only 14 percent of the funds being taken in by the land and water conservation fund were used to buy our precious lands to protect them from development and to give something to our children i am very proud of the fact that in 1998 this house spent virtually all of the land and water conservation fund to acquire critically needed lands and now as we look to the first budget of the new millennium we must keep faith with the law that established the land and water conservation fund and we should applaud the president for presenting us with a budget that provides for enormous surpluses that safeguards social security and medicare and at the same time allows us to spend nearly a billion dollars in preserving our land for posterity i especially want to complement the president for including within that 5 million to preserve the santa monica mountains by buying critically necessary tracts within those mountains for my colleagues edification i will point out that one out of every 17 americans not one out of every 17 southern californians not one out of 17 californians oneseventeenth of all americans live within an hours drive of the santa monica mountains national recreation area there is no better investment in not just recreational opportunities but the chance to get out into nature and unwind for oneseventeenth of the country than to preserve the santa monica mountains we need to do that one parcel at a time one fiscal year at a time until the land acquisition plan is fully implemented to do less would be to turn to southern californians and say if you want to unwind fine drive to yellowstone and after a thousand miles of hectic travel you can unwind in americas most premier national february 2 1999 park we need to have national parks close to where people live we have one in the santa monica mountains while i am focusing on local issues i should also point out the most important transportation need of the southern california area and that is dealing with the intersection of the san diego freeway and the ventura freeway the 405 and the 101 i want to applaud our state government for beginning a 10 to 15 million plan to provide some immediate quick fixes and one additional lane in order to deal with the huge snarl of traffic at that interchange but these quick fixes and moderate amounts of expenditures will not be enough to solve the problem i want to thank secretary rodney slater for providing for a halfmilliondollar study of what can be done to deal with this intersection and the transition roads that have to accommodate almost half a million cars every day i would like to use the last 10 minutes of my presentation and i thank the house for giving me this much time to focus on one particular type of tax cut that i hope will have bipartisan support and that is the need to reform our estate tax laws to dramatically reduce the amount of estate planning the length of documents and the literal legal torture that we put our elderly and our nearelderly through as a result of an estate planning process that yields virtually no revenue from the middleclass and upper middleclass individuals who need to go through the process let me describe that process briefly we have an estate tax that reaps i believe 17 billion in revenue for this country it is designedto get revenue from the wealthy as great wealth passes from one generation to another we designed the law so that a married couple could leave 1 2 million to their children with no tax at all that is the tax policy that we have established 1 2 million taxfree but we adopted that tax policy in a bizarre way and when i say by the way 1 2 million that number is going to be ratcheted up over the next decade to a total of 2 million depending upon of course when people die and that estate tax becomes applicable in my presentation here i will use the oldfigures the 600 000 figures and the 1 2 million figures that is to say how is it that current law provides for that 1 2 million exemption it provides a 600 000 exclusion to each of the two spouses so what do they have to do to take advantage of this 1 2 million exemption they have to write a long complicated estate planning document and bypass trust so that when the first spouse dies that first spouse does not just leave all the family assets to the surviving spouse oh no that would trigger an estate tax of major proportion when the second spouse dies instead the first spouse to die must leave 600 000 in a trust for the benefit of the surviving spouse the effect is virtually the same but the legal complexities are enormous first just drawing the instrument is a 1 000 to 3 000 legal fee tax imposed on any couple that believes that when the second of them to dies it is possible that their assets will exceed 600 000 and given the possibility that homes in southern california would go up in value with the same rapidity next decade as they did last decade every middleclass married couple sees that as at least a possibility keep in mind those who fail to go through this excruciating estate planning process and i will describe why i think it is excruciating because i have lived it are told well if the second spouse dies there will be a quarter of a million dollars of extra federal tax that you could have avoided a quartermilliondollar penalty on the family for falling to go through this complicated estate planning process but the estate planning process is not over it seems to be over but it is not overwhen the trust is documented and the couple leaves the lawyers office with a 50page document because there will come a time when the first spouse dies and at that point complicated legal steps need to be taken so that assets are put into the trust and other assets are assigned to the widow or widower and then every year thereafter that trust has got to fill out a separate income tax return assets have to be kept separate imagine trying to explain for the 20th time to a 95yearold widow or widower how some assets they have control over and are in trust which they are only allowed to touch under certain circumstances but get the income under other circumstances and other assets are in a different trust why do we afflict americas elderly especially our widows and widowers with the need to be in these bypass trusts now i am not talking here by the way of the living trusts that are established toavoid probate inmany of our states those are genuinely simple but built within so many of them are these bypass trusts created not to avoid probate but created to deal with very complicated tax laws what we should do instead is provide that when the first spouse dies they can leave all the assets or some portion of them to the surviving spouse and any unused portion of the unified credit the in effect 600 000 exemption goes to the surviving spouse in the simplest plan this would mean when the first spouse died all of the assets could go to the widow or widower when the widow or widower passes on later 1 2 million would be exempt from tax and the rest would be subject to tax this is the same tax effect that most couples will be faced with i just think they should be able to reach it without living with these trusts throughout the widowhood or widowerhood of the surviving spouse now the joint tax committee has informed me that they believe that this kind of change would deprive the federal government of a billion dollars a year in revenue for those who want to see a significant estate tax reduction that is a strong reason to join me in this proposed estate tax change but i would argue that that billiondollar reduction in revenue is almost entirely illusory because the bill as i would propose it would provide tax benefits no greater than any married couple could get simply by visiting a lawyer and paying a 1 500 legal fee the vast majority of couples with assets of over 600 000 will do just that and as a result they will obtain through complication the tax savings that i would like to provide through simplicity i look forward to working with the staff of the joint tax committee to get a more reasonable revenue estimate of this estate tax simplification and i look forward to working with as many of my colleagues who are interested in crafting legislation to try to simplify the life of every middleclass and upper middleclass widow and widower in this country i want to thank the chair for extending so much time i want to thank my colleagues for their patience in allowing me to get so many matters off my chest"], [1.2755393981933594e-05, 0.9999872446060181, 1, "a few minutes ago i became aware that this hour of time to speak before this house was available i

take this opportunity even though i have not had the chance to prepare and my remarks may not be quite as crisp as i would like i would like to address a number of different topics that i have been thinking about particularly over this last district work period the first is an odd attempt by those who claim to love ronald reagan to rewrite the history of the fall of the soviet union we know what the real history was the soviet union looked powerful we spent on our defense fearful of soviet aggression and expansion and ronald reagan led us in those efforts our deficit grew we tightened our belts domestically we did so because we were told that the soviet union could expand that it was powerful that it could emerge as the most powerful nation on earth in 1991 to the surprise of just about everyone both inside and outside the soviet union the soviet union began to collapse that is what really happened it is kind of disconcerting to think that all the experts in all the capitals did not foresee such an enormously important event and experts are reluctant to admit that they cannot always see the future but what is worse is that those who have come to idolize ronald reagan have started to rewrite history in their rewriting of history ronald reagan foresaw as early as the early 1980s that within a decade the soviet union could be pushed into the dust bin of history that reagan knew that the soviet union had begun to corrode from the inside and far from being a challenge to the united states in fact it was a nation that could not survive these supposed supporters of ronald reagan ascribe to him an omniscience and allknowingness that they think is complimentary in fact what these supporters of reagan are doing are besmirching ronald reagans character attacking his honesty and telling us that our former president is a liar to the american people time and again president reagan came before us in this hall i was not here stood and delivered the state of the union address and rallied america to spend more and more on our defense e0 2100 he never told us it was offense he said it was necessary to prevent soviet expansion not some secret plan to force the soviet union into collapse ronald reagan came before the american people and told us the soviet union was a powerful threat and would remain so for quite some time he urged us to embark upon military expenditure projects some of which would last a decade or 2 decades because he told us the soviet union was a threat now those who claim to be ronald reagans ideological descendants some who claim to be his friends tell us it was all a lie that ronald reagan knew that the soviet union had corroded from the inside that he knew that these expenditures were not necessary to defend us but rather were part of a secret plan to force the soviet union to spend more and more on its defense in a dangerous game in which the soviet union would be faced either with the prospect of launching a nuclear strike or consenting to an arms race that it could not win an arms race launched against it by a reagan administration with a secret plan to drive it into destruction ronald reagan never told us that we were engaged in such an effort ronald reagan never told us that we were trying to push the soviet union to destruction that they would face a moment at which they would blame us and would realize that either they would launch a military strike or go into the dustbin of history he never told us this because he never believed it and the soviet union in its dying hours did not believe it either the soviets knew that their system collapsed of its own weight only retroactive american arrogance would say that the other superpower collapsed because of something we did here in washington d c the fact of the matter is communism does not work and in the last decade or two both communist giants have ceased to embrace their ideology and without that ideology they have ceased to be exporters of communism ceased to have confidence in communism and it has shaken them to their roots are we going to say that communism lost favor in the soviet union because of american hostility and communist ideology lost favor in china because of american friendship that either friendship or hostility from america creates the same result i think not communism does not work russia and china realized it this forced a crisis of confidence in both places the soviet union not being one nation but rather an amalgam of nations held together by a failed ideology collapsed and china has moved from the ideology of communism to the ideology of nationalism overseen by a relatively small group of oligarchs and local potentates that control the economy to say that it all happened according to a plan is to dangerously rewrite history while i talk about the reagan administration and the collapse of the soviet union it leads naturally to a discussion of star wars an issue that is still before us just because the soviet union is no longer intact does not mean that we are safe in fact the world is more complicated and more dangerous there are those who have come before this house and suggested that the world does not have to be a dangerous place if only we developed a missile defense system now i would like to see us continue to research in this area and when our technology has advanced to the point where we can provide some reasonable defense at reasonable cost deployment is certainly called for but let us not fool the american people those that cannot hit us with an icbm those who cannot hit us with an intercontinental ballistic missile will be able to smuggle nuclear weapons into our cities no matter how effective our missile shield a nuclear weapon is about the size of a person some smaller than a child and anyone who has been in southern california or probably just about any major city in this country is aware that every year hundreds of thousands every day thousands of illegal immigrants are snuck across our border not just from the southern border but the northern as ell that illegal drugs are smuggled into america with relative ease and this is by people being paid a few hundred dollars to sneak a person into the united states marijuana importers or smugglers criminals bringing in bales of marijuana for a few thousand dollars in compensation how difficult would it be to sneak a nuclear weapon into an american city a nuclear weapon smaller than a child does not need ventilation does not need to be fed children who are smuggled into america scream and cry nuclear weapons would not so imagine that we had a perfect defense against iranian or iraqi or north korean missiles what would those countries do they would smuggle a weapon or two into an american city hire or kidnap an american scientist to come look at it detain that american scientist until it could be moved to another apartment or another city and inform our government that in some apartment in some city in some state in this country there was a nuclear weapon in the custody of someone reporting to baghdad or to tehran i would like to see a defensive shield shielding us from intercontinental ballistic missiles but let us not fool the american people that is just one small element of our defense and if we spend a trillion dollars building a roof over a building that has no walls we will have been misallocating resources i am not sure that we can police our borders well enough to prevent nuclear weapons from being smuggled here but i do know that a missile defense shield is of only modest use as long as our borders remain porous we need to focus our attention on the rogue states that are currently developing nuclear weapons and might be willing to use them even if they faced the threat of annihilation from our nuclear weapons and we need to cut off money investment funds from going to the regimes of north korea iran and iraq because all three of those countries are trying to develop nuclear weapons north korea has agreed to stop its program and i leave them aside we can discuss them separately at a different time but let us focus for a while on the two great enemies or rivals that we face in southwest asia we do need to prevent the government in baghdad and the government in tehran from getting their hands on money when investment capital flows into those two countries when money is loaned to them money is given to them export markets are given to them when iraq is allowed to sell its oil and not spend the money on food for its people then money is in the hands of those who would wish to develop nuclear weapons and whom as i have pointed out will face little difficulty in smuggling them into the united states unfortunately our efforts to stem the flow of money to tehran and baghdad have been set back in several different ways today mr speaker it was revealed that iran having suffered hundreds of thousands of casualties in a war of aggression launched by iraq 2 decades ago now is allowing iraq to use its coastal waters to evade the u n blockade evade u n sanctions sell a billion dollars perhaps every year of oil and this would not be money in the oilforfood program controlled by the united nations this is money directly into the hands of the iraqi military we could spend a trillion dollars on a missile defense system but if we do not stop those oil tankers from leaving the strait of hormuz if we do not prevent that oil from being exported we are literally allowing saddam hussein to build nuclear weapons and then we can worry about how to keep them out of the united states what concerns me is that our policy toward iran has been ineffective the ineffectiveness is shown today by iran allowing that iraqi oil to be exported now we are told that the ships that come from iran down into the persian gulf pass a checkpoint controlled by the revolutionary guard we are told the revolutionary guard does not report to the president of iran and so we should not get bent out of shape if they allow those oil tankers into their coastal waters the fact remains that in iran the president is not the head of their government or military the supreme leader is that leader controls those revolutionary guards and those guards have allowed those tankers to use iranian coastal waters iran has said well we need help in stopping these ships all iran has to do is announce that those countries that are enforcing the u n blockade are allowed into iranian coastal waters allowed within 12 miles of its coast and we will be able to shut down these illegal iraqi oil exports but instead iran lets the tankers go by the checkpoint and claims they cannot do anything to stop it and will not let united nations ships or rather american and british ships detailed to enforce the u n blockade will not allow them in their coastal waters this is a dangerous situation and it shows that our policy toward iran especially in the last 2 months has been mistaken two months ago the secretary of state announced unilaterally without really much consultation with congress at all certainly without any congressional encouragement or approval the secretary of state announced that the united states would allow iran to export to the united states pistachios carpets caviar dried fruit and many people joked how important could that be first it is symbolically important because if america will do business with iran business as usual if america will open its markets to these nonenergy exports of iran then how can we turn to europe and japan and tell them not to do business as usual with iran on a bigger scale how can we today turn to japan and germany and tell them to stop buying iranian oil because iran is clearly complicit in the illegal export of iraqi oil certainly it weakens our position these exports these nonenergy exports from iran are important to iran they are its major nonenergy exports they pale into insignificance in dollar amount compared to oil but reflect on this iran will always get the world price for its oil nothing we do is going to change by one penny the amount of revenue iran gets for every barrel that it exports to a world thirsty for its oil in contrast those other exports the carpets pistachios et cetera those exports need every market they can find to try to push up the price and by opening up our markets we invigorate the world market for those iranian exports exports as to which there is no fixed world price exports that are important to the iranian economy some 5 million people it is reported work in the iranian carpet industry that is just one of the four imports we would think that today the state department would react react to these illegal shipments through iranian waters and cut off irans access to americas markets my fear is that that will not happen every time there is an opportunity to make a unilateral concession to iran we seem to do it and do it quickly unilateral concession after unilateral concession the latest pat on the back that iran has received is a 231 million loan from the world bank the unitedstates voted against that loan but we certainly did not tell our european allies that we would take their votes in favor of that loan as a reason to perhaps reexamine other aspects of our foreign policy we were good losers we accepted the defeat this calls into question how we provide foreign aid i have come to this floor in the past to support american foreign aid i think we should do what we can to help the third world develop to help the poorest people on this planet survive but the recent action by the world bank threatens americas support for foreign aid that support is not all that deep to begin with but how do we go back to our districts and explain that america participates in the world bank its capital was provided in significant part by the american taxpayer and the world bank disbursed 231 million of loans to iran money that is fungible money that allows the iranians to spend their oil resources and oil revenues on their military programs this is going to be a hard sell sometime this month we will be dealing with the foreign ops appropriations bill at that point we will be asked to appropriate hundreds of millions of dollars to the ida program administered by the world bank we have to be aware that money of the united states disbursed to that program could be lent on a concessionary basis could be lent at very low interest rates payuswhenyoufeellikeit terms to such countries as north korea or sudan or any other country that claims to have a good project and is very poor north korea and sudan are very poor because of the evil of their governments not because of a lack of world aid how are we going to go back to our constituents and say these hundreds of millions of dollars were turned over to an international organization free to make loans to some of the most evil nations or evil governments i want to stress evil governments on this planet better we appropriate these same funds and i do not want to see a reduction i want to see if anything an increase in our foreign aid and provide these same funds to entities under the control of the united states government or entities where we at least have a veto power so these funds are loaned or given only for projects in countries that have some minimal respect for human rights i look forward to working with members of the relevant subcommittee and of the committee on appropriations to see what we can do to make sure that when we go back to our districts and defend foreign aid we can say that all unitedstates tax dollars are going for projects in countries that we can support this is an additional reason why the loan to iran was not only a poor decision but one that was illtimed as well not only does iran today a few days after the loan decide to facilitate iraqi evasion of u n sanctions not only does iran sponsor terrorism and is on the state department terrorism list not only is iran along with iraq one of the two greatest threats for possible destruction of american cities at such time as they develop nuclear weapons but iran a year and a half ago decided to continue its oppression of its small jewish community just as it oppresses those of the bahai faith the iranian government since its revolution has executed on trumped up charges 17 members of its small jewish community well over half of that community has fled and now 13 jews are on trial in the city of shiraz on the most trumped up charges in trials that would have made josef stalin ashamed trials where the only evidence is the apparently tortured or coerced confessions of the defendants in which the defendants confessed to crimes they could not possibly have committed here in the united states we live in a multiethnic multicultural society in which people of any ethnic or religious group may be found in our national security agencies and yes may be found among those few who commit espionage we have had britishamerican spies we have had jewishamerican spies we have allegedly had chineseamerican spies anybody of any ethnic group could find themselves in a position where they are the custodians of our national secrets iran is just the opposite no one of the jewish faith is allowed near anything of any military or national security significance whatsoever these 13 are accused of spying for the cia and i put forward that we could not be the worlds only superpower we could not have emerged in this powerful position if our cia went to iran looking for spies and decided to hire people from the small ethnic group that are prohibited from getting anywhere near any of the information our cia might be interested in these charges are absurd the world bank loan to iran as this trial continues was the kind of mistake that imperils american support for foreign aid and american support for the world bank and imperils a relationship that has recently been celebrated by the president in his farewell tour farewell as president tour of europe involving ties that are certainly disrupted when european nations say we will ignore the trial of the 13 jews in shiraz we will ignore irans other problems and when they will force the world bank to take american capital and money borrowed on the strength of american capital and hijack that xnoney to tehran i would now like to shift my focus to a bill that will come before this house i believe on friday and that is a bill to repeal the estate tax at the outset let me stress that 98 percent of all americans when their wills become operative do not pay a penny of estate tax this is a tax paid by only 1 percent of all the families in america yet to read some of the lebters to listen to some of the rhetoric on this floor we would think that the estate tax was the most burdensome tax on american working families estates of under 2 million will after the current law becomes hopefully effective pay absolutely nothing as long as some law and estate planning documents are drafted in advance i introduced a bill that made this law i think less burdensome on upper middle class american families and said that 2 million could be left by a man and wife or a husband and wife to their children with no estate tax even if they did not prepare a bunch of estate planning documents in advance this bill was designed to liberate widows and widowers from these bypassed trusts complicated legal documents almost required of them by our current estate tax law but that bill did not get a hearing because there is an effort here not to liberate upper middle class families and of course those of lesser means are already exempt but not to liberate upper middle class families from the estate tax and from the burdens of doing estate planning the plan here is to abolish this estate tax altogether the estate tax is a painful tax it is a bad tax i hate the tax i hate all taxes every single one of them is painful there is no way for the federal government to get money that does not have a bad effect on those who are required to pay the question is not whether the estate tax is a bad tax but whether it is our worst tax i ask members is a tax that 98 percent of all americans are exempt from is that our worst tax or is it an income tax and a fica tax that falls so heavily on the working poor must we first eliminate a tax that falls chiefly on those with estates over 10 million or must we first eliminate taxes on those who are making 10 an hour or less should it be 10 million and more or 10 an hour or less where should we focus our generosity where should we focus our tax cuts there is an earned income tax credit but it is not available to many of the working poor and is not available to any that do not have children in their homes so we have a situation where we are told that the estate tax diminishes the incentive to work because somebody working at age 40 or age 50 or age 60 is thinking ahead to the point when their estate plan would become effective in their eighties or nineties thinking ahead to what the estate tax law might be at that point knocking off work early and going to the golf course maybe it is happening maybe it is not but let us talk also about the effect that our current taxes have on the working poor people who are called upon to work the second job to support a family people who are called upon to get off of welfare and to enter the work force and we tell them we are going to take a chunk of your money of your paycheck to support the social security system and i support the social security system we are going to impose an income tax we are not going to give you a tax credit for the social security tax you pay and we will give you no tax credit for the state sales tax that you pay people who make less than 10 an hour are paying a lot of tax what about them are they affected by incentives are we to say that the ability to leave the second 10 million to your kids 20 or 30 years from now is what is uppermost on the minds of somebody building a business but that the size of todays paycheck is irrelevant to a person who is working two jobs i do not think so yes all taxes have an adverse impact on incentive the incentive to work the incentive to participate in the economy but i venture that there is a far worse effect on our economy from taxing those who make less than 10 an hour than taxing those who have more than 10 million i would also point out that before we cut the estate tax before we eliminate the estate tax we ought to make sure that we are not endangering social security that we are not putting ourselves in a position when we will not be able to provide any pharmaceuticals to those who are on medicare some who need 1 000 5 000 10 000 a year of pharmaceuticals to survive they retired believing they had social security and now find that they are insecure find that they do not have the wherewithal to pay for the pharmaceuticals that they need to survive what will come before this house on friday is a bill to repeal the estate tax before we have made social security secure before we have made medicare recipients secure every medicare recipient today knows that tomorrow they could be diagnosed with a disease requiring 5 000 or 10 000 a year of pharmaceuticals for which they will get no federal aid and we are told that the most important thing we can do with the available federal funds is to deal with a tax that falls most significantly on those with more than 10 million i suggest that we need to explore a number of avenues now i do not want to ignore the adverse effects of the estate tax it does make it more difficult to leave a business or a family farm to the next generation and we hear statistics about how businesses are not always left intact to the next generation and we are told that it is the estate tax it is not always the estate tax the son or daughter of a farmer does not necessarily want to farm the owner who builds a business from nothing to a 50 million business may find that his sons and daughters feel themselves unqualified or just disinterested in continuing to own that business there is no proof that family businesses will stay in families if only we reduce taxes on those with assets of over 10 million finally one little secret about the estate tax no one will tell it to us that is that at every major hospital complex nonprofit hospital at every major university in this country if we abolish the estate tax the buildings will not have names i am not saying that we will not be able to find our way around campus that is not the problem the problem is that gifts major gifts to our universities and hospitals will slow to a trickle if we go to any campus today we see this building is named after the smith family and that building is named after the cohen family and we wonder why the answer is simple the families involved made huge gifts to the university huge gifts to the hospital motivated in part by the fact that those gifts will not be subject to the estate tax charitable giving at the low end the 5 and 10 put in the collection plate would not be affected by a repeal of the estate tax but at the high end when people are bequeathing millions of dollars to universities that in their graciousness choose to name buildings after the donors at the high end where people make gifts that are income tax deductible in their 80s knowing that not only do they get an income tax deduction today but perhaps if they die in their 90s they get estate tax relief as well those gifts are motivated by the fact that 60 or 70 percent of the gifts value is represented by a tax deduction that 5 million smith building cost the smith family only 30 percent of 5 million what is going to happen when we repeal the estate tax the universities and hospitals will be here saying now congress you have to appropriate some special money for us but how will we do that we will cut our own revenues by 17 billion a year the colleges the universities the hospitals will not come here and tell us about this because essentially they do not want to bite the hand that feeds them speaking of the hand that feeds them i have had a lot of town halls in my district i have heard hundreds of questions hundreds of complaints i am out in the community almost every day that i am in california at these public gatherings i cannot remember a single occasion when someone has come up and said let us abolish the estate tax i hate to admit it but it is a sin of which virtually everyone in this house suffers or is guilty i also spend time raising money for my campaign and for the campaigns of my colleagues not a day goes by or not even a couple hours go by if a couple of hours are spent talking to those who might make major contributions the estate tax comes up every time not with every person but certainly in every hour or two the reason for that is that this tax does fall upon those who can most afford to come to fundraisers i think that we in this house need to pass campaign finance reform for a lot of reasons but one of them is that we spend too much time at fundraisers and we hear too often too repeatedly from that 12 percent of americans who pay the estate tax who happen to be the same 12 percent of americans who donate the most money for political campaigns if we do not stop and think about it if we do not filter it out we are going to come to the conclusion if one serves in this house that the whole country is concerned about the estate tax because in the average month we hear about it five 10 20 times we have to remember that every one of those times was not out at the community little league was not at a visitation to a senior center was not at a widely publicized town hall but in nine out of 10 cases or maybe 10 out of 10 cases it was through a friend that is a supporter of either us or our colleagues here yes if we serve in this house we need to keep in touch with people and sometimes that is thrown askew when the fundraising burdens and the time commitments of that are imposed upon us i would like to comment just briefly on governor bushs social security plan and some of the rhetoric surrounding that plan governor bush has turned to young people and said that they onlyget a 1 or 2 percent return for the money they put in social security what he has not said is that the first two generations to participate in social security did incredibly well social security brought us out of the depression as much as any program and the first two generations to participate in that program contributed for only a portion of their working lives and received the benefits benefits that many are still receiving today in their 80s and 90s so what does this mean it means that todays social security tax is paying for our grandparents retirement this was never a pension system where our money is saved exclusively for us rather our money is being used to fund the retirement of those who went before just as their money went to fund the retirement of those who went before and we can trace it back to the depression generation now we are told that the new generation does not have to contribute to pay for the previous generations retirement we are going to have their money diverted into separate individual accounts and that anything else would be unfair we cannot simultaneously take all the funds that are coming into social security and say that is the money of the people who put the money in and continue to fund the so6ial security payments to those who are receiving checks today people whose tax dollars fica contributions were used to pay the prior generations benefits the proposal that the governor has put forward is to take onesixth of the money virtually that is now going into the regular social security trust fund and divert it into special assets owned by those who contribute the funds i wish we could promise that i wish we could do that but before we start bestowing multitrillion dollar benefits new benefits why do we not make sure that the program can continue to pay the existing benefits another huge benefit promised by the governor of texas is that if one were to die before reaching 65 their family gets a huge check from social security or if they were to die at age 68 or 69 or 70 before they have received their actuarial expected benefit the family receives a giant benefit that is a wonderful promise i wish i could make that promise i would be a lot more popular if i made that promise but what do we do to those who live to 90 or 100 do we say that those who live less than their average life span get their money back and those that live longer than the average life span stop receiving benefits there is no solution offered by the governor of texas two huge benefits promised nosource of revenue to pay for them a sixth roughly of the money diverted let us make social security secure and then we can focus on whether we can do better i have talked about a number of topics topics that are complex topics that i do not get enough time to study about read about and it leaves me longing for a greater level of intelligence there are those working on greater levels of intelligence today there are those engaged in silicon chip engineering who are creating more intelligent machines all the time and there will come a time when the silicon chipdriven machines rival humans in intelligence there are genetic engineers mapping the human genome and within a few decades they may be in a position to create a more intelligent human being perhaps one that could have dealt with all of the topics confronting this congress with greater wisdom than i have been able to muster there are those dealing with nanotechnology technology where things are manipulated at the atomic and molecular levels technologies that offer a chance to engineer either from biological materials or from electronic materials or from a combination of the two a level of intelligence way beyond todays computers way beyond todays animals and perhaps way beyond todays humans speaking of intelligent humans on august 7 1939 albert einstein wrote to president roosevelt and brought to his attention clearly and crisply the importance that nuclear technology might have for the future of the world in just a few years that nuclear technology literally exploded what was the high and unusual science of 1939 became the public policy issue of 1945 and beyond we today are still wrestling with the political the international and the ethical issues of nuclear power and of course nuclear weapons would it not have been great if we had gotten a bit more of a head start would it not have been good for humankind if the scientists had come to us 20 or 30 years before the nuclear weapons were created and told the worlds political leaders that the genie will soon be leaving the bottle and it is time to develop a code of ethics and central understandings that will fit the new technology now some more than 50 years after nuclear weapons we are still struggling with the ethical issues that they create well i do not know how many years we have before what i refer to as remembered intelligence poses even more severe ethical issues for us than nuclear weapons do let me bring a few of them to our attention i know this may sound like science fiction today but i do not think anyone familiar with science would say that these are not real possibilities i am not saying this decade maybe not next decade maybe not in the lifetime of those of us who have lost our hair but certainly within the lifetime of some of the younger folks in the back of the room first we will see genetic engineering that will either create or offer to create our slaves or our masters today dogs are a mans and womans best friend they are great pets and a few of them are engaged in work shepherding sheep for example todays dogs have been bred not genetically engineered just bred to be friendly docile and obedient there are a few who think it raises ethical issues but most of us view a dogs intelligence as below that of selfawareness and consciousness and are quite happy to have dogs that are obedient docile but what happens when the genetic engineers start developing more intelligent canines what happens when we start having dogs as intelligent or more intelligence than apes fortunately i do not think we are going to face this issue in the next decade but we are going to face it this century and we are probably going to face it before we figure out what to do with it at what point must we recognize other life forms as being protected by our constitution how intelligent must a genetically engineered animal be to be worthy of our protection and respect i do not know likewise we have seen many science fiction shows where scientists start with human dna and deliberately try to create a being that is less intelligent or simply more docile than the average human form and we are told to imagine a race invented for slavery i think all of us recoil at the ethics of that but will we recoil with the same level of revulsion if the nearly as intelligent as human or perhaps as intelligent as human docile race is engineered from canine dna or simian dna perhaps someday if we are not careful human dna but not only may there be genetic engineering that invents those entities which some would wish to enslave genetic engineering whether it starts with simian dna or human dna could very well invent a level of intelligence well beyond that of any of us here perhaps even beyond that of the albert einstein i quoted earlier then how should human kind react that which can be done with genetic engineering may also be done with silicon chip engineering a book i have not had a chance to read bears the interesting title the age of spiritual machines how many decades is it before the computer screen lights up with the question am i alive why am i here should there be any ethical limitations on creating computers with intelligence not just to balance our checkbooks or to figure the trajectory of the rocket but computers intelligent enough to ask the spiritual questions i do not know i do know that it will take a panel of einsteins to give us some guidance as to what our laws should be this is going to be a tough issue i am going to propose probably next congress if i am fortunate enough to be here if there is interest by some of my colleagues perhaps we could work on it this month or next month that we create a national commission on the ethics of engineered intelligence to try to give some guidance to those lawmakers that will come after us in dealing with the issues of silicon or carbonbased intelligence that approach or exceed that of todays human being i do not know how to deal with these issues it is a tradition in this town that when one does not know what to do one creates a commission there is also a tradition in this town to wait till the last minute to wait till some development is going to impair jobs in our own districts before we get serious about the issue i would say that these are issues and there are others as well that we ought to try to tackle at least at the thinking stage at the earliest possible time"], [2.8371810913085938e-05, 0.9999716281890869, 1, "i rise today to speak about one of the most critical issues facing our nation today and that is the education of our children as a former superintendent of my states schools for 8 years in north carolina i know firsthand how important it is and i know about many of the amazing stories wonderful stories that have occurred and are occurring every single day in our public schools too many times we hear about the problems and we do not hear about the successes we tend to want to talk about those problems and not acknowledge that the majority of our children are good youngsters they do a good job they work hard our teachers are working hard and they deeply care about the young people they work with just this past weekend i had the opportunity to be with almost 100 of them in a group in north carolina and i will talk about that again in just a few minutes but i would say to my colleagues that if america is going to h1740 col seize the opportunity of this new economy we talk about the digital age that we are entering congress must provide some national leadership in this most vital effort too many times we say well it really is not a national issue we ought not to get involved in it we ought to be doing something else and education is important but it ought to be left here or there the truth is it is all of our responsibilities federal state and local and having been at the state level as a county commissioner prior to being a state legislator and a superintendent i can tell my colleagues that the bulk of the money continues to come from the local and state level it always will as it should and the decisions by and large will be made there but if we had not had programs at the federal level for children with special needs then they would not be taken care of the way they are today and we still are not funding that adequately there are a lot of other areas that we need national leadership on certainly education is one of those areas that i think that we need it there was a time in this country when we did not pay a lot of attention to roads or water and sewer and then we recognized it was an important national issue and it still is today and education is one of those across this great country the american people are calling for a greater investment in our public education system they are also calling for accountability this congress had an opportunity to do that last year and would not step up the way they should this past week we talked about the whole issue of the republican leadership and last year they dealt with it the republican leadership wanted to put together a voucher plan providing vouchers which in my opinion is not the way to improve education for all of our children it is really a joke and a hoax on most of them it will provide an opportunity for only a few and it will pump billions of dollars of tax money into financing areas that is so badly needed for our children in the public schools i happen to believe that that is absolutely wrong it would drain those resources from the public sector that is badly needed and leave too many children behind in my opinion condemned to a bleak future of failure as i was starting to say a few minutes ago with about 90 some young people high school students i was meeting with this weekend a variety of young people across our district where we were talking about the needs of what we ought to do about school violence it was amazing the answers these young people came up with one of the issues they focused on was the need for quality facilities and resources in those schools how do you tell a student that education is important when they do not get a textbook until 3 or 4 months into the year how do you tell them it is important when the toilets do not work in the bathroom how do you tell them education is important when all they have in the classroom on a fairly regular basis are substitute teachers because they do not have enough regular teachers in the classroom for a variety of reasons we are not paying them enough we are not attracting them we are not making the quality of where they work and that is where teachers work and students learn and work they have to be quality facilities that is important you can say that isnt the most important thing i would say to you if you look across this country at what we value we normally have nice buildings the buildings that we value they say a lot about what we care young people can pick that up very quickly my colleagues and i who are participating in this 1hour special order this evening we happen to have i think a better idea we want to invest in a national commitment to educational excellence whereschools are accountable to taxpayers for raising standards and every child has an opportunity to learn my colleagues who have heard me talk about this before know that i not only believe that but i have worked that as a state official and as a state legislator because if you look at north carolina you are looking at one of the school systems in this country that really is holding our system accountable and of all the states in the nation they are showing some of the highest growth in academic scores and accountability of any state in the nation it takes a total commitment on the part of everyone improving education in this country is about creating a classroom environment where children can learn and teachers can teach we need to foster greater connection between students teachers and parents and i might say the broader community schools in most communities are have been and still are that center focal point and they need to be more so in the future our schools can do better and with our help they will do better because that is where the future of america is that is where the future of our states are and where the future of our communities are they are in our classrooms today children do not know what they need many times unfortunately in school they only know what they get unfortunately in some cases they are not getting what they ought to get for a variety of reasons one of which may be the community does not have the resources to invest in other cases the community is not willing to invest those resources that in my opinion is shameful if that should happen one of the best ways that we can improve education is to help provide smaller class sizes that are orderly and disciplined and where children can get additional attention from their teachers who really can ignite that spark of learning the thing that teachers call the teachable moment when the child really gets turned on to learning as i met with those roughly 80 to 90 students this weekend and we were talking about school violence one of the issues they talked about was how do we get smaller class sizes how do we get in a class where we really know that our teachers care and gives us the time we know they care about us but she has so many students to take care of she cannot give me the individual attention that i need these were some pretty bright students as are most of our students but there are some who need that special attention to catch up and to keep up not all of us learn math as fast as others not all of us do as well on composition so there are a lot of ways that we need it but if we have smaller class sizes we can do a better job for our children i happen to believe we do a better job for ourselves because the information age of the 21st century is going to require that all of us be able whether we want to or not no matter what our age is incidentally we are going to have to be able to be on the internet we are going to have to be able to type we are going to have to be able to compose and we are going to have to send information back and forth it is so critical and so important i think one of the best ways we can do it is follow through on our commitment to reduce class sizes we started that with the presidents initiative a couple of years ago we have to fight for it every year and certainly what we do here it will set the tone for the country it is not the dollars that we need because they still are going to come at the local level but we can leverage the federal money to make a difference and i think that is important we need a new national commitment to the notion that parents in america have the right to expect that their children will have the best teacher in the world how do we do that we certainly do not do it by cutting education funding that is the first thing we do not do we do not do it by talking about how bad our teachers are we talk about how do we make them better how do we provide staff development for those teachers that are in the classroom we can do that i know as a state superintendent one of the things that once you have a tight budget one of the first things you start to see is staff development gets cut retraining of teachers no business in this country in their right mind would cut out the resources to retrain their staff especially at a time when they want to expand their product line what are we saying to our teachers and students you have got to teach technology you have got to teach math you have got to teach computer skills you have got to do composition we keep adding more on but we do not want to give them the resources to get the job done too many times we say well what we really need to do is you need as a teacher to go after school and learn how to be a better teacher that is what we do in many places in america or you do it on a weekend or you do it in the summer on your own time the last time i checked teachers are not paid 12 months of the year in most places in this country they are paid either 9 months and if they are real lucky they may get paid 10 months and spread it out we have to get serious about this business of educating our children if we are going to be serious then we have to make a new renewed national commitment to education in this country providing support for our teachers is more than just providing resources that is one of the most critical one of the toughest tasks that anyone will do i would challenge every member of the united states congress if they really think education is an easy job go in the classroom and spend a week do not go spend an hour as a visitor and walk through and smile and say im glad to be here and have someone put on a performance for you go in at 7 or 7 30 in the morning and have bus duty when you finish bus duty then you go to the classroom and you teach when you get a break you have hall duty you get through with hall duty and get ready to go to the cafeteria and your children are eating you have lunchroom duty because you stand around and watch the students and make sure the paper gets picked up and they are behaving in that depending on their age level then when you finish depending on the school you may have tutoring duties after school is over in the afternoon and oh by the way then if there is a basketball game or a football game that night you may have duties assigned to you for that oh and by the way there is not additional money for that that is just part of your duties of being a teacher thank god that we have people who are willing to do it and teach our young people when we see those yellow buses running up and down the road on the weekend they may be going to a band concert or they may be coming back from an athletic event or they may be going to a science fair or a math fair or any number of things that our young people participate in on the weekends and the teachers and staff are volunteering yes there are parents and i am grateful for those parents who take the time and are willing to do it because we need parents we need every parent engaged i have often said if every child in america had one adult mentor be it one of their parents or their grandparents or someone who really and truly was their one individual that other person that would stand up and fight for them and make sure they got in the right class they got the right attention and they were bn a track to be all that they could be it would be a different education system in america and we would have a different country but not all children have that they depend on their teachers and counselors and others to help them so rather than these things that we talk about in this congress many times many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to bash teachers want to bash education i say we ought to hold them up and help them we ought to encourage them yes we ought to challenge them and when they are wrong we ought to point it out but not always bash them because they have too tough a job and we ought not be talking about block grants because i think block grants are many times in my opinion an irresponsible way to get out of our duties of providing the true resources that are needed in the classroom and in other areas for education 0 1 815 i believe that we do not have in this country any children that we can give up nor any children we can waste america is a great country i get frustrated sometimes when i hear people talking about how great the economy is what a terrific job this country is doing and how bad our public schools are really who are most of the people who are running our industries and doing all of these jobs in america they went to the public schools of this country what we need to do is help those who are there today so we will continue to have that growth we have more young people in public schools in america today than ever in the history of this country and that is why classrooms are just bulging at the seams schools are overcrowded and overloaded i went into a school in my district just last week the school is in its third year and they have 18 trailers outside the school now that is because it is growing so rapidly the communities are growing people are moving there as i often tell people from time to time we are glad to have people moving and we are proud to have them come to our state we have a great growth economy in the research triangle park area one of the great dynamic hightech centers in america but there is something about when people move there they have a tendency to bring their children with them as they should and that puts additional pressure on our schools and local governments and that is true across america because we have a very mobile society a more mobile society today than we have ever had in history we have to make sure that our systems fit it and that we have opportunities for young people as we talk about this idea of vouchers and block grants i think we need to get that out of our vocabulary and get back to what is really important how do we help teachers how do we help children and how do we help our educational system become what it needs to be to provide for the challenges that we are going to face in the 21st century we must make every neighborhood public school in america work we must make every neighborhood public school in america work and we can if we are supportive and engage the community the business community the civic community and the parents in those schools we can make them work i have a bill and a number of my colleagues have others like the school construction bill that i have that will provide resources to the local units of government what it does is that the state governments will have it and they will not have to pay the interest that will be picked up at the federal level they only pay back the principle they decide where the schools are going to be built and how they are going to be built it will not solve the whole problem of 100plus billion that are needed for our schools for renovation and new schools but what it will do it will send a powerful signal to america that our public schools are important and we are going to engage at the federal level and we do care and we are going to make a difference i have another bill that many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have signed on to and it is entitled character education i will talk about that again in just a few minutes a third one that we are involved in on both sides of the aisle the speaker and minority leader gephardt and speaker hastert appointed 24 members on a youth violence task force i want to talk about that also in a few minutes i think these items are very important to us as we look at education and where we want to go this whole issue of character education is a critical piece and what this legislation does and let me hold up for my colleagues a chart because we have used this and we really started this in north carolina in about 1989 we did a survey at that time of our public schools we surveyed about 25 000 students and one thing we found from that survey is a large number of our students did not respect number one their fellow students and in some cases their teachers it was an alarmingly high percentage so we felt it was something we ought to do so we started out with a panel of citizens teachers superintendents judges lay people ministers and others and we came up with what we call ethics education well we did not really like what we were doing on that we kept playing with it in about 1993 we finally finalized it to be character education at the vanderbilt university and other places and came up with a number of character traits that we felt were the core issues and shared it with all of our public schools there are seven of these now the truth is that systems can enlarge on it and did the basic ones that we laid out were respect citizenship justice and fairness honesty caring responsibility and trustworthiness so what we did as we worked on our curriculum we asked that each school that was involved integrate that into their curriculum we did not want to have an additional addon for the teachers they had enough to do so what they have done is tied that into when they are teaching math when they are teaching history or science or whatever they may be teaching that day they pick out one of these characteristics and as the year goes on whichever ones they have agreed on that becomes an important part of the students curriculum and they have signs that they put in the school but let me say to my colleagues before they agree to do it the community comes in and agrees on the numbers of the different items of the character traits that they are going to use in that individual school system now normally it winds up being the whole lea and it may be depending on the size of it in north carolina anywhere from 3 000 all the way up to the biggest school system with about 110 000 but what it does is amazing we see the discipline problems go down in those schools i was in one in four oaks about a month ago talking with the principal the number of discipline problems have gone down by almost a third and the academics went up on the part of the students in that school we say well why would that happen easy when they start respecting one another they respect their teachers they understand they have a responsibility to do their homework they have a responsibility to one another they care about themselves they have citizenship responsibilities and this starts to be a part of what we are talking about there is nothing wrong with this being a part of public education as it should be of every education of a good education we get away from these issues that tend to divide us when we talk about whether or not we can have prayer in school or whether or not we can have these other issues that become constitutional issues what we ought to be talking about is something we can do something about to make a difference for children in america and make sure that our education system is the best it can be because when we talk about public education we ought not to be dealing with division we ought to be dealing with addition how do we add to what we have done to make it better for all children we have a chance in this congress now that we have some resources to make sure that social security is fixed we start paying down the debt and we invest in the future of our children and we can do it by putting resources out there and do some school construction i am going to talk about that in a minute at this time i want to yield to the gentleman from wisconsin my friend who has been a real leader in this congress who serves on the committee on education and the workforce and has been a real leader in public education because number one he knows what it takes and number two he cares about it andis committed to it"], [3.743171691894531e-05, 0.999962568283081, 1, "i know that some of my colleagues have had to rush back to their office one or two of them will hopefully join me here if they are of like mind and join in this discussion of what is the issue that is gripping america today and that is the issue of who will become the next president but more important whether we can continue to have confidence in the democratic institutions of this country now let me deal with some of the basics first the election last tuesday produced a very clear winner of the popular vote these were the results that were reported my colleagues can read the numbers here but gore re ceived almost a quarter of a million votes more than mr bush now i say a quarter million because i know that the vast majority of ballots that have yet to be counted even today are absentee ballots from the state of california i am from california it is my business to know how absentee ballots and particularly late absentee ballots are likely to come in i am confident that when those california votes are tabulated not only will mr gore have a lead of over 200 000 but a lead of 250 000 but that is the popular vote and we are a nation dedicated to the rule of law our law calls for the electoral college to operate but forthat college to operate there has to be a fair count and a fair vote in each state that is why we must turn our eyes to the state of florida where we will see a genuine contest one side in that contest is trying to seize power through political power chiefly through the power of the governorship of florida and the secretary of state of the state of florida two elected officials and is trying to malign the rule of law or rather just malign the court system which is pretty much the same thing see one can be a football coach who says i believe that football should be played by the rules but first we have got to kick all the referees off the field we all have been angry at a call by a referee i have been in stadiums where people yell kill the ref i have never quite joined in such a statement but imagine what football would be like if there were no referees or if there was an attempt to go to someone paid by one of the teams and have them arbitrate the disputes now our courts are not perfect but they are far less political let me tell my colleagues than those of us who are elected officials so i would hope that the courts of florida would ultimately and quickly resolve the issues that are before us now the main issue before us is how the votes in the counties of florida are going to be counted but before we get there i would like to focus a little bit on the ballot in palm beach county the famous butterfly ballot here is a picture of it we have all seen it it is confusing 19 000 people double punched on this ballot some of them had voted for buchanan by mistake and thought they could correct it by punching a hole for gore some of them saw two holes to the right of the democratic candidate and thought that if they wanted to vote for gore and lieberman they needed to punch both holes to the right some were simply confused by an array of arrows pointing in different directions left and right to a row of holes now it is said that the voters could have known about this ballot by looking at their sample ballot well with jut the holes this ballot tells one nothing a sample ballot comes in the names all seem to be there the people glance at it and decide who to vote for and then show up on election day to say that looking at the ballot without the holes is the same as looking at it with the holes is simply absurd but it is not enough that the ballot is confusing in fact i believe that there is a florida court decision that says that if a ballot is merely confusing the courts will not provide redress to those who were confused we are a nation of the rule of law but the florida courts were very clear when the supreme court of the state of florida ruled 2 years ago in beckstrom versus volusia county canvassing board that is volusia county canvassing board that where there is not only confusion as there clearly was in this case but also noncompliance with statutory procedures then the court must provide redress must adjust the election or allow for a new election if there is reasonable doubt as to whether the certified election expressed the will of voters and when that doubt extends to who won the election well there are more people in the cloakroom some of the times than the number of ballots that separates mr bush from mr gore in the vote in florida there is no doubt that any confusion in palm beach county could well have affected the result of the presidency of the united states there is no doubt that the ballot was confusing many on the day of the election before they realized how important it would turn out to be started complaining about that confusion there is no doubt that this ballot was in violation of florida law not just that it was confusing not just a vague law of florida that the ballot should be clear and unconfusing but two very specific statutes the first florida statute that is violated by this ballot is the one that requires that the names be on the left and the holes be on the right for every candidate for public office here as we see some of the names are on the left and the holes are on the right and sometimes the name is on the right and the hole is on the left now when one looks at that florida statute just reading through a statute book its wisdom is not all that apparent the reason for complying with the law may not be all that clear but it is by violating that law that the officials in palm beach county created the ballot that now has the whole world watching florida the second statute in florida also requires that the first ranking on the ballot the first listing and the first hole goes to the party that won the last gubernatorial election in florida that is the republican party my colleagues will notice the republican party on this butterfly ballot has the first listing and the first hole the second listing and the second hole is supposed to go to the party that came in second in the last gubernatorial election that is the democratic party as my colleagues can see well the democratic party does not have the second hole the democratic party has the third hole whether one views it as the second listing or the third listing depends upon whether one has a tendency to go from left then right or left columh and then right column but one thing is very clear this ballot does not award the second hole to the democratic party every voter in florida had the right to a ballot with the names on the left and the holes on the right every voter in florida had a right if they wanted to vote for the republican party to punch the first hole and if one wanted to vote for the democratic party for any office punch the second hole yet on this ballot the second hole is for pat buchanan that is why pat buchanan himself says that there are quite a number of votes hundreds or perhaps thousands in palm beach county alone that were registered as being for him but were not people who intended to vote for him so we are told that maybe there were not that many people confused well the number of people voting for pat buchanan in this county and in this particular precinct exceeded any imaginable count for pat buchanan even imaginable by him but there were not only the pat buchanan ballots but also those that were doublepunched now in every election there are people who just skip an office even the presidency they go in they say i do not like nader i do not like bush i do not know gore and i do not know who the workers world party is and i am not going to vote for any of them and they skip it i am not talking about people who completely skip the presidency i am talking about those who voted twice due to a confusing ballot now in the 1996 election far fewer people voted twice james baker spokesman for the bush campaign has tried to argue that there were 14 000 people who voted twice in palm beach county 4 years ago that is not just fuzzy math that is false math see that 14 000 figure is the sum of everybody in 1996 who just skipped the presidential race did not like dole did not like clinton just skipped it and those who doublepunched in fact the number who doublepunched last election was well less than half the number who doublepunched in this election this ballot was not only confusing it led to confusion so what do we do about it that needs to be determined and it needs to be determined in the courts of florida but when faced with a similar circumstance the courts have either ordered a new election or and i do not recommend this approach at all but florida courts have done it they have just statistically quote corrected the ballot count i do not think that is the way for the courts of florida to go in something as important as the presidency so i do not know whether the people of palm beach county will have their right to vote trampled upon by an illegal as well as confusing ballot and a refusal of the florida courts to grant a revote i know that that issue will not be reached for a while but before we allow our impatience with this process to govern its outcome let us remember how many americans have died for the right to vote not just in the suffragette movement not just in the civil rights movement but in every war america fought people fought and died for our democracy we can wait another week even another 2 weeks even 3 weeks in fact there is no particular rush at all on january 6 at 1 in this very room the electoral vote tallies from each of the 50 states and the district of columbia will be presented at that desk and they will be added up and tallied by the senate and the house of representatives assembled in this room on january 6 and if it takes florida till about then to be absolutely certain how its electoral college votes should be cast in a way that reflects the majority of voters what is more important our own impatience or our dedication to honor those who died to give us and to preserve for us a democracy now in talking about a revote which might be necessary in palm beach i am jumping the gun a little bit none of the candidates for president has called for such a revote because the focus now is just to accurately count the votes in the 67 counties of florida and here there has been an attempt by one politically elected partisan officeholder to thwart an accurate count that worries me i am talking about katherine harris secretary of state of florida who is also cochair of the bush campaign in florida unfortunately she seems to be wearing her hat as cochair of a campaign rather than as chief election officer because i will review all of the obstacles that have been placed by the office of the florida secretary of state in the way of an accurate vote of floridas counties i want to quote ms harris on one point ms harris is quoted as saying just a few days ago and i am reading from the palm beach post november 14 that she would be passionately interested in a federal post in foreign affairs or the arts if the governor of texas wins to that end according to this newspaper she not only campaigned for bush in florida but had gone to new hampshire where the associated press teports that she had been part of the freezin for a reason campaign of floridians flying to new hampshire to campaign for mr bush now i think it is just fine to campaign for someone to be president i did but my fear is that her selfconfessed and announced passion for a position in the bush administration is clouding her ability to carry out the prime responsibility of a states chief election officer and that is the accurate and fair conduct of elections passion for winning a post in the federal government should not control the decisionmaking process but i fear it has it is pretty well acknowledged that a manual vote is the right way to do a recount let me put to rest some of the mistaken beliefs first it is said oh this is the second recount the third recount the tenth recount not true under florida law and not at the request of the gore campaign or anybody associated with it the counties of florida did do a manual recount that is up to them the gore campaign requested only one recount in four of the 67 counties in the other counties they said fine go ahead we will not even request a re count so the gore campaign was in a position to request a recount in every county but it requested only four the bush campaign did not request a recount in any of those counties but that is not because as they claim they are so dedicated to the machinery being more accurate because many of us in this hall have been involved in elections and recounts and close elections involving punched cards and we all know as the governor of texas knows that the most accurate way to do a recount of a punched card election system is by hand with people from both parties examining the ballots now why is that true we live in an age where machines are praised and people are chided but in this case the invention of man the machine is not nearly as great as the creation of god first of all we are dealing with 1950s technology here this is no internet doublechecked modem this is a punch card this is 1950s technology and these machines we are talking about even if one votes properly doing everything according to the instructions punch the hole hard and straight through the card a chad can be left on that card sometimes partially attached sometimes hanging off the back sometimes hanging off the back and then in handling it it swiiigs back so that the machine cannot determine as a matter of fact the machine is erratic take a ballot that has been just slightly dimpled run it through the machine and sometimes it counts it sometimes it does not take a ballot where there is a swinging door chad on the back sometimes the machine counts the ballot sometimes not james baker has cried out for standards of course the counties of florida have their standards publish their standards train their employees by the standards do that training in front of a cable television camera for those who are glued to their sets and we know what those standards are in fact we can argue about those standards i believe the gore campaign argues in favor of counting a dimpled ballot and the people in palm beach florida may not be counting a dimpled ballot that is to say one where there is an impression but no perforation well we should know what the standards are we ought to try to agree on those standards and we ought to make sure that every challenged ballot is counted according to standards what standards does the machine have sometimes dimpled ballot yes sometimes not sometimes swinging door chad sometimes not the machine is not talking the engineers who made that machine are deep into retirement and they are not talking either counting these cards by machine may be fast but it is not the most accurate system now it is not enough for me to explain this because the governor of texas already made his decision in 1997 he signed into law a texas statute he signed it with his own pen a new clearer statute for the state of texas what does it say a manual recount shall be conducted in preference to an electronic recount what does that mean it means in texas if there are two candidates and both want a recount the candidate who wants a machine recount only has to post a bond from which the fee may be taken he may not get back his bond his money of 18 a precinct another candidate more interested in accuracy has to pay 30 a precinct as his or her bond and what if two candidates both want a recount the candidate who wants a manual recount is preferred that is to say not necessarily to win the election but the request for a manual recount has preference under the law of the state of texas why because george w bush when he signed this law knew full well that a manual recount while it may be a little more expensive and by god i think the presidency is worth 30 a precinct while a manual recount may be a little more expensive and time consuming it has preference because it is more accurate so why does james baker tell us to use machines he tells us that texas has standards and florida does not well first florida does have standards they simply vary from county to county but the palm beach standards are as good as the texas standards the broward standards are as good as the texas standards but if james baker was not trying to obstruct an accurate recount if he was hoping to have the votes counted accurately he would not be blocking a manual recount he would be aiding it andhow could he aid it let us read please show us because no one has seen them those supposedly in existence texas standards for dealing with these punch cards which they also use in texas do they count dimpled ballots in texas i do not know but i would like to know and frankly if james baker if george w bush can provide us with better standards let us see them but they have no interest in improving the accuracy of a manual count they want to block a manual count they refer to these machines as precision machines these are machines that jam if the ballot is bent a little bit the card is bent a little bit they deride human beings as in error even teams of three human beings working carefully with the tv cameras they deride that as being faulty and praise a machine that cannot read a bent ballot that would disqualify and disenfranchise one of our senior citizens who fought on normandy or iwo jima for the right of america to have a democracy for his right and our right to vote and his vote is going to be ignored by this supposed precision machine because well the ballot has a crease in it i cannot believe that the governor of texas would want to dishonor the oval office by sitting there only because creased ballots are not counted i cannot imagine that someone would want to be president in denigration of the votes of a majority of the states with a majority of the electoral college votes i understand he wants to be president and it is his right to be president if he does not have a majority of the popular vote nationwide but if he does not have a majority in states representing a majority of the electoral college then he dishonors the presidency by demanding it and he places his own desire for power above patriotism when he does everything possible to get a woman who is passionately dedicated to holding office in his administration to deny the most accurate vote count now i do want to deal with some of the other more extraneous issues that have come up but first i want to deal with one more aspect of the argument as to what is the best type of count the most accurate count you see we serve here in the united states congress and four republican candidates let me repeat that four republican candidates for congress have demanded and obtained manual recounts they were republicans they wanted to sit in these chairs and they got manual recounts by god if filling one of these chairs is worthy of a manual recount then certainly filling the chair in the oval office is worthy of a manual recount you see when john ensign wanted to sit in the united states senate in 1998 we gave him a manual recount or the state of nevada gave him a manual recount bob dornan got more than one manual recount peter torkildsen in 1996 demanded and got a manual recount and finally rick mcintyre in 1994 republican candidate got a man ual recount and throughout that process his cause was passionately advocated by then congressman dick cheney so dick cheney thinks that a manual recount is appropriate in filling a seat in this hall george bush signs a law in his own state saying that a manual recount has preference whether you are filling the governorship of texas or the lowest county clerk in the smallest county lowest or smallest county clerk in the smallest county but somehow obstacles are placed but i think ultimately these obstacles will be ineffective because ultimately the side of democracy will prevail and the same divine providence that has given us a democracy for these 200 years and many more will make sure that we have democracy in this election now first they went to federal court they attacked and vilified courts they have particularly attacked and vilified the federal courts those on the republican side often from this chamber they ran to federal court not for the purpose of seeking a more accurate count but for the purpose of demanding a less accurate count and the federal court turned them down and they turned around and they appealed to the 11th circuit a very republican very conservative federal court and i am confident that they will be turned down there as well because not only should a court not interfere to provide for a less accurate voting system but certainly the federal courts should not interfere in what under our constitution is very clearly a state matter then they went to the secretary of state and demanded a 5 deadline why to make sure that in volusia county they had to stay up all night to do the manual recount and make the deadline so then james baker could go on tv and say these human beings you cant trust them they were tired why were they tired because your person is imposing an unreasonable recount deadline particularly unreasonable given the fact that florida will not finish counting the absentee ballots from overseas until 5 friday so there is no speedup here of when florida will finish its vote tally the sole purpose is not speed the sole purpose is inaccuracy and they hope to achieve it so then a court in florida took a look at it and said okay all the counties can report their results by 5 today and then they can go back and do a manual recount should they desire and if they are dedicated to democracy they will and then report that as a supplemental report it will then be up to ms harris to decide whether her passion for a federal office exceeds her dedication to an accurate vote count because then she will be confronted with whether to ignore this report or whether to record it but if she arbitrarily and in passion for federal office decides to ignore an accurate count i am confident that the courts of florida will order her to do the right thing this election is too important to be decided by ms harris interest in a position in the arts or in foreign affairs in the federal government there is one other point i want to make and that is we are told that we should ignore the problems in palm beach county because the press said some things they should not have said at around 20 minutes before the polls closed in the florida panhandle keep in mind a decade or two ago the press would routinely report all through the day their exit polls and they would call states in the 1970s and the 1980s they would call them just as soon as they could whether the polls had closed in part of a state or none of the state or all of the state i am not prepared to throw out all the elections in the 1970s and 1980s just because the press did not have the good ethics which they have tried unsuccessfully to adopt for this election but if we are going to start equating illegal ballots on the one hand to false press reports on the other i would ask everyone to just make a mental checklist of how many false press reports we have had prior to the election after the election are we going to disqualify the election just because at least to my way of thinking the press misreported the economic effect of bushs social security plan the press has a constitutional right under the first amendment to say what it wants when it wants where it wants and the fact that they violated their own internal rules adopted by some of them and not by others apparently is no reason to throw out an election any more than the many times when the press violated its own rules of ethics by shifting a little bit this way or a little bit that way in a news report that should have been straight down the middle i see that i have been joined by the gentlewoman from texas before i yield to her i will ask how much time i have remaining"], [3.886222839355469e-05, 0.9999611377716064, 1, "i rise of course in strong support of this i certainly admire the passion and the intensity of our colleagues that have presented arguments tonight in voicing their concerns i think once we get through some of the rhetoric and hyperbole we might get down to some of the facts i think their arguments would seem to steal defeat from the jaws of victory in terms of this is a procra bill it expands cra it does so i think in a way and that was an absolutely fundamental demand by the president i respect the fact that the gentleman from iowa chairman leach and the ranking member fought like lionesses over their cubs trying to protect this and recognizing the necessity of doing it this was the last thing that we dealt with it was tough we have disclosure in here there are provisions with regard to reporting which i think are onerous but they are workable and we expand cra thousands of applications and thousands of other activities that went on that did not need cra will and every part and every branch of that holding company will have to have a positive cra rating in order to accomplish it in this bill we put teeth back in the fair credit reporting act which had been extracted several years ago that is an important consumer gain we have the prime act in here that the gentleman from illinois and senator kennedy sponsored which is so important to our local communities there are a lot of good things in this bill the activity of the gentlewoman from colorado with regards to spousal abuse is in this particular bill but beyond that of course the privacy issue is the most interesting issue of all because many have raised this great facade but 2 years ago when a bill was up here and some of the advocates to it would have allowed us with regards to being against this bill because it does not have enough privacy protections in this found it in their wisdom and hearts to vote for a bill that had none in it in minnesota we talk about protecting that one bank because they trespassed or were thought to have trespassed had to of course deal with a cra agreement or with regards to a privacy agreement i am concerned about that one bank but i was concerned about the other 549 banks in minnesota that did not have any law that would govern their particular privacy this covers all the banks in the nation and all the insurance firms in the nation and all the security firms in the nation and all the entities that are financial in nature are covered under this particular bill in terms of a privacy policy now even though it has taken 6 years to pass this guess what next year we are going to have to do some more work i hope that my colleagues realize we have not worked ourselves quite out of a job here yet we may have some imperfections in this legislation as there is in others and i will gladly confess that to my colleagues that we are going to have to come back and do additional work in this particular area but we have a solid foundation the principal provisions of this bill which have recognized the rusting and weakened and rotten chains of glasssteagall are finally recognized and congress is getting out in front and rationalizing and putting a policy in place in which our financial foundation a dysfunctional system can work that is what this is really all about i think in the process of doing so we have advanced and improved consumer provisions in this bill we should be proud to vote for it and proud towork for the results not simply polarization that this congress i think too often has reflected this year let us do something positive let us vote for this bill i rise in support of this conference report this agreement reached in a difficult and wrangling 66 member conference between the two bodies with very different products is a historic bill the conference report on s 900 is a balance it is a balance between the housepassed bill and the senatepassed bill it is a balance between competing industries it is a balance between bigger banks and smaller banks it is a balance between business and consumer needs it is a bill that does not allow us to continue to stick our heads in the sand with regard to the state of the financial services industry and instead brings the law up to date i worked upon and signed this conference report on s 900 the financial services modernization act in an effort to pave a path for the future that will provide financial opportunities for american consumers and communities across this country and that will keep our financial services sector competitive in the world economy we have a new law that will remove the rusted chains of glasssteagall and that will help insure that consumers receive quality financial services and new protections the measure removes the barriers preventing affiliation between banks insurance and securities entities and provides financial services firms the choice of conducting certain financial activities in bank holding company affiliates or in subsidiaries of bank structures on a safe and sound basis the agreement will not undermine the national bank charter vis a vis state banks foreign banks or the activities of unitedstates banks that have subsidiaries abroad with relative powers the conference agreement brought resolution to the differences over traditional bank securities powers we have successfully shut down the commercial loophole by prohibiting the sale of unitary thrifts to commercial entities functional regulation has been established on matter from insurance sales to antitrust anticoncentration law enforcement importantly the bill enhances the viability of smaller community banks and financial entities vital to extending services and credit through our greater economy rural and urban we do not have complete parity for affiliation between banks and insurance and securities firms with regard to commercial activities because of the 15 year grandfather provisions we could have merged the bank and thrift charters and merged the two deposit insurance funds that remain separate in law today i would have also hoped that we could have included fair housing compliance on insurance affiliates lowcost banking accounts and application of community reinvestment actlike requirements on products that are similar to bank products such as mortgages there are however no perfect bills produced through the congressional process with 535 views in the mix with the administrations phalanx of regulators and policy works the focus of the lengthy and public debate over this legislation has been the opening of the financial services marketplace to new competition and the reduction of barriers between financial services providers it is equally important that this bill is a positive step for our constituents and the communities in which they live as well in general there are inherent benefits of being able to provide streamlined onestop shopping with comprehensive services choices for consumers according to the treasury department financial services modernization could mean as much as 15 billion annually in savings to consumers hopefully some of these dollars will materialize we also have achieved other policy victories for consumers across the country we have modernized the community reinvestment act cra in a positive manner the cra was enacted by congress in 1977 to combat discrimination the cra encourages federallyinsured financial institutions to help meet the credit needs of their entire communities by providing credit and deposit services in the communities they serve on a safe and sound basisa basic reaffirmation of the purpose of insured depository institutions according to the national community reinvestment coalition the law has helped bring more than 1 trillion in commitments to these communities since its enactment across this great nation organizations belonging to ncrc acorn lisc enterprise neighborhood housing services and others have engaged cra to work with their local financial institutions to make their communities better places to live importantly the conference agreement will continue to ensure that cra will remain essential and relevant in a changing financial marketplace it is not everything i wanted or supported during the several amendments process it does however further the goals of the community reinvestment act by requiring that all of a holding companys subsidiary depository institutions have at least a satisfactory cra rating in order to affiliate as a financial holding company or to engage in any of the new financial activities authorized under this act this strengthens and modernizes the reel of cra in that current law does not have a cra satisfactory requirement for nonbank activities in which banks now seek to engage the federal reserve board has informed us that thousands of applications have been approved without any cra test that this bill will apply further according to the treasury department if a bank were to proceed without having a satisfactory cra the regulators have strong enforcement authority including monetary penalties cease and desist and divesture that they could apply the conference rightly rejected the other bodys proposed small bank exemption and safe harbor provisions for cra we did accept however a modified disclosure and reporting system i strongly disagreed with the burdensome socalled sunshine and reporting provisions in the senate bill they certainly raise the specter of harassment of procra groups however very few would oppose openness and public disclosure certainly the disclosure of information could spell out the effectiveness of these groups working so hard in our communities and the effectiveness of the cra itself i believe the reporting requirements although improved remain an extraordinarily difficult policy as structured in this measure it no doubt will be more of a burden to community groups and banks who currently do not file such status reports however we were able to streamline the reporting requirements and to limit who should file a report even as we gave the regulators substantial authority to properly oversee such provisions we should be mindful of the administrations and regulators expressions of good will to take a common sense approach with regards to its implementation hopefully they will help make these disclosure and reporting requirements more workable congress certainly must closely monitor the implementation of these provisions and their effects the conference report also contains two studies one evaluating business lines associated with cra and another looking at the impact of the changes or impact of this law on cra i am concerned about the short turnaround time of the report required of the federal reserve board i would hope that this important study of the default and profitability of cra loans will not be rushed to the point of not doing an adequate or fair job solely to meet an arbitrary deadline further this study should be inclusive and identify all loans individual commercial or other or activities that would qualify or be given as credit to financial institutions for craand certainly not just to those loads or actions that qualify under the cra reporting provisions of section 711 of the act other positive consumer provisions include the requirement that institutions ensure that consumers are not confused about new financial products along with strong antitying and anticoercion provisions governing the marketing of financial products a new program to provide technical assistance to low income microentrepreneurs known as the prime act will be created with enactment of this conference report atm fees will have to be fully disclosed to consumers not only on the computer screen but also on the atm machine itself i am disappointed that the conference committee rejected provisions i initiated which encouraged public meetings in the case of megamergers between banks which both have more than 1 billion in assets where there may be a substantial public impact because of the larger merger this would have provided our constituents with the important opportunity to express their views regarding mega mergers and their impact in our communities as my colleagues are aware this conference report contains landmark financial privacy protections for consumers today there is no federal law to protect your privacy or to stop the sale or sharing of your financial records with third party companies as many in my home state of minnesota learned this year not even credit card numbers are safe from telemarketers unless we act in the conference report to put in place substantive law with enactment of this agreement congress will give consumers real choices to protect their financial privacy this conference report will provide some of the strongest privacy provisions to ever be enacted into any federal law this agreement based upon the strong house provisions that i helped draft has an affirmative mandate upon all financial entities whether federal or state so that all banks brokers insurance companies credit unions credit card companies and many others must protect your personal financial information furthermore consumers will have an important choice of optingout of most information sharing with unaffiliated third parties financial institutions will no longer be able to share your customer account numbers or access codes with unaffiliated third parties for the purpose of telemarketing when you open an account and each year thereafter you will receive a full disclosure of the privacy policies of your bank credit union securities firm mutual funds or insurance companies if the policy is not strong enough this gives you the choice to choose a new company or to communicate your concerns to that financial enterprise importantly this conference agreement provides that financial institutions have an affirmative responsibility to protect and respect your financial privacy federal regulators are given the authority to set standards which guide the regulated and which will protect the security and confidentiality of a customers personal information we were successful in improving upon the house provisions by agreeing to allow states to give even more privacy protection to consumers at their discretion stronger state laws will not be preempted by this federal law the agreement also strengthens the fair credit reborting act giving bank regulators the ability to detect and enforce any violations of credit reporting and consumer privacy reestablishing regulatory provisions and the related enforcement powers essential to the same for the purposes like servicing accounts ordering checks selling loans to the secondary market giving consumers frequent flyer miles and complying with federal laws the agreement sets out exceptions in crafting regulations to implement this law the regulators should do nothing to further any sharing of account numbers or encrypted access codes which is not expressly conveyed through optin permission from consumers prior to any activity that would share such numbers further the regulators should not make any exemptions that would make it possible for consumers to opt in over the phone to a telemarketer regarding the sharing of their account number condoning such a practice would simply reaffirm the status quo with regard to those bad actors who would take advantage of the practice and avoid the clear intent of the law as the regulators begin to shape appropriate exceptions in regulation i entreat them to look carefully at the statute and to the clear intent to limit exceptions sharing with third parties outside of the scope of these limited exceptions should not be allowed the legislation does attempt to provide some competitive equality to smaller institutions vis a vis larger affiliated structures without providing loopholes which would invade consumers financial privacy the regulators should not provide exceptions merely to make something easier for financial institutions when it comes at the expense of the knowledge and benefit of consumers some have suggested that these major new privacy protections be jettisoned because they do not go far enough rejection would make these unprecedented good privacy protections the enemy of a skewed version of what is best to reverse the major strides made by this legislation is to steal defeat from the jaws of victory if congress says no to these new privacy provisions the result would be business as usual tacitly agreeing to sell your credit card numbers to telemarketers and permitting your financial data to float around the open market like the latest trade item on ebay would be a set back for privacy what is clear is that a law that requires consumer action is appropriate but third party and affiliate optout is hardly the first and last word in consumer rights we can do more and can do better the fact is that a number of consumers have such a right of optout today under fair credit reporting act or through voluntary institution policies even with that opportunity in law and practice only a small fraction of individuals less than 1 percent exercise that option consumer choice may give us a positive feeling of control and remedy but what does it really accomplishwhat is the bottom line does it provide results if only a fraction of 1 respond to the celebrated optout i do want to note something on the medical privacy provisions that were deleted from the housepassed bill h r 10 in this conference report mindful of the deep concerns raised by our colleagues on the commerce committee and many other outside the congress we finally deleted these admittedly less than perfect provisions in the bill in lieu of improving them the house approved a cqnvoluted motion to instruct the conferees to do as much i had and still have concerns about the leap of faith that this action deleting the provisionsrequired i hope that we will not be disappointed a i note the recriminations that have already been voiced by some i am pleased that the president has recently proposed comprehensive privacy provisions as a result of the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa law and hope that they will provide the protection we sought to assure and that there are no loopholes for medical privacy with regard to financial institutions consumers should not be forced to disclose and make public private medical data just to get insurance coverage although this legislation creates a new affiliated bank holding company structure that allows insurance banking and securities firms to join that must not translate into misuse and abuse of medical records by insurance companies and affiliates no one should be able to share private medical or genetic information to base credit upon or for other unrelated purposes we have been in the trenches on this bill for the last five years following more than 20 years of debate on financial modernization we are at the goal line i again want to express my appreciation to chairman leach ranking member lafalce chairwoman roukema our counterparts in the senate and all the respective staff especially my personal staff larry j romans kirsten johnsonobey and ern sermeus for their outstanding work cooperation and patience on this important legislation we worked hard together to create a bipartisan product that has gained the support of the administration and that overcame the polarized senatepassed measure the financial services modemization act of 1999 is a tremendous achievement if bittersweet from some reasons mentioned it is a solid foundation to build our economy upon as we move into the next century i urge my colleagues to support the conference report"], [5.054473876953125e-05, 0.9999494552612305, 1, "madam chairman i rise in strong support of h r 10 this is a good work product this is a legislative product that finally brings our statutory provisions of law in line with the current developed financial entities and the future policy path that is necessary to in fact fully engage our economy and our financial institutions in serving our enterprise and serving the their operation as a matter of fact consumers of this nation the chairman of the federal reserve the fact is that i think it is due to a board regulates just such operating lot of hard work on the part of the gen subsidiaries in the states and in the tleman from iowa and the foreign bank operation these are safe gentleman from virginia they are sound and i think this bill is and the gentleman from new york mr a good bill and deserves our support lafalce so too the work of the gen h r 10 represents the changes in law that tleman from michigan we need to catch up with reality by mapping who is in dissent today a path of true modernization for financial instinevertheless i think it follows a tra tutions in the financial services marketplace dition and path that will in fact put for today and tomorrow we need to enhance us in charge i think though that we the competitiveness of our financial services probably will not work ourselves out of sector and to move forward with predictable a job with this measure there is much certain logical and uniform regulation to do in many many aspects of it but as my colleagues are by now painfully it does for the first time through the aware there are many democrats some of work with the various enterprises the whom supported the bill in the banking coinindustry the banks the securities mittee who can now no longer feel coinfirms and the insurance firms that are fortable supporting this legislation despite the already affiliating today under court partisan gamesmanship of the past 24 hours and under regulatory practices it fi i remain committed to achieving comprehennally puts a statutory policy path that sive financial modernization through the enactcongress stipulates in place and one ment of h r 10 into law and thus hope that that is effective of course there is a we can pass this bill at the end of the day claim that there is 15 billionworth of i have put a great deal of time effort and saving that inures to the benefit of our energy working with my democratic colleague economy in terms of some of the and my colleagues from across the aisle we streamlining that takes place with this have been laboring together for many yearspolicy and law three congresses on this particular versiondo we like big banks and big finan crafting and perfecting a compromise on financial institutions probably not but cial modernization that will put the congresthe fact is that the global marketplace sional imprint on modemization our chairthat we compete in and that we par man mr leach and the ranking member ticipate in today is actually bringing mr lafalce were able to work together with these together and about this is hap members such as myself and mrs roukema pening in the absence of this law but to put together a bill the administration what we are trying to do is to try to which was opposed to the bill passed last put in place a legal framework to put year was supportive of our banking coinback some consumer voice some public mittee product policy voice in that process that affects we have accomplished much of which we consumers should be proud this bill has strengthened commu back in march the house banking and finity reinvestment act provisions this nancial services committee approved h r 10 bill when the amendment on privacy is on a strong bipartisan basis 519 with 21 adopted i think the banks will have democratic votes cast in support f the bill about the strongest privacy policy of much of this banking committee roduct has any of the financial entities commer been carried forward in the product before us cial or otherwise that we have respon today sibility at the national government for some important provisions are lacking or inor for that matter even at the state adequate we do not have complete parity for level we know how important that example for affiliation between banks and inissue is the privacy provisions that surance and securities firms with regard to will finally be written into this bill are commercial activities i would preferred to stronger than those that were in the have gone a little further on limiting unitary commerce bill stronger than those thrift holding companies indeed we could that were in the banking provision of have merged the bank and thrift charters i h r 10 would have also hoped that we could have inbeyond that i think that the bill cluded fair housing compliance on affiliates provides many opportunities to deal lowcost banking accounts and application of with antitrust issues other issues such community reinvestment actlike requireas supernotice requirements for merg ments on products that are similar to bank ers mandatory atm fee disclosure it products such as mortgages product sold and provides the opportunity for posted prl issued through affiliates vacy policies some medical privacy i on the main however we have a product think we are going to have some debate that will remove the rusted chains of glassabout that today some would have us steagall providing in its place a new financial believe that no policy is better than services infrastructure to keep unitedstates companies the policy that we have in this bill but competitive in the global marketplace while we are trying to in fact do the right ensuring consumers the quality services and thing as i said it deals with antitrust protections they deserve we remove the barconcentration riers preventing affiliation we provide financial as far as the operating subsidiary services firms the choice of conducting certain goes i think we ought to look very financial activities in bank holding company afclosely at chairman greenspans com filiates or in subsidiaries of banks on a safe ments because he pointed out in 1997 and sound basis that operating subsidiaries pose no some today may say that the operating subsafety soundness problem in terms of sidiary is too risky that is just not the case outgoing treasury secretary robert rubin the federal deposit insurance corporation and four past chairs of the fdic have all explained how the subsidiary structure protects the public interest as well as the affiliate structure and provides greater protection for the fdic and bank safety and soundness even chairman greenspanthe foremost opponent of subsidiariesacknowledged in 1997 testimony that the subsidiary approach posed no safety and soundness problems by requiring bank to be wellcapitalized even after investing capital in a subsidiary we are providing a proper cushion that is not the s l crisis all over again our national banks have been and should remain a source of economic strength and a solid foundation to construct an economic framework of growth this bill will keep them vigorous and viable with or without a holding company structure and does not change the balance between the national bank and state bank dual banking charters and regulation structure as i said earlier today the focus of the lengthy and seemingly endless public debate over this legislation has been the opening of the financial services marketplace to new competition and the reduction of barriers between financial services providers it is equally important that this bill is a positive step for our constituents and the communities in which they live as well in general there are inherent benefits of being able to provide streamlined onestop shopping with comprehensive services choices for consumers according to the treasury department financial services modernization could mean as much as 15 billion annually in savings to consumers there are additional specific and key positive consumer and community provisions in the base text we have modernized the community reinvestment act cra in a positive manner and i am pleased that this bill will not contain provisions that move us back in time for cra the cra was enacted by congress in 1977 to combat discrimination the cra encourages federallyinsured financial institutions to help meet the credit needs of their entire communities by providing credit and deposit services in the communities they serve on a safe and sound basis according to the national community reinvestment coalition the law has helped bring more than 1 trillion in commitments to jhese communities since its enactment groups like lisc enterprise neighborhood housing services and others too plentiful to mention them all use cra to work with their local financial institutions to make their communities better places to live cras success results from the effective partnership of municipal leaders local development advocacy organizations and communityminded financial institutions by creating such partnerships the cra has proven that local investment is not only good for business but critical to improving the quality of life for low and moderateincome constituents in the communities financial institutions serve importantly h r 10 ensures cra will remain of central relevance in a changing financial marketplace it furthers the goals of the community reinvestment act by requiring that all of a holding companys subsidiary depository institutions have at least a satisfactory cra rating in order to affiliate as a financial holding company and in order to maintain that affiliation including appropriate enforcement in addition h r 10 extends the cra to the newly created wholesale financial institutions woofies these provisions represent substantial progress and a critical contribution to the overall balance reflected in this bill other positive provisions include the requirement that institutions ensure that consumers are not confused about new financial products along with strong antityping the anticoercion provisions governing the marketing of financial products super notices to customers that state that when banks sell nondeposit products they are not insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic like traditional bank accounts are insured the requirement to maintain marketrelated data and to produce an annual report on concentration of financial resources to assure that community credit needs are being met and the disclosure to consumers of atm fees not only on the computer screen but also on the atm machine itself additionally when issuing atm cards banks must issue a warning that surcharges may be imposed by other parties i would also like to highlight an amendment of i advanced that has been included with a minor change from commerce committee requiring public meetings in the case of megamergers between banks which both have more than 1 billion in assets where there may be a substantial public impact because of the larger merger providing our constituents with the important opportunity to express their views regarding mega mergers in their communities importantly the base text also includes required posted privacy policies by depository institutions of financial holding companies to clearly and conspicuously disclose to their customers their privacy policies specifying what their policies are with regard to a customers information while an amendment later today will make vast improvements for consumer privacy with this provision customers can learn what a financial institutions policies are and could be clearly informed of their rights under the fair credit r6porting act to choose not to have their information shared among affiliates frankly in this way customers would be able to choose whether they want to do business with institutions that have privacy policies with which they disagree if they dont like affiliate sharing or other parts of the privacy policy that an institution has they have the benefit of living in a country with thousands of small community banks and with other institutions even offering banking on the internet i do want to note something on the medical privacy provisions in title iii of the bill mindful of the deep concerns raised by our colleagues on the commerce committee and many other outside the congress i want to state that we do not want to preempt any comprehensive medical privacy provision we do not want to create loopholes or set up consumers to be forced to disclosed private data just to get insurance coverage neither however do we want to leave wide open the possibility that within the confines of this new affiliated structure this bill creates allowing insurance banking and securities firms to join that they can learn private medical or genetic information to base credit decisions upon i would hope that we will have an opportunity in time to appropriately fix this provision and if that means limiting it to situations where insurance and banks affiliateso that within these confines insurance companies which affiliate with a bank will keep confidential customers health and medical information this represents an initial effort to assure that health information cannot be used to determine eligibility for credit or other financial services it was not our intent to undercut circumvent of weaken but rather to enhance and protect so let us work together in conference to improve this if the amendment sought by mr waxman and mr condit cannot be a part of this process here today as i noted earlier in my statement i had hoped that we could have included a banking committee reported provision to condition affiliation of insurance companies with banks based on compliance with an existing lawthe fair housing act it is a productive provision that more than suggests that companies who seek to expand their opportunities are meeting the needs of communities and following the law by not discriminating there have been settlement agreements and consent decrees between the department of housing and urban development the department of justice and insurance entities that resulted from alleged violations of the fair housing act what has resulted is changes in underwriting guidelines such as changes eliminating year the dwelling the built or minimum dollar amounts of coverage or not denying coverage solely on the basis of information contained in credit reports that will better ensure the homeowners are not denied insuranceand quite possibly the opportunity to become homeownersbecause of discrimination it is indeed unfortunate that neither the base text has not did the rule allow as an amendment a provision to strengthen fair housing and to eliminate discrimination this provision could have been step forward for consumers as much as requiring lowcost banking accounts could have been these provisions would have ensured that the benefits of modernization would be more available to consumers of all economic means low cost accounts could have taken a form similar to the eta accounts created by treasury with little or no burden and certainly no credit risk borne by depository institutions in closing following more than 20 years of debate on financial modernization i think that we are close to achieving our goal and if not on the rule on much of the substance of the bill before us today we have done so on a bipartisan basis we have much to do so we can get this bill through a conference with members of the other body their bill has many provisions that are extremely problematic for the administration and for house democrats from debilitating limitation on the national bank operating subsidiary to outright gutting of the community reinvestment act i ask my colleagues to join me in supporting h r 10 i want to thank chairman leach ranking member lafalce and chairwoman roukema and their respective staff for all of their work and cooperation on this important legislation"], [6.67572021484375e-05, 0.9999332427978516, 1, "yesterday we took the first step on a long process of passing a budget this year and a very important budget it will be as it will lay out pri orities as we move into the next century it will in fact be the last budget of the 20th century as we move forward we need to set our priorities this will be a long process as we go through the summer and into the fall in deciding what those priorities should be in passing a budget i rise today to emphasize the importance of fiscal discipline fiscal responsibility and paying down our debt as we move through that process i feel that should be the number one priority of this body in the budget process and for the future as it is what can best help the people of this country we still have a significant financial problem the news has gotten better in recent years we have reduced the yearly size of the deficit and we actually have the possibility of moving towards a surplus all of that is good news and many people on both sides of the aisle and many congresses through the past 6 or 7 years can rightfully take credit for that but the job is not done i worry a great deal as i listen to the debate and listened to the debate this past week on the budget resolution that people have lost sight of that fact we are talking about surplus politics and i think we do so prematurely to begin with we still incorrectly from an economic standpoint cbunt the surplus in the social security trust fund as income to the treasury and use that surplus to claim an overall surplus when in fact we have an overall deficit last years numbers make this point clearly we had a 100 billion surplus in the social security trust fund the rest of the budget actually ran a 30 billion deficit so presto we have the 70 billion surplus that everybody has been talking about it does not really exist but that surplus in the social security trust fund is already obligated we have to pay it back plus interest to the treasury so that the trust fund can pay out the social security benefits that all of us or all of us hopefully some day that many of us are due so it is not money we can count as a surplus to count it that way is to spend it twice when we spend money twice we wind up in debt as far as we are the second critical point in this is we still have an overall debt that 70 billion surplus mythical though it may be even within the grounds of that myth is only a 1year surplus with quotations around it the overall debt continues to grow it is approaching 6 trillion on a yearly basis we pay 215 billion to service that debt that is 15 percent of the budget 15 percent of our budget and 250 billion that basically goes simply to pay off past excess it does nothing to meet our obligations at present or in the future and it should be reduced now is the time to do it we have a very strong economy we have unemployment at 4 2 percent we have virtually nonexistent inflation a booming stock market with growth to match if we cannot begin to pay down that debt now we never will we will never get there if we do not take that step right now we need to step up to that as a priority i am concerned as i look at the debate that we had on the budget resolution that we are not heading in the right direction i basically lookat the budget resolution of this week that was passed in the house as a bad newsgood news situation the bad news is it is not a particularly good budget resolution and the debate was even worse from a fiscally responsible and economically accurate standpoint but the good news is it borders on meaningless what really is going to matter is the 13 appropriation bills that both bodies have to pass between now and october there is no way that those 13 appropriation bills are even going to come close to matching what was in that budget resolution i say that is good news because the budget resolution overpromised in a number of different areas essentially by holding back key specifics the budget resolution was able to promise in a number of interesting areas promise more spending on defense although they added another little trick in there that they promised budget authority but not necessarily outlays what is the difference between budget authority and outlays we ask it is the difference between promising to spend money and actually spending it there is a big difference between those two things beyond that the pledges for increased spending in defense in education while at the same time including a massive back end tax cut and by back end i mean it grows in the out years in the first 5 years it is not too much in the second 5 years it is more in the third five years it is even more all of that for all of that to work within any sort of fiscally responsible framework requires cuts in the rest of the budget that nobody is prepared to make and therefore were not spelled out in that budget resolution for some very good reasons if they had been spelled out nobody would have voted for it and it would not have passed so the budget resolution was more or less a political document an effort to try to gain favor in some areas by playing various tricks and smoke and mirrors games with the budget numbers so it is not going to happen but we are going to have a situation where we are going to have to pass a real budget what is going to happen is all of those promises that were made during the budget resolution debate are going to be very tough to meet in reality what is going to happen my fear is that what is going to happen is exactly what happened in the 1980s long before i got to congress actually when i was in high school and college and watched with horror as my predecessors in this body spent all of our future money basically what happens is an agreement is reached that goes something like this i will take your tax cut if you take my spending increase that works out just fine for that congress they are able to pass out a lot of goodies and make every one happy but it sets up a situation that i among others walked into in the mid 1990s basically it is like showing up at the time that the credit card bill comes due it is not a lot of fun and it is not good for the country because i understand the federal government has many positive things that it needs to do it has spending programs in the areas of education in the areas of defense environmental protection medical research it has tax cuts it can do all of those things are important but they are not peculiar to this one moment in time ten years from now 20 years from now 30 years from now and beyond residents of this country are going to have needs in all of those areas needs that they will not be able to meet if we spend the money now irresponsibly i am afraid that we are headed in that direction by overpromising by talking about the politics of a surplus and where can we spend the money where should we spend the money what tax cuts we should do way beyond what we can actually afford to do and not even taking into account the nearly 6 trillion debt that we have run up over the course of the last 30 years let us be fiscally responsible and start paying that down worse than that the debate as i watched it degenerated into a criticism of the clinton budget and a battle over who is quote setting aside more for social security there are a couple of problems with this argument first of all it allowed many of the majority party who supported their budget to not even really talk about their budget but rather try to focus their attention on proving that the presidents budget that he introduced 3 months ago was bad that may well be in fact an amendment was offered by a member of the majority that was supposedly exactly the presidents budget it was defeated i think with only two votes voting in favor of it from the time that budget was introduced many things have changed many other ideas have come up the budget is a dead issue yet that is what the majority party spent most of its time talking about i would have much preferred them to have spelled out some of the specifics of their own resolution i also would have much preferred them to be a little bit more honest in their analysis of that budget i brought a chart with me which i saw frequently on the day that the budget resolution was debated being brought up and put forth by the majority party as evidence that their budget was better for social security than the presidents was i bring this chart up mainly for illustrative purposes to show howwell dishonest might be too strong a word we are supposed to not say things like that in this honest bodylet us say how disingenuous the debate was i will put that chart up now this chart shows the commitment on social security it is interesting the republicans argument throughout the whole budget was that their budget sets aside 100 percent of the social security trust fund or sorry 100 percent of the surplus for social security whereas the president only sets aside 62 percent the interesting thing is and they absolutely had to be aware of this fact the 62 percent that they are talking about or sorry the 62 percent that the president was talking about was 62 percent of the entire surplus whereas the number that the republicans were referring to in their budget was 100 percent of the social security surplus so basically the president was talking about 62 percent of a much larger number in fact a fascinating fact is this 62 percent of that much larger number is almost exactly the same as that 100 percent in other words there is no difference whatsoever yet the majority got up here and argued repeatedly that their budget was better because it set aside 100 percent instead of 62 percent it is just exactly that sort of disingenuous use of fact that colored the debate and got us way off the topic that topic ought to be fiscal responsibility if we want to do something about social security and medicare and that is really a third point in addition to the two prior points about how our budget situation is not as rosy as it is those being one that we still count the money that we borrow from the social security trust fund two we have an existing debt three is the coming bills on social security and medicare once the baby boom retires those exploding bills that are out there and what we are going to do about them nowhere in the budget resolution does it say anything about any sort of medicare or social security reform to deal with those problems if we do not that is going to further exacerbate our financial situation the level best thing that we can do for dealing with those programs well there is two things one we can reform the two programs but two is to not spend the money now because the interesting thing about this chart is both the president and the republicans are being somewhat disingenuous in arguing about how much money they quote unquote are setting aside for social security we cannot bind future congresses in that way as future congresses pass budgets they will decide whether or not to spend this money on social security medicare or someplace else it will require a yeartoyear decision to decide what to do with that so to say that we are setting it aside now is somewhat empty rhetoric except for this point it is arguable that the extent to which we are fiscally responsible now in other words the extent to which we do not spend money or do not give out tax cuts that further inhibit our ability to have revenues for social security and medicare to the extent we do that we will be in a better position to deal with social security and medicare in the future so the number one biggest test aside from all this baloney with the charts this effort to confuse people by taking two separate numbers and treating them as the same when they are not look at the budget and see if it is fiscally responsible that is the test on whether or not we are preparing for dealing with the coming increases in cost and social security and medicare again when we look at the budget resolution we passed this week it promised 800 billion in tax cuts over 10 years actually that number balloons even further in the next 5 years over a 15year period it also promised massive increases in a number of different areas of spending all of that will jeopardize this chart considerably that is what we need tolook at as we debate the budget in the months ahead because as i said the hard work is yet to come we have basically done the smoke and mirrors twisted the numbers around to make them look as good as possible now we actually have to pass realistic appropriations bills that is going to be far far more difficult than simply passing a piece of rhetoric i rise today to urge fiscal responsibility balance the budget and pay down the debt that is the best thing we can do for society today and in the future i am pleased to yield to the gentleman from arkansas a colleague who will help in this argument i appreciate his coming down"], [6.687641143798828e-05, 0.999933123588562, 1, "tomorrow on the house floor we will begin the budget process we will debate in the full house for the budget resolution and the budget resolution is the parameters under which we will pass the spending bills later on in the session so this is the first attempt to get a look at what our budget is going to look like for the fiscalyear i rise today to talk about fiscal discipline and to urge fiscal discipline in that process and i do so from the perspective of a democrat but a new democrat and i would like to explain that a little bit at the outset because i am a member of the new democratic caucus back here in washington d c but that is not something folks may necessarily be completely familiar with outside of washington d c the basic premise behind the new democrats is that the democratic party needed to change to address some of the legitimate concerns that the american public had with our party essentially we in the new democratic caucus believe that the democrats did have to make some changes in some of its policies in order to address the concerns the public had expressed with us and the reasons that we started losing elections quite frankly we had to understand some of the changes that were going on in society and some of the changes that were going on in government and address them in manners that had not been previously addressed and one of the biggest ones is fiscal responsibility now as democrats we believe that government can in fact in certain areas be a positive force in peoples lives we can look to medicare social security the interstate highway bill the gi bill laws that have protected our environment by cleaning up air and water all of those areas have made a difference so it is not that we do not believe as some of our colleagues on the right in the republican party sometimes believe that government can ever do anything right it is just that we believe that they need to do it in a fiscally responsible manner and there is a variety of reasons for that first of all all of the needs that we have as a society education defense cleaning up and protecting the environment medical research taking care of our veterans providing health care and pension security for our seniors are not onetime needs our generation is not going to be the only generation that is going to need to address those concerns it is going to be ongoing in the future and if we spend all of the money right now in this generation we are going to be doing a grave disservice to future generations in fact that is more or less what happened in the 1980s basically as my colleagues know there were a lot of compromises that were reached in this body in the 1980s and i always characterize those compromises as being basically okay we will take your tax cut if you take our spending increase and we will just spend as much money as possible to make as many people as possible happy right now today put it on a credit card and forget about tomorrow well i first got into politics in 1990 when i was elected to the washington state senate basically i got elected right about the time the bill came due and i know how difficult it is to do what we need to do as a government when the previous members of a legislative body have spent all the money and then some it is completely irresponsible and it mortgages the future of our children future generations will need infrastructure they will need money for transportation they will need money for public education for cleaning up the environment and if we have spent it all they will not have it so being fiscally responsible should in no way be antithetical to the beliefs of the democratic party we need to emphasize it and make it a big priority one of the other problems with running up such a severe debt other than spending all of the money that future generations could spend for needed and necessary programs is that the more money we spend the more debt we go into the higher the interest payment this is a concept that everybody in america understands whether it is a mortgage payment a car payment a credit card bill we understand that not only do we have to pay back that money that we borrowed but it keeps going up in the presence of interest that accumulates on our bill every month i have a chart here that helps illustrate that problem in the federal government basically the third largest expenditure behind social security and national defense of our federal government is interest on the debt 243 billion or 14 percent of the budget that is money that does not go to educate our children that does not go to provide health care for people in poverty or seniors or people who need it that does not go to help our environment to help with medical research to help with veterans to do any of those things it goes to pay for the irresponsible spending of those who went before us and we should be keenly aware of that number because as the deficit goes up this number keeps going up as well and finally there is another benefit to being fiscally responsible that goes beyond this that the next chart as i will demonstrate in a minute reveals and that is that basically if we can pay down the federal debt because keep in mind this number here is a yearly number we are running up a deficit on a yearly basis we are getting close to balance but we are not quite there but more on that in a second but we also at the same time are incurring overall debt we are borrowing more and more money so even if we get our budget balanced one of the critical things we need to do is start paying down the debt if we start paying down the debt that helps interest rates go down and if interest rates go down there are benefits all across the economy and i will demonstrate a few of them on the other chart one of the biggest ones that we can all relate to is a home mortgage and basically if we can pay down the debt so that the public or the government sector is not gobbling up all the money other people can have more access to it at a better rate and my colleagues can see here if you just reduce the mortgage interest rate on a 30year fixed rate from 8 percent down to 6 percent you can save yourself a great deal of money on the monthly payment and over the course of a year you can save yourself a great an even larger sum of money so this is another problem with being fiscally irresponsible all of which brings me to the budget that is going to be laid out here on the floor tomorrow by the majority party it fails to be fiscally responsible it is not just democrats that have trouble being fiscally responsible in the past it is democrats and republicans one of the things i always try to say whenever people get into an argument over whose fault the debt is as my colleagues know is it the reagan bush presidency or is it the democratic congress as my colleagues know i believe in saying it is both of their fault they made the decisions to spend more money collectively than they can possibly cover so it is not just one party or the other that is responsible for this but now as the budgets are being rolled out if the republican budget passes it will be the republicans who are responsible for further fiscal irresponsibility because their budget sounds themes that are eerily familiar massive tax cuts totaling well over a trillion and a half dollars over the course of 15 years at the same time accompanied by massive spending increases primarily in the areas of defense and education and in some arguably laudable areas keep in mind as i said earlier this is not an argument against spending money this is an argument of spending too much money and going into debt so that we create a fiscally irresponsible situation and lastly the last thing reflected in the current republican plan is not only do they dramatically cut taxes and dramatically increase spending but they also offer no plan at this point to do anything about entitlements about social security and medicare and medicaid all of which in their present framework are going to cost far more than the current budget structure could possibly accommodate medicare goes bankrupt in 2008 social security stops running a surplus in 2014 and goes bankrupt in 2032 all of those facts combine to make this republican budget very fiscally irresponsible and to put us in a position of basically snatching defeat from the jaws of victory we are just this close to balancing the budget personally i do not think that we should count the surplus in the social security trust fund as income to reduce the overall deficit so i do not think we have a balanced budget yet but even if you do not count that money we ran a 30 billion deficit this past fiscal year as opposed to the nearly 300 billion deficits that we were running in the early 1990s so we are getting close i rise today basically as a new democrat to urge fiscal discipline urge us to get the rest of the way and to reject the republican budget i have some of my colleagues here who are going to help me in this argument and i will at this point yield to the gentleman from north carolina"], [8.285045623779297e-05, 0.9999171495437622, 1, "i rise tonight to talk about fiscal responsibility the budget deficit and hopefully paying off the debt we have a very promising situation right now where we are finally headed towards balancing the budget it was not too long ago when that seemed like an impossible dream i remember in 1990 when we looked at budget deficits growing on a yearly basis stacked on top of an already multitrillion dollar debt it seemed impossible to think that we would ever dig our way out of that hole but thanks to a strong economy the private sector kicking in and some good decisions made by both sides of the aisle and by president clintons administration we are to the point where we almost have a yearly balanced budget now we still have a 5 6 trillion debt to deal with but we are headed in the right direction for the moment that is why i rise to speak this evening because the for the moment part could change as we head into the budget negotiations that are starting in earnest in both chambers and at the white house we need to be very careful not to lose the progress that we have gained and not to in essence snatch defeat from the jaws of victory which we still have plenty of time to do i think there are a couple of ways this might happen the first way is when we start throwing numbers around of the surplus we have heard the numbers in the trillions of dollars about how much money we have got lying around i want to try this evening to clarify exactly what we are talking about because there are a number of variables in these numbers that often do not come with the rosy scenarios that various politicians are laying out for people to hear we have heard for instance that we have and will run up as currently projected 6 trillion in surpluses over the course of the next 15 years there are a number of problems with this scenario first of all of that 6 trillion better than half almost i think it is like 3 1 trillion will be ran up in the social security trust fund any surplus that we have in the social security trust fund is not money that we can spend because it is money that we borrow from that trust fund with a promise to pay it back plus interest so that we can meet the obligations of the social security trust fund if we were to take that money and treat it as a surplus and spend it we would in essencenot in essence we wouldbe spending money twice that is exactly the sort of thing that got us in trouble in the 1980s if you spend money twice you wind up in debt because you do not have it when you need it so right away we lose half of that 15year figure better than half of that 15year figure you could still look at that and say gosh 2 9 trillion over 15 years that is still a lot of money it is but it presumes that our existing budget of all spending will be reduced by 20 percent not only will it not increase but we will make cuts of 20 percent this was part of the 1997 balanced budget agreement that occurred before our economic situation got rosier and more money poured into the coffers i do not want to be one to predict the future but having been around this place for the last year or so and listening to people talk about all the various programs from defense to education to you name it that people feel are underfunded much less in need of a 20 percent cut i find it very hard to believe that over the course of that 15 years we are actually going to have that 20 percent reduction so if we assume that again we are going to get in trouble that puts us in a position where you realize there is not that much money there lastly and most importantly these are projections estimates now we have to do projections and estimates you have to sort of guess if you will at what your budgets are going to look like so you can plan for the future that is acceptable but i would not count our chickens before they hatch because that 15year projection is based on 15 years of continued growth and low inflation now granted the growth that is projected is lower than we have had in the last year or two as we have had the long peacetime expansion the longest that we have had in a while but still there are times when revenues go down instead of up when estimates get worse instead of better i know this as every member of this chamber ought to know those times happened throughout the 1980s and into the early 1990s we had projected balanced budgets at gosh i do not know how many times throughout the 1980s and 1990s but the numbers always came in worse than expected many times far worse than expected dramatically growing the deficit instead of reducing it so if we assume that this 15year period is going to produce continued growth continued low inflation we are asking for trouble i would suggest that a more modest approach is at most let us assume that maybe half of that is going to happen and if the other half happens fine when it happens then we can use it for tax cuts or needed spending but let us not spend it before we getit and fourth the final point we should not forget the 5 6 trillion debt that we have hanging over us it would be nice to use a lot of this money to pay down that debt to get us back to the point where we can have the fiscal responsibility that we need in this country we spend over 200 billion somewhere around 220 billion a year in interest on the debt that is money that cannot go for any program cannot go for any tax cut it is merely servicing our debt if we were to pay down that debt we could reduce that amount and have even more money and a more fiscally responsible budget let me suggest that now is the time to do this at a time when we have between 4 and 6 percent growth depending on the quarter at the time when we have virtually nonexistent inflation these are unprecedented times at least unprecedented in the last 40 or 50 years in this country and if we do not seize this opportunity at a time when unemployment is 4 2 percent to be fiscally responsible we will never do it when times turn bad because when times turn bad is precisely when you need to spend more money on things like education and infrastructure when you need to give tax cuts to help people who are struggling due to the tough economic times now is the time to be fiscally responsible i want to touch on one more point on that we have recently heard a lot of talk about tax cuts truthfully there are not many politicians who do not like tax cuts we would love to be able to give as many of them as possible and in as many places as possible but only in my opinion if they do not jeopardize fiscal responsibility the plan that has been rolled out by the majority republican party in recent days calls for 850 billion or 875 billion depending on whose figures you believe over the next 10 years right away please note that they estimate over the next 10 years whereas the surplus figures that have been thrown around in the newspapers estimate over 15 years so over 15 years that 850 billion is even more in fact if you take that 850 billion put it over the 10 years like it is then take our projected surpluses back over 10 years and that is the chart that i have with me today you will see that we have a figure here that shows that the combined surpluses over those two periods are somewhere around 1 trillion if you then also add into it the fact that if you spend the 850 billion or if you give it to tax cuts basically you will not be able to pay down the debt at all you jack up your interest payments by almost 200 billion and you completely exhaust this projected surplus in 10 years so we better do absolutely as well every single year and we better be prepared to cut the budget 20 percent or we can forget about fiscal responsibility the number is simply too high yes we ought to do tax cuts i completely support that i completely agree with that we ought to target it to the middle class target it to the people who maybe have not necessarily benefited as much from the recent economic boon as others but we should not exhaust the entire projected surplus on these tax cuts putting ourselves in a position where we cannot even begin to pay down the debt and probably will not be able to have a balanced budget if the numbers come in worse than they are currently projected that is not fiscally responsible let me throw one other frightening statistic at you as we are looking at these happy numbers of the projected surpluses we project out 15 years which is an interesting time frame to pick particularly when you factor in positive economic projections because it is right about at that time period the year 2014 when the costs of medicare and social security are really going to accelerate if you project it out a few more years you would see how much that starts to hurt us as the baby boom generation starts to retire in earnest we are going to be in big trouble all of these factors and statistics need to be considered the fact that half the money is in the social security trust fund the fact that right at the end of our projections we get hit with a huge bill for medicare and social security these are things that mitigate how much money we have my grave concern and i have seen it already and had people come up to me program after program tax cut after tax cut is thrown at us and everyone says well gosh you ought to be able to do it youve got this multitrillion dollar surplus that everybody keeps talking about i hope in my remarks i have explained a little bit tonight that we do not have that multitrillion dollar surplus in the bank by any stretch of the imagination i really think that the single best thing this chamber can do for the people of our country right now in these strong economic times is balance the budget and pay down the debt then if we hittough economic times we will have a little leeway to borrow some money help prime the pump help get the economy back going again but not if we cannot do it now if we cannot do it now in these prosperous times we will never do it and god help us if it gets to the point where actually the projections go down if we experience a year of negative growth which by the way does happen if inflation ticks back up closer to double digits than just one or two then we will really be in a fix now is the time to prepare for the future i would like to close by just making one other point this is tough i recognize that i am not going to stand here and say that fiscal responsibility is easy because we have a lot of needs in this country i could tick off a dozen off the top of my head defense spending education spending veterans health care for seniors and children environmental protection programs and that is just a few we also could have a tremendous need for a lot of tax cuts that would be tremendously helpful to the middle class and others i know that every day in my office a number of people come in the door and request one of those programs but the obligation and the responsibility of this congress is to recognize that we are not the last people in this country who are going to need those things and if we spend all the money now if we basically have no discipline and simply want to pass out the goodies to make as many people happy as is humanly possible then 10 20 30 years from now our children our grandchildren those of us who are still around are not going to have anything for these same programs in the year 2020 2050 they are going to need education and transportation and health care and defense spending every little bit as much as we need it now but they will not have it because we in our fiscally irresponsible way will have spent their money i grew up in the 1970s and the 1980s when prior congresses were in essence spending all of my money i did not much like it and i darn sure do not want to do it to future generations because i do not have the discipline to do what is right and what is best for this country and what is responsible do not let rosy scenarios and pie in the sky numbers fool you about where the budget is going and what is going to happen demand fiscal responsibility from this congress demand that the budget gets balanced and we pay down the debt"], [8.392333984375e-05, 0.9999160766601562, 1, "in the absence of anything constructive for the house to do i yield myself such time as i may consume to begin let me congratulate the overwhelming majority of our colleagues approximately 432 of them for ignoring this exercise in partisan silliness no one believes that this is anything more than a very feeble effort from a party that is having difficulty in presenting a program to try and look like it is doing something no one thinks this is going anywhere we are about to debate an amendment to the constitution of the united states look who is here at this point it is now myself and the gentleman from texas we are here because we have to be here if one of us was not here we would have to stop so the barest minimum number of people possible to keep this farce going are impressed into it frankly i am a little resentful because we are having a serious hearing in judiciary on the antitrust measure that i cannot be at i notice my republican colleagues in the judiciary understanding this was coming scripted it better and they managed to get a committee on rules member to sit in so they could all be present at the hearing the committee on rules presumably has nothing else to do at this time but now let us get to the proposal i did hear one member as i was coming in announced that what we are doing now is what james madison would have done if he only were as smart as we are it is true and it is an inconvenient fact because we do as a body like to pay tribute to the wisdom of the founding fathers and what we are saying here is boy the founding fathers really blew one because this is not some obscure issue they knew about taxation they knew about twothirds people make one of the least logical arguments i have ever heard even in this sort of partisan silliness when they say well the fact that the constitution calls for twothirds in some cases shows that it really should have called for twothirds in this case what that does is establish that the people who wrote the constitution knew how to call for twothirds when they thought the subject required it they said in certain cases it takes twothirds they then obviously made a deliberate and conscious decision not to require twothirds for taxation now to get around that i did hear one of my colleagues say well if james madison knew what we knew he would have done what we have done i doubt it the evidence that james madison would have thought exactly as he would have thought seems to me quite thin what we have of course is the inconvenient fact that james madison quite clearly thought the opposite the people who wrote the constitution decided that it would be a majority and that is of course a perfectly sensible thing we happen to believe fundamentally that a majority of the people as constituted and remember the senate is not that majoritarian but a majority of those elected from the house on a popular basis and in the senate on a state basis make the important decisions and all of the important ongoing governmental decisions are made by majorities now what has happened is this the republican party used to be a very majoritarian party in its rhetoric but they have now discovered to their dismay that the majority no longer loves them as much as they thought this really goes back to 1995 when they shut down the government and were jeered instead of cheered so what we now have is an announcement by the republican party that we cannot trust the majority of the american people as the constitution says they should be represented and for measures they do not like they need twothirds now it is also the case that the republican party is offering a procedural objection to taxes instead of a substantive one for example the last time we raised taxes as i recall was 1993 we did do some tax increases before that under ronald reagan and george bush but the last time we raised them was in 1993 in the first year of the clinton administration and i remember my republican colleagues objecting because we were raising taxes on middleincome people now most of the tax increases went there on people making well upwards of 100 000 in 1993 not middle income even by republican standards but there was an increase in the gasoline tax and they pointed that out well we recently had a spike in gasoline prices because of opec and i think a failure on the part of the administration to act initially as promptly as they should have although i think they since have taken some effective action so one suggestion was let us now deal with that 4 3 cent increase in the gas tax the republican party had a chance to do that where is the bill the republican party having fulminated against the gasoline tax increase of 1993 had the ideal opportunity to come forward with a reduction in the gasoline tax and a few of them talked about it where is the bill we did get a resolution threatening opec that we might call them names if they did not do some things i have not seen a bill to reduce that gasoline tax the last time we raised taxes was in 1993 they will talk about how terrible it was but they will not do anything about it and the reason is that reality has had a very severe impact on the republican party and on their ideology on the one hand they denounce government on the other hand they seek opportunities to increase it now of course we have the military budget the single largest part of the discretionary budget and it is faith among the republicans that that is too small we need vast increases billions and billions of dollars to increase the military budget but that is not all the republican party has gone from denouncing the notion of helping older people buy prescription drugs to embracing it they say there are differences in how much but they want a new program the republican party is for a new program which will cost government money a couple of weeks ago we took a step that i approved of and that many republicans approved of and we put the federal government for the first time into the business of helping local fire departments in a systematic way i am glad to do that but it costs government money my republican governor was just down here yesterday acknowledging the fact that a major highway project that he and his republican predecessor thought were very important to massachusetts would cost a couple of billion dollars more than they thought that will cost government money for much of the time my republican colleagues join many democratic colleagues in talking about increasing the budget of the national institute of health increasing money for transportation increasing money for the military buying prescription drugs we passed a housing bill last week overwhelmingly whichtalked about how important various federal housing programs are to help people get homeownership these cost money so in the abstract the republican party wants to look like the antitax party but in particular they want to spend government money just as many of the rest of us do for good purposes so what we get to resolve that contradiction is an entirely silly effort i should not say it is an effort because no one takes it seriously we get this gesture to amend the constitution of the united states and to wrench it away from democracy now this is not the first time the republican party has shown its lack of faith in the voters we had that previously with term limits what they said was those voters they do not understand they cannot deal with elections we have to put term limits on because they cannot understand it of course for many republicans the idea of term limits in the abstract was far more attractive than the idea of term limits in the particular because among the people who will be voting for this constitutional amendment today to limit the electorates ability to call for a tax increase will be people who will be defying their own pledge to limit the electorates ability to reelect them they have decided that does not work so we have what is finally fundamentally a notion that democracy is flawed that in this country the compromises they made about majority rule for the senate for instance two senators per state that was not enough that we have to go further and make a very drastic change in the basic structure of government and say that when it comes to deciding how much money should be spent for public purposes and how much for private purposes majority rule does not work now one last point we hear this remarkably foolish notion that there is a dispute between the money that goes to the government and the money that goes to the people but all the money belongs to the people the people understand and the republican party has been forced to acknowledge it that there are some purposes very important to the people that they cannot accomplish unless they do them jointly a tax cut putting money in individuals pockets does not expand airports a tax cut putting money in individuals pockets will not solve the problem of putting more police on the streets or aiding local fire departments or increasing medical research through nih that is there are in a civilized society some very important purposes that can best be accomplished by individuals spending their own money personally and that is what the market generates and that is a good thing but there are also important purposes particularly in a complex urban society that can only be done jointly and that is why we come together through government to deal with the environment to deal with public safety to deal with elderly people and other peoples children who will not themselves be able to make it what this is is an announcement that democracy does not work that the fundamental scheme of government adopted in 1787 in the constitution is flawed and therefore it has to be changed fortunately as the dearth of members in this chamber shows no one takes it seriously it is a political gesture put forward by a party that has no substantive legislative agenda and i guess given that

that congress failed to adopt a budget it disrupted the appropriations process and made it much more difficult for the entire house to complete any of its legislative business in an orderly way then again last year we adopted a budget but it was an unrealistic budget it was shot full of holes with gimmicks and blue smoke and mirrors it treated things like the decennial census that has been going on since 1790 as an emergency we did not complete action on the appropriations bills until well after the fiscal year had begun we failed the american people again now again this budget resolution is equally unrealistic it is so filled with assumptions that we know will not be met that it is not fair to the american people to even propose it never mind pass it on the floor of the house we know it is not a real budget we know that what this is is not serious legislation but political expediency we would probably be better off doing what we did in 1998 without a budget resolution whether it be the republican leadership budget or the cats budget which are not all that substantively different these republican budgets start with the wholly unrealistic assumption that we will be able to hold nondefense discretionary outlays to 114 billion below inflation over the next 5 years that is not going to happen next year alone as the gentleman from south carolina suggested we will have to cut nearly 20 billion below the level needed just to keep level with inflation yet we know that the congress has increased nondefense appropriations faster than inflation every year since 1996 who are we kidding if we were honest with the american people we would admit that we have no intention of cutting federal law enforcement or education or environmental programs or veterans care you name it we are not going to cut it we are going to do what our constituents demand that we do and at least keep these programs level with inflation h1384 coi who are we kidding ourselves why are we proposing a budget that we know we are not going to hold to maybe we are planning on putting all this money into the supplemental hiding it shifting it from fiscal year 2001 to fiscal year 2000 maybe that will be this years gimmick but it is not right to the american people to be deceiving them in this way the main problem is that to accommodate a tax cut in the range of 200 billion whether it be the republican leadership budget or the cats budget we know that we are putting in place a situation where we are going to be cutting revenue by almost 1 trillion over 10 years those tax cuts are not fair they are not fair to the american people but most importantly they are not fair to our children we have an opportunity today to pay off the debt that we incurred in the 1980s to pay down that debt to

this house of representatives passed real patient protection legislation to correct hmo abuses we passed the norwooddingellganske bipartisan consensus managed care reform act of 1999 with a vote of 275 to so members ask why is that bill not law yet why is not the congressional leadership leaning on the chairman of the conference committee to hold meetings is the conference dead if so then senator nickles should say so so that we can move beyond the failure of the conferences committee every day that goes by without passage into law of a real patient protection bill means that people are being harmed by hmos that care more about their bottom line more about their most recent stock quotes on wall street than they care about patients let me give some examples of people who have been harmed by hmos before coming to congress i was a reconstructive surgeon i took care of little children that were born with birth defects like this little baby with a cleft lip and palate do my colleagues know that in the last several years more than 50 percent of the surgeon who care for children born with this birth defect have had cases like these refused by hmos who call this a cosmetic deformity this is a birth defect the operation to repair this would be to restore towards normalcy that is not a cosmetic case under any definition a couple of years ago now this ladys case was profiled on the cover of time magazine this woman lived in california her hmodid not tell her all that she needed to know furthermore they put pressure on the medicare center treating her not to tell her because she did not get that information in a timely fashion and because her hmo did not play straight with her on getting her the treatment that she needed as medically necessary she died today her children and her husband do not have a mother and a wife a couple of years ago a young woman was hiking in the mountains about 70 miles west of washington d c she fell off a 40foot cliff she broke her pelvis fractured her arm broke her skull was lying at the bottom of this 40foot cliff when her boyfriend who had a cellular phone managed to get a helicopter in they took her to the emergency room she was treated she lived but then do members know what the hmo would not pay her bill because she had not phoned ahead for prior authorization was she supposed to have a crystal ball that was going to tell her that she was going to fall off a 40foot cliff so she could make a phone call to her hmo i have shared these stories with my colleagues in the past but i have some new ones tonight that are going to amaze my colleagues this is also a story a true story about a little boy we can see him here tagging on his sisters sleeve one night his temperature was about 104 or 105 degrees and his mother phoned the 1800 number for their hmo and said my baby needs to go to the emergency room he is really sick she got somebody thousands of miles away who said well i will only authorize you to take him to one emergency room and when the mother asked where it was the person said i do not know find a map it turned out that the hmo was about 60 or 70 miles away en route this little baby had a cardiac arrest if one is a mom and dad driving this little baby to the hospital members can imagine what that was like when they finally found it the mother leaped out of the car holding her little baby screaming save my baby save my baby a nurse came out started resuscitation they put in the i v lines gave him mouthtomouth resuscitation gave him the medicines and they managed to bring his life back all because that hmo did not have the common sense or decency to say if your baby isreally sick take him to the nearest emergency room because en route they passed three emergency rooms but they were not authorized by that hmo this little baby managed to survive but because he had that cardiac arrest he lost the circulation to his hands and his feet and he had to have both hands and both feet amputated why do 80 percentplus of the american public think that congress should pass an hmo reform bill a patient protection bill a real bill because their friends and neighbors have had problems just like some of those that i have shown the members a few years ago there was a movie as good as it gets in that movie helen hunt is talking to her friend jack nicholson and explaining how this hmo that they belong to will not properly take care of her son who has asthma then she let loose a string of expletives that i cannot repeat on the floor of congress but i can tell the members what happened in the theater that my wife and i were in it happened all across the country people started cheering and clapping and even standing up in applause because they knew the truth of that allegation no law has passed because the hmos have spent over 100 million lobbying against real patient protection legislation they have given generously to keepthat legislation bottled up in conference committee even worse the hmo industry is trying to get legislation passed that would undo the progress that is being made on behalf of patients in state legislatures and in the courts the gop bill that recently passed the senate the nickles amendment is worse than no bill at all in fact it is an hmo protection bill not a patient protection bill would members like some proof of this let me tell the members about some of the things that have been documented in a recent article in smart money magazine in their july issue l 2000 consider the case of jim ridler it was shortly after noon on a friday back in august 1995 and jim ridler then 35 years old had been out doing some errands he was returning to his home in a small town in minnesota on his motorcycle when a minivan coming from the opposite direction swerved into his lane it hit jim head on it threw him more than 200 feet into a ditch he broke his neck his collar bone his hip severalribs all of the bones in both legs it ripped his triceps muscle clean through over the next 4 months after a dozen surgeries he still did not know whether he would ever walk again when he got a phone call from his lawyer who had started legal proceedings against the driver of that minivan who had swerved into his path that call that he got from his lawyer really shook him up im afraid ive got some bad news for you said his lawyer he told jim that even if jim won his lawsuit his health plan wanted to take a big chunk out of it that they had spent on his care youre joking right said jim nope said the lawyer jims health plan had a clause in its contract that allowed the hmo to stake a claim in his settlement a claim known in insurance as subrogation so i pay the premium and then something happens that i need the insurance for and they want their money back ridler asked incredulously the way i figure it my health insurance is just a loan well ridler eventually settled his lawsuit for 450 000 which was all the liability insurance available his health plan then took 406 000 leaving him after expenses with a grand total of 29 000 i feel like iwas raped by the system he says do my colleagues know what most people are

challenges in exciting innovative ways with our beyond the beltway project we are hoping as freshmen to open new doors for these leaders we know that for far too long federal rules and bureaucracies have held them back and smothered their efforts through unnecessary burdens and restrictions now the freshmen are reaching out to leaders like my own governor governor tommy thompson in an effort to help them unleash a whole new wave of creativity and innovation in state after state it is the freshmen who are initiating this project because even though we are members of congress we are very much still state legislators local officials and private sector small business persons at heart here specifically is what the beyond the beltway project will do the freshman class as a group have asked our governors legislative leaders directly and through the various associations to help us identify some of those federal rules and restrictions that are holding them back we want to turn these suggestions into an ongoing action agenda member by member and issue by issue we want to provide relief we are coming forward now with the beyond the beltway initiative because we have also introduced the first measure result from this new dialogue this legislation would direct each federal agency to develop an expedited review process for waiver requests as we know oftentimes states need federal approval or waivers to initiate their state programs if those plans deviate from the details of federal programs e0 0915 the idea of this legislation is that where a state has been granted a waiver on a particular program if another state seeks a similar waiver we believe that they should only have to go through a streamlined or expedited waiver review process we want to encourage the laboratories of democracy we want to encourage modeling we want to encourage benchmarking we want to encourage borrowing of ideas i would hope that my colleagues would join us in this expedited review bill and more importantly join the republican freshmen in developing beyondthebeltway ideas this is more than a shortterm project we hope it is the beginning of a new longer more open relationship between congress and the states instead of the governors coming to us on bended knee we are hoping to go to them for ideas and suggestions we want to turn them loose we believe that there is no telling how many of our major social political challenges can be met if only we will move power and authority out of washington and beyond the beltway"], [0.017704874277114868, 0.48229512572288513, 0, "2 years ago this house and this congress and the president joined with us in enacting the first balanced budget in 28 years a balanced budget which contained key middle class tax cuts thanks to that middle class tax cut we are enjoying a booming economy and a 3 trillion projected budget surplus of course under the republican budget we set aside twothirds of the surplus for medicare and social security onethird we use of course for ta4 relief i would also point out under this republican budget this year the third baianced budget in 3 years we are going to set aside 6 for debt retirement for every dollar in tax relief i also want to point out in this tax relief package that we are working on right now that we are addressing a question that i have raised in this house and that is is it right is it fair that under our tax code today married working couples pay more in taxes just because they are married a key provision of the financial freedom act of course is efforts to eliminate the marriage tax penalty for almost 28 million married working couples who will receive 243 in marriage tax relief and it is time think about it 243 that is a months car payment for a lot of families this legislation deserves bipartisan support"], [0.017704874277114868, 0.48229512572288513, 0, "2 years ago we approved legislation which allows parents to put aside 500 each year in education savings accounts where the money can be invested in order to grow tax free and where it can be added to each year so that it can grow enough to help pay for college tuition ever since we managed to get education savings accounts enacted into law we have been trying to raise the amounts parents are allowed to put into their childrens accounts each year we have been trying to extend education savings accounts so that parents grandparents or other interested parties will be able to use them to prepare for private or parochial elementary or high school expenses if a family vere able to put 2 000 in an education savings accounts every year from the time a child was born and if the account averaged 7 percent interest annually it would hold 14 500 by the time the child got to 1st grade if nothing were withdrawn and annual savings continued that amount would rise to 46 500 when it was time for high school president clinton vetoed an extension of education savings accounts last september but i am confident that most of us in the house think parents should be encouraged to save for their kids futures and that is why we are going to try again"]]}
