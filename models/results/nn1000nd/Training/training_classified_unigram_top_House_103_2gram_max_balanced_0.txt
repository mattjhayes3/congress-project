two years ago i came here as a former small business owner thinking that i could have a real opportunity to help this nations small businesses however i found out over the last 2 weeks that that is not necessarily true let me tell what happened the lkst 2 weeks several weeks ago i found out that sba a federal agency that is supposed to act as an advocate of small businesses spent over 100 000 of taxpayers money to promote employee mandates i was shocked that the sba would do such a thing especially since small business owners and employees overwhelmingly oppose employer mandates they are frightened for good reason every credible study predicts substantial job losses as a result of the employer mandates so i decided to offer an amendment which would change this ridiculous situation my amendment was simple it would prohibit the sba from spending taxpayer dollars to promote employer mandates the first thing i found out is that my amendment will not be allowed to be offered on the floor unless the rules committee approves the rules committee decides which amendments can and cannot be offered on the house floor for debate so i went to the rules committee to offer my amendment i thought that this was a simple amendment and that it should not have any problem being accepted when i walked into the rules committee i was surprised i found out something interesting there are nine democrats and only four republicans serving on that committee suddenly i had a bad feeling about my amendments chances sure enough the democratcontrolled rules committee rejected my amendment remember my amendment is simply asking sba not to spend taxpayers money to promote employer mandates it was simply rejected they said that the sba bill was not the appropriate place to debate health care issues despite the fact that my amendment dealt specifically with the sba and despite the fact that our own house parliamentarian ruled that my amendment was perfectly germane this ruling was obviously very unfair so i went to the house floor to try and overturn the rules committees decision and you can guess it i was defeated again even though 10 brave democrats stood up lid joined all of the republicans in voting to overturn this unfair decision my amendment again was blocked despite this defeat i was not willing to give up the fight for small businesses in fact i found out that i had one last chance to get a vote on my amendment i decided to offer a socalled motion to recommit which would have forced the house to debate and vote on my amendment just as i was preparing to offer my motion the democratic leadership removed the entire sba billthe bill i was trying to amendoff the floor why did they do this let me tell you why because they did not want to have a vote on my amendment they are scared to have a vote on my amendment they are terrified that this body might actually pass my amendment and reveal the truth that the american people dont want employer mandates and being taken over by government small business people do not want employer mandates california people do not want employer mandates because they know that with employer mandates it is not a question of whether jobs will be lost it is just a question of how many jobs will be lost this is exactly why the american people are so frustrated with congress they are frustrated because instead of debating issues openly and honestly the democrat leadership of this body delays and hides behind parliamentary rules the american people are frustrated because instead of telling the truth about employer mandates the democratic leadership uses its dominance of the house to force members to toe the biggovernment line on health care reform the american people should know the democrat leadership is holding a bill hostage which would provide funding for an entire agency because they do not want to deal with employer mandates which is my amendment sadly this is just business as usual in the

for these programs at the current level under the democrat bill the spending would skyrocket from 388 million this year to 541 million in fiscal year 1994 and 1 billion in fiscal year 1995 my amendment would prevent this profligacy and save the taxpayers 800 million it was just a few short weeks ago that the democrats in this house passed a 5year budget plan which included the largest tax increase in american history we were told then by the democrat majority that this hefty contribution on the part of hard working taxpayers was necessary to reduce the federal budget deficit and here they propose increasing spending on corporate giveaway programs by 158 percent and what does h r 820 do under this bill the federal government is going to build an enormous network of technology centers so bureaucrats can show business men and women what machines to buy and how to run their businesses and the same people who gripe about socalled junk bonds are putting uncle sam in the venture capital business if you thought the s l crisis was bad wait until bureaucrats start making multimilliondollar commercial loans and finally the government is going to spend hundreds of millions each year picking winners and losers in the name of promoting technology here is what we are saying to the taxpayers today the government that brought you amtrak the post office the usda and 500 toilet seats at the pentagon is going to teach real entrepreneurs how to beat international competition the reason this bill is on the floor of course is that the majority believes that committees here in congress and the bureaucrats at the commerce department know how to run the economy as george will noted in a column 2 weeks ago the liberals in washington dc believe they know far more about competing in the marketplace than the undiscerning men and women who have risked their life savings to start a real business in the real world well let us take a look at what the democrat majority has already done for business this year it has heaped another mandate on workers and business in the form of mandated leave legislation it has passed a budget resolution which promises business higher energy and corporate income taxes the majority has promised the business community and the country another 5 years of huge budget deficits which will deprive the private sector access to capital but we have only just begun on the way is striker replacement and the rest of the big labor and trial lawyer agenda which will undermine americas competitiveness the finest illustration of the economic illiteracy of the majority is this the democrat party opposes indexing the capital gains taxwhich lowers the cost of capitalyet supports indexing the minimum wagewhich increases the cost of labor but the democrats are here to help business today they say the party that beleaguers business with higher taxes and regulations at every opportunity now wants to help the majority wants to promote economic growth and jobs through investment sounding ironically like supplyside onservativq republicans but as my friend jude wanniski says the majority is operating on the dark side of the supplyside modelinvesting in government bureaucracies instead of the private sector so as russia sweden mexico france poland and on and onmove away from state planning to emulate the american model of free enterprise the majoritywhile paying lipservice to the market seeks to move more and more resources from the productive private sector to the wasteful public sector if my democrat friends are genuinely interested in creating real jobs in the private sector they should consider this over the last 4 years the tax and regulatory burden on small business has increased 34 percent these small businesses create 76 percent of the new jobs in the economy if you want to help the entrepreneur lower his cost of capital stop tying his hands with unnecessary red and green tape do not raise his energy costs and corporate taxes reform americas legal liability laws amend antiquated antitrust law in short get the government off the backs of small business but do not burden all businesses with massive new taxes and regulations and then give away a billion dollars to the politically wellconnected that will not make america more competitive i would close with a quote from adam smith who warned us of politicians who were onceited enough to try to direct an economy he wrote the statesman who should attempt to direct private people in what manner they ought to employ their capitals would net only

had folly and presumption enough to fancy himself fit to exercise it support the armey freeze amendment heed the advice of adam smith save the taxpayers over 3800 million and limit the damage that

of the freshman class in this body when these members ran for election last year did they tell the voters that they were intending to vote for the largest tax increase in unitedstates history i dont think so did they tell the votersthat they would cast their vote to raise taxes dramatically long before ever voting for any spending cuts i dont think so i dont think my colleagues ran as business as usual tax and spend democrats well then let me explain this budget bill the clinton administration is asking freshmen representatives to support its called the omnibus budget reconciliation act the name is purposely confusing so that the american public is deceived into thinking its something harmless or even good i want the american public to know that this now budget bill really is the largest tax increase in american history it will cost american taxpayers at least 332 billion over the next 5 years as a freshman i have a hard time committing american taxpayers to 332 billion as an engineer i always like to quantify figures using basic math lets see how much this tax hike will really mean to the american family my district is one of 435 districts so i took 332 billion and divided it by 435 the result is 760 million per district that means my district in california alone would be obligated to pay 760 million in new taxes over the next 5 years then i took this simple math a step further there are about 570 000 people in my district so i divided 760 million by 570 000 people i was shocked to see that every man woman and child would have to come up with over 1 300 this means that the average family of 5 will be assessed nearly 7 000 in new tax increases let me repeat 7 000 in new tax increases america has never had this huge a tax increase in its entire history but thats not all this tax bill also includes a new btu tax again lets be honest this is a hidden gas tax this btu tax means 8 cents a gallon that might not should like much but it is were told avg 450 yr of new btu taxes per family is not that big a deal to the average american family i guess this is true its only the price of 2 haircuts but this is not all this btu tax is indexed annually for inflation the cost of this new tax will grow higher and higher each year but wait there is more the btu tax isnt just a gas tax on automobiles it also translates into more taxes on electricity water heating oil and almost every other products so by the time all these new taxes are added together i wouldnt be surprised if the total burden to the average family of 5 will exceed 10 000 in new tax increases thats outrageous we must stop this madness the point i raise for my fellow democratic freshmen is that a yes vote on this tax bill will have grave consequences in 1994 good luck going home and telling people that we voted for the biggest tax increase in unitedstates history i just wanted to quantify this bill using simple mathematics so that the american public will be told the truth let me repeat for the average family of five were looking at nearly 10 000 new taxes i say dont raise taxes no nation has ever taxed its way into prosperity cut these hundreds of wasteful government subsides

refusing to allow any of the significant cutting amendments to be offered and debated on this floor the democrat leadership in a cute little ployand you just heard it recited by the manager herein a cute little ploy made in order six small amendments have you people listened to it up there do you know what those six small amendments were for they were good amendments but none of them individually

six of these amendments pass all six that were magnanimously made in order which my good friend the gentleman from texas has said they were really gracious in allowing all these amendments if all six were allowed to pass they would not even cut our legislative budget by a tenth of 1 percent that means that congress this year will continue to spend on itself almost the same amount that it always has while socking it to the taxpayers of this nation to portray this legislative budget as a costcutting bill is a charade the american people have had enough they have had it with a congress that

this no democrats ruled the congress but we had republican presidents we had disastrous plans for the 1980s to fix the budget so we all had republicans and democrats our fingers in it together we dont make any claim to the contrary this plan advocated by president clinton is more of the same old warmedover dinner it did not work in the 1980s and it will not work in the 1990s focus for a minute if you will on what the formula has been it is always a promised immediate tax hike followed by a promised future set of spending reductions when was this formula tried we began in 1982 with the first disastrous tax hike up until that point the biggest in history tefra it was called in 1984 we had defra in 1987 we had another effort in 1989 yet another in 1990 the disastrous budget summit agreement that cost george bush his presidency now the democrats led by president clinton come into this chamber and before the united states ask us once again to put blinders on and pretend the emperor is wearing a magnificent suit of clothes in reality it is just the same old failed nonsense we get immediate promised tax hikes now the largest in history and promised future spending reductions of course it turns out when you read the fine print that even in this plan we discover there will be no net spending reductions for the first 2 years of the plan we will never get beyond the first 2 years of the plan that is the idea dont you think it is fascinating we have a 5year plan and we get the first couple of years and then we are onto a new 5year plan with yet more tax increases and further spending reductions look at this chart these numbers have changed a little bit i am going to be very honest this is a moving target and this chart was prepared a month ago so they are a little different let me just outline briefly what the effect of the clinton plan is it is 140 billion in new spending under these numbers 359 billion in new taxes and after we go through all of that what do we end up with after we penalize farmers and bluecollar workers and middleclass workers and everybody in this country shared sacrifice it is like socialism equal sharing of misery as churchill said what do we end up with we end up with an annual budget deficit of 228 5 billion the gentleman from texas the ranking member of the committee on ways and means tells me this is now projected to be 250 billion but it is over 200 billion wherever the numbers may fall what does that do for us it is a serious fiscal risk for this country to end up after the largest tax increase in history and energy tax that is going to cost 600 000 jobs and the effect of the other taxes in the clinton plan may be to cost 1 to 2 million jobs and then we end up with an enormous annual deficit let me show the members by comparison what has happened in the past this chart is not upside down it just so happens that the government has not had a very good record with its budget in past years look this goes clear back to 1940 these are inflationadjusted dollars look at what happened here in world war i in inflationadjusted dollars we had annual budget deficits of over 500 billion but look here near the end of world war ii the tremendous drop that occurred down to about 180 billion guess what folks the next year there was a surplus a surplus that is about 45 billion under this pathetic administration plan after huge tax increases we will end up with an annual budget deficit of over 3200 billion after 5 years and having added a cumulative total to our existing national debt which is about 4 trillion now it will be 5 trillion that will not work it will not work for farmers it will not work for housewives it will not work for children it will not work for senior citizens it will not work for anyone who hopes to thrive in this republic a good democrat john f kennedy used to say a rising tide lifts all boats another way of saying that is when the rich get richer the poor get richer sure we can go back into socialism and have the equal sharing of misery kind of like we got a taste of that right now it is going to get worse if we enact the clinton plan we have had various statements about farmers let me quote from the president of the american farm bureau federation writing to president clinton he said i am compelled to express our members deep concern about the energy tax proposal and your proposed economic package if imposed this tax will stifle economic output increase production costs for farmers cause farm prices to decline and jeopardize our ability to compete in the world markets agricultural products are processed packaged and transported to consumers they will be more costly due to the multiplier effect of energy cost increases at each point in the food distribution chain we ought to get real and recognize the key to balancing this budget freeze it is a reduction in spending when i hear about how many billions that are being cut that is only inside the beltway they are not cutting anything as far as i can tell they are merely reductions below the planned increases but they are net increases it is a disaster we have got to quit talking like that if you are going to talk about a cut tell me that you are spending less next year than you are spending this year that is a cut that is the type of approach we are going to have to take or at least a freeze so we allow the growth in the economy to reduce the deficit paul craig roberts wrote an article saying that if president reagan had continued the partial freeze in spending in 1987 for 2 more years his administration would not have been known for its deficits what we need to do is recognize there is an economic emergency in this country and that does not mean you go out and pour money out the door from the federal government and not be subject to the phoney 1990 budget rules the payasyougo rules like we have done time and time again what it means is you stop spending and you let the budget gap close to the natural growth in the budget that is the formula for success and that is what will help farmers and everyone else so in this agriculture committee and in this presentation i thank the ranking member for the chance to address the house on these important issues we have got to recognize that control of spending is what is lacking here we do not need any tax increases of any

something else about canadian health care there are 177 000 canadians who are waiting for operations they are waiting in line for operations because you know what socialism causes lines if you do not think so go to the kremlin sometime take a trip to some of those liberated countries in eastern europe socialism causes lines and about 25 percent of the people who were surveyed in canada of those

examinations americans do not want to walk in with 15 or 20 people and do an examination en masse that is japan they are heavy on efficiency they are a little bit short on privacy let us look at great britain which has socialized medicine that socialism that winston churchill described as shared misery they have a system in which senior citizens elderly people are not given lifesaving operations that is because socialism never works very effectively and they ran out of money so they tell senior citizens who are over a certain age you cannot have this lifesaving operation because you have lived a long and full life and you have to fall off the tree like a leaf in the autumn and let a younger person have that lifesaving operation that is great unless you happen to have fathers and mothers and grandfathers and grandmothers who mean something to you and you know american families have a lot of grandmothers and grandfathers who mean something to them and so we do not want to have that brand of socialized medicine to date this administration has not shown us one model country that has a medical system a socialized medical system that we should follow last let me talk about something that is kind of near and dear to americans hearts that is a job remember that gentleman herb kane who stood with the president on a nationally televised program and he said he is a guy who owns godfathers pizza his father worked three jobs a day so he could go to college and become a success and herb kane said mr president i have put a pencil to your numbers here to your plan i will have to fire a lot of people i am paraphrasing him he said this is not going to work out i am going to have to close down franchises and get rid of folks the president said to him i do not know why you just cannot raise the cost of your pizza i could see a look of shock on mr kanes face and when he addressed the republicans recently he said to the effect if i could get more money for my pizzas i would be doing it you cannot just raise the price of your product and expect to continue in business he said i am asked by people why i do not feel i have a duty to give every single person who works for me a health care plan he says that is because my first duty is to give them a job and we are going to lose a lot of jobs under socialized medicine the plan that the gentleman from missouri is putting together with other democrat leaders right now is socialized medicine it is socialized medicine that is going to require employer mandates that means employers are going to have to pay a big new tax we have a group that is a think tank and there is plenty of think tanks around the country but the consad study group did an evaluation on how many american jobs will be lost under the ways and means committee plan that is the democratcontrolled committee that developed the plan in this house that is being followed by the gentleman from missouri by the democrat leadership is putting together their socialized medicine plan let me tell you how many jobs they say will be lost and how many will be affected what is an affected job it is a job not lost it is a job where you never get any raise you do not get any raise because your employer is spending the money he would have used to give you a raise buying this health care plan that he is forced to buy by government so let me tell

victim of the mistaken judicial interpretations of erisa that this bill is designed to correct in july a federal court misread erisa to deprive the commonwealth of pennsylvania of its right to require payment of prevailing wages on public projects involving state or local moneys this court decision was wrong and should be overturned by this bill pennsylvanias tradition of regulating the terms of employment on public contract work dates back to the last century the current prevailing wage act is more than 30 years old there is no way that congress intended erisa to deprive pennsylvania or any other state of the fundamental right to set the terms and conditions under which contracts for public works and services are awarded the federal government sets the terms and conditions of its public contracts it cannot deny that right to state and local governments at least in the absence on any conflict with federal law or policy erisa was intended to federalize the regulation of employee pension and health plans state prevailing wage laws like pennsylvanias do not conflict with this regulatory scheme these state laws do not regulate benefit plans or interfere with their operations they do not require employers to create or maintain plans employers who do not have pension or health plans can substitute cash wages in lieu of plan contributions to satisfy their prevailing wage obligations pennsylvania does require all employees on public contract to pay their workers no less than cash wages prevailing in the community where the project is located and does not allow this minimum to be offset by benefit contributions in excess of the prevailing rate of contributions the setting of a minimum wage is a fundamental state right preserved even under the federal fair labor standards act that act sets a floor which the states are free to raise h r 1036 is a states rights bill it does not require any state to enact or to retain a prevailing wage law an apprenticeship

subcommittee on interior mr yates and the ranking member mr regula for their efforts in bringing the bill to the floor every appropriations bill represents its product of hundreds of difficult choices

the millions of americans that live and work in that ecosystem i would like to point out a few programs for which this appropriation makes money available that are especally importaht to the nation and to constituents in wisconsins third congressional district the first involves research into containment and ultimately eradication of the zebra mussel tfl explosive growth of zebra mussel populations in the great lakes has cost communities states the federal government and private businesses and individuals hundreds of millions of dollars in public infrastructure private property and environmental damage this bill makes over 1 million available for research into ways to better cope with this plague and to eradicate this economically and environmentally damaging pest im proud to say that much of this research which will benefit the entire 28 state mississippi river drainage basin is carried out at the national fisheries research center in la crosse wi this appropriation also makes approximately 600 000 available for research which will speed the process for fda approval of drugs and chemicals vital to american aquaculture the limited commercial market for these fishery chemicals has slowed research into their safety and efficacy and thus the entire fda approval process as a result american aquaculture has suffered the moneys provided in h r 2520 will fund the research necessary to win fda approval for the highest priority drugs and chemicals needed to control disease reduce stress and better manage water quality in aquaculture facilities across the nation

on preservation of americas environmentally complex large river systems as many of my colleagues know i have long been involved in efforts to foster better management and more efficient stewardship of these national resources an environmental management program targeted to this objective has been in place on the upper mississippi since 1986 and i have introduced new legislation h r 2500 which would
