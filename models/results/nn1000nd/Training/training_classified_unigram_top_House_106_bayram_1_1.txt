against the amendment printed in the report the rule also allows the chair to accord priority in recognition to members who have preprinted their amendfurther it allows the chairman of the committee of the whole to postpone votes during consideration of the bill and to reduce voting time to 5 minutes on a postponed question if the vote follows a 15minute vote finally the rule provides one motion to recommit with or without instructions the wildlife and sports fish restoration programs improvement actof 2000 h r 3671 is a bill to enhance the use of funds available for grants to states for fish and wildlife conservation projects and to increase opportunities for recreational hunting bow hunting trapping archery and fishing the legislation accomplishes this by eliminating opportunities for waste fraud abuse mismanagement and unauthorized expenditures the committee on resources held three oversight hearings examining the manner in which the fish and wildlife service through its division of federal aid administered and executed the pittmanrobertson act and the dingelljohnson act the hearings of the committee on resources made it clear that funds committed for the administration and execution of these programs had not been used for their stated purposes and that there was a general lack of fiscal accountability and management throughout the programs h r 3671 stops wasteful spending and mismanagement of the wildlife and sports fish trust funds and allows more money to be distributed directly to the states for conservation programs the legislation fixes what the gao called quote one of the worst managed programs it had ever encountered by increasing accountability and restricting the administrative use of funds from the trust funds specifically h r 3671 restricts the use of administrative funds reserved from federal excise taxes on hunting and fishing equipment to purposes directly related to the pittmanjohnson wildlife restoration act and the dingelljohnson sport fish restoration act further the legislation established 12 categories of authorized costs for the wildlife restoration act and sports fish restoration act and provides that administrative funds will be available for one fiscal year after which all unobligated funds will be returned to the states through the apportionment formula h r 3671 also requires the secretary of interior to certify in writing the amount apportioned to each state and the amount obligated for administering those programs in addition the wildlife and sport fish restoration programs improvement act provides grants from the savings generated from the administrative changes in the bill to enhance firearm and bow hunter education and shooting range construction the legislation also provides up to 2 5 million for the secretary of interior to make multistate conservation grants finally the legislation requires increased accountability within the fish and wildlife service through certification of the use of funds and administrative restructuring the committee on resources reported h r 3671 as amended by a unanimous vote of 36 to nothing last march h res 455 makes in order an amendment by the gentleman from alaska chairman young to increase the amount authorized to administer the pittmanrobertson act and the dingelljohnson act to 7 09 million for each act an increase of 5 million for each act with the reduction of these funds in later years the amendment also makes certain technical changes and changes to ensure that the bill language conforms to language in the existing statute language that is not amended by the bill finally the cbo has estimated that enacting h r 3671 would have no net effect on the federal budget the committee on rules was pleased to grant the request of the gentleman from alaska for an open rule under h r 3671 and accordingly i urge my colleagues to support h res 455 and the underlying bill i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.00575406476855278,

idea i must say that when i talk to teachers back home and school superintendents back home this is one of the greatest topics of concern in many cases many of the younger newer teachers think all of a sudden in the last few years we invented idea which is not the case of course it was passed in 1975 when we took the republicans took control of congress we tried to deal with some of the discipline problems just 2 years ago that are occurring in idea so this is sort of new news to youngsters who are just out of college and just started teaching let me begin by stating that i doubt that there can be a more important job in america than teaching our children i do not know what it would be this is especially true of our special education teachers education for those with disabilities allows all of our children to have the opportunity to learn and succeed ensuring that all of our children have a safe and orderly environment in which to learn must be and is a top priority most every teacher i have talked to about idea brings up the problem of classroom discipline teachers tell me that there is a great double standard that exists when disciplining disabled students for instance a nondisabled student who brings a gun to school can face a much stronger disciplinary action than a disabled child who engages in that very same activity we need to make sure that our teachers and students are protected in the classroom while at the same time ensuring that disabled students are fairly treated this is critical if we are going to make sure that our children disabled and nondisabled have a good learning environment a good order at their schools learning will soon become a casualty if it has not already if we do not do this and soon enough our children will become economic casualtie6 if they do not learn well i believe that we should trust our teachers to determine who should be in the classroom they will know firsthand which students are discipline problems and which students are just having a hard time reading up to their grade level they will know how to deal compassionately with those students with disabilities who because of their disability may be disrupting the classroom experience of others we can and should provide a good education for all without putting our teachers in this untenable position in addition i want to speak a minute about this unfunded mandate that the gentleman from pennsylvania was talking about we have since 1975 mandated to our states that they do certain things at the school districts the same law that mandated what our special education teachers have to do said we the federal government will fund that we will pick up 40 percent of the tab you at home pick up 60 percent of the tab that simply has not been the case it has been only under the gentlemans leadership over the last 4 years that we have finally gotten the funding level up to 12 percent that is a long long way from 40 percent now what does that mean that means people at home who are paying property taxes that go to their schools who want to use that money to add new teachers do not have it because they are funding special education if we want to use that money for bricks and mortars which we should do at home to build new schools we do not have it because it is going to special education and the federal government is just simply not keeping its word and i will yield back after making one point my great state of georgia for example is a perfectly good example we received almost 54 million as part of this mandated special education money but had we received what the law required it would have been over 276 million we received 54 million by law we should have received 276 million we can fix a lot of roofs in georgia and we can hire a whole lot of teachers back in georgia if the federal government will do what you are trying to get them to do and fund their comparison of substate idea grants and maximum comparison of

representing the south side of chicago and the south suburbs communities like joliet and lancing and morris and rural communities like tonica and elsewhere and they often ask me a pretty basic question that question is as we talk about taxes they say why why do married working couples a husband and wife who are both in the workforce why do they pay higher taxes when they get married they ask is it right is it fair that under our tax code married working couples pay higher taxes on average 25 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 more in higher taxes than identical couples who choose not to get married but live together outside of marriage that is not right the folks back home tell me that it is time that those of us here in washington should do something about it that we should work to eliminate what has been called the marriage tax penalty 1 400 the average marriage tax penalty is a lot of money back home in illinois 1 400 is one years tuition for a nursing student at joliet junior college our local community college it is three months of day care for a working mom and dad with children it is almost 4 000 diapers for a family with a newborn child it is real money for real people and there are of course some here in washington who say they would much rather spend that money here in washington than bring about tax fairness by eliminating the marriage tax penalty well i am proud to say this house is doing something about the marriage tax penalty last year we passed and sent legislation to the president which would have wiped out the marriage tax penalty for over 25 million couples and unfortunately president clinton and vice president gore vetoed that bill they had a lot of excuses they wanted to spend that money but this year there is no excuse we have valentines day approaching and what better gift to give 25 million married working couples who suffer the marriage tax penalty than to pass legislation wiping out the marriage tax penalty this thursday we will be considering in the house legislation approved by the committee on ways and means h r 6 the marriage tax elimination act which i am proud to say now has 236 cosponsors including almost 30 democrats who have joined with us in our effort to eliminate the marriage tax penalty we help real people let me introduce a couple here this couple here shad and michelle hallihan of joliet illinois two public school teachers in joliet illinois they happen to make about 60 000 in combined income from their two teaching salaries and shad and michelle suffer almost the average marriage tax penalty well under the legislation that the house is going to be considering this week shad and michelle will benefit because two public school teachers who chose to get married who now suffer the marriage tax penalty will essentially have their marriage tax penalty wiped out michelle told me the other day she says congressman tell your friends in the congress particularly those who believe it is not a good idea to eliminate the marriage tax penalty what wiping out the marriage tax penalty would mean for them they say 1 000 which is essentially the marriage tax penalty would buy 3 000 diapers for their newborn baby that is money that is currently going to washington that they could use to take care of their child frankly if we want to be fair it is their money we should eliminate the marriage tax penalty this thursday h r 6 the marriage tax elimination act will help couples like shad and michele hallihan we do it in several ways we double the standard deduction onehalf of married couples do not itemize their taxes they use the standard deduction so we double it for joint filers the marriage penalty is created when a married couple of course get married they file their taxes jointly their combined income usually pushes them into a higher tax bracket that is what pushes shad and michelle into the 28 percent bracket what we want to do of course is for the nonitemizers which is about half of the married couples who suffer the marriage penalty to double the standard deduction for joint filers to make it twice that of singles for those who itemize who are the other half of married couples who suffer the marriage tax penalty those who itemize are homeowners the average middleclass family itemizes their taxes because they own a home we want to help them and provide marriage tax relief as well so we widen the 15 percent bracket the basic tax bracket that every one of us pays we are all in the 15 percent bracket regardless of our income for the lowest bottom bracket of our income by widening the bracket so that joint filers married couples can earn twice as much as a single filer and be in that same bracket we help those who itemize we also help the working poor there is a marriage penalty for the earned income credit and we provide tax relief for them this thursday let us have an overwhelming bipartisan majority let us work together let us eliminate the marriage tax penalty there are no excuses we want to be fair eliminate the marriage tax penalty"], [0.008823703043162823, 0.008823703043162823, 0, "a lot of americans look at what the government does and conclude that many of the things that it does simply make no sense the marriage tax penalty certainly falls into that category the federal government has actually set up a system that makes married couples pay more in taxes than couples that live together but are not married when people shake their heads when they hear about the latest crazy scheme coming out of washington this is exactly the kind of thing that they have in mind there is no telling what absurd rationale the social engineers had in mind when they set up the marriage tax penalty but americans with common sense think it is time finally for some accountability it is time to get rid of this dumb idea of taxing people more just because they get married it is time to bring a little middle america common sense to a tax code that is an affront to the common sense of american citizens and it is time that we reduce taxes for all americans across the board we are just overtaxing this country let us finally do something about it and lower taxes"], [0.009145615622401237, 0.009145615622401237, 0, "i would now like to shift gears and talk about the federal public lands the largest landowner in the united states is the federal government and by far by far the largest owners of land are the federal government the state government the city government the local districts et cetera et cetera et cetera we depend very heavily on the use of public lands i thought i would begin tonight by showing some examples of some beautiful public lands now i am a little biased in this regard my state the state i represent is the state of colorado and i have been very fortunate to represent the 3rd district of the state of colorado many people have been to aspen many have heard of glenwood springs or steamboat or telluride or durango breckenridge summit county grand junction there are a number of different communities that some people have visited they know about the colorado rockies the colorado rockies are a gem they are a diamond for the united states we need to do what we can do to preserve those while at the same time while at the same time allowing people to live out there we are going to cover a little of that let me first of all point out this is in the district i will use my red pointer here we will see the red pointer on the sky above the mountains this is the maroon bells one of the most beautiful settings and i am sure many of my colleagues have been there this is fall obviously which can be seen by the colors many many thousands and thousands of visitors whether handicapped whether 19 years old and have great big legs everybody gets to have access that can get here can go up there and see this beautiful beautiful gem of our country the maroon bells i know the maroon bells i was born about 40 miles away my brother climbed the maroon bells when he was 14 years old right there on that peak where the red dot is unfortunately during that climb a rock came off the top he was in outward bound school and it killed his instructor he was 14 or 15 years old we have a lot of family history and there are a lot of people in this country that have a lot of history in these mountain ranges i am from the mountains so are many of us but the mountains are something we believe in we have a strong heritage with the mountains we want to protect the mountains now that is what this looks like today see my red beeper my little light there the lake that is how it looks today why does it look like that today is it because we allowed oil well drilling to go up on top of it no is it because we put mines in there no is it because we clear cut all the sides no is it because we let them fish out the lake no is it because we let them pollute the water no what is my point my point is that for 200 years and before that with the native americans we have taken care of this land washington d c would like to convince us that this thing is full of oil rigs that the timber that the small families that make a living off timber go up there and clear cut this land that the fishermen fish out the streams that the streams are polluted and that the only way to do this is move the west wing of the white house to now have that command center for the western united states they think it matches west wing western united states so they come up with a program 40 million acres now what does 40 million acres mean many people if they own a home they are on a lot size maybe they have i do not know half an acre a half an acre where their home is located imagine 80 million times that half an acre that they own and that is what the president today has proposed to in essence take off limits what i am saying here is these are assets these are museum pieces these mountains are beautiful we know this we want to protect them but we have to use common sense and in using common sense we cannot just do it for the elite people of this country we have to consider the common man of this country and i say that generically we have to speak for the common person in this country do not forget about them not everybody can have a farm or a ranch in aspen colorado not everybody can own a home in aspen colorado i certainly could not afford it and most of my colleagues on this floor could not afford it but that should not keep us from being able to go up and enjoy it it should not keep us from being able to go up and recreate on it like skiing i can say within eyesight of maroon bells one can see several of the major ski areas in the world have they polluted the maroon bells no have they caused clear cutting in the maroon bells no do they provide jobs for colorado yes thousands of jobs do a lot of people get to enjoy the recreation of skiing in aspen colorado yes lots we have to be careful about allowing an administration who by the way rarely sets foot in colorado and last year when they locked off a big chunk of the state of utah they announced it the president announced it in the state of arizona come put your hands in the soil come put your hands in the dirt mr president come see what you are doing before you do it know a little something about it before you talk about it i know about it i was raised there my family has been there for generations let me show my next display here these are the fourteeners look at this all over colorado i will point out there is the young compadre peak this one is the mount of the holy cross right here where my finger is i will put the red pointer so it can be tracked by the red pointer columbine park look at all of these we have over 54 of them over 14 000 feet in colorado form these beautiful mountain ranges do my colleagues see any clearcutting that has gone on no do my colleagues see any oil rigs no do my colleagues see tents and cities and condominiums and town homes all over those 14 000 foot peaks no why do my colleagues not see them it is because we protect this land but we protect it with common sense we do not lock everybody out of there one can ski on some of those mountains one can cross country ski in the summer guess what we have discovered something it is a wonderful sport it is a fabulous sport mountain biking one gets to mountain bike a lot of this does it tear up those mountains no are people who use those mountains responsible for the most part yes for the ones who are not let us go after them if this is an asset if they are going to abuse it kick them off but do not kick them off in general just because they are human beings do not put all of the four systems of the united states into a museum the federal lands i will show my colleagues a couple other here real quick this right here this is a winter scene here in colorado take a close look at that look at that snow do my colleagues see bulldozer tracks through that snow no my colleagues do not even see snow machine tracks through that snow why because we have designated trails we manage those lands out there those lands are not just important to the united states they are important to those of us who make a living off of those lands my inlaws for example david and sue ann smith my colleagues ought to visit them they live in meeker colorado you want to talk about salt of the earth people you want to talk about environmentalists do my colleagues know why they are environmentalists they have got their hand in the soil every day ask him what he thinks about that ranch ask him what he thinks about that ranch when people come up and offer him millions of dollars for that property they do not want to sell it they love that land the smith family is pretty representative of most of the ranching families i mean the president is about to go out and destroy the way of the west the territory remember the judge from the supreme court go west young man go west maybe it was greeley horace greeley said that go west young man go west do not wipe it out do not make it an urban area do not restrict it for the presidents museum at the white house work with us and help us protect this in a common sense approach a common sense approach this is colorado these are more peaks that i want my colleagues to see beautiful absolutely beautiful those are protected president clinton does not need to skip in and protect them any more than they are protected right now we are preserving them we know how to take care of this land what i am saying to my colleagues in my district alone and i say my district the peoples district that i am lucky enough and fortunate enough to represent in that district alone we have over 23 million acres of governmentowned land 23 million acres we take darn good care of that land we have a lot of uses of that land recreational land recreation wilderness areas we do have some timber we have very little mining left anymore we have a lot of different uses for that land president theodore roosevelt i want to quote him because the president in the last couple of days wants to put out an image that he is the theodore roosevelt the teddy roosevelt who rode in on the bucking bronco to save the west let me tell my colleagues what teddy roosevelt said i think it is very important here because he talks to the common man president teddy roosevelt was known as a common man he understood the ways of the east he understood the ways of the west i think before somebody lifts themselves to that standard they ought to at least qualify for it let us talk about teddy roosevelt conservation conservation means development as much as it does protection i recognize the right and the duty of this generation to develop and use the natural resources of our land but i do not recognize the right to waste them or to rob by wasteful use the generations that come after us that is the approach the balanced approach in essence what he is saying is there is a right for people to use these lands but there is no right no right by the people that use these lands to destroy these lands for future generations we have got really two extremes one end of the spectrum over here one end of the spectrum over here this end of the spectrum says hey we ought to be able to go out there and mine it and clearcut it and develop it all we want over here on this extreme we have got organizations like earth first lock them out put everything in wilderness take away the right of multiple use i will talk about multiple use here in a minute take away those rights but do my colleagues know what most people in america and certainly most of the people that live here feel that in the middle ground there we can do both we can allow some ski areas we can allow cross country skiers we can allow mountain bikers we can raft on those wonderful beautiful rivers in colorado we can hike yeah we can allow a power line to go across them to some of our communities that are circled by federal lands there are things we can do with federal lands we are going to restrict it we are going to be balanced on the other hand they also say there are places the same group that says one can ski and ride on mountain bikes and raft down the rivers that same group the middle group as i call it the real westerners as i call it also believe hey there are some areas like the maroon bells that we just saw like this area right here to my left just like this area where my hands are there are some areas we need to lock those away let us put those into wilderness those are appropriate wilderness or let us create a national park just like senator campbell and i did with the black canyon national monument we just converted it to a national park or let us create a new monument or let us make this a specialuse area or let us give this a species status a certain endangered protected status there is a reasonable ground in there what the president has done is laid his chip he has staked out his ground on this extreme to me that is as offensive as the people over here that stake out their claim that say we ought to be able to mine it at any cost let us go in and cut the timber we do not need selected timber cuts lets go in and cut it that is as extreme as the president is attempting to do over here for earth first and that is clearcut those forests abandon those forests and put them into the museum let us talk about a concept that is very important very important for the united states and for all of us to understand during my discussion this evening that is the concept of multiple use now many of us many of my colleagues may have never heard of what multiple use means well obviously one puts use together with multiple it means many uses many different kinds of uses remember just a couple of minutes ago in my comments i talked about skiing mountain biking rafting grazing grazing ones cattle timber mining lots of different uses wilderness environmental fishing things like that those are multiple uses i think this map is an excellent illustration if my colleagues can follow my red dot on the map obviously this is a map of the united states this is government lands my colleagues can see where the blob of government lands are they are not in the east there are some in the carolinas there are some up here in the northern part and illinois and the great lakes but the big bulk of federal lands are right here well when the united states acquired these lands through different acquisition methods the population was all along here in the east and they decided they needed to move the population to the west follow the red dot out to the west well when they got them out here to ohio and nebraska and kansas and texas oklahoma and some of these states out here those are pretty fertile states the way to encourage people to go out west when we wanted to settle the frontier back in the last century was to give them land grants or let them go out and put a stake in the ground and claim that land 120 acres or 160 acres let us go back to the map in these areas for example in kansas in nebraska in the dakotas out here in the midwest farm country one can support a family on 160 or 320 acres or some other type of government land grant but what was happening and washington was aware of it is there were not many people coming into the mountains they were not going into this area they wanted to settle this area of the west the question came up how do we encourage our pioneers to go to the west to go beyond the colorado rockies or to get into the rockies and into the mountains and go west how do we encourage people to settle shall we give them 160 acres under land grant like we have to settle the midwest and up to kansas and so on well the answer came back pretty simple one is dealing with different terrain the mountains cannot support per acre what the great plains states can support per acre so if we give 160 acres to somebody for agriculture and that was the driving industry obviously back then the agriculture and mining if we give it to them for agriculture they are not going to be able to make it off 160 acres in fact they need thousands of acres to do what somebody can do on 160 acres of real fertile land or 220 acres of real fertile land so they thought about it and said we cannot go out politically and it may not even be right to go out and give citizens several thousand acres of land simply through a land grant program what can we do how do we resolve this therein was the birth of multiple use that is a concept that concept was the government said okay and again follow my pen on the demonstration here the way we can get people to go up into this territory of the united states let us introduce this concept of multiple use which simply means that the government retains the ownership of the land we will call it public lands but the people have a right to use the landsnow when i grew up and when my father and mother grew up before me and so on down back in the generations there was a sign that hung out there we still see it once in a while but there was a sign that hung out there on public lands for example when one would go into the white river national forest one would see a sign that said welcome to the white river national forest underneath it hung a sign that said a land of many uses that is what the sign said today there is a very concentrated attempt to take off the sign that says a land of many uses throw it in the trash and put on a sign that says no trespassing that is the defeat of the concept of multiple use now maybe this would have worked i doubt it but maybe that no trespassing would have worked 150 years ago but the government itself this country itself encouraged its citizens encouraged its people to become pioneers go out and settle the west be cowboys be farmers help this country we need people in the west so generation after generation after generation including not only my family but my wifes family and our children has spent generations in those mountains that is how we make a living if one wants to put up ones no trespassing sign to those of us in the west one will break us we are not large in number we are large in heart we have got a lot of heart in our feeling about this but one will break us keep putting up that no trespassing sign unfortunately a lot of people that are encouraging that are these over here on this extreme that i spoke about earlier my colleagues have to imagine if they can pretend for a minute that they are a ranch owner that they own their own ranch there are several things that they need to do to be a responsible ranch owner number one they need to visit they need to go out into their fields they need to get their hand into the dirt number two they need to understand nature they need not to defy nature they need to work with nature nature renews a lot of natural resources such as water only if they treat it right so they have to understand nature the other thing that they have to do is manage different segments of that ranch they may want to manage the strawberry patch on their ranch a little different than they manage their grazing area where they have got their cattle well it is the same thing here the united states has millions and millions of acres in public lands let me give my colleagues some of those statistics ninetyone percent almost 92 percent of the land that the federal government owns almost 92 percent of the land that the federal government owns is in the western united states thirtyseven percent almost 37 percent of the land in the state of colorado primarily in the mountains is owned by the federal government the forest service the blm and the national park service manage 95 percent of this land the national wild and scenic rivers system contains 10 900 miles of wild scenic and recreational rivers we have got a lot of land out there and most of it is owned in the mountains by the federal government how do we manage that land what kind of management tools do we have let me talk to my colleagues about a few of them in order to manage federal land we do not need to lock everything up as some proposals like the president he says take 40 million acres again colleagues picture what 40 million acres is imagine how many people make a livelihood off of 40 million acres 40 million we have lots of ways we can manage that land and protect it so it looks just like the beautiful maroon bells that i just got done showing my colleagues or like the 54 peaks over 14 000 feet that i just got down showing you or the snowy scene in the colorado rockies that i just got done showing my colleagues we have ways to manage that land protect it for the future but reach that balance that teddy roosevelt spoke about teddy roosevelt said you have a right to develop that was the word back then of course it is a sin to use that word today but back then that is exactly the word that teddy roosevelt meant today we use the word use you have the right for use but you do not have the right for waste you dont have the right for abuse for destruction and he is right he is absolutely right well how do you manage this to help protect it we have national parks we have national monuments we have national preserves we have national reserves we have national lake shores national seashores national rivers national wild and scenic rivers i just told you elevensome thousand miles national scenic trails national historic sites national military parks national battlefield parks national battlefield site national battlefields national historic park reserve study areas national memorials national recreation areas national parkway coordination areas national forests national scenic areas national byways national scenic research area conservation research programs national research and experimental areas national grasslands national conservation areas special management areas national forest primitive areas national game refuges national wildlife preserve areas national wildlife refuges national wildlife protection areas we have lots of tools in our arsenal to manage these public lands we should not just go to one tool we should not put everything in a national park we should not put everything in a national wilderness mr president before you put 40 million acres 40 million acres in essence locking people out of it look at what the consequences are to the people who have preserved it all of these years it is very very important for us to understand a couple other ramifications not just the soil not just the land but right here with my cold tonight i have been sipping on water to keep my voice because i feel it very important to talk to you but that is water in colorado let me give my colleagues a little quote from the poet thomas ferrell it is in the colorado state capital i saw it when i served in the state legislature and the quote is here is a land talking about colorado here is a land where life is written in water here is a land where life is written in water colorado is a very unique state in colorado we must be overly protective of our water rights number one it is something that a lot of other people want colorado provides water for probably 18 to 23 other states believe it or not the country of mexico has water rights in the state of colorado for some of that water colorado is the only state in the union the only state in the union where all of our water goes out of the state we have no free flowing water that comes into the state for our usage in colorado we are an arid state an arid state meaning we do not get much rain when you look at those beautiful mountains you say wow it looks pretty rich to us but we do not have the kind of thick vegetation that a lot of my colleagues do in the east in their district in the east their problem is getting rid of water in the west our problem is storing water we have to store it because since we do not have much rain the only real opportunity we have for mass volumes of water is for the spring runoff assuming we get the winter snows and that spring runoff only lasts for about 65 maybe at the most 90 days so over the balance of time we have got to have it we have got to store it or we do not get it now what happens is that the water law in colorado is unique as well and the same for a lot of the western water law it is different than the east as i mentioned earlier it is entirely different but there are some organizations out there who understand this and those organizations really have two things in mind one stop any kind of use from the water and that is one way to drive people out of those mountains and the second thing is let us take the water for our own use i do not know many organizations in the east who have the interests of the people of the state of colorado or have the interests of the people in the west in mind when they look at our water rights they look at our water rights like a great big piece of apple pie and they are hungry and they think it ought to be theirs although they did not bake it or anything else they think it ought to be theirs so they put their arm around us and they talk to us friendly and they do all kinds of things but their goal is to put that apple pie in their mouth and keep it out of our stomach that is what their goal is so what do we do we have to be protective and when the president comes out and does as he did today set aside 40 million acres of public lands to essentially lock them up when he does that what are the implications to water in the west well i can tell my colleagues right now that the national sierra club that earth first and some of these kind of organizations their goal is that every acre he locks up ought to have with it implied water rights you ought to be able to reach outside that acre let us say this is an acre of land right here this is an acre of land they would like to have the government step outside of this acre up here or over here or over here to control water rights these are very very valuable rights and in essence what the next argument will be is hey we realize that president clinton back in 1999 set aside 40 million acres and certainly what he wanted to do is to also lock up the water necessary for all of those 40 million acres even though we may not be using the water for agriculture or anything we have certain water rights like we want the quality et cetera et cetera and they start reaching outside that territory it happened in colorado we have the wilderness act when the wilderness act was enacted by this congress by the united states house of representatives and of course the senate and the president there was never any kind of discussion of water rights in about 1985 judge cain out of the federal district court said although there were no water rights for the federal government although the federal government does not seem to have any automatic water rights there must have been an implication for water rights so the federal government now has implied water rights for the wilderness areas we have been fighting that battle for a long time same thing is going to happen here my colleagues now for you in the east my colleagues so what we need the water what do you mean so what that is our lifeblood remember my quote here is a land speaking of colorado here is a land where life is written in water here is a land where life is written in water it is a huge difference to us what are some of the other things that these 40 million acres can do the other implications we do not know but it could be all of a sudden there are air rights for the federal government all of a sudden the federal government could reach out to an adjacent town say silt colorado or grand junction colorado or glenwood springs colorado which borders the white river national forest or meeker colorado which borders the white river national forest on the north side and they could say to those communities you know something you have too many cars in your community you have too many people burning wood fireplaces and those communities could say we understand that we try and do our own no no no here is what the federal government out of washington d c is going to tell you communities in the west how you are going to run your communities there are lots of implications to the action that the president has taken today now what they will try and give you is an allusion that if we do not follow the presidents lead if we do not listen to the advice of earth first if we do not adopt point by point the national policies of the national sierra club that these beautiful mountains that i showed you a picture of will be destroyed that the water in the west will be polluted that the trees will be clearcutted well let me tell you what happens if we follow their agenda write off mountain biking forget skiing forget river rafting forget the other recreational uses that we have out there hunting going throughout in a 4wheel drive vehicle on marked trails all of the different kind of things that you can recreate with in colorado in the longrun those could very easily be diminished significantly maybe never ended completely because we have some private property although every ski area to the best of my knowledge and i have almost all of them in the third congress district in my district almost every one of them is on public land those are the kind of implications that we are speaking about here it sounds warm and fuzzy today and it is very easy to appeal to the entire country by saying what i have done is to do as teddy roosevelt or as i just heard somebody on tv say it is the most significant thing we have done for the environment in centuries do you know what the most significant thing we have done for the environment in centuries we have let the people that live in those mountains help manage those mountains we let the people who really have their hands in the soil every day now my hands are not in soil but take a look at my fatherinlaws hands or my motherinlaw or my parents or many many people out there in colorado i could give you name after name after name what we have done right is let those people who are on the ground there every day every hour help us manage those lands we did not kick them off now once in a while we have had abuse and we get rid of them and maybe we need to tighten the laws on that i am up for that and i am not for saying that we do not have additional areas out there where these kind of restrictions should be placed but 40 million acres by simply throwing a fishnet over the western united states that is what has happened the president got a big fishnet and just threw it as far as he could and out it floated over the western united states and wherever there is public lands haha we will lock it up i am not attempting here to be provocative to try and be derogatory what i am trying to do here is one make us all cognizant of what life in the western mountains is all about number 2 the fact that we have beautiful beautiful diamonds out there meaning the mountains and we all want to protect those and three i want to tell you do not just write us off we have too much to lose we are fellow citizens and we live in a beautiful large expansive area but there are not a lot of us out there so it may be pretty easy for many of my colleagues just simply to write us off but i am asking you not to do that take a look at what it really means what kind of impact you are going to have you are going to hear in the next few days many statements about how bad mountain bikes are i guess probably more realistically they will take some kind of thing that just on its face they will want to make it sound offensive logging for example you know i have known a lot of small families these are not the big logging companies these are small families that are in the logging business why do you want to wipe them out manage them do not wipe them out help them do not destroy them my gosh mr president i wish that you could go to dinner some night go to dinner tonight what you should have done is made this announcement of this lockup of this 40 million acres and then gone to dinner with a small family in colorado somewhere that cuts timber and does it responsibly how happy do you think they are tonight it is going to destroy some people out there but that will not happen the people in washington d c especially down the street are not going to take time to see what the impact is on people as my good colleague the gentleman from arizona said earlier this president committed to put people first they are not going to go out and see where it puts people instead it is much easier to be politically warm and fuzzy and say the west is being destroyed and we in the east must step into the west and defend it defend it against itself we have got to protect those people those families and pioneers out there in the west those ranchers those river rafters those hikers those skiers those residents that live out in the west we have got to protect them from themselves they are destroying themselves that is what the image is here in washington d c that is exactly what the image is that this president is trying to portray to you people with this sign with this signature of 40 million acres set aside in colorado most of us that live out there including myself my family my wifes family we are not wealthy people we are there because we have a job i have been fortunate i have a job representing those people but all five of my brothers and sisters all of my nieces and nephews all of my cousins there are probably 30 or 40 first cousins they are all over colorado why are we able to stay in colorado because we have a job we have a job that may not sound like a lot up here we get paid we have got an automatic job for 2 years back there some of these people depend on their jobs almost day to day let me give my colleagues an example of what kind of jobs we have in colorado on the white river national forest the white river national forest has two predominant uses twothirds of the forest the predominant use in twothirds of it is recreation in onethird of the white river national forest the predominant use is wilderness we have locked it up i voted for that and it was appropriate to do that but we intentionally left twothirds open for recreation why number one they do it in a responsible fashion two it provides resources that are not available you cannot put a ski mountain out in ohio they do not have a lot of skiing in kansas they do not have much skiing in mississippi or missouri or louisiana or nevada they have some in the sierras but not much colorado has got the natural resource for it what does that do that white river national forest just that forest thirtyfive thousand jobs my neighbors in a lot of cases have those jobs that is how we are able to stay out in colorado we are not johnnycomelately we did not just jump out to colorado all of a sudden to live our families many of our families have lived there for generations my family and my wifes family have lived there for many many generations but we still welcome people to come out to colorado sure we think it has grown too fast we wish it were not growing so fast but we do not think we have the right to shut the door because they did not shut the door on us back in the 1870s when my family came in or the 1880s when loris family came in they did not shut the door on us they said come on in but we only ask you one thing when you come to colorado or when you come to the rockies or utah wyoming or montana be responsible help us make this a good community to live in help us retain the beauty of this state help us follow what teddy roosevelt said and that is there is a right to use the land but there is not a right to destroy the land we think we can use the land the federal public lands in colorado or in the rockies or in the west in a responsible fashion i happen to think you can build a ski area and manage it in a responsible way many of you have skied in colorado many of your constituents have skied in colorado you have been there you have seen that a lot of those areas they are managed okay it has been a fun family vacation it was a nice way to recreate then when you take a look at the areas that are cleared for the ski runs they are just a pinpoint a pinpoint in the forest many of you have had the opportunity to river raft in the state of colorado or utah or wyoming or montana it is a blast if you have not done it do it it is a great time and it is a great family activity we have not destroyed the rivers we have been doing what teddy roosevelt said to do use it but dont destroy it some of you may have never heard of lake powell but many of you probably have do you know what lake powell has done for families in this country how many families are down there instead of having their kids running out to the mall or dad running down to work they are down together on a little boat on lake powell that lake does a lot it recreates use it but dont destroy it the roosevelt theory it is a lot different than the other theories that have come out when we talk about this when we talk about where we are going with the future i have got to tell you as long as i am in this elected office i am going to stand as strongly as i can for colorado and for water rights in the west i am not just saying that because never in my entire career have i felt more of a challenge to the taking of colorado water than i do today and never in my career have i felt more of a challenge to those 35 000 jobs on the white river national forest those are not indirect jobs those are direct jobs thatis not 35 000 in fact it is 35 000 families live off that forest i have never felt a larger threat in my political career to those jobs thar the visioncoming out of washington d c the vision that we cannot manage it the vision that theyneed to protect us to protect us from ourselves how many of you have ever mountain biked out in colorado that is a relatively new sport but if you have you have really gotten into some of that terrain and you have been able to access it you did not have to hike for miles you have been able to ride in there on your bike minimal damage to the environment we managed it well despite the fact that washington thinks they need to protect us from ourselves we followed the roosevelt theory use it but dont abuse it it is the same thing with any other type of activity you can imagine whether it is kayaking whether it is hiking and so on you get my message my drift what i am saying here now what about some of the other issues what about some of the other jobs i do not think it is shameful to have a sporting goods store and sell sporting goods in colorado i do not think it is wrong for a small family to try and go out and harvest some timber by the way if you harvest timber with correct management it is healthy for the forest it is a renewable resource and by the way every one of you in this room tonight every one of your constituents uses wood that istaken out of some forest somewhere at some time every chair in here you look around you know what i mean wood is everywhere it is a renewable resource but you have to follow the roosevelt theory the roosevelt theory is use it but dont abuse it it saddens me to think that here in washington d c frankly a lot of the national press is buying this hook line and sinker they are biting at it just like that it troubles me that back here in the east that even the administration in the west wing they do not go to the western united states they make this decision in the west wing they have got some confusion there it bothers me that they are using a deception upon the american people that this land out there that we are not taking care of that land it is public land it is all of our land i am telling you we have been on it for a long time we have lived on it for a long time we have worked it for a long time we have used it for a long time and we have not abused it for a long time folks do not be sold on this do not automatically assume that the west is being destroyed because of the fact that we have ski areas do not automatically assume that the west is being destroyed because we have mountain bikes do not automatically assume that the west is being destroyed because we allow peopl to river raft and hike and hunt do not automatically assume because it is not true we do follow the roosevelt theory use it but dont abuse it i know that tonight my time is rapidly expiring but i just want to reiterate a couple of things number one do not forget that the pioneer spirit still exists for a lot of us we are very proud of our heritage we are ameri cans but we also come from the west i feel very respectful of the people of the east but i am not an easterner i am a westerner i am not out here to destroy the lifestyle of the east and i ask you people in the east do not go out of your way to destroy our lifestyle in the west we do not need the eastern united states the bureaucracies in washington d c to protect us from ourselves i think we much much better than some of my colleagues and some of the people in the east understand that land much much better than you ever will we have got our hands in the soil all of us can agree that a commonsense approach is what is reasonable but that means that these people out here who want to clearcut every forest who want to put a ski area on every mountain who want to build a house on every ridge who want to put a highway wherever they want to who want to build townhouses wherever they want that means these people are going to have to be movedto the middle and the people out here like earth firstand other hardcore groups out there who think they only have the title to the environment who think they only have the knowledget to protect that land who think onlythey have the historical background to manage that ranch for all of us that group has also got to be brought to the middle and here in the middle is not the leader of the united states today the president of the united states bill clinton that is not who is here in the middle today he is over here what is in the middle today was what was in the middle at the turn of the century and many years ago and that is teddy roosevelt teddy roosevelt is who is in the middle and remember and i will conclude with teddy roosevelts comments and i will paraphrase him you have the right to use it but you dont have the right to abuse it or destroy it teddy roosevelt had it right it should be teddy roosevelts path that we follow do not be misguided down the path of president clinton follow the path of teddy roosevelt use it and enjoy it but dont abuse it and destroy it"], [0.009355369955301285,

their local county planning and i also would like to thank the gen zoning commission out here in these tleman with my colleagues here for the federal lands anything like that they considerations and the courtesies that have got to go to their planning board he has extended to the state of colo which is in washington d c so there rado over the years we appreciate his are a lot of significant issues that we service and his courtesies ask for our colleagues in the east to i interrupted my com have an understanding of what goes on ments because i felt it was very impor out primarily in the west or have an tant that we listen to the chairman of understanding of what goes on in the the committee on resources the gen state of alaska tleman who has represented the state for example in my district we are of alaska for a number of years alas totally dependent totally not parka is a wdnderful wonderful state tially totally dependent on multiple most of alaska i think in the high 90s use of public lands for water every maybe 96 percent of alaska is owned by highway that we have in my district the federal government i wish i had comes across federal lands the water time this evening to talk to my col when i go back to water it is either leagues about what happens and the stored upon originates or comes across differences between states that are pri federal lands all of our power lines marily owned by government and all of our cellular telephone towers all states that are primarily owned by pri of this is on federal lands in my parvate individuals ticular district of which we have the many of my colleagues here on the premier ski areas in the world aspen floor come from states where their pri or vail or telluride or powder horn or mary ownership in their state are pri purgatory i could go on and on and on vate individuals many of us come from these areas are dependent very dependstates where the primary ownership in ent our tourism dollars are very deour states is the federal government pendent on these lands we are very in colorado for example my district is very i guess you would say over a pethe third congressional district of the riod of time we have become encomstate of colorado my district geo passed by the concept of multiple use graphically is larger than the state of i want to talk just for a moment florida and on the eastern line of my about that concept of multiple use district which very simplified runs what happened in the early days when from wyoming down 125 to new mex our country was a young country we ico it exempts out the cities as you go basically had this as our country our down but from that eastern border to forefathers the leaders of our country the atlantic ocean that land there is wanted to settle the land that we had very little federal government owner purchased in those days possession ship of lands out here in the east you that is where the saying by the way have the appalachias you have the ev possession is ninetenths of the law erglades down there and then in a lot possession meant everything in the of states you have the local court early days of our country if you did house you may have a park here and not possess the land somebody else there but the reality of it is if we took could come in and they did not care a map for example of the united whether you had a deed or a document states and we looked obviously i am that said you own it they came in not an artist but if we took a look at they sat there with a gun and said i my eastern border here is colorado own that property the point i am making is from this once our country made purchases point right here to the atlantic ocean like through the louisiana purchase federal ownership or government own and things like that what happened ership of land is represented about like was taking this out for a moment this with the appalachias here the they were trying to figure out how to everglades the park up here in the get people to leave the relative comnortheast if you were to look from my forts of the east and of the settled border this district the third con communities in the east how do we gressional district and go to the pa get them out into the new frontier cific ocean you are going to find out how do we encourage people to go out that government ownership of land there and set up a home or set up looks like this obviously that is a towns because as a country we need to rough drawing but that is pretty sig possess the lands like the louisiana nificant purchase or we are going to lose them there are a lot of differences between to some other country living in areas where the ownership of so what they decided to do was let us the land is by individuals and living give land everybody in this country it out here where our zoning and planning is an americans dream to own a little commissions are dictated by decisions piece of land to own your own little out of washington d c for example house it is the american dream so they used this incentive go west young man go west to do that they said let us have a homestead you go out into kansas you go out into missouri you go out there you find 160 acres or you find 320 acres you farm it for enough years and you get to keep it it is your land that worked pretty well what we saw were fairly dramatic movements of population into these areas but when they got to the west where it is very arid we do not have the kind of water it does not rain in the west like it does in the east when they got out west the crowd started going around nobody was sticking around in here why because they discovered in kansas for example or missouri or even eastern colorado or down here in some of these states in the midwest states pennsylvania and so on they were discovering that with 160 acres you can support a family you have enough acreage there to grow a farm but they also discovered that when you got to the mountains for example or to the more arid acres sometimes 160 acres would not even feed one cow so the settlers were not staying there at the nations capital they said what do we do about this how do we get settlers out here before we lose this land how do we get them to move in there somebody came up with the idea it takes 160 areas of good fertile ground in missouri for a family that is the equivalent in the mountains of colorado it might take 2 000 acres so let us give them 2 000 acres they thought about it the policymakers back then and they said wait a minute we cant give that away that is too much for one person then the idea was born well let us go ahead and have the government retain the ownership in other words the government will continue to own this land out here but let us let the people use the land that is where the concept of multiple use came from when the gentleman the chairman of the committee on resources stands up and talks about alaska and talks about your oil that is why alaska is primarily owned by the government because of the fact of the differences between states in the west and states in the east and so i think it was important i acknowledge the gentleman and appreciate him coming to speak with us i want to address another point i had the opportunity to come down and listen to some of my respected colleagues prior to my having the opportunity to visit with you it sounded like it was the george w bush bash hour what can we bash george w bush about that seems to be a favorite thing by some of my colleagues here lately what policy can we find of george w bush lets just bash him somebody ought to stand up here and say a few things that george w bush is doing right and a few ideas that i think will work for this country on a bipartisan basis that both sides of the aisle ought to acknowledge let us take an example let us talk about social security for example social security we ought to look a little at the history we know that we had the depression in 1929 in 1935 the president decided and this country and this congress on this floor decided that we should have a national insurance policy a social insurance that is where social security came about but there are a few factors to remember about social security when it was first conceived number one for every person that was retired in 1935 we had 42 workers out there working fortytwo workers for every person retired what has happened over a period of time is the number of people that are working has gone down in proportion to the number of people that are retired today instead of being 42 to one today it is three to one it is three to one that has created a problem for social security number two and this is good news for all of us colleagues this is good news the modern medicine that we have developed and the vaccines and the ability to fight things like chicken pox and polio and things that were horrible diseases of the past and with godspeed we can find a cure for cancer in the future but these diseases have in a large part been conquered the average person in the united states in 1935 could expect to live a male 62 years old a female 65 today that is almost in the 80s we have had a dramatic increase in the life span for our citizens in this country unfortunately no adjustment has ever been made in social security number one because of the number of active workers that have been reduced and two because of the extended life span of these individuals so what is happening is today we have a social security fund which on a cash basis means cash in the bank is in the plus column but when we look on an actuarial basis and what do i mean by that word i mean when we look into the future and say okay here is the money we have here are our future obligations do we have enough money to cover all of these future obligations that is what is called actuarial thinking on an actuarial basis social security is bankrupt and who is the individual that is running for president that has stood up and i think in a bipartisan approach come up with a plan now it is a bold plan gore and the president they have called it a risky plan you have got to take some risk you have got a plan that is in trouble not in trouble for my generation i am 47 not in trouble for my parents my parents are going to be guaranteed any of the colleagues any of your seniors their money is not going to be interrupted really from about 45 on up their money is going to be there but the young people of this country the people that george w bush has talked about the people in their 30s the young workers that are starting out in their 20s those are the people that are going to face the dramatic problem on social security if we do not take a bold move you can call it risky as al gore has called it but the fact is you have got to do something that is what leadership is about if you do not want to lead stand aside we are not going to leave you behind but you are not a leader somebody has to get out there with a bold plan i can tell you that the plan that george w bush has proposed is not exactly in my opinion something that is novel you say what do you mean novel well i think that george w bush and his social security plan they looked around and said go~h how do we test market my proposal how do we test market something for the younger generation that will save social security you know what they found it it has been test marketed it has been out there and used you know what it is working the logical question that one would ask is well where is this test market where are the results who is using the same type of basic plan that george w bush is proposing for all of america where is your test market on that you know when corporations or businesses or people want to try a product they go out and test it first so you prove to us mcinnis where is this test market you know where it is it is right here on the house floor us you know what we are treated differently than other americans every federal employee is treated differently than other americans how we have our own separate retirement plan now we are participants in social security and we do pay into social security but as you know we have another plan every federal employee 3 million of us in this country have been test marketed and that plan is called the thrift savings plan what is the thrift savings plan number one it is voluntary you are not required to participate in it exactly what george w bush is saying with the partial investment of social security dollars number two it gives you choice exactly what george w bush is talking about when he talks about his social security plan number three it guarantees you a payment regardless of the choice that you make exactly what we have in our thrift savings plan and exactly what george bush has proposed in his plan how does the thrift savings plan work as you know we get our check and there is an automatic deduction taken out of our check for social security there is also an automatic deduction taken out for our retirement so as a federal employee and remember this applies to all federal employees not just to the congress but to about three million federal employees so they take out a small amount or an amount out of your check for your retirement you have no choice on that you get no choice as to where it is invested you do not get a choice as to whether it goes into the stock market or whether it goes into bonds you have no choice on it on the other hand the tradeoff is you are guaranteed a payment when you retire but then after that is said and done you get to take up to 10 percent of your pay and you can invest it through the thrift savings plan and the federal government will match the first 5 percent so you get to take 10 percent they match the first 5 percent and you get choice you are not required to do it by the way and what kind of choices do we have our choices are one you can go into savings accounts which are guaranteed by the government just like if you went to a local bank fdic approved you get that but the return is low the lower the risk the lower the return the higher the risk the higher the return the very low risk option zero risk almost and you get a low return or you can go into something like the bond or the stock market you have that choice what is wrong with george w bushs proposal to give choice to the american people what is wrong with our generation the older generation looking to the younger generation like my children my children are grown now what is wrong with my generation saying to this generation hey you ought to have a little choice we ought to give you a choice on some of your investment dollars george w bush has not gone out and said take all the social security dollars and let this young generation decide if they want to put it all in the stock market of course that would be reckless conduct that would be careless there is not a financial mind in the world that would tell you that would be a smart thing to do what george w bush said is give them up to 2 percent let us try it out it works for american government employees why can it not work for the young generation the women in this country that are young and just getting into the workplace the young men and the families if we do not do something do you know what the return is if we stick with the status proposed which seems to be what is proposed by the al gore policy here is what your return is 0 09 percent that is a rotten return that is what you get to expect assuming that we can keep it afloat so a young couple today let us say a young lady named joyce and a young man named john and john and joyce go out into the workplace and their social security if we do not change this thing number one it probably on an actuarial basis will not be there for them and if it is if the stock market continues to boom and we know in case you have not read in the last few weeks it has leveled off but if it continued to boom which it will not do forever then that is about what kind of return you can expect how can we do this come on it is an obligation it is a fiduciary duty on every one of us in this room to stand up for this next generation behind us and the generation behind them and the generation behind them if we are going to hive a social security program let us give them a social security plan that works for the american people let us not make american federal government employees an exclusive set where they have a little different arrangement than the very people who put us here the people that pay our checks are the taxpayers we ought to take that into consideration we should not treat the taxpayers of this country who are not federal employees different than we treat federal employees why not change social security i see positive things instead of standing up here in a very partisan way and bashing george w bush why do we not stand up here and talk about what i think are the good policies and the good recommendations that he has made if he becomes the president i think you are going to see a very positive change for social security those policies will work because they have been test marketed it is not new it did not just fall out of the sky these policies work they have been tested and they have been tested on 3 million people and do you know what the participation rates are in the high 80 or 90 percent of federal employees that want to get into this program because why because it works that is why they want to get into this program let me change subjects because i heard some other bush bashing going on and i think once again somebody has to come tell the other side of the story paul harvey who by the way i had the privilege of meeting paul harvey a couple of weeks ago in pueblo colorado where we honored about 100 medal of honor recipients and paul harvey was kind enough to come out there at his expense to speak to us but paul harvey has a famous saying you have all heard it and now for the rest of the story that is exactly why i am over here this afternoon talking to you you heard one side of the story bush bashing bush bashing on social security bush bashing on taxes bush bashing look do you know what there are a lot of good things in there why not look for some 6f the good colleagues instead of trying to spin it out of control because of the political necessities of an election coming up here in 4 or 5 weeks let us talk about taxes and let us talk about what the republicans frankly with a lot of help from conservative democrats have done with their tax policy number one the republicans again with help from conservative democrats who came across the aisle we sent to the president of this country a death tax elimination now whetheror not you think you are covered by the death tax i think it is a fundamental question it is the same thing by the way with the marriage tax elimination the republicans with help from some conservative democrats sent to the president of the united states a marriage tax elimination to eliminate the tax because of the fact you are married and to eliminate the tax because of your death on both occasions the president vetoed both of them now let us talk about it the basic fundamental question you need to ask about the death tax and the fundamental question you need to ask about the marriage tax is should death or marriage should those be taxable events in our society you know what the majority of us stood up and said no unfortunately the administration disagreed they think that marriage should bea taxable event they think that death is a taxable event not only do they think death is a taxable event i sit on the committee on ways and means i know about finance and taxes the presidents budget the president and vice president the clintongore budget this year not only did not even consider elimination of the death tax they actually proposed an increase of 9 5 billion a 9 5 billion increase in the death tax you should not increase it you should not keep it the death tax does not collect a lot of money let me tell you when you hear and i have heard this over and over again when you hear wvell this only benefits the upper 2 percent of a community wake up it does not just affect 2 percent of the community let me give an example colorado you take a small town in colorado i have a small community in colorado where somebody who by the way lived the american dream started out with nothing worked all his life his entire dream in life was to be successful so he could pass it on to the next generation and spread it in the community he had a construction company by the way to be eligible for the death tax on a construction company if you own free and clear if you own much more than a bulldozer a dump truck and a backhoe then all of a sudden you are facing the death tax that is right a bulldozer backhoe and dump truck and you are facing the death tax this individual passed away from what you would hear from the people who think that the death tax is a fair tax that it is fair to tax somebody on property they have accumulated that they have already paid taxes on simply by the fact that they died what you need to look at is what the impact is on a community what happened when he died they took 70some percent 55 percent of it for the death tax 22 percent on capital gains or 28 percent excuse me on capital gains and they took 70some percent of that estate and moved it out of this small town in colorado and they moved that money to washington d c to be redistributed by a bureaucracy you know what the money in a community ought to stay in a community i do not believe you ought to be able to tax death as a taxable event but it sure would be a lot more liveable if you went to that small community and said look just in spite you had somebody who was successful so we are going to tax them on their death but you get to keep the money in the community remember the death tax where it came from the death tax came as kind of a geteven tool with the carnegies and the fords and the rockefellers that is where that thing came from from people who wanted to declare class warfare who said look this is a great country and we say if you invent the better mouse trap you get to reap the reward as long as you do not reap too many rewards because then we are going to come after you that is exactly what happened in the twenties and so on this is a tax that should never have been created it is a tax that hurts our communities it is a tax that hurts our environment this is a country that ought to pride itself in encouraging its citizens encouraging its families to pass abusiness from one generation to the next generation what builds the strength of a country is family that is what builds our strength and for a government to go out and discourage and actually penalize the transfer of a business or the family farm or the family hardware store from one generation to the next generation is fundamentally flawed it is flawed with the concept of what we have as government now maybe in a communist country or in a socialist country where everybody is not paid on what they are worth they are paid on what they need so no matter what they do it is not what they do for society it is what they need so you equalize all those payments that is what the concept of a death tax or a marriage tax comes from especially a death tax that is not what we want in this country that is not what ought to be happening to our communities by the way you heard me right when i tell you the death tax hurts our environment you say wait a minute how does the death tax hurt our environment you know how it hurts it in my district in colorado a beautiful district i live in the highest place in the nation the highest elevation in the nation if you have been skiing in the mountains in colorado if you have been in the mountains in colorado the essence is you are in my district the people discover the beauty of this what happened is we have family farms and ranches out there and what is happening is people are coming in and the families are having to sell these they want to farm they want to ranch they want to have that piece of land but they have to sell it you know where that land goes it does not continue as a ranching operation it does not continue as a farming operation it continues as a few hundred more condominiums or a few hundred more townhouses or a brand new shopping center that is what is happening to that land out there and a lot of it is due directly to this death tax so do not stand here and bash george w bush because he wants to eliminate the death tax do not stand here and bash george w bush because he says marriage should not be a taxable event what you ought to do is as some of the democrats have done join the republicans in our fight to get rid of the death tax join the republicans as some conservative democrats have done and get rid of the marriage tax instead what happened unfortunately we saw the majority of democrats go with the president and support the presidents veto of getting rid of the marriage tax and support the president on this death tax i am saying to my colleagues work with us in a bipartisan method we can do something for social security for this next generation we can do something about that death tax we can do something about that marriage penalty let me tell my colleagues in a bipartisan direction when we have worked together in the past the democrats helped us pass probably the largest tax break that we have had in 20 years or 30 years although the people do not realize what we have done the republicans about 3 years ago 2 years ago went out and said the americans dream is about owning their own home so we think in most families the ownership of the home is the largest asset they have that is usually the largest asset in a family what we said the republican bill that we got passed with some help from some conservative democrats on a bipartisan working effort the bill we passed says that if you now own a home and you sell that home for a profit i am not talking about equity i am talking about net income you sell it for a profit your first 250 000 per person remember most homes are owned by couples so it is the first 500 000 per couple but the first 250 000 per person goes into your pocket tax free you get to do that every 2 years that is an incentive for people to go out and own homes and that was supported on a bipartisan effort we had conservative democrats who helped the republicans pass that and that gave the american people a tax break they deserved for some reason there has been a misconception down here on this floor we seem to think that the american taxpayers ought to pay and pay and pay and somehow people some of my colleagues spin it out as if we dare talk about it hey maybe they put in too much george w bush says take half of our surplus right away and put it to reduction of the debt that should be our priority reduce that debt but you still have a little that you ought to put into some programs like education and healthcare and you still have a small fraction of that you ought to give back to the taxpayer pat them on the back and say thanks for what you have done thanks to the productive nature of the american people the american taxpayer this government is sitting pretty well this surplus was not created by the wonderful creative thoughts of your government it was created by our constituents the hard workers the 8 00 to 5 00 people or the 8 00 to 8 00 people out there who produce and create capital government does not create capital government transfers capital government takes it from the workers pockets transfers it to washington d c and then hands it out as if they worked for it that is not what the government is about what i am saying is do not be ashamed to talk about a tax cut they ought to be reasonable tax cuts is it unreasonable to cut out the tax of death is it unreasonable to cut out the tax of marriage i was so excited last night in that debate i wanted to be in that debate not as a candidate but just to get up there and say wait a minute mr vice president what is wrong with the policy of cutting out a death tax what is wrong with the policy of eliminating the marriage tax what is wrong with the homeowners tax break that we gave 2 years ago you did not try and spin it out of control then i am telling my colleagues from a bipartisan point of view we owe respect to the taxpayer and there is no reason to back off and be ashamed because we talk about maybe we ought to thank the taxpayer and say we got enough to operate the government the more the taxpayer provides for the government the sloppier the government becomes sometimes it is a good idea to tighten down on the budgets that forces efficiencies that is why i have taken this podium today instead of bashing bush all the time which i heard minute after minute after minute earlier this afternoon why do we not stand up and say hey here are some policies that we can work on in a bipartisan basis here are some positive things that he has proposed there are very few of my colleagues out here who could look me right in the eye and arguably tell me that our plan our thrift savings plan should not apply to the american people and should only apply to federal government employees there are very few of you i think that could really look me in the eye and honestly tell me look scor we ought to have a death tax how many of my colleagues really support a death tax how many of my colleagues really think people ought to be penalized in tax due to the fact that they are married how many of my colleagues really think that this government ought to engage in discouraging families from passing their hardware store or their farm or ranch from one generation to the next generation not a lot of my colleagues but my colleagues ought to be identified to the american people so they know exactly where we stand the taxpayer does deserve some courtesy we obviously need to reduce the death debt we have to take care of programs like education and health care which are fundamental for the survival of the greatness of this country but the best way that we do it is we look at it in a positive sense and i encourage my colleagues to do just exactly that"], [0.009673350490629673, 0.009673350490629673, 0, "i rise in strong support of h r 6 the marriage tax elimination act

would prohibit funds from being expended to approve class i gaming on indian lands by any means other than a tribalstate compact entered into by a state and a tribe there are four compelling reasons to vote in favor of this amendment first the united states supreme court has ruled that it is unconstitutional for the indian tribes to force the states to allow gaming within their borders by suing in federal court there is nothing in the supreme court decision that allows the secretary to take it upon himself to approve compacts where the states and tribes have not agreed in many cases the tribes are now completely bypassing negotiations with the states because they know they will receive a more favorable ruling from the secretary of interior second the national governors association and the states attorney general believe that the secretary lacks legal authority for rulemaking and that statutory modifications to igra are necessary to resolve state sovereignty immunity issues let me share with my colleagues what the national governors association stated on this issue they strongly believe that no statute or court decision provides the secretary of the united states department of the interior with authority to intervene in disputes over compacts between indian tribes and states about casino gambling on indian lands such action would constitute an attempt by the secretary to preempt states authority under existing laws and recent court decisions and would create an incentive for tribes to avoid negotiating gambling compacts with states third while not an entirely enthusiastic supporter of the national gaming study commission i do agree with its adopted language that opposes the secretary of interior empowering himself to grant class i gaming licenses to indian tribes why my colleagues say because the gambling commission after a 2year exhaustive study determined that indian gaming was poorly regulated throughout this country and out of control finally there is nothing in the indian gaming regulatory act which grants this authority to the secretary of the interior this amendment would prohibit overreaching by the secretary of the interior of the worst kind i urge my colleagues to support this amendment and help reign in a bureaucracy that is so obviously out of control that it would grant gaming licenses in states and jurisdictions where both the governor and the people do not wish to sanction this activity may i say before i close i have lived in las vegas for 38 years i grew up there i know gaming i agree that the poverty on the indian reservations is horrific but if anyone thinks granting indian tribes gaming licenses is a panacea for the reservations abject poverty they are sadly mistaken certainly there must be better ways of

colleague for joining me tonight i have come to talk about what i consider to be one of the greatest threats to our nation and that is the horrible debt that our nation faces and the absolute reluctance on the part of both presidential candidates and almost everyone who seeks higher public office to deal with it when i go down the street in my home state of mississippi and folks ask me where do their tax dollars go they are almost dumbfounded when i tell them that the largest expenditure of their nation is interest on our nations debt yesterday our nation spent 1 billion on interest on the national debt we did the same thing today we did it 3 days ago we did it 5 days ago we have done it every day for the past year unless we change the way we are doing business here in our nations capitol we will spend at least a billion dollars on the national debt tomorrow the next day and every day for the rest of our lives what do we get for that it does not educate one child it does not build one inch of highways it does not build one war ship to defend our nation it does not pay the kids in uniform it is squandered down a rat hole and most appropriately and something most americans would find very disturbing is about one third of the interest on our nations debt is fully paid to foreign lending institutions see german and japanese lending institutions actually control the papers on about one third of our nations debit for my father and your fathers those who fought the great world war ii to save us from the tyranny of then nazi germany and imperial japan you have to imagine how upset they would be to realize that the nations they saved us from now control americas financial future because they control our debt i often wonder how this incredible misperception of a big budget surplus could come from because we hear it every day i hear otherwise educated people tall as if they are mindless idiots so when they talk about an alleged surplus i really wonder again where it comes from i think i know one of the places that it came from this was an ad that was run in several national publications including the usa today it was run december 6 of 1995 and it features then head of the republican national committee a face that most of you would remember a guy named haley barbour from the state of mississippi it is a fullpage ad he is holding a million dollar check and it says up top heard the one about the republicans getting medicare it says down here the fact is that the republicans are increasing medicare spending by more than half i am haley barbour i am so sure of this fact that i am willing to give you this check for a million dollars if you can prove me wrong he goes on down here to have the actual terms of that challenge here is why you have no chance for a million dollars the republican national committee will present a cashiers check for 1 million to the first american who can prove the following statement is false in quotations in november of 1995 the unitedstates house and senate passed a balanced budget bill it increases total federal spending on medicare by more than 50 percent from 1995 to the year 2002 pursuant to congressional budget standards what was called to his attention in a handdelivered letter just a few days later is that the bill that they passed for that year to run the nation was not a balanced budget bill for you at home for me for our nation for my state a balanced budget is when you spend no more than you collect where you are collecting your salary and what you spend or what this nation or my state collects in taxes and what they spend if you spend more than you are collecting then it is not a balanced budget that is a deficit budget remember this change was made on a budget that passed in november of 1995 so that would have been the budget for the fiscal year 1996 running from october 1 1995 through september of 1996 as we can see and this is for those of you who have your computers at home the source for this is the united states government annual reports for the fiscal years 1996 1997 1998 and 1999 all taken from the monthly treasury statements for the month of september for those years what you can see is for the fical year 1996 the first year that the challenge would have been in effect the republican congress passed a budget that was 221 billion 960 million in deficit that is almost a billion a day that they were spending more than they were collecting in taxes so maybe they did not get to the balanced budget quite as quick as they thought they could for fiscal year 1997 federal funds were 145 217 000 in deficit as you can see these are the trust funds things like the social security trust fund but for the federal trust funds the real portion that we determine there was no balanced budget fiscal year 1998 88 088 000 in deficit fiscal year 1999 82 998 000 in deficit all of these years later the nation finally turned a surplus in september of the year 2000 it was not easily accomplished i came to the house floor in the month of july to point out that through the end of june our nation was running an 11 billion annual operating deficit again these are from the monthly treasury statements department of treasury table 8 page 30 what you do not see is and what you do not hear is when they talk about a big surplus they are not telling you that that surplus is in the social security trust fund the military retiree trust fund the medicare trust fund the highway trust fund the key word in each of these sentences is the word trust these are taxes that are collected from a specific group of people and set aside by people who trust our nation to spend them on nothing but that one purpose when my young daughter teaches sailing lessons during the summer and she pays social security on that paycheck she trusts that money will be set aside so that years from now when she is a senior citizen that money will be available for her social security when you go to the gas pump and pay gasoline taxes you trust that that money will be set aside to build roads when a military person serving our nation in places like korea places like bosnia kosovo pays into his trust fund he trusts that that money will be set aside for when he retires so that his retirement check is sent every month when someone pays into the medicare trust fund all of us are counting on that money being set aside so that when we need those services that money will be there the only surpluses that are out there are in the trust funds so to say that i am going to have a big tax break or we are going to spend a whole lot more money because of these big surpluses my question to those people are who are you going to steal it from are you going to take it from peoples social security trust fund are you going to take it from their medicare trust fund are you going to steal it from the military retirees are you going to steal it from the people who bought gasoline and paid the tax on that the one bright light of this year i think as far as this congress is concerned is that for the first time in 30 years the nation collected more than it spent it collected about 8 billion more than it spent on expenditures for the nation so for the first time in 30 years there actually was a surplus what that fails to note is that there was an extraordinary amount of money collected in the month of september and a reduction in normal operating expenditures it was an accounting game that was played so that we could have a surplus one of the games that was played was a very unfortunate trick to the people who serve our nation in uniform they are normally paid on the last of the month but because september 30 2000 fell into fiscal year 2000 and october 1 was in fiscal year 2001 congress voted to delay their pay to october 1 so that that 2 billion accounting cost would go on this year and not on last if you are a congressman and everybody knows congressmen make good money having to wait between a friday and a monday for your paycheck not that big of a deal but if you are an e3 an ea an e5 out there if you are a young lieutenant with a couple of kids running around the house that weekend of waiting to buy baby formula or pampers or whatever was an incredible inconvenience to them so from my republican colleagues who are regularly telling me that they support the troops i ask my colleagues if they support them so much why did they delay their pay just so they could pretend to balance the budget this is the american financial portfolio that the next president of the united states will inherit there is no surplus our nation is almost 6 trillion in debt the public debt on september 30 2000 was 5 674 178 209 887 for george bush or al gore to say because we had an 8 billion surplus that we should go out and start great new spending programs or cut taxes by over a trillion dollars is literallylike a fellow who has not made his way for 30 years he has not broken even 1 month for 30 years and he finally clears a profit of 1 000 and he is getting ready to celebrate with that 1 000 and going on a spending spree totally ignoring that during those 30 years he has grown the equivalent of 686 000 of credit card debt 686 000 versus 1 that is what 8 billion compares to this debt that we owe and we continue to pay a billion dollars interest every day that is the public debt of the united states again contrary to what my republican colleagues are saying they are not paying it down it increased by 17 970 308 271 43 last year for those of you who doubt my figures i would encourage you on your computers http www publicdebt treas gov opd opdpenny htm it is public record that is whatwe owe mr

some of them read as many as 200 and 300 the significant thing was that when i went to give those awards a year ago there were probably 400 parents grandparents aunts and uncles that filled up the gym so i will go back this year to give the awards again this year there were 481 children who read at least 100 books several of the children had read more than 500 books i mean we are talking about children reading two and three books a day they were not very big we did not tell them how thick the books had to be but the interesting thing was the number of kindergarfners in this school a lot of them they received an award well it is quite obvious to me that kindergartners very few can read when they start they do not read but guess who read the books the parents or the grandparents or the aunts or uncles whoever but what we do is we get a significant adult involved with that child early and then we get the linkage to the school so this year i delivered 481 certificates we had more parents in the gym than it would hold they were standing outside they stood in line a lot of them stood up because they did not have seats for almost 2 hours because i stood up for 2 hours and handed out the certificates and shook the hand of every child in that school i only tell that story because i think every member can do something like that we ought to honor and encourage our children it is not enough to stand on the floor of the house and point out the problems there are plenty of problems in the world but i think we need to go and honor and reward the good things that are happening i have always believed that if one rewards successes one will get more if you let people know you encourage good things more good things will happen i was so pleased because i left there that day and of course my back was sore from having to bend over to shake hands when one is 6 feet 6 inches and shaking hands with little folks one gets sore but i felt so good i was late for the next school i had to deliver more certificates we are now going to expand it but these are the kinds of things all of us can do it is not very creative and the cost of a little certificate is not much but for some of those children it was so important we could tell in talking with the children and watching their parents who came up to take the photographs the neat thing was the principal a lady by the name of alice cobb who is just an outstanding leader and a great educator she was smart enough to understand how important it was to her children so she had a video camera going digital video camera through all of it so she could photograph every child in the video of course as we know one can print that out on paper she sent me a whole stack of stuff she had done i know the type of person she was that she had given every child a photograph when they got their certificate there are some things that we do not think about sometimes those of us who are in public office appreciate being acknowledged just think what we will do for a plaque or certificate so a child will do good things and schools understand that i hear people sometimes belittle some of the good things teachers do and call it woman fusses if you are a child and you need someone to say you look good today when you do not feel good when you are not real sure you look good someone to tell you you are a nice child or they love you when nobody at home may be telling you that it may make the difference in that childs life all of us can talk about things like that to make a difference we have to require the academics of every child make them achieve the most they can do we do that in north carolina we require it we assess each child we have a tough curriculum but at the same time all of us need to be loved and every child needs that if you do that you encourage you give them love and you give them tough love when you have to you can get a lot that is what the gentleman is talking about with the program he was just

programs i believe the department of energy has it is a program where we are working on these advanced technologies and anyone can participate so i think it is a tremendous effort just this year the year 2000 marks a major milestone in the pngv program the unveiling of the proof of concept vehicles that demonstrate up to 80 miles per gallon fuel economy earlier this year the three auto makers presented their pngv vehicles at several events including the northern american international auto show in detroit and the pngv 2000 concept rollout on march 30 in washington d c all three vehicles the ford prodigy the general motors precept the daimlerchrysler esx3 feature advanced hybrid propulsion systems high efficiency diesel engines and extensive use of lightweight materials each vehicle is a significant technological achievement and the auto makers each credited the government contribution to that achievement it is estimated that industry has spent on its own a billion dollars of its own money on these concepts which would not have been invested in the absence of the pngv program so i think this program is working and at a time when energy prices are on the minds of the american people where in the midwest gas prices are at 2 50 finally doing something with innovative technology to bring on these more efficient cars seems exactly the right thing for the federal government to be doing in a partnership with the private sector i commend this administration for what it has done and i also want to reiterate of the 128 million appropriated by the departments pngv efforts in fiscal year 1999 less than 3 percent 3 million was sent to general motors ford and daimlerchrysler most of the funds were passed through to subcontractors the majority of the appropriation as mentioned by the gentleman from michigan approximately 63 percent was distributed to the department of energy national labs and only a small portion passed through the laboratories to other businesses about 30 percent of the appropriations supported large automotive suppliers and approximately 7 percent supported small businesses and universities by technologies fuel cells rank first with 33

children in greatest need to services the universal breakfast pilot project is based on the premise that children who do not eat at school dont eat breakfast and that more children would eat breakfast at school if all children could eat for free any school that wants to participate in the school breakfast program with federal reimbursements can do so and all children are eligible for participation however in contrast to a universal breakfast program only lowincome children are eligible for free meals the school breakfast program has grown tremendously over the past years in 1980 approximately 33 000 schools served breakfast in 1990 approximately 43 000 schools participated this year approximately 74 000 schools did the number of children participating in breakfast programs has increased as well during the past 10 years the number of children receiving school breakfasts rose 88 percent climbing from4 million to 7 5 million over 85 percent of lowincome children enrolled in elementary school attend a school of fering thebreakfast program this is an important fact because there are more breakfast programs in elementary than secondary schools as a results the opportunity to participate in a breakfast program is available to the majority of lowincome children in elementary schools i doubt there is any member in this body who would disagree with the fact that breakfast is an important meal for children ithelps provide them the energy they need to perform will in school we do not need to prove this through a demonstration program what is under debate is who is responsible for feeding our nations children while i believe it is important that all children have an opportunity to participate in a school breakfast program 1 also think the primary responsibility for feeding children lies with their parents any proposal tomake school breakfast free to children at all income levels in all schools would primarily subsidize middle and upper income children who do not need a free breakfast one reason children do not participate in the breakfast program to the extent they participate in the lunch program is that many children eat breakfast at home with their families this is notusually an option for lunch why would we want to encourage children to eat at school when they can spend valuable time with their parents if the argument in support of a universal breakfast program is that it will reduce the number of children who are missing breakfast large research evaluations funded by the usda in the eariy 1990s do not support that contention studies show

time as i may consume h r 1887 would make it a violation of federal law to knowingly create sell or possess with intent to sell a depiction of animal cruelty at the subcommittee markup we added a provision which exempted possession and distribution of such materials for scientific political historical educational artistic religious or journalistic purposes although this narrows the application of the bill considerably i am not convinced that the bill meets the provisions of the first amendment to the united states constitution which prohibits reinstructions on speech including speech that most find disgusting or unpopular in unitedstates v eichman a 1990 case the supreme court said and i quote if there is a bedrock principle underlying the first amendment it is that the government may not prohibit expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable it is without question that the conduct at issue today is offensive and disagreeable and it is also clear that we can constitutionally prohibit cruelty to animals however it is clear that we cannot prohibit the communications regarding such acts including the film communications done for purely commercial gains all states already have some form of animal protection laws which would likely prohibit the crushing of animals in a manner depicted in the socalled crush video films and prohibiting the crushing of animals in the manner suggested in the bill raises no constitutional issues but the communication through film is speech which is protected by the first amendment of the united states constitution films of animals being crushed are communications about the acts depicted not doing the acts in fact the content in these films is no different than the content of a closedcircuit film of actual robberies or other crimes which are used on the cops on the beat tv shows in order to compete for rates and advertising revenues that they bring in in those videos human beings are intentionally killed or pistol whipped by criminals and those videos would not be affected by this bill the supreme court has consistently refused to carve out new exceptions to the first amendment although one cannot endanger the public by yelling fire in a crowded theater and one cannot traffic in child pornography speech has been restricted in precious few examples obscene speech is one type of speech which has been restricted first to be obscene it has to appeal to prurient or sexually unhealthy and degrading interest second it has to violate contemporary community standards which are judged on a statebystate indeed communitybycommunity basis not a national basis and third when taken as a whole it must be entirely lacking in redeeming literary artistic political or scientific merit while h r 1887 would apply to some obscene material many videos covered by the bill are clearly not obscene we have other supreme court cases which indicate that speech can also be restricted when there is a compelling state interest to do so however such restrictions must meet the strict scrutiny test which requires that it is necessary to serve a compelling governmental interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that end although it is clear that the governmental interests in protecting human rights may be sufficiently compelling to justify restrictions on rights otherwise protected by the constitution the question posed by this bill is vhether protecting animals rights counterbalances citizens fundamental constitutional rights it would seem from the case in 1993 city of hialeah that the answer to that question is no in that case the city of hialeah enacted various ordinances to prevent cruelty to animals by prohibiting animal sacrifices which were part of the santerian religion one of the asserted bases for the ordinance was protection of animals although the district court found a compelling governmental interest in protecting animals the supreme court invalidated those ordinances as an infringement on the first amendments free exercise of religion clause although the supreme court recognized the governmental interest in protecting animals from cruelty that interest did not justify violating the rights of citizens to freely exercise their religion therefore on balance animal rights do not supersede fundamental human constitutional rights so while the government can and does protect animals from acts of cruelty making of the films of such acts are unlikely to constitute compelling state interest sufficient to justify rights which are otherwise protected by the constitution now one argument to justify this as a compelling state interest is the suggestion of the correlation between serial killers and the indication that they often begin by torturing animals yet the suggestion is that the serial killers actually torture the animals themselves not just watch videos and certainly there is no indication that a store clerk selling videos is a danger to society therefore it does not appear that there is a compelling state interest to violate the freedom of speech constitutional right but even if there were a compelling state interest it fails the strict scrutiny test because it is not narrowly tailored although the bill is tailored to avoid some of the more obvious first amendment issues it leaves so much of what it is purportedly aimed at is in fact uncovered that it falls into the problem encountered by the hialeah case there the ordinances prohibited the practices of the santerians in a way of protecting public health but it did not prohibit practices generally or pursue less offensive ways to accomplish the goals such as requiring the same sanitation activities throughout the city here the bill prohibits the commercial use of videos in a way to prohibit the cruelty to animals but does not prohibit personal creation or use of the videos the bill also exempts serious political scientific educational historical religious artistical or journalistic uses of such films as legitimate purposes for disseminating them it is also apparent the bill does not prohibit maiming mutilating wounding or killing animals in connection with food preparation or for clothing preparation such as bashing heads of baby seals and skinning them sometimes alive and those kinds of videos for hunting and fishing or for pest control on the other hand the bill makes illegal depictions of activities that are not illegal when or where made and if those activities are illegal in the state where the depictions are possessed for example bullfighting may be illegal in virginia so possessing for sale of a film in virginia depicting a bullfight in spain would violate the act thus as in the hialeah case the bill purports to prevent animal cruelty by stopping the creation and distribution of films but only when it is used for commercial purposes a more narrowly tailored way to get at such cruelty would be to prosecute those who are actually engaged in the activities considered cruel so although i commend the author of the bill the gentleman from california"], [0.00030940771102905273, 0.500309407711029, 0,
