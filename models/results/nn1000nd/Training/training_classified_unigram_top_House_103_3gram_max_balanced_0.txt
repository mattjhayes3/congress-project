and troubling a lot of us from the state of california two years ago i came here as a former small business owner thinking that i could have a real opportunity to help this nations small businesses however i found out over the last 2 weeks that that is not necessarily true let me tell what happened the lkst 2 weeks several weeks ago i found out that sba a federal agency that is supposed to act as an advocate of small businesses spent over 100 000 of taxpayers money to promote employee mandates i was shocked that the sba would do such a thing especially since small business owners and employees overwhelmingly oppose employer mandates they are frightened for good reason every credible study predicts substantial job losses as a result of the employer mandates so i decided to offer an amendment which would change this ridiculous situation my amendment was simple it would prohibit the sba from spending taxpayer dollars to promote employer mandates the first thing i found out is that my amendment will not be allowed to be offered on the floor unless the rules committee approves the rules committee decides which amendments can and cannot be offered on the house floor for debate so i went to the rules committee to offer my amendment i thought that this was a simple amendment and that it should not have any problem being accepted when i walked into the rules committee i was surprised i found out something interesting there are nine democrats and only four republicans serving on that committee suddenly i had a bad feeling about my amendments chances sure enough the democratcontrolled rules committee rejected my amendment remember my amendment is simply asking sba not to spend taxpayers money to promote employer mandates it was simply rejected they said that the sba bill was not the appropriate place to debate health care issues despite the fact that my amendment dealt specifically with the sba and despite the fact that our own house parliamentarian ruled that my amendment was perfectly germane this ruling was obviously very unfair so i went to the house floor to try and overturn the rules committees decision and you can guess it i was defeated again even though 10 brave democrats stood up lid joined all of the republicans in voting to overturn this unfair decision my amendment again was blocked despite this defeat i was not willing to give up the fight for small businesses in fact i found out that i had one last chance to get a vote on my amendment i decided to offer a socalled motion to recommit which would have forced the house to debate and vote on my amendment just as i was preparing to offer my motion the democratic leadership removed the entire sba billthe bill i was trying to amendoff the floor why did they do this let me tell you why because they did not want to have a vote on my amendment they are scared to have a vote on my amendment they are terrified that this body might actually pass my amendment and reveal the truth that the american people dont want employer mandates and being taken over by government small business people do not want employer mandates california people do not want employer mandates because they know that with employer mandates it is not a question of whether jobs will be lost it is just a question of how many jobs will be lost this is exactly why the american people are so frustrated with congress they are frustrated because instead of debating issues openly and honestly the democrat leadership of this body delays and hides behind parliamentary rules the american people are frustrated because instead of telling the truth about employer mandates the democratic leadership uses its dominance of the house to force members to toe the biggovernment line on health care reform the american people should know the democrat leadership is holding a bill hostage which would provide funding for an entire agency because they do not want to deal with employer mandates which is my amendment

of the freshman class in this body when these members ran for election last year did they tell the voters that they were intending to vote for the largest tax increase in unitedstates history i dont think so did they tell the votersthat they would cast their vote to raise taxes dramatically long before ever voting for any spending cuts i dont think so i dont think my colleagues ran as business as usual tax and spend democrats well then let me explain this budget bill the clinton administration is asking freshmen representatives to support its called the omnibus budget reconciliation act the name is purposely confusing so that the american public is deceived into thinking its something harmless or even good i want the american public to know that this now budget bill really is the largest tax increase in american history it will cost american taxpayers at least 332 billion over the next 5 years as a freshman i have a hard time committing american taxpayers to 332 billion as an engineer i always like to quantify figures using basic math lets see how much this tax hike will really mean to the american family my district is one of 435 districts so i took 332 billion and divided it by 435 the result is 760 million per district that means my district in california alone would be obligated to pay 760 million in new taxes over the next 5 years then i took this simple math a step further there are about 570 000 people in my district so i divided 760 million by 570 000 people i was shocked to see that every man woman and child would have to come up with over 1 300 this means that the average family of 5 will be assessed nearly 7 000 in new tax increases let me repeat 7 000 in new tax increases america has never had this huge a tax increase in its entire history but thats not all this tax bill also includes a new btu tax again lets be honest this is a hidden gas tax this btu tax means 8 cents a gallon that might not should like much but it is were told avg 450 yr of new btu taxes per family is not that big a deal to the average american family i guess this is true its only the price of 2 haircuts but this is not all this btu tax is indexed annually for inflation the cost of this new tax will grow higher and higher each year but wait there is more the btu tax isnt just a gas tax on automobiles it also translates into more taxes on electricity water heating oil and almost every other products so by the time all these new taxes are added together i wouldnt be surprised if the total burden to the average family of 5 will exceed 10 000 in new tax increases thats outrageous we must stop this madness the point i raise for my fellow democratic freshmen is that a yes vote on this tax bill will have grave consequences in 1994 good luck going home and telling people that we voted for the biggest tax increase in unitedstates history i just wanted to quantify this bill using simple mathematics so that the american public will be told the truth let me repeat for the average family of five were looking at nearly 10 000 new taxes i say dont raise taxes no nation has ever taxed its way into prosperity cut these hundreds of wasteful government subsides

would skyrocket from 388 million this year to 541 million in fiscal year 1994 and 1 billion in fiscal year 1995 my amendment would prevent this profligacy and save the taxpayers 800 million it was just a few short weeks ago that the democrats in this house passed a 5year budget plan which included the largest tax increase in american history we were told then by the democrat majority that this hefty contribution on the part of hard working taxpayers was necessary to reduce the federal budget deficit and here they propose increasing spending on corporate giveaway programs by 158 percent and what does h r 820 do under this bill the federal government is going to build an enormous network of technology centers so bureaucrats can show business men and women what machines to buy and how to run their businesses and the same people who gripe about socalled junk bonds are putting uncle sam in the venture capital business if you thought the s l crisis was bad wait until bureaucrats start making multimilliondollar commercial loans and finally the government is going to spend hundreds of millions each year picking winners and losers in the name of promoting technology here is what we are saying to the taxpayers today the government that brought you amtrak the post office the usda and 500 toilet seats at the pentagon is going to teach real entrepreneurs how to beat international competition the reason this bill is on the floor of course is that the majority believes that committees here in congress and the bureaucrats at the commerce department know how to run the economy as

savings to start a real business in the real world well let us take a look at what the democrat majority has already done for business this year it has heaped another mandate on workers and business in the form of mandated leave legislation it has passed a budget resolution which promises business higher energy and corporate income taxes the majority has promised the business community and the country another 5 years of huge budget deficits which will deprive the private sector access to capital but we have only just begun on the way is striker replacement and the rest of the big labor and trial lawyer agenda which will undermine americas competitiveness the finest illustration of the economic illiteracy of the majority is this the democrat party opposes indexing the capital gains taxwhich lowers the cost of capitalyet supports indexing the minimum wagewhich increases the cost of labor but the democrats are here to help business today they say the party that beleaguers business with higher taxes and regulations at every opportunity now wants to help the majority wants to promote economic growth and jobs through investment sounding ironically like supplyside onservativq republicans but as my friend jude wanniski says the majority is operating on the dark side of the supplyside modelinvesting in government bureaucracies instead of the private sector so as russia sweden mexico france poland and on and onmove away from state planning to emulate the american model of free enterprise the majoritywhile paying lipservice to the market seeks to move more and more resources from the productive private sector to the wasteful public sector if my democrat friends are genuinely interested in creating real jobs in the private sector they should consider this over the last 4 years the tax and regulatory burden on small business has increased 34 percent these small businesses create 76 percent of the new jobs in the economy if you want to help the entrepreneur lower his cost of capital stop tying his hands with unnecessary red and green tape do not raise his energy costs and corporate taxes reform americas legal liability laws amend antiquated antitrust law in short get the government off the backs of small business but do not burden all businesses with massive new taxes and regulations and then give away a billion dollars to the politically

the democrat majority in congress the budget proposal offered by the democrats is a recipe for economic and fiscal disaster it proposes to increase taxes at a time when americans are already overtaxed it proposes to increase taxes at a itime when we have a fragile economy higher taxes will only stifle job creation and economic growth it proposes to continue the path of excessive govemnment spending excessive spending is the reason our federal government is currently saddled with a massive debt depending on whose estimates you believe bill clinton is proposing to raise taxes anywhere from 250 billion to 315 billion no matter which figure you use if his proposal becomes law it will be the largest tax increase in the history of our nation moreover egardless of the exact figures his proposal taxes everyone from the small business owner to the social security recipient to the working middle income american family and we thought mr clinton was only going to sock it to the rich it is an absolute outrage that a man who actually promised middle american taxpayers a tax cut during the campaign can now turn around and unblushingly pr6pose to raise taxes in a magnitude of historic proportions mr clintons assertion that the reason he must now raise taxes is because the deficit figure is higherthan he anticipated during the campaign is quite frankly bull in fact last july during the campaign clinton predicted even higher deficitsup to 40u billionthan actually materialized moreover democrat budget committee members advising clinton during the campaign and working with their good friends at the congressional budget office certainly were well aware of what to expect in the way of deficit figures most conspicuous among those members is leon panetta former chairman of the housebudget committee and now clintons director of office of management and budget for clinton to rationalize raising taxes based on claims of new deficit figures is the height of hypocrisy this is just another example of mr clinton trying to be slick more importantly regardlessof what the actual deficit figures are t is excessive spending not insufficient tax revenues that has produced our gushing red ink indeed when you combine federal state and local taxes you find that the american taxpayer is already being taxed at alltime record high levels analyzing the federal budget over the past 12 years further drives home thepoint in 1980 revenues to the federal treasury were 500 billion by 1992 revenues had soared to 1 1 trillion a massive 600 billion increase in 12 years in other words in 12 years the american taxpayer shouldered an additional federal tax burden that was greater than the magnitude of the entire tax burden it took us over 200 years to reach one would think that the federal government could do just fine with 600 billion in new tax dollars each year but alas it isnt enough to quench the insatiable thirst of democrats in congress during that same timeframe federal expenditures rose frem 600 billion to nearly 1 4 trillionan increase of 800 billion this simply illustrates the historical fact that for every new dollar the treasury receives in taxes congress spends 1 60 more indeed the 1990 budget deal which had promised spending cuts for every dollar in new taxes instead resulted in congress spending an additional 2 37 for every dollar in new taxes republicans have been willing to make the hard choices and make the spendlng cuts how many times in the past 12 years have i seen this congress on a party ing vote reject republican amendments to trim as little as 1 percent from an appropriation bill how many times have i seen the democratcontrolled rules committee decide to prevent republlcant from offering amendments to cut spending and make economies indeed in that regard i was deeply disappointed that the democrats did not allow my good friend from indiana congressman dan burton to offer his budget freeze proposal i have long been an advocate of an across the board spending freeze mr burrons proposal would have made a bigger dent in the deficit than any of the proposals before us today moreover in my view mr burtons

alternatives and the budget proposal offered by my good fmlend john kasich is the kind of proposal that the american public deserves it proposes no tax increases and will cut the deficit significantly

down for a couple of weeks because they ran out of money funny socialism always runs out of money because governments never spend money in an efficient manner so canadians saw their biggest hospital close down for 2 weeks because they ran out of money then we discovered something else about canadian health care there are 177 000 canadians who are waiting for operations they are waiting in line for operations because you know what socialism causes lines if you do not think so go to the kremlin sometime take a trip to some of those liberated countries in eastern europe socialism causes lines and about 25 percent of the people who were surveyed in canada of those 177 000 waiting in line for an operation 25 percent of them said they are in pain while they wait 01610 we looked at other

day and i had this impression i do not know if my colleagues or you have seen that have read about those professional packers that they have in japan on the subway trains where they get everybody they possible can into the train right at rush hour then they have two professional packers these packers are like sumo wrestler they are big healthy people they do not hurt anybody but their job is to pack the last possible person that they can get into that train they want to get that guy picked right inside there so they can close the doors and go out with a full train that is the impression i

efficiency they are a little bit short on privacy let us look at great britain which has socialized medicine that socialism that winston churchill described as shared misery they have a system in which senior citizens elderly people are not given lifesaving operations that is because socialism never works very effectively and they ran out of money so they tell senior citizens who are over a certain age you cannot have this lifesaving operation because you have lived a long and full life and you have to fall off the tree like a leaf in the autumn and let a younger person have that lifesaving operation that is great unless you happen to have fathers and mothers and grandfathers and grandmothers who mean something to you and you know american families have a lot of grandmothers and grandfathers who mean something to them and so we do not want to have that brand of socialized medicine to date this administration has not shown us one model country that has a medical system a socialized medical system that we should follow last let me talk about something that is kind of near and dear to americans hearts that is a job remember that gentleman herb kane who stood with the president on a nationally televised program and he said he is a guy who owns godfathers pizza his father worked three jobs a day so he could go to college and become a success and herb kane said mr president i have put a pencil to your numbers here to your plan i will have to fire a lot of people i am paraphrasing him he said this is not going to work out i am going to have to close down franchises and get rid of folks the president said to him i do not know why you just cannot raise the cost of your pizza i could see a look of shock on mr kanes face and when he addressed the republicans recently he said to the effect if i could get more money for my pizzas i would be doing it you cannot just raise the price of your product and expect to continue in business he said i am asked by people why i do not feel i have a duty to give every single person who works for me a health care plan he says that is because my first duty is to give them a job and we are going to lose a lot of jobs under socialized medicine the plan that the gentleman from missouri is putting together with other democrat leaders right now is socialized medicine it is socialized medicine that is going to require employer mandates that means employers are going to have to pay a big new tax we have a group that is a think tank and there is plenty of think tanks around the country but the consad study group did an evaluation on how many american jobs will be lost under the ways and means committee plan that is the democratcontrolled committee that developed the plan in this house that is being followed by the gentleman from missouri by the democrat leadership is putting together their socialized medicine plan let me tell you how many jobs they say will be lost and how many will be affected what is an affected job it is a job not lost it is a job where you never get any raise you do not get any raise because your employer is spending the money he would have used to give you a raise

the c17 cargo plane program specifically i would like to urge my colleagues to support the harman amendment which restores the administrations request for six aircraft instead of four as in the current bill language and oppose the furse amendment which terminates the program entirely in a time when we are trying to reduce our nations defense spending and decrease our worldwide force structure supporting the construction of six c17s in fiscal year 1995 makes the most economical and military sense authorizing the construction of six instead of four planes is the least expensive way to meet the nations military airlift needs maintaining a production rate of six per year will decrease the unit costs of the planes and will not undercut the department of defenses strategy to control program costs this rate will also allow the prime contractor program costs this rate will also allow the prime contractor mcdonnell douglas to show that it can bring costs down and ensure that we produce the c17 in the most efficient manner additionally it is important to mention that the harman amendment does not add to the overall cost of the bill but merely reprograms funds already included in the bill to cover the cost of the additional two planes in this postcoldwar era there is less of a need to station troops abroad and maintain large military installations around the globe as we have seen in grenada the persian gulf and somalia however there is still a great need for the united states military to have the capability to move large numbers of troops and equipment in and out of remote areas quickly our current airlift capabilities simply do not make the grade the c141s which was designed in the 1950s and produced in the 1960s are falling apart and cannot land at small austere airfields while the c5 is able to carry similar payloads as the c17 the c6 complicates deployment planning because it requires excessively long and wide runways which are not always available in developing countries further the air force has testified that there have been instances at large military fields in europe when operations had to be suspended because a c5 was unloading and could not get off the runway to allow other planes to land or takeoff if we are to reduce our global military presence it is essential that we continue building c17s which give us the ability to move troops

the commercial pw2000 enginewas developed entirely by pratt whitney and its commercial partners this alone saved the government over 1 5 billion additionally none of the cost overrunes or production problems have resulted from the fl17 engine to stop the program now would mean the loss of another 200 to 300 jobs in middletown in an area that has been hard hit by the downsizing of the defense and insurance industries and where pratt alone has laidoff 6 700 employees during the past year the cancellation of the c17 program would be devastating in closing i ask that my colleagues do what makes

let me say at the outset that i support this amendment and i believe that the chairman of the committee on agriculture the gentleman from texas and the gentleman from oklahoma are seeking to do with this amendment is to make certain that the concept of a rural development administration survives i will say to my colleagues that there are some differences of opinion among members of the subcommittee as to the future and the efficacy of this agency it has a lot to do with the fact that somewhere along the line we established some seven regional offices across the united states those regional offices became a new layer of approval for those communities which are seeking water and sewer grants through the farmers home administration what we did in fact by creating those regional offices was to create a new level of bureaucracy a new stage in the approval process and a great inconvenience to a lot of small communities that are seeking to improve their water and sewer facilities so we tried through the subcommittee on appropriations to eliminate the rda we heard from the administration that their concept of a rural development administration was being pursued as part of reorganization that is why i have acceded to the request by the committee on agriculture to continue the work of the agency but to eliminate the regional offices the net impact of this as i understand it is that those who are working with rda will be also working in the same offices with folks from the farmers home administration which means that state by state each community can still continue to work with the state farmers home office and the representatives of rda to get the job done it will cut down on paperwork it will cut down on the time for approval and i think in cutting

less than the price that is being paid by our unitedstates mint who uses these zinc to mint pennies as a result we could actually save the federal government 2 5 million a year if we would be able to work out a methodology where we could transfer from one part of government that is the department of defense over to the unitedstates mint so there are many things like that we need to look at of course as we are downsizing i trust the chairman who is taking over this committee at one of the most challenging times from what i have heard from the members of the gentlemans committee he is
