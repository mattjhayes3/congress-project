recreation for many across the nation my own hometown of sacramento is but a couple of hours from tahoe national forest throughout the year sacramentans can be found taking advantage of this proximity using the park for hiking skiing and camping with 18 national forests and 20 million acres of national forestland in my home state of california we face the challenge of a wildfire on almost an annual basis many western states deal with forest fires every summer in addition americass forests also endure damage from hurricanes floods mudslides and our natural disasters all of these events require swift action from our nations brave network of first responders as well as tailored government policies to help forests regenerate over the long term the rule before us would authorize debate on h r 4200 a bill which its supporters see as a way to speed forest recovery by loosening or eliminating some federal regulations protecting our public lands such a proposal demands scrutiny and debate to warrant congressional action there must be a demonstrable need for such a proposal and reliable proof that the proposed solution meets that need unfortunately the evidence on the need for this bill points in both directions while some sources claim that this bill would improve the state of forests other scientific accounts indicate that h r 4200 would actually hurt the forest recovery process we do know that it would create a loophole to allow some industries to skirt compliance with the national environmental policy act and the endangered species act supporters contend that the logging industry is saddled with unfair government regulations which impede their postfire operations and ultimately hurt the forests themselves at the same time 35 percent of all logging in national forests in the past 6 years came from timber salvage in ways similar to this bill accounting for 35 million to 40 million annually the only difference is that now these activities have to comply fully with nepa and the endangered species act before moving forward while a cbo estimate projects that this bill would increase timber profits from salvaging by 40 percent the first question which must be answered is not one of business but one of science does the policy recommended under this bill make sense as i stated at the beginning the evidence is too murky to tell and we need to spend more time learning about and debating this issue before we act i am encouraged that the rules committee recognized this and made four amendments in order which will add to the public discourse on this bill however it is difficult to ignore the arguments of those opposed to h r 4200 one such voice comes from a january 2006 issue of sciencd magazine in that issue a group of researchers published a study of logging in the aftermath of the 2002 biscuit fire in oregon this peerreviewed study concluded that the impact of logging in these areas reduced regeneration of new trees by some 70 percent this single scientific articleis not the final word on such a complicated matter for sure but its findings are consistent withi a good portion of the larger body of literature on this subject and when so many experts express concern with h r 4200 members would be well advised to listen to their reservations and take time to reconsider the issue i will insert at this point in the record a letter to congress signed by 169 experts in the areas of biology ecology and forest management this group of researchers includes uc davis professors dr robert coats and dr peter moyle as well as 13 other californians dear members of congress the united states has made great strides by relying on science to inform our decision making science helped us travel to the moon advance medicine and health and understand the complex web of life on land and in rivers lakes and oceans science has also opened our eyes to the workings of forests and provided blueprints for federal plans to better protect the abundant natural resources of our public lands when we as scientists see policies being developed that run counter to the lessons of science we feel compelled to speak up proposed postdisturbance legislation specifically the forest emergency recovery and research act and the related forests for future generations act crafted as a response to recent fires and other disturbances is misguided because it distorts or ignores recent scientific advances under the labels of recovery and restoration these bills would speed logging and replanting after natural disturbances although logging and replanting may seem like a reasonable way to clean up and restore forests after disturbances like wildland fires such activity would actually slow the natural recovery of forests and of streams and creatures within them many scientistreviewed studies and syntheses please see the selected citations appended to this letter have recently come to this conclusion for example no substantive evidence supports the idea that fireadapted forests might be improved by logging after a fire in fact many carefully conducted studies have concluded just the opposite most plants and animals in these forests are adapted to periodic fires and other natural disturbances they have a remarkable way of recoveringliterally rising from the ashesbecause they have evolved with and even depend upon fire we are concerned that h r 4200 and s 2079 will bind us to land management practices that perhaps logical in the past are no longer tenable in the light of recent scientific understanding specifically postdisturbance logging impedes regeneration of forest landscapes when it compacts soils removes or destroys socalled biological legacies such as soil organic material seeds in the soil large standing and downed trees damages riparian corridors introduces or spreads invasive species causes erosion delivers sediment to streams from logging roads and steep slopes degrades water quality and damages populations of many aquatic species in testimony before the house subcommittee on resources november 10 2005 eminent forest ecologist and university of washington professor jerry franklin noted that logging dead trees often has greater negative impacts than logging of live trees he concluded that timber salvage is most appropriately viewed as a tax on ecological recovery beyond those concerns postdisturbance logging often intensifies the potential severity of future fires by concentrating the slash fromlogging at or near the ground rather than leaving plant material standingand providing perching nesting and feeding sites for wildlifesuch logging abruptly moves the material to the ground most of this material would naturally fall to the ground adding important supplies of nutrients and energy to the forest floor and structure in the form of woody debris to stream channels but this naturally happens over decades not in the relatively short time associated with a logging operation advocates of postdisturbance logging may argue that this slash can be disposed of with controlled burns and other treatments yet such treatments can severely damage underlying soils imposing other taxes on natural recovery one additional tax concerns us postfire logging taxes the public treasury recent analysis of postfire logging operations after oregons biscuit fire of 2002 shows that costs of the logging operations exceeded revenue by about 14 million for logging that removed more than 53 million board feet of timber dellasala et al 2006 science provides the best insight into the real consequences of our policies and actions ironically this legislation is crafted to ignore the science by waiving environmental reviews reviews that would makeuse of the scientific knowledge often available only because of expenditures of public funds failure to conduct full environmental reviews informed by that science will inevitably lead to ecological and economic harm from postdisturbance logging in short neither ecological benefits nor economic efficiency result from postdisturbance logging we therefore urge you to defeat these legislative efforts because they will set back forest recovery we urge you to work with your fellow lawmakers to craft legislation that will rely on the most uptodate scientific knowledge to protect the natural resources of the nations public lands

the day after carlie was abducted on an unrelated parole violation a woman who said she lived with smith was one of the tipsters who contacted the police of course he refused to admit any involvement

on his play station he loved playing with his sister dylan and his sister shasta were declared missing on may 16 2005 after police found the beaten and bound bodies of their mother their older brother and their mothers boyfriend authorities believe that joseph edward duncan iii a registered sex offender abducted shasta and dylan from their home and held them for 7 weeks at a primitive camp site in the vast forests of montana according to shasta duncan repeatedly molested the children and eventually he killed dylan shasta was discovered on july 2 at a local restaurant with duncan two days later human remains were discovered at that primitive remote western montana camp site and on july 10 the remains were identified as dylan groene this person 9 years of age investigators have not really told us exactly what they believe happened to dylan or how long they believe the boy was alive after the childrens mother 13yearold brother and her boyfriend were beaten to death but they have given us some information sheriff rocky watson has said that he believes the motives for the killings of course was to acquire these two children as sex objects watson always said authorities believe the family was chosen at random but the attack was carefully planned the police have interviewed shasta a couple of times and the details are agonizing and they are slow in being revealed but she has provided certain information thatis astonishing dylan when he was 9 like the others that i have mentioned was a real person he wanted to live like all kids but he never made it to his tenth birthday because of this criminal this individual by the name of joseph duncan ill joseph duncan by the time he was 16 he had committed 13 sexual assaults in 1980 duncan was arrested for breaking into a neighbors house stealing guns and then accosting a 14yearold and sexually assaulting him at gunpoint he was convicted of the rape and sentenced to a naximum of 20 years in the penitentiary however in lieu of prison somebody sent duncan to the sex offender treatment center at western state hospital an evaluation at western state mental hospital found that duncan who was then 17 met the definition of a sexual psychopath so western state hospital had given up on duncan then at 19 he announced that he wanted to leave treatment and serve the rest of his time in the penitentiary so he received 14 more years for the rape and sexual assault and 3 more for parole violations when he got out of the penitentiary he moved to fargo north dakota then after leaving the penitentiary he decided to create a blog on the internet many of the entries appear to focus on his own sexual abuse crimes and he seemed to be proud of it it also shows us his rage over how sex offenders are treated in our community brenda grone and her boyfriend mark mckenzie and the 13yearold slade grone were killed in their home sometime on may 15 by joseph edward duncan iii they were beaten to death with a hammer duncan after kidnapping shasta he told her and explained to her what he did to these three before he murdered them he said he watched the house and specifically had watched her for 2 or 3 days at night he would sneak up to the houseand peer into the windows he said it was real simple to kidnap them and kill the other three he said he used a night vision goggle to learn about the familys layout before breaking into the home and he bragged to shasta about killing her family with a hammer and he even taunted her with the hammer that he had used to kill her family duncan was charged with firstdegree

loved chocolate chip ice cream cookies and milk in july of 1994 at the age of 7 megan an enthusiastic animal lover was lured into a neighbors home 100 feet from her own door once again another child predator living in our neighborhoods she went over to his house with the hopes of seeing his new puppy he claimed he had that neighbor unknown to megans parents was a convicted sex offender the chatty little girl rode her bike over to jessie timmendequas home he told her that he had a puppy but it was too young to go outside so she needed to go inside to see it of course there was no puppy it was a lie the defendant timmendequas was a previously convicted sex offender and he sexually assaulted megan then like the others he murdered her when he got her into the house he tried to kiss her but she attempted to escape so he strangled megan with a belt he says he slammed her head into the dresser and strangled her he sexually assaulted her he tied two bags over her head he tied two bags over her head he put her body into a toy box and he drove his pickup truck to a nearby park with her in the toy box he sexually assaulted her again and dumped her body into a patch of high weeds in the hours following megans disappearance a massive search effort took place all over the quiet hamilton township of new jersey the red and blue lights of police cars filled the once quiet suburban neighborhoods police were instantly drawn to timmendequas home after learning that he and his roommates were both convicted sex offenders they immediately questioned him and only 1 day later he confessed and led the police to megans body his history well he had a criminal history of sexual assault of children in 1 979 timmendequas pled guilty to the attempted and aggravated sexual assault of a 5yearold girl in new jersey he was given a suspended sentence that means in simple terms he did not go to jail but somebody recommended that he get counseling for his sexual assaults he did spend 9 months in the middlesex adult correction center then in 1981 he pled guilty in regard to the sexual assault of a 7yearold girl he was imprisoned for 6 years in may of 1997 he was sentenced to death for the murder ofnichole kanka he remains on death row in new jersey state prison in trenton hopefully justice will be done and he will see his maker soon in honor of megans memory a section of the child safety act creates the megan nichole kanka and alexandra nichole zapp community notification program this program requires appropriate officials to notify the communities within 5 days of a change of a

she was confronted by a large hulking man armed with a knife the man richaxgt allen davis threatened to kill all the kirls if they did not do as he told them to davis made his way into the bedroom of the 12yearold polly klass and he tied her up with her two sleepover companions and then he abducted her when pollys body was found later she had been brutally sexually assaulted and strangled to death davis is a career criminal whose life has a twisted tangle of much violence and criminal activity a few days after pollys abduction davis confessed to the inurder and led the police to her body after a trial he was found guilty of first degree murder he was sentenced to death as he should have been perhaps the most telling part of pollys story is this according to pollys father she had always had a fear of the dark she had trouble sleeping unless there was a night light on as many children are she was scared of the boogey man and the possibility of being kidnapped it is unfortunate in our culture too many kids go to sleep afraid of the boogey man like richard allen davis it was something that she had discussed often with her parents and her father mark recalls with bitter irony how he

working americans who will be worse off under yet another morally reprehensible republican budget this budget insults students attacks veterans and bankrupts future generations a budget is a statement about priorities for the party of tom delay and jack abramoff that means rewarding corporate contributors at the expense of ordinary americans republicans protected billions of dollars in giveaways to an oil industry awash in profits but despite president bushs state of the union rhetoric this budget underfunded investments in alternative energy that are necessary to prevent global warming what else do the republicans believe is less important than additional billions of dollars in tax cuts for the wealthy education health care and the financial well being of our children and grandchildren despite record enrollment from prek to college republicans support large cuts to education this budget cuts department of education funding by 2 2 billionand provides 15 4 billion less than republicans promised when they passed no child left behind even though college costs have risen 40 percent since 2001 the republican budget again freezesthe maximum pell grant and denies more than 460 000 students lowcost higher education loans though 46 million americans lack health insurance the republican budget does nothing to improve access to quality careand actually includes policies that would increase the numbers of people without health insurance and who are underinsured rather than embrace necessary fixes to the medicare prescription drug program republicans instead chose to continue billions of dollars in overpayments to managed care plans and despite regularly thumping their chests while claiming to support the troops republicans propose 6 0 billion in cuts to veterans health care over five years many americans volunteer to serve their country but the republican party rarely serves them when george bush was elected president a satirical newspaper joked that our long national nightmare of peace and prosperity was finally over in the years since americans have leamed the republican record of warmongering and fiscal mismanagement is no laughing matter prior to this year republicans had already turned a 10year 5 6 trillion surplus and turned it into a 3 2 trillion deficit though this budget cowardly rails to include tens of billions in supplemental requests related to a misguided iraq war it nonetheless adds another 2 3 trillion to the rational debt over the next five years this budget makes clear what no amount of spin and lies can hide republicans care

facing record budget deficits that is the legacy of this republican leadership and the national debt which now stands at 8 4 trillion is exploding under this republican congress and administration

grossly underqualified for the important job of fema chief the key position for coordinating governmental response to domestic catastrophes his previous professional experience with the arabian horse

fiveweek vacation short by two days and dipping the wing of air force one as he jetted by the american people witnessed the bush administration negligent response to hurricane katrina and they want a

colleagues debbie wasserman schultz and also my good friends from the great state of massachusetts mr bill delahunt i am so glad mr delahunt is here we were talking earlier i had to chuckle there for a minute because mr delahunt always takes the opportunity and the privilege to share with us the printed word and it is good to have him here mr ryan will be joining us a little later if i could just take a moment here to let the members know that the great debate took place here on this floor a number of amendments were proposed to make sure that we pass a budget that is just and fair for every american but i must bring to the members attention because i think members do not realize what is happening or if they do realize what is happening i want to make sure that it is in the record that they know we talk about debt a lot in our 30 something working group and talking about debt and doing something about debt are two different things the republican majority continues to spend in a recordbreaking way that is bankrupting this country and changing the philosophy of this country which is payasyougo democrats we are the only party in this house that can say that we balanced the budget we have actually done it we have actually had surpluses as far as the eye can see republicans can only talk about well we would like to cut it in half and we would like to cut it back a quarter or what have you but i just want to make sure that folks understand that there was an article written on tuesday of this week entitled another possible bump to the debt ceiling 2 7 trillion budget plan pending before the house would raise the federal debt ceiling by nearly 10 trillion less than 2 months after the congress last raised the federal debt borrowing limit the provision is buried on page 121 of a 151page blueprint it serves as the backdrop for congressional action this week i think it is important and i usually have my letters here from the secretary of the treasury but i think it is important that the american people and the members of this house understand that what they are doing to this country recordbreaking debt i just want to make sure before we start off and then i am going to be kind of quiet here tonight because i know that we have a lot to share it is almost too much to share but i just want to share this with the members one more time we are talking about who are we borrowing from we are borrowing from japan at 682 8 billion china 249 8 billion the uk 223 2 billion the caribbean 115 3 billion taiwan 71 3 billion opec nations including saudi arabia and a number of nations that we have issues with 67 8 billion germany 65 7 billion korea 66 5 billion canada 53 8 billion and climbing if we do not stop this republican majority from continuing to raise this debt ceiling and burying it within the federal budget on what they believe their members have to vote for and this budget vote has been postponed and postponed and postponed not because the republican majority did not have time to deal with it they just did not want to do to their constituents what the majority wants them to do as long as we are here and we have breath in our bodies we are going to share with the members of this house that we will not allow this to be a back room with the lights off in the middle of the night proposition for the american people that they do not have any choices in but the special interests do i just in closing again history making this is not the kendrick meek report debbie wasserman schultz bill delahunt or tim ryan report this is facts not fiction the unitedstates department of the treasury backs this up 1 01 trillion borrowed in 224 years since 1776 to the year 2000 versus 1 05 trillion that was borrowed from 2001 to 2005 and counting from the president and the republican majority congress we are saying that we want to pay as we go we are saying that we want to make sure that we are fiscally responsible and we are saying that we

the worldthat they were unwilling to respect international law respect individual liberty respect sovereignty of nationsand that they were willing and desirous of engaging in mortal battleno other option was left to us or the civilized world abu musab alzarqawi on january 23 2005 said we have declared a fierce war on this evil principle of democracy and those who follow this wrong ideology so this discussion today comes down to a fundamental questionwhat is the appropriate strategy and tactic to adopt to win the war on terror will we withdraw and simply defenda policy of isolation and containment or will we aggressively combat terrorismand take the battle to our enemy this war is unlike any other in historywithout a doubt our enemy has no single home it recruits and trains its army from nations around the world the only unifying element is hatehate for the westhate for democracyhate for freedom of religionhate for liberty the only message our enemy understands is force period terrorists dont negotiateterrorists dont compromiseterrorists are not interested in peace to them thats weakness thankfully weve stayed the course thankfully weve persevered in both iraq and afghanistan the greatest threat to terrorism is freedom liberty and democracy in the middle east and beyond today the terrorists are truly on the run last week unitedstates and iraqi forces eliminated a qaeda in iraqs top terroristabu musab al zarqawi this was accomplished with excellent intelligenceknowing where the bad guys were and when and this information came from iraqi civiliansthat is a very positive sign this important step demonstrates many things we will hunt down terrorists and eliminate them wherever they are hiding the shackles of decades long terrorism are being removed from the middle east iraqi security forces are stepping up to the challenge iraqi citizens want to be free of terrorists and they are not going to sit idly by success breeds success never has that been more evident than this past week while zarqawi was eliminatedfinding him brought a treasure trove of information allowing unitedstates and iraqi forces to dismantle many more pieces of al qaedas puzzle success breeds success iraq just this past week selected 3 more officialscabinet ministersto serve in its standing government success breeds success it is also important for us to recall and

2005 when iraq started that democracy with that parliament that occurred people voted that day and of course there are those who said they will never vote they do not understand democracy they will never come out and vote and yet they did even though there were over 50 iraqis murdered because they chose to vote over 400 were wounded because they chose to vote and they did it anyway because freedom is that important but it all occurred because we are there our troops are there our young men and women are there doing what they can to have democracy in this part of the world that many years ago did not even understand the concept of it i appreciate the opportunity to make these comments the last 2 days i have stood on this house floor and mentioned two people in my district one a marine and one a soldier who gave their lives for this country in iraq gave their lives for the iraqi people and gave their lives for freedom both of them and their families have reiterated to me personally how they believed in what they were doing because they were doing the right thing i appreciate the chance to make these comments it is important that the american people focus finish the

dod inspector says we cannot find 8 billion and yet here we are in the congress owing 8 2 trillion in debt and the american people are out there working hard trying to do their best they support our troops they want us to support our troops but we have a responsibility and that is to rebuild public trust the public has lost faith in the congress of meeting its responsibility for oversight and i join the gentlewoman from ohio and my other colleagues and there are those on the republican side too that want to have an accountability to the american taxpayer it is time that we do so so i ask my colleagues on both sides of the political aisle for goodness sakes let us support the american taxpayer let us do what truman did saying to the people during world war ii we are going to fight this war and we are going to defeat the enemy but we are going to do it in a wise way we are going to protect the investment of the taxpayer lets do the same thing in 2006 that he did during the 1940s i

pay attention to more than 3 hours in a month to the intelligence needs of this country we have already talked about how vote after vote after vote by the democrats that they choose to gut our ability in my opinion to effectively not only have law enforcement but to chase down those that may do harm against this country some choose to characterize that we are not safer today than what we were

line of defense this resolution has nothing to do with that it is a resolution the force of this body to say we respect the men and women who on 9 11 gave their lives we are sorry for the men and women who have been injured as a result of that we are going to support our military we are going to support the families and we will never forget and we are going to back up our allies and we are

job of bringing in those issues about the 9 11 commission report and showing how we are doing the things that the 9 11 commission has said that we need to do it is something that i had intended to mention in my remarks but i am glad that you brought them up because you were very eloquent in what you said i want to say again that the republican leadership here the president the vice president the secretary of state we are all focused on improving national security for this country we want to make sure that the people of this nation know that they are secure in their everyday lives that they can go about their jobs go about their leisure and go about their business every day doing what they should be doing and forgetting in many ways what happened in 9 11 because they have a government a national government that is focused on the defense of this nation and national security and i want to encourage our democratic colleagues to hear what i know their constituents must be saying to them that they want to remain safe in this country and they want us to deal with those issues at this level we know no other level of government can do that and i feel confident that over the next week as we continue to deal with the issues that we need to deal with before we take a recess to go home and work on our campaigns that we will focus on the most important job of the federal government and that is securing this country and focusing on the defense of this country and making sure that our citizens can go about their daily lives feeling safe as we did before 9 11 hit and as we will again and i want to say to our leadership you have done a wonderful job in taking us closer and closer to a time when we will be able tb once again feel free to do all those things that we did before 9 11 and make sure that that kind of act never occurs in this country and yet we maintain our constitutional rights and privileges and at the same time go after terrorists where we should be

failure the policy of success i chaired the criminal justice drug policy subcommittee that was one of the responsibilities speaker hastert had before i inherited it from him he chaired the national security sub committee that had that responsibility we did everything we could during the clinton administration to get resources to colombia the liberals did everything they could to keep resources goingto colombia the policy was a policy of failure it was a policy of death and destruction thousands of people were slaughtered while the liberals in congress and the administration denied aid to colombia policemen were killed by the thousands members of the legislature members of the cabinet people on the street villages were wiped out because they did not want to send the necessary aid to colombia president bush thank god for president bush and his action and his policy of success he took a policy of success he put the resources there the murders are down dramatically the last speaker spoke about creating economic opportunity how can you create economic opportunity or economic activity when there is slaughter and chaos in the streets i went down with president pastrana and he wanted to sing kumbayah with the terrorists and the leftists and that approach did not work people continued to get slaughtered and the drugs came into this country in unprecedented amounts ask dea about drugs about heroin at the beginning of the clinton administration you know how much heroin was produced in colombia zero look at it now and look at it over the past years it flooded into our streets and killed our children and our most productive citizens and those with potential in this country by the thousands and has left thousands being destroyed in colombia this is a horrible amendment it would be a horrible step backwards to bring drugs into this country to stop a policy and now we have been blessed not only with a president with strong determination and a good successful policy in this country but one in that country who just got reelected and to cut his legs out from under him at this juncture when he has experienced success not only have we stopped the killings and the murders and the slaughters there and stopped people from dying in our streets the economy has dramatically increased almost doubled in colombia since presidents bush and uribes policies have taken place this would be a step backward this is a step towards death destruction and drugs coming into our country i have had it with the liberals who allowed this to happen and let thousands of people go to their deaths in colombia who allowed drugs to proliferate in that country and create and finance narcoterrorism which destroyed some of that region and thousands of lives there and thousands of lives here if we pass that amendment it is a horrible step back i cannot tell you how important this amendment is not only to the lives in colombia but to the lives of the young men and women and

act let me give a little bit of recent history you have heard a lot about past history in the state where i am from in florida redistricting was always a way that was used to discriminate against minorities and to stop minorities from the opportunity to elect candidates of their choice we all know that there is a substantial african american population in florida and a substantial hispanic american population in florida and yet and i do not want to sound partisan but the reality is that one party controlled the state legislature for 122 years during that entire time not once did they deem it necessary or important to create one african american congressional district one district for african americans so they could elect a candidate of their choice finally in redistricting before the 1992 elections after a lot of haggling and i was involved in that redistricting and other members who were then in the state legislature who are now in congress were also involved finally the thenmajority party the democratic party finally saw the wisdom to create one district where african americans could elect a candidate of their choice for congress and one district only where hispanic americans could elect a candidate of their choice we had to sue the state of florida we had to go to federal court to get more districts where hispanics and african americans could elect candidates of their choice and because of the voting rights act and because some of us sued the majority party in those days which was the democrats the courts agreed and created districts where three african american members of congress were elected serving in this wonderful body one of them is leading the effort on that side of the aisle for the implementation of this voting rights act again and two districts where hispanic americans could elect candidates of their choice we are not talking ancient history we are talking the need is still there today it is there the need is still there today in florida as a matter of fact we saw recently a group mostly from outside of florida spending millions of dollars hundreds of thousands of dollars in florida trying to get something on the ballot a group that supports multimember districts for the state of florida which have been proven to be discriminatory the threat is still there the need is still there that is why i am so grateful to
