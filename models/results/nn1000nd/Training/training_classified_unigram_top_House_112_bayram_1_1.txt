years of reckless spending the president is asking that we raise the debt ceiling once again but we have yet to see any concrete plan from this administration to help rein in the outofcontrol government spending that has brought us to the brink of a debt crisis so the house is once again leading in delivering on the message sent by the people of virginias fifth district to change the culture in washington and end the government spending spree by putting forth a commonsense proposal that will cut cap and balance federal spending and force washington to live within its means now is the time to put in place effective spending reforms to reduce our debt and deficits return certainty to the marketplace and preserve the american dream for our children and grandchildren"],

every monday night or the first night when we are in session but especially tonight as we close out black history month this is such an important time for this discussion i also thank you congresswoman christensen for your visionary and bold leadership as you continue to make history truly you have done remarkable work here in this body it is really especially poignant that this year during black history month the republican leadership has proposed a budget for fiscal year 2011 that will fall most heavily on the backs of the most vulnerable in our society african americans latinos and the poor those who have been shut out of the american dream at a time when we should be remembering and uplifting the accomplishments and contributions of african americans to the history culture civil rights and economy of america we are literally during this month debating steps that will severely undercut and undermine that legacy can we cut nearly 750 million from the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children the wic program while we have a record high unemployment rate throughout our country but especially among african americans we cant do that the unemployment rate among african americans is over 15 percent many african american women rely on wic while they seek jobs which we are trying to hopefully create how can we cut 317 million in funding for vital family planning health services provided through a network of clinics throughout the country that serves nearly one in five women these programs are vital not just in saving lives through cancer screening hiv and std testing and contraceptive services but for providing a link for the many poor and lowincome women in terms of their link to the public health system many of these women are african american women and how can we cut nearly 1 1 billion from the head start program which will effectively knock out 200 000 children from participating in this critical early education program which helps provide health nutritional and support services to prepare children for school many african americans who were part of the head start program are now making history in our country because of this great early childhood education program the other side has made it clear that no matter who is impacted by these cutswomen infants children the working poor people of color african americanstheir response consists of only three words so be it so be it if 800 000 jobs are lost so be it if people are put out on the street with no access to homeless assistance grants or temporary housing so be it if people dont get enough nutritional support or if kids have to go hungry so be it that is not what the civil rights movement was about we should be working together to build up a nation instead of tear down the very programs and institutions that have contributed to our nations growth and success we should be working together to reduce inequality help the unemployed and get our economy moving again above all we should be working to create jobs thats what so many prominent african american leaders have fought for over the yearsfrom those who are well known the world over like dr martin luther king jr to people who are sometimes well known just in their own neighborhood tonight there is one person i want to mention who influenced my life and the direction i took our late beloved former congresswoman shirley anita chisholm in 1968 congresswoman shirley chisholm was the first african american woman elected to congress and she was a founding member of the congressional black caucus we celebrate this year 40 years of this great institution in our congress the conscience of the congress it is the 42nd anniversary of the election of congresswoman chisholm who represented her brooklynbased congressional district with grace and distinction for 14 years earning a reputation as one of the houses most eloquent orators and greatest champions of human rights social and economic justice in 1972 congresswoman chisholm again made history when she became the first african american to run for the presidential nomination of a major party that campaign captured the imagination of millions and inspired countless individuals to engage in the political process for the first time and i know for a fact that congresswoman shirley chisholm paved the way for our great president obama to be able to win the presidency 2 years ago congresswoman chisholm was a catalyst for change giving voice to the overlooked and underrepresented members of our society people of color women children and the african american community and she fought for the unemployed she fought for those who wanted to work for those who were seeking the american dream i cant help but wonder what she would say right now if she knew this was taking place im sure she does know this is taking place and i can feel her telling us that we have to fight the good fight because her legacy is so important within the context of creating jobs that we are trying to do for our country later this week i will be introducing two pieces of legislation to honor the work of congresswoman shirley chisholm the first would recognize and celebrate the 42nd anniversary of her election to congress and the second would call on the postal service to issue a commemorative stamp honoring the life and accomplishments of congresswoman chisholm i urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support these bills as we work to finalize funding for the 2011 fiscal year let us remember that budgets are moral documents and as congresswoman chisholm said when morality comes up against profit it is seldom that profit loses so we have to stand up for morality reverend jim wallis and sojourners challenged us they asked us what would jesus cut programs to help the poor or wasteful weapons systems at the pentagon ending the war in afghanistan or programs to feed and shelter the poor this weekend once again i will be participating in the faith and politics civil rights pilgrimage we are going to selma montgomery and birmingham alabama the epicenter of the civil rights movement we will be led by our hero a warrior a great civil rights leader our colleague congressman john lewis who sacrificed so much for civil and human rights and economic justice i have participated in this pilgrimage many times and i always feel a sense of gratitude to congressman lewis and to rosa parks and to dr king to shirley chisholm to all of those who fought so hard for equality and jobs and freedom this year however i feel that many of these gains mind you that all of our great civil rights leaders fought for are about to be eroded due to the increasing income inequality and the reckless budget cuts which will gut so much in the way of our countrys response to the civil rights movement so as republicans fight us so hard to enact budget cuts that will destroy nearly 800 000 jobs be

black history month but i want to take a few minutes to talk about the future last december when faced with the prospect that tax rates for the richest 2 percent of americans would rise to where they were in the 1990s when we balanced the budget and enjoyed unprecedented prosperity republicans decided that extending these unnecessary and unaffordable tax cuts was their number one priority as we all remember they held muchneeded relief to the middle class hostage and they got their tax cut for millionaires and billionaires according to the joint committee on taxation this tax is adding 39 billion to the deficit this year and will add even more next year speaker boehner has said that our national debt is a moral issue and i agree with him we need to act to curb our exploding deficits and mounting debt but republicans and democrats have different approaches to the problem the republicans approach is the irresponsible continuing resolution that was passed by this house 10 days ago republicans would cut 600 million from the cops program and 256 million from the state and local law enforcement assistance program which would make our streets less safe republicans would cut 75 million from the legal services corporation which would deny legal services to the victims of domestic violence republicans would cut 53 million from the food safety and inspection service which would threaten public health republicans would completely eliminate family planning funding which would result in more unplanned pregnancies and more abortions adding insult to injury republicans would cut 758 million from women infants and children which would deny these mothers and children the nutrition they need to begin life on the right track republicans would cut pell grants by 15 percent which would deny young people the opportunity to get a college education i could go on but i think you get my point the cuts in the republican continuing resolution are shortsighted counterproductive and the wrong way to cut the deficit and the one community or the communities that will suffer the most are minority communities in this country and that includes the black communities black students black mothers and black infants as well mark zandi the former economic adviser to the mccain campaign said that these cuts will destroy 700 000 jobs and stall our economic recovery which would lessen future revenues and further exacerbate the debt problem and a goldman sachs economist warned that the republican plan could reduce our nations economic growth by 1 5 to 2 percent in the second and third quarters of this year maybe i should amend my previous statement the cuts in the republican cr are shortsighted counterproductive and may not even cut the deficit we need a smarter approach we need an approach of shared sacrifice not sacrifice by the most vulnerable we do need to cut the deficit but there are different ways to cut the deficit and i believe the republicans have chosen the wrong way democrats offer a better approach we can cut the deficit by at least 61 billion in such a manner that helps doesnt hurt struggling americans our economy and our shared future first as i mentioned before we need to get rid of once and for all the tax cuts for the richest 2 percent of americans it is too late to save the 39 billion that we wasted this year but we could save more than that next year next i think we need to get rid of special tax preferences for oil and gas companies many of which were instituted by republicans the last time they were in the majority this would save 44 billion over the next 10 years there is no good reason to keep these subsidies in place the oil companies have said themselves that they dont need them john hofmeister the former ceo of shell oil said on february 11 in the face of sustained high oil prices it was not an issuefor large companiesof needing the subsidies to entice us into looking for and producing more oil next defense secretary gates has called for 78 billion in defense cuts over the next 5 years saying that these funds can be cut without putting national security at risk we should listen to him i want to thank my friend

he said so be it in response to the likely job losses that will occur as a result of this continuing resolution an independent analysis by the nonpartisan economic policy institute indicates that this bill will result in the direct loss mind you of 800 000 private and public sector jobs instead of doing everything we can do to halt the loss of jobs and put people back to work this bill takes the wrong approach putting our economy and our country back on the path to recession for every job opening in this country we have 4 7 unemployed people who are looking for work why would we want to add to their numbers so be it cannot and should not be our response to this economic crisis not with a 9 percent unemployment rate and over 15 percent in communities of color and record layoffs and furloughs at the state level and especially not when republicans have the temerity to demand tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires paid for through borrowed money this is just wrong and its immoral as a member of the house appropriations subcommittee on labor health and human services and education i am in strong opposition to these cruel cuts budgets are moral documents and they are a reflection of who we are and what we value this spending bill makes it clear that the poor the young women the elderly teachers firefighters cops and the communities that they protect and serve are not valued make no mistake this bill will harm the most vulnerable among us and it represents a wrongheaded approach to reducing the deficit or expanding job growth in our country i am especially concerned about the proposed cuts to education and training programs among the range of cuts include workforce investment act programs which last year helped over 8 4 million job seekers find jobs they got additional education and job training support this is being cut all told when counting rescissions of prior funding elimination of the requested fy11 funding and the advanced funding needed to run these employment and training programs they will experience nearly a 5 billion cut republican cuts in job training will only prolong the recession keep unemployment high and keep more americans collecting unemployment instead of training and getting ready for our 21st century job opportunities how can we justify cutting job training programs in the middle of an economic crisis how will my republican colleagues respond to the unemployed in their communities who come to them and ask them for help will they just say so be it pell grants pell grants provide vital funds for students who wish to attend 2 and 4year colleges but who need help to pay their expenses in my district alone there are 16 institutions that provide pell grants to over 18 000 recipients this proposal would cut pell grants by 845 making college less affordable and accessible for lowand moderateincome students more than 8 million students benefit from pell grants and many would be hurt by this cut especially as schools are raising tuition fees to meet rising costs and to deal with tighter budgets the bill also entirely eliminates federal funding for supplemental educational opportunity grants which colleges and universities use to assist undergraduates who have the greatest financial need that program assisted 1 3 million college students last year head start under this proposal is cut by nearly 1 1 billion this will effectively knock out 200 000 children mind you in republican and democratic districts from participating in this critical early education program this helps provide health nutrition and supportive services to prepare our children for school the job corps program this program is cut by 891 million which will result in 21 384 jobs lost in communities in every state the majority of which are in the private sector there will be 1 7 billion lost in economic activity as a result of this and 36 000 atrisk young people will be turned away from job corps costing the government and the economy as much as 17 billion over the course of their lifetimes additionally the cuts will guarantee the closure mind you of 75 job corps centers across the nation in your districts and in our districts slashing one of the most effective accountable and marketdriven solutions for millions of youth who leave our schools unprepared is really the wrong move at the wrong time the majority has stated that they want to cut the deficit but in effect they are cutting the social safety net lifeline for those who need it the most this cr leads us down a path that will result in hopelessness joblessness and desperation and it destroys the future for our young people i urge my colleagues to meet the challenge before us and reverse the potential harm that will be inevitable if this bill is enacted i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.0007818937301635742, 0.9992181062698364, 1, "i am committed to cutting the deficit and i sought a seat on the budget committee to do so but i rise to express deep concerns over the congressional republicans irresponsible fiscal scheme that will harm communities and students back home that i represent we need a multiyear strategy to cut the debt and the deficit but a strategy that ensures that america retains its superiority in education innovation and research we must cut waste and close the huge tax loopholes written by lobbyists like the ones for oil companies but congressional republicans do not do this instead of tackling the debt and deficit in a smart and strategic way the congressional republicans scheme will result in job losses and it will make economic recovery more difficult for american families and businesses and here are some stark examples from the community i represent back in florida in the tampa bay area first on education and the pell grant i represent an education community with a large public research university a private college and many community colleges when the republicans propose cutting the pell grant and support to students this harms our ability to maintain our superiority in education when we are competing with countries all across the globe you know over 9 million students and families rely on the pell grant every year in america and we have worked very hard through the economic recovery to help those students maintain that same level of pell grants so dont take us backwards you shouldnt be taking us backwards do you know what its like for a hardworking family to pay tuition right now is tuition going down is tuition being cut are books being cut no so lets not turn our backs on our students and families at this time the same thing for head start in tampa and hillsborough counties we have an awardwinning head start initiative and the evidence that head start gives students a boost in life is very well known parents have to be involved we wish all eligible kids could get that boost even now before the congressional republican cuts we have 2 400 families on the waiting list and 1 000 infants and toddlers on the early start list the republican cuts again take us backwards i hear from back home that 452 families will be told that there is no room for their child they will also lay off 123 teachers just in my home county alone because in the state of florida they predict that they will have to lay off almost 2 000 teachers under your cuts schools and students the republicans again are off base in cutting my local schools particularly the title i schools that serve kids that need a little extra attention we estimate that republicans will be eliminating 20 to 30 jobs in my home district that serve students that need that achievement gap boost you are harming the high poverty middle and high school students also in the county across the bay that recently was able to expand beyond elementary school madam chairman rather than close the tax loophole for the oil companies that are making multibillion dollar profits the republicans instead cut my local police and sheriffs departments like the help we get under cops for the antimethamphetamine initiative and for our juvenile justice initiative to try to prevent gangs from forming in the counties the youth initiatives have received national awards from the attorney general and it would be a real shame if we had to turn these back also in my home county we rely on some very robust ports in the tampa bay area as our economic engine you are going to cut that support for that economic engine to dredge the canals and ports so the ships can come in and we rely on those for jobs you also are going to cut the national oceanic and atmospheric administration now after the gulf of mexico suffered the economic hit under the bp oil blowout our coastal communities were hurt badly the tourism industry the seafood industry and our wildlife habitat suffered significant damage so coming from florida when you all say that you are going to turn your backs on our ability to monitor our oceans that is very harmful because clean oceans and clean beaches mean a healthy economy certainly closing the oil company tax loophole would be a wiser course of action we all know how harsh it has been under the great recession with foreclosures it has hit us especially hard so hard that a local expert told me yesterday that the republican budget cuts to the magnitude

minority a motion to recommit with or without instructions i rise today in support of this rule and the underlying bill this legislation is simple direct and easy to understand the text of the threepage bill was posted last week on the rules committee web site this legislation is an attempt and an effort to provide more transparency and accountability in the government regulatory process something that my colleagues and i have called for numerous times over the last two congresses the legislation before us today calls for 10 house committees to review existing pending and proposed regulations and orders from agencies of the federal government particularly with respect to their effects on destroying jobs and economic growth with the current high unemployment rate it is essential we do everything reasonably possible that we can to look at and to reduce government rules and regulations that impede job creation and economic growth that discourage innovation hurt or harm global competitiveness limit credit create economic uncertainty impose unnecessary paperwork and cost on small businesses and that result in largescale and often unnecessary unfunded mandates on employers that is exactly what this legislation would do and we are on the floor today to talk about this as an important component of allowing america to get back to work and to highlight these rules and regulations that stifle not only investment but also job creation every single member of congress understands and believes that regulations are needed to provide the rules safety and structures for this society to function properly while regulations are important they can also cross that fine line and can become too burdensome it is essential to strike a balance to ensure that the imposed rules and regulations do not lead to higher costs and less productive societies the federal government creates an average of 4 000 final regulations each year with about 500 to 700 that are reviewed by the white house according to a recent report from the small business administration the total cost of federal regulations has increased to 1 75 trillion a year from the unitedstates economy 1 75 trillion is what this burden is on the free enterprise system additionally the study shows that regulatory and paperwork costs were found to be more onerous for smaller firms than their larger counterparts more specifically the costs of regulations per employee for firms with fewer than 20 employees is now 10 585 a 36 percent difference between the costs incurred per employee by a larger firm this is absolutely outrageous this is outrageous because small business is the backbone and the engine of our economy it represents 99 7 percent of all employers small businesses according to the small business administration have generated 64 percent of net new jobs over the past 15 years while employing over half of all private sector employees one of the fastest ways to put americans back to work republicans believe is to limit the regulatory expenses that these small firms have to comply with simply to satisfy federal government regulations regulatory burdens are hindering job growth regulatory burdens are hindering investment and innovation while eroding some of the most basic and fundamental freedoms in america congress and this administration must work together to do more than prevent harmful new regulations they must also review study and eliminate unnecessary rules that are already on the books on january 18 of last month president obama signed an executive order to provide a governmentwide review of the rules already on the books to remove outdated regulations in an oped placed in the wall street journal last month by the president he clearly states that sometimes those rules have gotten out of balance placing unreasonable burdens on business burdens that have stifled innovation and have had a chilling effect upon growth and jobs i applaud and i appreciate the president for recognizing this and i ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to understand what we are attempting to do today and that is to support as best as we can not only the ideals that the president talked about but also a focus on these rules and regulations that stifle innovativeness create costs and ruin jobs in america while the president is now taking a step in the right direction when it comes to regulation in the last fiscal year alone the obama administration unleashed 43 major new regulations that will cost america more than new 28 billion annually these costs will affect americans in many ways from raising the price of cars where we buy food where we eat and every single one of these stands in the way of making the free enterprise more efficient and

had in this oped he can do something about it and that is join republicans who today are attempting to work with the president if the president is serious about reducing regulatory burdens impacting every american we can do this job together fifteen of the 42 regulations proposed last year were from the frankdodd financial regulatory bill another five stemmed from the obamacare bill and 10 others come from the environmental protection agency or what is known as the epa including the first mandatory reporting of greenhouse gas emissions the annual compliance costs constitute only a part of the economic burden of regulations on business many of these new rules curtail the purchase of new equipment conversions of industrial practices and are about revising data collection and reporting procedures one example is the new restriction on short sales from the frankdodd bill that requires the securities and exchange commission to make modifications to computer systems and surveillance mechanisms for gathering and managing this information that will cost over 1 billion that defies balance and i think ultimate accountability of what the regulations should be about we have an opportunity today to direct our committees to take the first step in reining in big government reducing our deficit and encouraging job growth and economic prosperity this simple bill is three pages long and it shines the light on the regulatory process and provides the necessary transparency and accountability on federal agencies that has been lacking for years my republican colleagues and i

deserves a shot at the american dream unfortunately the economy led by president barack obama is denying them the opportunities that they need actually according to an associated press analysis over 53 percent of young college graduates aged 25 or under which is 1 5 million young americans are unemployed or they hold lowwage jobs that dont require them to use the degrees that they just obtained our approach to help young people is about more than just the interest rate that they pay on their loans its about creating an economy that gives them a chance to apply the knowledge that they worked so hard to learn that means not raising taxes or imposing new regulations on the very job creators that will offer opportunities to our young people it means opening up energy reserves to lower prices at the pump because guess what young people also are paying these high gas prices as well lets stop the rise in student loan interest rates but at the same time lets get this economy moving so that americas young people can achieve their dreams"], [0.0018076896667480469, 0.49819231033325195, 1, "thank you mr chair i would like to let this congress know and the american people know that ive identified a funding source so that we can provide nutritious food and fresh fruits and vegetables to those americans who live in areas around this country that the gentlelady from texas so appropriately described as food deserts as a matter of fact this government currently spends hundreds of millions of dollars to build agricultural businesses to help support farmers to help new farmers start new agricultural businesses in order to address food desert issues unfortunately that money is not spent here to help americans eat better its spent in the afghanistan desert as a matter of fact in this previous fiscal year this government spent over 700 million on agricultural aid in afghanistan what i propose is to redirect 1 percent of that money thats going to afghanistan right now send it back to the united states so people here can eat nutritional food and have access to fresh fruits and vegetables and i would like to say one thing the argument on why were spending that kind of money to support farmers in afghanistan is because we dont want those farmers growing poppies to sell opium to fund safe havens for terrorists we understand that there are people around the world that want to attack this country like they did many years ago but because bin laden is now dead its time for us to reassess our mission in afghanistan we dont need to spend 100 billion a year in afghanistan right now we need to take a share of that money to help the american people so if we took 1 percent of the money that we spent last year we would be able to fund the program proposed by the gentlewoman from texas look ive got young folks in the city of detroit right now that would likely not have to resort to selling drugs if they could make a living in urban agriculture we need that money thats going to afghanistan we need it right here in the united states so we can help our farmers here so we can support farmers markets so we can provide food and nutritional supplements to our pregnant mothers and to their infants and children our people in the united states need a share of their own money back here and thats why i wanted to rise to raise this point now i understand that the rules of this house may not allow me tonight to redirect that money from afghanistan back here to this budget and you know what also too we could use a share of that money to help retire our deficit and debt at the same time id like to work with you on that but you know what we should do we should change these darn rules of the house so we can reduce the overspending help create jobs here reduce health care costsbecause people are going to be eating a lot better and help the american people right now during this economic recession id like to work with you id also like to work to change the rules of the house so that we can do this and i understand at this late date this is not the time to act but id like to pledge an agreement to work with the majority so that we can save the american people money save us health care costs provide better nutrition address those food desert issues fund the initiative proposed by the gentlelady from texas and help end this economic recession and return us to prosperity with that mr chair i ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment the acting chair without objection the amendment is withdrawn"], [0.0022388696670532227, 0.4977611303329468, 1, "thank you very much i rise to support the amendment im opposed to the point of order i think it is absolutely germane not only do we have a bill before us that will eliminate taxpayers ability to have their homes that are underwater refinanced this also impacts their taxes they will continue to have to be taxed on those homes at the same rate and so here we have before us the universal homeowner tax relief act that would impact 30 million americans nationwide and i must add that if we can in this house and in this congress give tax breaks to the richest 1 percent of americans in the way that we have done certainly we can support these homeowners who are underwater these homeowners who have been tricked into mortgages that they didnt understand these homeowners who are the victims of fraud and i think this is germane the acting chair the gentlewoman from california must confine her remarks to the point of order does any other member wish to speak to the point of order if not the chair is prepared to rule the gentlewoman from illinois makes the point of order that the amendment offered by the gentleman from new jersey is not germane the bill addresses repeal of a federal housing administration program that provides for refinancing of a specified set of mortgages one of the fundamental principles of germaneness is that the amendment must confine itself to the jurisdiction of the committees represented in the underlying bill the bill was referred to and reported by the committee on financial services the amendment proposes a direct amendment to the internal revenue code a matter within the jurisdiction of the committee on ways and means the amendment is therefore not germane the point of order is sustained"], [0.0023464560508728027,

aviation administration programs i said this of the most recent extension almost two months ago and i will say it again i hope this bill will be the last faa extension bill for a long time as my colleagues know the house and senate each passed longterm reauthorization bills earlier this year staffs have made good progress in negotiations to resolve a number of differences between the two bills there are just a few open issues remaining the longterm bills success however will depend on how those open issues are resolved they are important issues many of them i regret to say have been controversial issues from day one house republicans have proposed to renege on our commitment to small communities and to end essential air service everywhere but alaska the senate bill does not house republicans have proposed to repeal a national mediation board rule that guarantees fundamental fairness for airline and railroad workers deciding whether to join a union the senate bill does not the house bill slashes funding for airports and faa programs with the mandate for the agency to somehow do more with less when all available evidence clearly shows the agency will do less with less the senate bill does not these are differences that must be worked out and i believe they can be worked out if both sides come together in good faith put partisanship aside and resolve to keep americas aviation system the worlds best and finest i look forward to working with my colleagues in this chamber and with our senate counterparts to enact a lasting longterm reauthorization that creates jobs improves safety and serves the interests of the flying public for the meantime however this onemonth extension is necessary without its enactment the faas funding programs and expenditure authority would lapse on may 31 h r 1893 will keep the faa operating for another month through june 30 it will give congress one more month to complete work on a longterm reauthorization and i urge my colleagues to support it"], [0.0027698874473571777, 0.5027698874473572, 1, "ms kaptur youve gone too far thank you so very very much for picking up tonight is a very special night for california we lit the holiday tree in front of the capitol it was a tree that came from a community very close to where i was raised in california i was out there with the choir from summerville high school in tuolumne county an area that i represented for some 20 years and then others around the area a beautiful beautiful tree from the stanislaus national forest in california there really is much to celebrate and much to be concerned about in america we are still a very great country were the strongest wealthiest place on this earth we have incredible opportunity and potential i saw it in those kids that were singing in front of the nations capitol this evening yet theres so much pain as was pointed out by you and our colleague from houston earlier americans care about each other they deeply are concerned about whats going on in our communities and they want solutions to the problem thats our task theres 435 of us here and over in the senate another 100 and of course the president its our task to find the solutions the president has put forth a very powerful program called the american jobs act one piece of it has fortunately passed it was passed just a few days after veterans day when i guess we were out at the parades and we made promises to take care of the veterans fortunately a piece of legislation did pass only one part of the american jobs act though theres much more to do my colleagues ms kaptur and the gentlelady from houston were talking about a piece of it the veterans piece provides employers a very powerful incentive to hire a veteran a very very powerful incentive you can reduce your taxes by 2 600 to hire a veteran thats been unemployed a longterm unemployed veteran 5 600 reduction in your taxes and in addition to that the president proposed that if it is a veteran who is disabled as a result of their service a 9 600 reduction in taxes thats right off the tax line so weve got to get the message out to employers hire put people back to work the veterans its one of the elements the president has proposed in his american jobs act and you were so powerfully putting forward just a moment ago the issue of the payroll tax deduction its going to end there will be a tax increase for every american who is earning up to 106 000 a tax increase average of 1 500 across this nation we want to keep that tax reduction in place we democrats do not want a tax increase on the working middle class no but again as was pointed out just a moment ago our republican friends are saying well thats a good idea but where are you going to get the money you cant get the money from those whose annual income is more than 1 million 1 million a year annual income you cant tax them thats not fair to tax those people theyre the job creators baloney theyre not the job creators any more than any other small business in the community who doesnt even come close to having an annual income of 1 million so lets be fair about this theyve had an enormous tax break over the last decade its time for them to come forward and to share in the burden of america and put americans back to work the american jobs act works let me now turn to my colleague from new york well ms kaptur youre running this operation so please"]]}
