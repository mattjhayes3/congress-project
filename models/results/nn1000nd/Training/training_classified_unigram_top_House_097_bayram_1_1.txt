homeland of lithuania are in the finest tradition of defense of individual freedoms predictably the soviet union responded to benedict scotts protests against the gross injustices of soviet policy in lithuania by arresting him scott was sentenced to 7 years in a hard labor camp and 5 years in internal exile on charges of antisoviet agitation and propaganda he was sentenced in december 1980 and is currently serving his sentence in a soviet prison camp benedict scotts only crime was to expect the soviet government to live up to its obligations under the final act of the conference on security and cooperation in europe the helsinki accords his activities in supporting the work of lithuanian national and religious movements by assisting the catholic committee for the defense of believers rights in lithuania and in joining the lithuanian helsinki group can only be regarded as crimes in a system that has no respect for truth and freedom i strongly support house resolution 200 which expresses the sense of the house that the president should inform the soviet government of the opposition of the united states to the unjust imprisonment of benedict scott and that the president should take every appropripte action to secure the release from prison of this american citizen so he will be allowed to emigrate to the country of his choice i would also like to take this opportunity to express my support for house concurrent resolution 205 which expresses the sense of the house of representatives in opposition to human rights violations in the ukraine on august 1 1975 the soviet union joined 34 other countries in signing the final act of the conference on security and cooperation in europe in helsinki commonly known as the helsinki accords to monitor soviet compliance with the helsinki accords a group calling itself the ukrainian public group to promote the implementation of the helsinki accords was born the ukrainian public group has in the 5 years plus that it has existed solidly doctimented a continuous record of soviet violations not only of the helsinki accords but also of the soviet constitution the united nations charter and the universal declaration of human rights the soviet response to efforts of the ukrainian citizens who are lawfully engaged in asking their government for protection of human rights in the ukraine has been flagrant persecution and frequent imprisonment this resolution proclaims november 9 1981 the fifth anniversary of the establishment of the ukrainian public group as a day honoring that group and calls on the soviet union to release the jailed members of the group and the cease its persecution of human rights champions in the ukraine it is critically important that we in the united states continue to express our solidarity with the effort for individual freedom in the ukraine and i am proud to be a part of that effort we also are considering today two resolutions house concurrent resolution 218

in january 1981 when he was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment for writing and circulating materials related to the trial of the chairman of the lithuanian helsinki group among hil and he is also one

appreciate your stopping by my office friday and look forward 1ao seeing you in the followup meeting we discussed in a few weeks as i promised here are more of the details concerning several of the points we discussed to repeat my general concern epa must do better in making its montana line siting process genuinely responsive to the needs of montanans along the proposed routes to the landowners groups the local governments to the state government and to the congressional delegation from our discussion i am confident that you are working to make these improvements as part of this process here in a listing of my understandings concerning our discussion friday 1 in the drummond area i understand you will see whether epa can promise not to go through the flint creek valley this assurance would obviate the need to immediately pin down the substation 3 site without this assurance i am concerned that a southofhighway substation site will prejudice spas decision on line siting west of the substation 2 also in the drummond area i would appreciate your making certain that periodic mailings and meetings with the landowners association occur without further prompting from my office i would like to be provided with copies of epas group correspondence with drummond area citizens and to be notified of meetings epal is holding 8 concerning the missoula area i understand you will make certain that spa immediately responds to several pending information and meeting requests as we discussed friday fending requests of which i am aware are as follows a a december 1980 letter request from margery harper president clark fork basin protective association for information and meeting i would like a meeting between epa and this group scheduled for some time during march b a january 1991 letter request for information from the missoula county commission c a february 2 1981 verbal request made by richard l carter president touchette hills homeowners association of gordon erandenberger in kalispell i understand both mr brandenberger and mr carter have written notes of the specific request 4 also concerning the missoula area i am asking the clark fork basin protective association the touchette hills homeowners association the valley preservation council and houle creek homeowners association to send me their lists of members who wish to be kept informed of spas plans and progress i will provide you with these listings as they arrive as i have provided epa with the listing of drummond area citizens who attended my december 27 meeting i understand that you will make sure that epa communicates with these people as quickly as possible and periodically as necessary to informn them of epa plans timetables and progress 5 finally i have several substantive questions about missoula area siting as follows a can you assure me that no special weight will be given the existing power line route in the missoula areathat it will be considered only as an option with equal weight being given to alternative routes as i mentioned friday spa has given me this assurance with regard to the existing power lines site through the flint creek valley near drummond b what is the specific criteria spa will use in determining areas through which the power lines must be buried a once a route is determined to what extent will people off of the route itself but nevertheless impacted by the lines be compensated for the impact for example will epa pay for fixing television reception problems that result from the lines construction even if the people with these problems do not live directly on the route also is any provision being made for scenic impacts on homeowpers not living directly on the route 6 concerning epa and the montana state government it is my understanding that bpa is seeking formal memoranda of understandings with montana that will involve the state in a initial decisions on whether epa will build future power lines and other major facilities and b the development of rules and regulations for implementing the northwest power actspeciftcally including regulations determining the formula for providing impact aid awards as i noted in our meeting it is my position that the montana major facilities siting act should goveru construction of major facilities within the stateregardless of whether the construction is federal or private while this issue has not been finally resolved still the decisionmaking on whether and who will build facilities needs to involve state government at the earliest possible moment 7 it is my understanding that epa will thoroughly explore the basis of its determination of need for the proposed libby integration project with appropriate montana state government siting officials and provide them with whatever specific information they require on a timely basis the purpose of this is to allow the state and me sufficient information on which to base a recommendation to you on whether this project should proceed as planned accordingly this needs to be accomplished so quickly as possible and before work has substantially proceeded 8 finally it is my understanding that you will address the need for epa to have personnel available to montanans at meetings and otherwise who can address authoritatively montanans requests thank you once again for your assistance with best personal regards i am sincerely max baucus bonnerville power a13mni5txatiozn portland oreg hon max daucuo unitedstates senate washington d c dear senator eaucus i very much regret that i was unable to meet with you in washington d c on march 12 as we had planned and i trust that we will be able to reschedule this meeting at an early date in the meantime i should like to respond to your letter of march 9 1991 concerning various aspects of bonneville power administration epa activities in conjunction with the colstrip transmission project before addressing tho specifio items in your letter let me assure you that we are most cognizant of the concerns of your constituents with respect to the planning of the doublecircuit 500kilovolt transmission lines from the townsend area westward those individuals and communities along the proposed transmission corridor are rightfully concerned about a project which would affect their lives and their environient we at spa are equally concerned about these impacts and about fulfilling our responsibilities and obligations as a power marketing agency of the federal governmnent we believe that bpa has a fundamental duty to carry out its operations in a manner which strives to accommodate the concerns of the citizens whom we serve with respect to the colstrip transmission project we have endeavored to satisfy all of the concerns reservations and inquiries expressed by various individuals and entities within the state of montana we believe that we have done a good job but apparently not good enoughit is obvious that we must expand and intensify our efforts some of those who oppose the rroject in toto or its individual features will perhaps never be satisfied epa must however strive to convince them that their concerns are being treated openly and fairly we must assure that they view us as being accessible responsive and truthful regardless of whether or not we can satisfy their individual concerns as a first step to improving our relations in western montana we intend to open a project office in missoula on or about april 1 1981 hopefully this office will occupy storefront space and we intend to precede its opening with advertisements end news releases to be distributed throughout a sizable area this missoula office will serve as a base for viiing communities along the entire length of the proposed route our tentative plans ame to assign three representatives to this office one will be a professional engineer representing the office of the chief engineer the second will be a public utilities specialist from our k~alispell district we also intend to hire a temporary but fulltime clerical person to occupy the office during normal business hours for dispensing literature and maps accepting inquiries and requests for speakers etc in addition we are arrangin for a member of our information office staff to visit missoula on a regular basis and to provide direct liaison with area news media assist in meeting arrangements and supervise publicity and information efforts beginning in april 1981 we will publish a monthly progress bulletin to be suppleinented by special reports as may be required these regular bulletins will be mailed to a sizable list of organizations and individuals throughout western montana and we shall be actively soliciting names and addresses to expand our current mailing list it will not be feasible to publish specialized bulletins for each segment of the proposed transmission project but we will attempt to summarize all spa activities and analyses relating to the entire corridor from townsend westward we will set up on or about april 1 1981 one or more tollfree 800 telephone numbers which people can contact to ask questions offer comments request meetings and seek information these telephone numbers will be widely publicized the telephones will be answered by assigned personnel in our portland headquarters who in turn wilt be in close

there have been many many warnings over the years about the danger posed by nuclear weapons to civilization and the futility of any war fought with nuclear weapons every president from eisenhower to carter has tried to remind us that there couild be no such thing as victory in a war fought with such weapons twenty years ago president kennedy told our nation and the world thatevery man woman and child lives under a nuclear sword of damocles hanging by the slenderest of threads capable of being cut at any moment by accident or miscalculation or by madness the weapons of war must be abolished before they abolish us yet when we look back over all these years the competition between the united states and the soviet union in the development of nuclear weaponry has proceeded steadily relentlessly without the faintest regard for the future of the human race both the united states and the soviet union have gone about the business of piling weapons upon weapons missiles upon missiles new levels of destructiveness upon old ones today it is es timated that the united states the soviet union and the other nuclear weapons states possess more than 50 000 nuclear warheads the vast resources of this planet are being devoted more and more to the means of destroying instead of enriching human life it was president eisenhower who said every gun that is made every warship launched every rocket fired signifies in the final sense a theft from those who hunger and are not fed those who are cold and are not clothed this world in arms is not spending money alone it is spending the sweat of its laborers the genius of its scientists the hopes of its children this is not a way of life at all in any true sense under a cloud of war it is humanity hanging from a cross of iron the further development of nuclear weaponry hastens the day when civilization moves closer to the eve of destruction the world however was not meant to be a prison in which man awaits his execution we must prevent the nuclear arms race from mushrooming out of control there is a new and strong wind of public opinion in support of a mutual nuclear weapons moratorium now crossing over our land it was felt in the numerous town meetings in new england it is gathering momentum in various state legislatures such as in wisconsin it is spreading out to callfornia where the public will vote on a referendum endorsing a mutual nuclear arms moratorium this wind will sweep back to washington where we in the congress will have the opportunity to put the congress on record as favoring negotiations for a mutual freeze and verifiable nuclear arms reduction as proposed by house joint resolution 434 i recently received several letters from high school students who participated in a discussion group on the nuclear arms race issue at st johns lutheran church in madison wis i would like to share the thoughts of these youngpeople with my colleagues though im only 18 1 feel that i know enough about nuclear war to know that its extremely dangerous to the people of today and future generations still have a whole life ahead of mel the money that goes to nuclear arms is outrageoual we the teenagers who will be the next generation to run the country will not have a good enough education to do so because of the money to go to nuclear arms i dont think its fair that my education is being cut

ask unanimous consent to include in the record of todays proceedings the transcripts of the dellums hearings i think they will provide members and the public with penetrating insight into the full implications of the military budget considering the paucity in attendance at the dellums hearings to date i am certain the soviets look to other sources to discern where america stands on arms control and other defense issues the soviet military establishment has looked to the administration and the pentagon and their reaction has been regrettably predictable marshal nikolai ogarkov soviet chief of staff and supreme ranking soldier warned kremlin leaders in a recent book to respond to the reagan administrations active preparations for a nuclear war by putting the country on a war footing ogarkov recommends the coordination of mobilization and deployment of the armed forces and the entire economy and particularly the use of human resources transport communications and energy to secure the stability and livability of the country the marshal continues the fast pace of the development of nuclear missile weaponry by the adversary and the possibility of their sudden use call for new steps to secure the vital interests of our people t he failure to change views in time stagnation in the development and implementation of new questions of military construction are fraught with serious consequences president brezhnevs announcement of a eur6missiles moratorium on march 16 must be viewed in light of this pressure on the kremlin to respond to american military posture in kind while president reagan and other administration officials have belittled mr brezhnevs unilateral action i perceive in it an element of desperation perhaps even more important american citizens are becoming increasingly desperate and frustrated with governmental inability to limit the production deployment and proliferation of nuclear weapons recent polls reflect the rise in citizen concern a gallup poll of last december revealed that 75 percent of americans would like to see the united states and the unitedstatess r reduce their stock of nuclear weapons by 50 percent the washington post abc news poll released last week indicated that 45 percent of americans believe the chance of nuclear war has increascd during the reagan presidency while 46 percent think reagan has not done as much as he should to limit the buildup of nuclear weapons drawing on the history of the civil rights movement and the vietnam era americans are beginning to recognize that grassroots organization and citizen activism

remains as important as it was during the height of the arab embargoes and price increases the immediate pressure upon us to come up with energy alternatives seems to have waned largely because opec nations began to demand excessive oil price increases following the rapid escalations of the 1970s the saudis put a brake on their expectations by simply increasing its own production 2 million barrels a day this was not done out of any charitable concern for the welfare of the industrial west so much as it was done out of respect for our ability our willingness to make the effort to come up with energy alternatives it was no secret that the saudis understood well that had opec continued on its high profile course of steadily increasing the costs of energy the western countries would sustain the political will to find sources of energy elsewhere the saudis almost singlehandedly created a glut gas lines disappeared unfortunately much of the alternative energy constituency in the united states did also the new administration bouyed by this glut announced that it would henceforth rely on the private sector to produce energy and to deliver it when or economies needed it it deemed the entirety of the previous federal effort at energy independence to have been superfluous intrusions into the energy marketplace it credited decontrol entirely for the decrease in energy imports and consumption it ignored the reasons the saudis helped create the glut which was fundamentally to deprive energy development programs of their political base in fact the administration sees little more that the government could or should do to counteract opecs manipulation of the marketplace the government has in this administrations view no responsibility to prepare for events even events that opec may not be able to control i do not want to debate the merits of the department of energys previous regulatory programs let me say that i tend to be a supporter of decontrol and am a specific supporter of both president carters and president reagans steps to decontrol the price of oil i agree that no energy program can succeed unless one of its components brings about accurate price signals from the marketplace however the very confusion in price signals the hiatus in what we all know will be a steady increase in the price of oil over the coming decades is conclusive proof of the need for an active research and development program into energy alternatives it is during periods like this that the short term signals from the marketplace divert us from what commonsense tells us our long term objectives should be the wall street journal reported august 11 that the regular price of oil is about 31 a barrel 4 below last year and the spot market prices are even lower than that the journal attributes this unexpected softening to a prolonged international recession aggravated by widespread cheating on opecs production levels while the recession lasts when western economies recover the entire situation will be reversed and we will again be hostage to opecs policies at that point the test of the administrations policies will occur and to the extent that it is successful in reducing our governmental efforts at energy independence the failure of the policy will become clear conservation induced by price or by doe and state and local programs has proven to be the shortest term source of energy and it is the most responsive to shortterm price signals as conservation maximizes its potential and as the economy begins to revive the nation will have a need for increased energy supplies the research and development we engage in today will be the source of those new supplies provided we stick to our energy research and development program particularly important in this period of uncertainty will be those new sources of energy that involve small incremental investments by either utilities or individuals one might point to certain utilities as illustrations of this key point the southern california edison co has announced in the last year plans to construct three new incremental sources of power one involving wind energy the other solar thermal energy and the third photovoltaics it also has an interest in geothermal deposits in the california desert and in a solar pond project in the salton sea these options have the advantage of requiring relatively low amounts of initial capital they can be expanded or left at any level of output and still be costproductive similarly another utility the sacramento municipal utility district in my district has with the help of the federal government embarked on a 100megawatt photovoltaic plant to be constructed in stages these utility projects have several things in common they all use technologies which have been developed to one degree or another with governmental assistance they each depend on some form of government backing tax credits in the case of the sce and upfront risk loans in the case of smud they are all consistent with incremental capitalization and supply strategies not coincidentally they are all renewable the renewable energy research and development budget has been slashed enormously in deference to the marketplace philosophy though other energy forms have not had that philosophy applied so rigorously to them they would be cut from 520 million in fiscal 1981 to a proposed 72 million in just 3 years the chairman of the science and technology committee mr fuqua has told the energy and water development appropriations subcommittee on which i sit that approximately 209 million is necessary in fiscal year 1983 to preserve the core of the renewable energy programs though spending in any brand new exploratory area in an atmosphere of great concern is bound to allow waste i would think that a reduction from 520 to 209 million in 3 years should be enough sacrifice to satisfy any budget cutter to go further to go to the 72 million proposed would be itself a massive waste of the investment the taxpayers have made in energy options which by now are emerging with real potential for instance we have spent about 150 million on large scale wind energy in recent years with an additional 20 million we can produce a wind machine called the mod 5 which is believed capable of 3 cent per kilowatt hour electricity in over 1 000 loca ions around the nation electricity does not come much cheaper howev r the administration proposes not making this 20 million final expenditure which would be matched with 36 million in private commitments incidentally we have devoted roughly 550 million to the development of photovoltaics in recent years if we maintain our level of commitment for just several more years will probably have in our possession a technology capable of gigawatts by the year 2000 the administration proposes to back away from the photovoltaic program keeping it at the level of abstruse research so that its transition into the marketplace is doubtful and dependent on its geopolitical whims we can well expect a japanese sucess in this realm of international economic competition in biomass we have an energy option that can directly supplant quads of energy in liquid fuel form in a relatively few years alcohol fuels are making a contribution now if we are wise enough to devote merely 5 million a year for several years on an approach called cellulosics we will likely unlock 10 quads of energy from agricultural wastes the administration is operating on the assumption that if the marketplace does not pick up these technologies the technologies are ipso facto without merit the department of energy has unfortunately little faith in the technologies it has developed doe secretary james edwards told me in a hearing before the energy and water appropriations subcommittee that he thought it was worth having devoted millions of dollars to wind energy up to this point because to find out that something isnt practical is sometimes worth the investment and we have found that wind isnt practical for general use now except in isolated areas if the department merely proceeds 1 more year with a 20 million contribution to largescale wind energy the secretary could disprove his own selffulfilling prohecy i am hopeful that the congress will keep alive and well those energy oph 6506 co tions that we will need should all of a sudden the marketplace collapse be the collapse due to war in the mideast or a resurgence of demand or to any number of possible causes that is the purpose of research and development to prepare for the day when this most imperfect marketplace fails us sustaining our energy research and development program against the simplistic philosophies that would destroy it will

implications for the living standards of all americans but today the members of the house consider a question that is even more fundamental simply put the issue is whether we are going to allow basic

the constitutionally protected rights of due process and equal protection under law will be afforded millions of indigent individuals our former colleague and current director of omb david stockman has stated that poor persons do not have a constitutional right to the servicet of a lawyer his statement indicats a misunderstanding of the constitution and a disregard for the hwnan needs of the less fortunate members of society such an attitude which regrettably is now the official administration position means that the administration is at least in this case turning its back on the poor

the budget cuts there will be needs that will go unmet as a result of these cuts but there will at least be some mechanism for handling the most serious cases legal services burdens should not be unduly harsh because those burdens become the burdens of the people who are served the underprivileged have unique legal needs as beneficiaries of government assistance these individuals have close

"mt chairman it is that time again we seem to so regularly face the most momentous and difficult decision that we have to make during any session of congress and that is the issue of whether or not we are going to compensate ourselves at a higher rate of pay it is never a good time to do it and obviously right now we face a very high rate of unemiployment but as i look back at the way we belhaved in regard to this issue in the recent past i find we havefound mnyother excuses not to deal with it not to take it up front and not to discuss it even with ourselves and our constituents we have always found that perhaps this is not the right time because we had not reduced takes or perhaps because we had reduced subsidies or someones entitlement perhaps we complain that it is an election year we can find numerous excuses as to why wve should not deal with it but i think it is time that we focus to some degree on perhaps what we have done to ourselves in the process of not facing up to the impact that our lack of forthright decisionmaking has had on us as individuals i would like to use these charts to indicate to the members and perhaps to our constituents what has happened to members of congress as compared to other people in our society other occupational groups during the last decade certainly in terms of our purchasing power we have lost far more than any other group in our society white collar workers have over the last decade lost some 9 percent of their purchasing power as of 10 years ago members of congress have lost four times that 36 percent of our purchasing power there are a number of managerial groups in our society banking retailing and the aerospace industry where people have had absolute gains despite the inflation that we have been wracked with over the last decade gains in their purchasing power why is that because if we look at the salary increases that various classes of workers and types of managers have received we find that members of congress have been far behind the cost of living has gone up over the last decade over 125 percent members of congress have had a pay increase of 42 7 percent far below every other class that we can compare with production workers and white collar workers have done far better on the average now we are not asking to be compared we are not asking to receive the same level of compensation as our constituents but i think it is important that we provide for some adjustment we have in the last 5 years failed to take some 27 percent of the 321 2 percent which federal workers have been given it is important to realize that my amendment will reduce the amount that is due for costofliving adjustmentthe 27 percent the bill before us would provide a 77 300 salary my amendment would reduce that to 69 800 what i hope we do today is to take back some of that 27 percent and then begin in the future to take whatever we think we can afford to pay our white collar workers they are an important element in this because there are some 32 000 of them who have been impacted by our frustration by what some would term our vindictiveness by our decision to make the imposition of a pay cap almost an annual affair i think it is important to point out that a number of people who are concerned about how this body operates have taken a look at our behavior and have urged us in recent days to do something about it not just because of the impact is will have on those of us as individuals who have a need for additional compensation but because it is hurting this institution we demean ourselves in the manner in which we handle it in addition because it is importantly hurting the managers of the federal government that we rely on to run the programs that we regularly appropriate funds for we do the people of this country a lot of harm by denying them a fair wage we have had the united autoworkers the business round table the aflcio the national association of manufacturers the national association of realtors common cause and many other commentators and analysts say congress give yourself a modest increase the washington post and the new york times added their support this morning i think it is important to point out that one of the reasons we have not had an increase is because there is an increasing reliance on outside income to provide a replacement for it members of the other body no longer governed by any rule are able to take outside income from honorariums that now we know range well over 50 000 there will be in this year when the maximum allowable honorarium has gone to 2 000 many members of the other body who will probably equalize their pay in outside income i do not think our constituents are aware of why they have an interest in our voting for pay raises that in terms of real dollars after the 50percent tax bracket is applied amount to less than some members can earn in one single honorarium so i think it is time for us to focus a little bit of our attention on trying to provide some information to the people who will judge us by our actions we have only had 10 pay raises in the history of the house of representatives and yet there are those who assume we get one once a year in fact i do not understand where these free haircuts that someone talked about come from i pay at least 8 50 for one in tl~e rayburn building when i do not tip i understand my constituents feel very deeply about the need to keep us equivalent and they ask me regularly why dont you just take the cost of living or what federal workers get i have to tell them we fail to do that year after year because we are afraid of their reaction today we are lagging some 57 5 percent behind the costofliving index based on the increase from 1977 to the present which has been 62v2 percent we had a 5 5percent raise to compensate for that 62 5 percent inflation if we go back to 1969 the cost of living has gone up 171 percent since then and we have lagged 130 percent behind i think on the merits the case is there i hope people appreciate the fact at this time we have used the upfront direct approach there can be no process argument against our behavior in this

problem that i believe needs to be looked into the bill contains a legislative mandate for the general accounting office to conduct audits and issue annual reports and for the office of technology assessment to conduct studies and issue reports to congress i take no issue with the objectives of these audits studies and reports i only wish to point out that the policy of a legislative mandate to a gencies of the legislative branch is more restrictive than it needs to be to accomplish the same purpose both agencies have the authority under their basic statutes to conduct these studies audits and to issue reports they can do so at the specific request of the committees of interest this is the way they normally do business however when we make this a legislative requirement we absolutely foreclose any adjustments due to changing circumstances i believe that is bad policy as the attached letter explains"]]}
