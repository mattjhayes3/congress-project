vast majority of our constituents want us to do something about preventing more gun violence in this country mass shootings have become unacceptably commonplace in the united states of america and we have a responsibility to do more to keep guns out of the wrong hands the shooting in orlando was the largest mass shooting in our countrys history this is a moment of truth and we cannot have another moment of silence without some action we are pleading with the speaker of the house and we are pleading with our republican colleagues to allow us to bring two bipartisan bills to the floor for consideration so that we can debate them and vote on them one is the no fly no buy legislation if you are too dangerous to fly on an airplane because you are on the terrorist watch list according to the fbi then you are too dangerous to buy a gun it shouldnt be controversial the second is to eliminate the loopholes in our background check system which says that you have to go through a background check if you go to a licensed gun dealer but that you can get around that by going to a gun show or by buying a gun online overwhelming numbers of democrats and republicans according to the latest public opinion polls think both of these ideas are smart commonsense approaches the only thing that is standing in the way is the republican leadership in this house please schedule these bills for a vote no we will not be satisfied with the nra bill that you want to bring to the floor this week that basically is nothing but a press release but will not keep guns out of the hands of people who are suspected of being terrorists i hope that we can reach some sort of accomodation with our republican friends we are not going away this issue is too important and it is about time we acted silence and indifference can no longer be tolerated in this chamber if we defeat the previous question i will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up no fly no buy it is bipartisan legislation that will give the attorney general the authority to bar the sale of firearms and explosives to those who are on the fbis terrorist watch list i ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the amendment in the

communities yesterday we honored the courage that millions of americans have demonstrated throughout our history by standing up in defense of their fellow citizens but today this congress will not muster the courage to hold a vote on two proposals that are supported by roughly 90 percent of this country and that can save american lives the american people deserve to be heard they deserve a vote if the unitedstates homeland security community places a person on the fbi terrorist watch list or determines that a person is too dangerous to board an airplane then surely we can agree that person is too dangerous to buy a firearm this week the majority will introduce a bill that pretends to close this gap in our homeland security laws but in reality it would create a system in which it is both legal and likely for suspected terrorists to buy a firearm the republican measure takes no fly no buy and turns it into no fly no problem under their proposal if a known or suspected terrorist attempts to buy a weapon they will be denied that ability for a mere 3 days from the moment they attempt to purchase that firearm the following things must happen all within 72 hours to prevent that purchase the attorney general must file a petition in federal court the court must schedule a hearing the suspect must be provided actual notice and the opportunity to appear at that hearing with a lawyer the court must rule on the petition and if all those things do not occur in 3 days the suspect is legally entitled to buy a weapon not only does the republican bill set an impossible timeline it also requires the justice department to meet an extremely high burden of proof a sale would only be prevented if the court finds probable cause that the suspect has committed or will commit an act of terrorism the republican proposal is specifically designed to ensure the justice department fails and the suspect is allowed to buy a gun it is a fig leaf to cover up the republicans refusal to take any meaningful action on gun violence it is no surprise that this bill is supported by the gun lobby instead of spending our time on toothless ineffective proposals we should vote on the original no fly no buy bill that will keep guns out of the hands of suspected terrorists we are also demanding a vote on a bipartisan proposal to require that commercial gun purchases include a background check background checks for all i have yet to hear one good explanation on why this should not be the law of the land if a dangerous person cannot pass a background check at a licensed gun dealer they should not be able to avoid a background check by going to a gun show or purchasing a firearm over the internet in states that have closed loopholes in their background check laws 48 percent fewer

of waters of the united states under the clean water act the rule provides for consideration of h r 1644 under a structured rule making four amendments in order three from the democrats and one from the republicans h r 3662 under a closed rule and s j res 22 also under a closed rule like many americans i have grave concerns about the administrations nuclear agreement with iran since the agreements adoption in july iran has shown no goodwill or intention of improving its relationship with the west in many ways the iranian regime has increased its aggressive attitude toward the united states and our allies against u n security council resolutions the rogue nation has expanded its ballistic missile program testing two missiles as recently as last fall just on december 26 an iranian military ship fired a rocket near unitedstates and french military vessels in the persian gulf these incidents occurred just months before crippling international sanctions against the country are scheduled to be lifted further iran continues to be a state sponsor of terrorism a direct threat to our closest ally in the region israel continues rampant human rights abuses and continues the wrongful imprisonment of five american citizens president obama and senior administration officials have claimed that the nuclear agreement and lifting of economic sanctions which could return as much as 100 billion in frozen assets to tehran will help iran down a more moderate path however reality appears to show the contrary is occurring just weeks after the deal was signed supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei stated that we wont allow american political economic or cultural influence in iran and just last week the supreme leader told a gathering of prayer leaders that americans have set their eyes covetously on elections but the great and vigilant nation of iran will act contrary to the enemies will whether it be in elections or on other issues and as before will punch them in the mouth while president obama may find something positive in irans actions and statements i believe congress owes it to the american people to view iran with skepticism and concern h r 3662 the iran terror finance transparency act requires the president to certify that those individuals and entities receiving sanctions relief under the iranian nuclear deal are not involved in irans support for terrorism its human rights abuses or its ballistic missile program by passing this legislation congress can help ensure that the unitedstates will continue to sanction and deter terrorism and illegal ballistic missile tests within the state of iran in arguing for the nuclear deals adoption the president committed to congress and to the american people that our sanctions on iran for its support of terrorism its human rights abuses its ballistic missile program will continue to be fully enforced this legislation gives us the opportunity to hold the president to his word and conduct the necessary oversight to ensure that sanctions are enforced additionally this rule will provide for consideration of two other very critical measures that will help protect american businesses and families from the administrations regulatory overreach this rule provides for consideration of h r 1644 legislation that was drafted in response to the office of surface mining reclamation and enforcements ongoing rulemaking process that seeks to govern the interaction between surface mining operations and streams it is commonly referred to as the stream buffer zone rule in december 2008 the outgoing bush administration published its final stream buffer zone rule this rule was the product of over 5 years of deliberation extensive scientific research environmental analyses public comment and a concurrence from the environmental protection agency put simply this rule was developed the right way with transparency unbiased research scientific integrity stakeholder engagement and most importantly public involvement however shortly after the final 2008 rule was released several environmental groups filed a lawsuit against the osm ultimately leading to a settlement agreement between osm and the environmental groups after numerous missed deadlines the environmental organizations renewed the litigation the administration agreed with the complaint as a result the court vacated the 2008 rule and osm subsequently restarted the rulemaking process since that time the entire process has lacked transparency oversight conducted by the house committee on natural resources of which i am a member revealed that the settlement agreements expedited timeframe coupled with an inexperienced contractor and gross mismanagement of the rulemaking process resulted in major issues with the administrations rule now this may sound just a little familiar it is the very same sue and settle practice that the house addressed just last week with the passage of h r 712 the sunshine for regulatory decrees and settlements act the outcome is another example of why sue and settle leads to poor rulemakings and onerous regulations that significantly harm the people businesses and jobs they are supposed to be supporting backroom deals between environmental groups and federal agencies do not lead to sound regulations but instead circumvent the rulemaking process to serve the interest of a select few namely special interests and environmental groups for 6 years osm has been rewriting this rule and the ongoing process has now cost the taxpayers over 10 million though this is only a small fraction of the cost it will have on businesses and hardworking american families the stream protection rule will drastically reduce our access to coal which accounts for nearly half of our countrys electricity leading to higher electricity costs and significant job losses according to a study from the national mining association the number of direct mining jobs that could be lost is between 40 000 and 77 000 and the total job losses is between 112 000 and 280 000 a fact that is underscored by the nations second largest oil company arch coal filing for bankruptcy largely due to the increased cost of federal regulations that happened just this week for these reasons it is imperative that we pass h r 1644 legislation that delays the rules implementation increases scientific transparency for rulemakings affecting mining directs a transparent third party to evaluate the existing stream buffer zone rule and reduces duplicative regulation this rule also makes in order legislation dealing with an issue that i hear about very often in my congressional district it strikes the controversial waters of the united states or wotus rule s j res 22 is a resolution of disapproval of the presidents wotus rule that was passed by the senate in bipartisan fashion and it is now time for the house to consider and pass this important measure this legislation was crafted in response to the wotus rule promulgated by the epa and the army corps of engineers which redefines and vastly expands the scope of water subject to federal jurisdiction under the clean water act by issuing this rule these agencies have given themselves broad new power over water and land across the united states like many of my constituents i am very concerned with this massive federal overreach it goes far beyond the agencies statutory authority and could impose significant costs not only on american farmers and small businesses but on states and local governments the rule is another federal power grab that has more to do with controlling land use decisions than protecting access to clean water s j res 22 utilizes the congressional review act to block this harmful regulation and it is time to send this critical measure to the presidents desk i urge my colleagues to support this commonsense legislation and the rule providing for its consideration the rule we consider here today provides for the consideration of three bills that are critically important for the future of this country we must pass h r 1644 and s j res 22 to protect american families and businesses from the rampant executive overreach that will be the defining achievement of the obama administration furthermore the united states must stand with our allies in the middle east as well as around the world in the face of growing iranian aggression which threatens not only the stability of the region but the strength of unitedstates alliances and standing in the world i stand ready to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure that the obama administrations shortsighted nuclear agreement does not unravel decades of work by the unitedstates and our allies to impose meaningful

a single vote on legislation that would help keep guns out of dangerous hands i think that is shameful the american people deserve more than silence the american people deserve a congress that is willing to stand up and do whatever it takes to keep our communities safe that starts by making sure that terrorists criminal domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill dont have easy access to purchase guns in our country today suspected terrorists can legally buy guns in our country individuals who are on the fbis terrorist watch list can walk into a gun store pass a background check and walk out with a gun or the guns of their choosingand they can do it legally since 2004 more than 2 000 suspected terrorists were able to purchase guns more than 90 percent of all suspected terrorists who tried to purchase guns in the last 11 years walked away with the weapon that they went in to buy now in the wake of the horrific attacks in orlando congress must make it a priority to keep deadly weapons out of the hands of suspected terrorists there is bipartisan legislation that would prohibit those on the terrorist watch list from being able to purchase firearms in our country this bill is common sense if you are too dangerous to fly you are too dangerous to buy a gun it is long past time for the republican leadership to bring that bill up for a vote we also need to pass my bipartisan bill to require background checks for all commercial gun sales background checks are our first line of defense when it comes to stopping dangerous people from getting firearms we know that background checks work every day they stop more than 170 felons some 50 domestic abusers and nearly 20 fugitives from buying a gun unfortunately in 34 states criminals domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill can bypass a background check by purchasing guns online or at a gun show this is a dangerous loophole that needs to be closed yesterday senate republicans blocked consideration of no fly no buy legislation and a measure to strengthen and enhance background checks now the republican house is going on with business as usual without giving the american people a vote to help prevent gun

end because we entered a new month we must remain focused on how we can bridge the divides in our society and how we can bring our nation closer together the divides are striking and we know them all too well the school to prison pipeline education disparities health disparities the injustices in our justice system it is well established in fact that students of color face harsher punishments in schools than their white peers leading to a higher number of youth of color in detention suspension and yes expelled african american students are arrested far more often than their white classmates black and hispanic students represent more than 70 percent of those involved in schoolrelated arrests or referrals to law enforcement currently african americans make up twofifths and hispanics onefifth of confined youth today disparities are found not only in how we punish behavior in schools but also how we fund education this is true in k12 it is also true in higher education and we know that a college degree is a path to a middle class life as african american students graduate with more debt than their white classmates the cuts to pell grants are threatening african american access to a better education without the pell grant program hundreds of thousands of young african americans would not be able to afford college the disparities in access to health coverage are startling the infant mortality rate among african americans is 2 3 times that of nonhispanic whites and african american infants are four times more likely than nonhispanic white infants to die mostly due to complications related to birth weight we must confront these prejudices and these injustices in our nation headon the congressional black caucus is committed to resolving these challenges the

consideration i remember it all too well a couple weeks before that when we were in that hearing room it looked like a sea of red as deltas marched in and lined up one after another wearing our colors crimson and cream deltas lined the outside of the hearing room we did that because prior to entering that room media and some of my colleagues on the other side had tried to make it a bad thing that

longer than any recent attorney generals nomination which in my opinion is shameful she deserves to be voted our next attorney general if senators have a reason to vote against her nomination they should make their case public yes hiding behind procedural tactics does not help our nation as the senate has an opportunity to unite behind a wellqualified nominee for a critical position congress

process but perhaps not unfortunate for the american people because no budget is better than the proposed republican budget that would have been brought to the floor our nations budget reflects priorities but the republican budget only highlights the wrong priorities the budget the house republicans wanted to bring to the floor would be even more devastating to students working families and seniors than their previous proposals the republican budget would end the medicare guarantee for seniors by converting medicare into a voucher payment that would not keep pace with medical inflation shifting billions of dollars in medical costs onto our senior citizens the republican budget would repeal the affordable care act and would jeopardize the health insurance for millions of americans even though the budget assumes all of the revenue collected by the affordable care act to pay for the affordable care act all of those taxes remain in the budget the republican budget includes a total of 6 5 trillion in spending cuts largely unspecified if this level of cuts were ever made it would devastate our investments and jobs education research and would essentially eliminate any new transportation projects on top of these devastating cuts to vital programs that support and uplift hardworking american families the republican budget calls for trillions of dollars in tax cuts that would primarily benefit millionaires and billionaires and then they claim the tax cuts would be revenue neutral suggesting that we are to believe that trillions of dollars in new taxes would be imposed to pay for those tax cuts for the wealthy but despite this the republican budget is not a credible plan are we really going to dismantle medicare are we really going to cut hundreds of billions of dollars out of education and job training and transportation are we really going to raise trillions of dollars in new taxes to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy i dont think so but the house leadership couldnt even secure enough votes for this budget proposal because a faction of their conference wanted even deeper unrealistic spending cuts budgeting is about making tough choices and the only choice the republicans seem to have made with the budget proposal is that we can only balance the budget on the backs of students workers seniors the disabled and vulnerable communities across the nation while cutting taxes for the wealthy the congressional black caucus knows that is not the right choice that is why as we have done for the last 30 years we have diligently prepared our own budget alternative to the republican budget which we would have offered as an amendment to the republican budget if they had brought up their proposal the cbc budget chooses to invest in programs that we know will grow our economy and ensure that every american family is able to prosper our budget proposes a comprehensive jobs program totaling 500 billion over 3 years that will accelerate our economic recovery and ensure that it reaches virtually every community in america while also investing in what will guarantee americas longterm economic competitiveness this jobs plan includes funding for direct jobs creation programs school modernization jobs for teachers and first responders immediate investments in our nations crumbling infrastructure assistance for neighborhoods and families still reeling from the housing crisis job training programs and summer jobs our budget calls for significant and sustained investmentsapproximately 300 billion over the next decadeabove the presidents request for programs that have been instrumental in lifting millions of americans out of poverty some of these proposals include restoration of cuts to the supplemental nutrition assistance program expanding access to affordable housing increasing access to quality and affordable education increasing funding for job training and trade adjustment assistance adjusting the earned income tax credit and child tax credit to inflation as well as decreasing the age where you can benefit for the earned income tax credit down to 21 years of age thanks to the leadership of congressman jim clyburn our budget also ensures that federal resources are targeted more efficiently toward eradicating poverty by targeting federal spending toward persistent areas of poverty through the 102030 formula our budget also includes more than 340 billion above the presidents request for education over the next decade this additional money will help make college more affordable by increasing the pell grant fully funding the presidents free community college program reducing interest rates on student loans and financing other proposals to ensure that no student graduates from college saddled with unmanageable debt the cbc budget also provides muchneeded funding for families of flint michigan to help address the shortterm and longterm cognitive and behavioral development of children exposed to high lead levels however the congressional black caucus appreciates unfortunately that flint is not the only community in america impacted by lead exposure this is why our budget includes funds to help not only flint but also other communities across the nation deal with the effects of lead exposure unlike the republican budget the cbc budget clearly shows how we pay for these additional investments our budget sets a new revenue target of 4 trillion over the next 10 years above the current revenue baseline to demonstrate how this is achievable and realistic our budget suggests several specific alternatives totaling 7 trillion that the house and senate committees can choose from to reach that target we ask for 4 trillion in new additional and specifically outline at least 7 trillion to choose from we do this by specifically talking about closing specific corporate loopholes treating capital gains and dividends as regular income a reasonable fee for financial transactions restoring the estate tax to levels paid over a few years ago specific items where you can choose from and in fact if we just cancel the bushera tax cuts we would have almost 4 trillion in new revenue right there at the end of the day our budget realistically reduces the deficit by approximately 3 2 trillion over the next decade compared to the congressional budget offices march 2016

significant progress in boosting voting for african americans and other historically marginalized groups but we find ourselves today facing our first presidential election in 50 years without the full protection of the voting rights act as mr jeffries referenced in shelby the supreme court decision reversed over 50 years of progress made to expand access to the voting booth and opened a pathway to new voting laws that discriminate against african american voters as a result of shelby new voting restrictions have been put in place in 22 states 18 of them republicanled since 2010 making it harder for millions of americans to exercise their right to vote the way states have been able to reduce the voting power of minority communities and put in place new voting restrictions in an effort to make it harder for millions of americans to vote is appalling our democracy is in crisis our right to vote is under assault why would we want to make it harder for americans to vote i believe we should be making it easier for americans to have access to the ballot box but apparently some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle do not agree we need to put forth a vote on the voting rights act now new laws range from strict photo id requirements to early voting cutbacks to registration restriction among these 16 states with new voting restrictions is my home state of ohio in ohio in 2014 lawmakers cut 6 days of early voting and eliminated the golden week during which voters could register and cast a ballot all in one trip of course ohio is not alone in its efforts to make it harder for americans to vote the freedom to vote is one of americas most constitutionally guaranteed rights and it should be easily accessible to those who want to exercise it that is why i am honored this congress to serve as the deputy vice chair of the newly created congressional voting rights caucus a caucus dedicated to protecting our democracy by ensuring the fundamental right to vote is safeguarded for all americans however after a longstanding tradition of bipartisanship on voting protections house republicans now refuse to bring either bill to the floor for a vote this is unthinkable the voting rights act of 1965 has been reauthorized with bipartisan support five times congress has a duty to ensure elections are free and transparent so that all eligible voters feel comfortable and welcome i would echo president obamas february 13 2013 statement on the voting rights act and let me quote we must all do our part to make sure our godgiven rights are protected that includes one of the most fundamental right of a democracy the right to vote when any american no matter where they live or what their party are denied that right we are betraying our ideals there are 168 days until the presidential election and our democracy still has far too many missing voices particularly among those who are already at a disadvantage due to deeply rooted racial and class barriers in our society we must ensure that voter suppression is not the new normal in order to have a truly vibrant democracy the united states must take steps to ensure inclusive voting by reducing barriers to voting efforts to suppress voting turnout undermine democracy and those efforts are on the wrong side of history as i close the time is now i am calling on all people including our community and national leaders to join me in working to eliminate voter suppression and to restore what so many people fought for marched for died for that is the voting rights act human rights organizations like the naacp and the leadership conference on civil and human rights have been at the forefront of these issues along with my colleagues members of the congressional black caucus
