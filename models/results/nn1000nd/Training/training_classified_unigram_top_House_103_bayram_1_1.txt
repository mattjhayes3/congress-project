health plan as outlined in a new york times book entitled the presidents health security plan and outline the alternatives the house republicans have introduced in a bill entitled affordable health care now which currently has about 120 cosponsors i am fascinated with the gap between the presidents speech and what i am discovering now that i am reading the plan let me start though by saying that there are many changes that need to be made in health care that we ought to put together a bill as the gentleman from illinois told the american medical association yesterday we ought to put together a bipartisan bill that we could pass this fall on the seven major areas that we agree on we agree on administrative reforms on malpractice reform on antitrust reform on antifraud reform on medicaid reform on 100 percent deduction for the selfemployed and an insurance reform i think in those seven areas we could actually pas a good commonsense positive step that would help millions of people and save several billions of dollars and let it go ahead this fall and pass this before we adjourn for this session of congress however as i study the presidents health care plan the clinton plan i am astonied at how bad it is and how fundamdentally wrong it is for america captured in an article this morning entitled health plandevilish details by elizabeth mccaughey she is a fellow at the manhattan institute in new york whqn you being to read the details it is remarkable i was trying to understand how an american president could propose a centralized bureaucratic plan which is this bad and this fundamentally wrong for americans i think i have found it on page 314 of a book called reinventing government by david osborn and ted gabler david osborn is a consultant to vice president gore on reinventing government on page 314 where david osborn and ted gabler are describing health care reform as they would see it they say this kind of system would share some features of the canadian model but its olosest although not identical parallel is in germany actually n the former west germany the german government steers the system i have been saying this for several days that it just felt the more i read about the clinton plan the more it felt like german medicine i had assumed it had been discovered by my good friend senator jay rockefellbr on one of his vacations or the clintons who are very fond of germany however in fact now that i have been doing more research i wonder if it was not originally the suggestion of mr osborn which led them towards the german model there are several things wrong with the german model the first is that west germany is a very small country about the size of oregon and it is a very homogenous country virtually everyone there is german by contrast we are a huge country so complicated enormous diversities 260 million people and we come from all kinds of backgrounds anyone who has been to germany can use one simple everyday common experience to describe the difference between german and american culture styles in germany there is no speed limit on most of the autobahn although in congested areas there is but everyone who knows german civilization knows that if there was a speed limit imposed tomorrow morning virtually all germans would obey it until the next election when they would defeat the current politicians and replace them with an antispeedlimit party by contrast for most americans their response to speed limits is dramatically different i think i can say in all candor without insulting any american who is listening that for most americans a speed limit is a benchmark of opportunity that there is an astonishing pattern virtually anywhere in this country of looking at the sign and thinking now can i go 5 miles an hour over or 10 miles an hour the difference is not just about driving the difference goes to the core of the two cultures bureaucracy makes some sense in a german culture it is no accident that max weber a german was the greatest intellectual analyzer of the bureaucratic model in the american civilization however we are not particularly good at bureaucracies we are good at incentives we are good at competition we are good at individual leadership we are good at creativity we are good at encouraging people in their own selfinterest to move in the right direction there are many things we do very welli and i would argue as i have on other occasions that american civilization is the most successful integrated civilization in history that more human beings from more backgrounds come together out of selfinterest and in an enlightened way as citizens and create greater opportunities for each other than any civilization in the history of the human race but the one thing we do very very badly is large peacetime bureaucracies i was very struck the other night as an illustration i thought it was remarkably symbolic that when the president came to this very house when he stood down here in the well to address the nation in a joint session or rather up at the desk to address the nation with an entire country watching with all the members of the house and the senate here with the diplomats here with the cabinet sitting down front when he looked up at his teleprompter the president of the united states saw not his health care speech but his state of the union message that is right the white house bureaucracy had put the wrong computer tape in the teleprompter or the wrong disk rather the result was that the president was looking at the wrong speech he turned to vice president gore and he said according to newspaper reports they have the wrong speech on the teleprompter vice president gore in the great tradition of bureaucracy said no they dont the president pointed out in touch with reality i am reading it it is the wrong speech now i want to make this very profound and yet funny point if an american bureaucracy s high as the white house cannot get the right speech in a teleprompter for the president of the united states to address the joint session what level of pride and hubris would lead someone to believe that this bureaucracy will get the right cat scan the right mris the right xray to the right doctor in the right operating room when you and i are in there and yet that is the essence of the clinton plan when you start going through this as i will in a minute and you read the scale of bureaucracy the scale of centralized planning the kind of hubris involved in thinking that a handful of people in a room in the white house could design for 260 million people their version of what they in the white house believe the rest of us should choose is astonishing and it uses language i think to disguise rather than to disclose now this is not a new phenomenon i have to thank bill niskanen a very sophisticated economist at the cato institute who discovered this quote which i think illustrates perfectly 234 years after it was written exactly the level of conceit that we are dealing with and the word conceit comes not from me but from adam smiths writing in 1759 in what i think is far and away his more important work the theory of moral sentiments smith of course was the scottish philosopher who wrote the wealth of nations the most important single description of how markets operate but in a book written some 17 years earlier called the theory of moral sentiments he outlined a general structure of how humans behave in the real world and this is what he said and i want you to think about this and apply it directly to the clinton health plan the man of system is apt to be very wise in his own conceit he seems to imagine that he can arrange the different members of a great society with as much ease as the hand arranges the different pieces upon a chess board he does not consider that the pieces upon the chess board have yet another principle of motion besides that which the hand impresses upon them but that in the great chess board of human society every single piece has a principle of motion of its own although different from that which the legislature might choose to mpress upon it if those two principles coincide and act n the same direction the game of human society will go on easily and harmoniously and is very likely to be happy and successful if they are opposite or different the game will go on miserably and the society must be at all times in the highest degree of disorder adam smith 1759 now let us apply it in the real world if the government adopts commonsense practical general rules that make sense to people they will obey them a 70mileanhour speed limit on a superhighway is obeyed by dramatically more people than 20 miles an hour on a superhighway but if the government starts to adopt rules and regulations that go against the very core of how people behave people will start to find ways to cheat i found it fascinating that in elizabeth mccaugheys article today she makes the point a parent lying awake worried about a childs illness and whether the gatekeeper will ok a specialist might think about bribes or even going outside the system the clinton plan anticipates the problem with new criminal penalties for payment of bribes or gratuities to influence the delivery of health services p 9 doctors meanwhile joke about offshore practices hospital ships outside the 3mile limit and other ways for families to escape controls and buy the health care they want now let us look at what we are talking about how does the clinton plan work it does exactly the wronf things it establishes first of all a national health board it sounds innocuous but let me describe for just a few minutes reading from the new york times version which is slightly different in page numbers from the white house version about the national health board this is what they say about the national health board pages 44 and so on the national health board which is responsible for setting national standards and overseeing the establishment and administration of the new health system by states in other words the president is going to appoint people in washington dc bureaucrats appointed by politicians to oversee the health system of every state and here is what they will do t he board establishes requirements for state plans monitors compliance with those requirements provides technical assistance and insures access to health care for all americans note the powerful words establishes requirements monitors compliance insures access they go on to say the board interprets and updates the nationally guaranteed benefit package and issues regulations they go on to say the board issues regulations concerning implementation of the national budget for health care spending and endorses the budget the board establishes baseline budgets for alliances by allocating national spending among alliances to reflect regional variations let me make it clear wht this means if you are lucky and you are clever and your lobbyist and your politicians have the right influence your region gets more money if you are unlucky and you are unclever and your region is politically incorrect your region gets less money allocating national spending among alliances to reflect regional variations you have to be totally ignorant of american history to believe that that board would become anything but a political pork barrel that will give the money to your friends and your allies and punish and starve your opponents the board certifies compliance with the budget now what happens if you fail to meet your responsibilities this is what the secretary could do the secretary of health and human services this is one human being in a nation of 260 million people we are now going to have a federal health dictator this is what the federal health dictator can do the secretary has the authority to order the withholding of federal health appropriations in other words the federal health dictator can call your state governor of your state and say you have failed to comply you get no federal money as of this date on my personal single dictatorial signature if the state persists in its failure here is what the book says the secretary and i prefer to think of it as the health dictator is required to take one of the following actions they then say dissolve an existing health alliance and establish one or more regional alliances in compliance with federal requirements contract with private parties or others to establish and operate regional alliances order regional alliances or health plans to comply take other steps as needed now this a grant of power to a single human being which in all of world war ii was never done other than lincolns suspension of habeas corpus during the civil war i know of no instance ever in the history of the united states that one person was given the level of dictatorship that this plan would give to one human being and again for anyone who knows american history it is hard to imagine in a hard presidential year with a tough reelection with a friend who is giving a lot of money and promises to bring an entire union or an entire corporation or an entire region that suddenly the wrong party who gave to the wrong sides friends that their alliance is suddenly guilty of 22 technical violations as found by federal inspectors sent from washington and suddenly they are suspended and suddenly a brand new alliance is created which just happens to be staffed by and has the money going to the presidents friends is that impossible in the history of america or in fact do we not have a number of occasions where power given too closely does as lord acton warned tend to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely but it goes further forget the fact that they are dissolving your insurance plan they decide from washington with one person making the decision what kind of plan you are allowed to buy forget that they can take over everything that is going on in your state forget that they can out off all federal aid to your state here is what else it says the secretary of the treasury will impose a payroll tax on all employers in the state the payroll tax shall be sufficient to allow the federal government to provide health coverage to all individuals of the state and to reimburse the federal government for the cost of monitoring and operating the states system this is literally the federal government taking over all of the health care of a state and then having the secretary of the treasury establish a unique payroll tax for one state now what if you are a politically incorrect state what if you voted for the wrong person for governor what if that candidate for governor might be about to run for president next time oh you would say but they would never do that that i think is a level of naivete about human nature that i think is astonishing imagine one person the health dictator will be able wipe out your entire health program and another person the new tax dictator will be able to impose a payroll tax on all the employers in the state and that payroll tax shall be sufficient to allow the federal government to provide health coverage to all individuals in the state and to reimburse the federal government for the cost of monitoring and operating the state system now that is a level of detailed intervention that we have never ever in american history seen with power given to one particular agency elizabeth mccaughey catches it correctly when she says the clinton plan will make almost all americans buy basic health coverage through the regional alliance where they live regional alliances are huge government monopolies that will purchase basic health care for everyone in the area the law will require you to buy basic health coverage from the limited choices offered by your alliance it will be 11gal to buy it elsewhere can you imagine in america where your desire to buy better health insurance for your family is illegal your desire to take better care of your family is illegal your desire to do better to have more security to have greater options to improve your lot is illegal elizabeth mccaughey goes on to say alliance officials will negotiate benefit packages and prices with insurers and health maintenance organizations hmos groups of physicians and hospitals that provide total health care through costconscious methods to each consumer for a prepaid premium unless you now receive health care through medicare military or veterans benefits or unless you or your spouse works for a large company the law will require you to buy basic health coverage from the limited choices offered by your alliance it will be 11legal to buy it elsewhere pages 1 16 81 under the plan the federal government will set ceilings on how much each regional alliance can spend on payments to insurers and hmos annually the goal is to limit private health care spending alliances can rejeot any health insurance option that would push spending through the ceiling feeforsarvice insurance which tends to be more costly than hmo coverage will be the first to go in addition an alliance cannot offer any plan that costs 20 more than the average price of all plans it offers plans with added benefits such as pap smears every year instead of every third year and many feeforservice plans will be excluded by the 20 rule a primary goal of the clinton plan is to eliminate a twotier health care system where people who can pay more for medical care will receive more now let me make a point about this i want to see an america where everybody improves their life by getting better by having more by being more prosperous by having more choices the clinton plan levels everyone down to give everyone less it tries to reduce all of us to the lowest possible denominator and it is extraordinarily antismall business not only in its mandates not only in its payroll tax increases not only in its redtape but from the fact that many of the small businesses it will put out of business are the small businesses the phar macies doctors and local health agencies that are not gigantic and not big national firms and will not be able to get to the secretary of health and human services or the health dictator as i prefer to call that function let me go on and read some more from elizabeth mccaughey because i think she has it exactly correct annual ceilings and the 20 rule will make it virtually impossible for some alliances to offer chooseyourowndoctor health insurance americans have been told that they will always have the option to buy feeforservice insurance but the plan says that with a waiver from the national health board alliances can exclude all feeforservice plans effectively forcing millions of citizens to join an hmo now notice this is so typical of what we are discovering with the clinton administration the first speech is terrifc the second speech sounds a little strange but not too bad but they beg you never read the fine print so you are really always going to be able to buy your own insurance unless of course the national health board says you do not now that requires a level of trust in government that i do not think americans want to make anymore that requires you to believe that washington will always keep its word that requires you to believe that seven political appointees on a board appointed by a president sitting in washington dc are not going to use the power that has been given to them let me go on again and quote from elizabeth mccaughey car walinsky of the health care advisory board and governance committee which advises 800 hospitals worldwide explains that the plan will make it as difficult as possible for you to buy more than the standard package the clinton proposal is designed to drive doctors out of private practice the plan has verystrong incentives built in that work against feeforservice not only on the consumer side but also on the provider side explains ms walinsky even dra david himmelsteln and steffie woolhandler leading proponents of a canadianstyle singlepayer system warn that the plan will obliterate private practice now let us take a look at this we are telling yeltsin more perestroika we are telling poland hungary ukraine more free enterprise and what are we telling america the clinton administration wants to wipe out private practice they want to eliminate doctors and nurses working on their own they want to crush everybody into large bureaucratic managed structures of thousands and thousands of people reporting to a national health board of politicians in washington which then reports to a health dictator let me carry this a stage further quoting from elizabeth mccaughey price controls will make private practice unfeasible americans have been told that there are no price controls but the plan empowers alliances to set fees for doctors seeing patients on a feeforservice basis the plan states a provider may not charge or collect from a patient a fee in excess of the fee schedule adopted by an alliance now what is this this is government controlled markets this is the government stepping in to say what you can charge what you can pay i find it fascinating that some of the large corporations that are endorsing this plan what if we set up a national automobile board what if the national automobile board decided it would set the price of cars what if the national automobile board decided how many cars you could make by state and which factories could make which cars and what if the national automobile board said we will only have three kinds of cars just as they are talking about in the clinton plan of three kinds of health insurance you can have a big car a medium car or a small car you choose which of the three sizes you want why the auto industry would go crazy they would say that is goofy the average american would know instinctively that does not make any sense but gradually over the last 30 years we have drifted into so much governmentrun health care so much redtape so much overregulation that we can talk now today about a system where the government will empower an alliance to literally establish what you and your doctor negotiate and can literally set prices imagine if we decided to do that for mcdonalds or wendys and for fast food a government fast food board that would allow prices to be set people would know instinctively that is unamerican maybe it works in germany we know it failed in russia we know that centralized command bureaucracies simply do not work and yet here we are being told that it is going to work in washington under clinton let me go on and quote a little further from elizabeth mccaughey americans have been told that the quality of health care will not decline many experts believe it will in hmos gatekeepers or primary care physicians tightly limit patient use of specialists physiciansubscriber ratios at hmos average 1 to 800 half the ratio of physicians to the nations population under the plan pressure on gatekeepers to curb access to specialists will increase ms walinsky predicts that above a threshold level of reasonable quality alliances will choose hmos based on lowest cost not highest quality in order to meet federal spending limits she goes on to say as i said earlier a parent lying awake worried about a childs illness and whether the gatekeeper will ok a specialist might think about bribes or even going outside the system the clinton plan anticipates the problem with new criminal penalties for payment of bribes or gratuities to influence the delivery of health service doctors meanwhile joke about offshore practices hospital ships outside the three mile limit and other ways for families to escape controls and buy the health care they want now let me just say many of these millionaire politicians who today are going to vote for this plan are going to be the first people to get on their private jet and leave the country to go to a hospital somewhere else if they are told that their child or their parent or their grandchild cannot get the care in the united states instead of having the king of jordan fly to the united states to get health care we are going to start seeing health care systems set up overseas and americans will fly to mexico or to the bahamas or to bermuda or to tokyo or somewhere else then of course they will try to make it illegal to leave elizabeth mccaughey states further the plans biggest surprise this really struck me i did not realize this until elizabeth mccaughey wrote this and i think every member of the black and hispanic caucus had better read carefully what she says about this the plans biggest surprise is who bears the cost of universal health coverage the plan requires states to create health alliance regionssimilar to election districts how those alliance lines are drawn will determine which areas of the state are hit with the highest health care premiums because they are shouldering the costs of health coverage for the inner city poor the system promises to pit black against white poor against rich city against suburb the average treatment cost of a baby born addicted to drugs is 63 000 because of community rating anyone who lives in an urban alliance is going to pay high premiums regardless of his health or behavior part of the premium covers his own care part is a hidden tax to provide universal health coverage within the alliance some alliances will bear especially heavy social burdens others will not everyone will figure out that you get more health care for your dollar or pay lower premiums in an alliance without inner city problems the plan will be an incentive for employers to abandon cities and relocate let me repeat this and i hope every member of the black and hispanic caucuses reads this line and starts to think about what the clinton plan is going to do to destroy jobs in the inner city the plan will be an incentive for employers to abandon cities and relocate let me go a stage further this is the final section by ms mccaughey suppose a state fails to establish its regional alliance on time or to meet all federal requirements the plan empowers the secretary of the treasury to impose a payroll tax on all employers in the state the payroll tax shall be sufficient to allow the federal government to provide health coverage to all individuals and to reimburse the federal government for the cost of monitoring and operating the state system the plan does not set any limit on this tax the clinton plan is coercive it takes personal health choices away from patients and families and it also imposes a system of financing health care based on regional alliances that will make racial tensions fester and produce meanspirited political struggles and lawsuits to shirk the cost of medical care for the urban poor members of congress should read the 239page draft rather than relying on what they hear and then turn their attention to alternative proposals that aim to provide universal coverage while avoiding the devastating consequences of the clinton health plan now 26 months ago in 1991 the gentleman from illinois established the house republican health task force long before bill clinton became president we began working on the question how can we fundamentally overhaul american health and make sure that every american has access that they have choice that they have quality and that we continue to be the finest health care system in the world while lowering the cost we have been meeting for 2 years and 2 months thanks to congressman michels leadership we have had 25 members of the house republican party meeting from every relevant committee plus key members to represent rural america and urban america and to look at special concerns we have produced the affordable health care now bill which is the most widely cosponsored health care bill in the congress having 117 cosponsors ab of yesterday affordable health care now is a bill which is based on american culture and american civilization unlike the clinton plan it does not establish a health dictator it does not establish a tax dictator it does not establish a national board of 7 politically appointed bureaucrats to run all health care for 260 million americans affordable health care now uses the market personal responsibility the traditional values that have made america great creates individual incentive and begins the process of getting government out of the way and getting government to quit making the messes that government has created in health let me run through some of the key provisions it provides group insurance for small business based on a model in cleveland that we know works for over 10 000 small businesses and that allows small businesses to buy health insurance by allowing them to buy in a pool so that they have much lower costs for insurance so they can afford it instead of crushing small business and killing jobs the way the clinton plan does our program lowers the cost of insurance and allows small businesses to afford it second we allow the states to go to managed care for medicaid and for people up to 200 percent of the poverty level thereby mopping up a number of the people who are currently uninsured by allowing the state to put them into a managed care plan based on a medicaid model we do so in a way that lets the governor such as carroll campbell of south carolina tommy thompson of wisconsin who have been making real breakthroughs in health care continue to develop better approaches to do a better job for less money we eliminate preconditions so that no one ever again has to fear that they will not be able to get health insurance because they cannot afford it we ensure portability so if you change jobs you can continue to get insurance we stop the government from raising the cost of health care artificially for hospitals and doctors today it is illegal under antitrust for hospitals or doctors to plan together or work together we eliminate that and we allow hospitals and doctors to cooperate because we know that the consumer today is paying far far more in the cost of health care because of antitrust blocking good planning good cooperation and good common sense so we changed that to allow hospitals and doctors to decide who should buy the mri and who should buy the cat scan who should specialize in hearts and who should specialize in cancer and begin to get some voluntary rationalization of the process by local decisions made by local people looking at local conditions without getting involved in a national health bureaucracy establishing by law and enforcing by putting people in jail we use systems that are already working in community health centers for the inner city and in rural health care to extend further to virtually every poor person in america access to health at a common sense low price effort to make the doors open for everybody who needs the care in the inner city and in rural america we know the system works because it already exists it is not some program as david osborne described it invented brought in from germany it is instead in the affordable health care now plan an american plan based on what works in america we use individual incentive by developing a medical savings account which is sometimes called a medical ira or medisave program that works in a way that fits americans it allows you to have a very high deductible catastrophic plan say 3 000 per family and it gives you at the beginning of the year the 3 000 so that when you go to the doctor or you go to the pharmacist you are using your dollars that are in your wallet to pay for your health care if at the end of the year you have not spent the money you can take it as a christmas bonus and pay income taxes or you can roll it into a savings account have a taxfree interest buildup and later in life use the money paying taxes on it for putting your children through college for buying a house for what you want to or you can roll it taxfree into buying longterm care for people who are growing older and are concerned about the long term it is fascinating by the way that president clinton the other night admitted that more americans than ever are living beyond 80 years of age which will be an indication if one thinks about it that maybe the health system is doing some things right you know if the health system were so bad how come we have so many more people living to be over 80 what we need to do is improve upon the american health system not destroy it with a german bureaucratic model and let me carry you back again to the radical difference in the medical savings accounts which we have in the affordable health care now approach if you save the money if you learn this is my 3 000 and you come to believe you can have it at the end of the year it saves on health costs at three levels first because it is a first dollar cost we know people are more likely to be frugal second since you are paying cash on the spot the doctor does not have to hire a clerk to fill out a form to send to your insurance company who has a clerk to read the form that is two people who you save that are currently just pushing paper in addition since you are paying cash on the spot they do not have to charge you the interest rate of the time value of money while waiting to get the paperwork done and nowadays that can be 90 or 120 days so that on a 50 item you can be paying 3 or 4 just for the interest while they wait for the money to come in and another 12 for the paperwork and then in addition medical savings accounts or medisave or a medical ira whichever you prefer has the third great advantage that not only is it your first dollar therefore you are more frugal not only does it save on redtape and paperwork but it encourages preventative care people come to learn if they take care of themselves they are in a much better position to have the money at the end of the year and so it encourages wellness it encourages exercise it encourages paying attention to your diet it does the right kind of things i think the affordable health care now approach is exactly the right approach and i hope every member of congress will compare and contrast the enormous bureaucracy the centralized control of the clinton plan with what we are trying to do in a very funny way the clinton plan is kind of reverse perestroika instead of moving from centralized bureaucracy in government toward decentralization in the marketplace the clinton plan would move us exactly the opposite direction from where we are trying to get russia to go and it is ironic because i happen to read something i agreed with which is in creating a government that works better and costs less which is vice president al gores report of the national performance review the very beginning starts with a quote from clinton and gore in putting people first by the way when you are listening to this quote think about the clinton plan and ask yourself how could somebody have written what i am about to read to you and written their big bureaucratic centralized health are plan we can no longer pay more for and get less from our government the answer for every problem cannot always be another program or more money it is time to radically change the way the government operates to shift from topdown bureaucracy to entrepreneurial government that empowers citizens and communities to change our country from the bottomup we must reward the people and ideas that work and get rid ofthose that dont now i would ask the president and the vice president how can you say shift from topdown bureaucracy to entrepreneurial government and then propose a health plan that is the exact opposite that creates a health dictator and a tax dictator and is totally topdown where the power is all in washington in a group of appointed people who will be bureaucrats appointed by the president it is just astonishing to me that you could have the contradictions between the gore report which i frankly agree with and the clinton health plan which i think is astonishingly out of touch with american reality you know many many years ago my first name is newt and that is the english version of the norwegian canute and king canute was a famous king whose advisors kept telling him he was wise and bright and successful in everything finally one day he got sick of them telling him all these things and went down to the ocean and he said waves stop and they didnt stop of course and he turned to his advisers and said you see we are all limited by reality well this week in an article entitled the health plans financing gap martin feldstein in the wall street journal on wednesday reminded all of us that president clinton may be in a way president canute feldstein goes through the health plans analytical package and says look based on everything we know about how humans behave the clinton plan will cost a minimum of 70 billion a year more by 1997 than they are telling us and at the same time it will reduce income to the government reduce tax income by about 49 billion a year so the effect of the two would be about 119 billion or a 120 billion a year financing gap in other words the clinton plan will cost according to dr feldstein the former chairman of the presidents council of economic advisers and a professor of economics at harvard will cost about 120 billion more in 1997 or would require an acrosstheboard 18percent increase in personal tax rates except that that of course would further slow down the economy and so you would lose money now he estimates you would have to increase marginal tax rates by 24 percent in 1997 in order to cover the clinton gap in financing this was brilliantly pointed out on the committee on energy and commerce by the gentleman from virginia during a hearing on the clinton health plan when he pointed out that the clinton plan projects when it is fully phased in that it will increase its expenditures above inflation annually by eighttenths of 1 percent let me give you the figures for around the world that means that germany will be growing three times faster based on the 6 years 1985 through 1991 germany will be increasing the cost of this plan by three times as much the united kingdom will be increasing the cost of its plan by five times as much japan will be increasing by six times as much canada will be increasing six times as much italy will be increasing seven times as much and the unitedstates historic pattern for that period is 71 times as much in other words the clinton plan says you are not going to have to spend the money dont worry about it and here are our figures then you look in the real world not the fantasy world of the white house plan but the real world and you suddenly realize that if you took the best effort anywhere in the world in the industrial world from 1985 to 1991 it was three times bigger an increase than the clinton plan suggests and if you start to apply that three times as big an increase to what the clintons are talking about you are beginning to havedramatic changes furthermore as the gentleman from virginia points out the places that come close to the clinton model the gentleman says we are talking about systems that explicitly ration care now let us be very clear with people explicitly rationed care means if you are over 55 and you need kidney dialysis you die explicitly rationed care means if you are above a certain age and need a heart bypass operation you wait in line and the odds are pretty good you die before the line gets to the hospital rationed care means if you have a particular kind of disease you just may never have it taken care of explicitly rationed care means if you need a hip joint replacement at 70 years of age you do not get it because you are too old it is cheaper for the state to let you stay bedridden than it is for the state to put a new hip socket in rationed care means in item after item after item you do not get the care even with all of that those systems have bigger increases in their annual health budget than the clinton plan projects which tells us what the clinton plan simply is not being honest with the american people it is simply not sharing how it will really work now i believe that we can pass two bills i believe we could pass an immediate bill which could help people now by taking the seven items we agree on on a bypartisan basis passing it this fall and helping millions of people and saving billions of dollars i hope that next year we can start with the affordable health care now plan working on a bipartisan basis and design an american plan not a german plan i would hope that we could design a plan that emphasizes the marketplace emphasizes individual choice and uses incentives for people to be able to go out and get the beet care they want we have four goals we want to lower the cost of the system by having more competition and less paperwork by getting the government out of the way and increasing entrepreneurship so new ideas and new technologies and new approaches can lower costs just as walmart lowers costs just as cellular telephones lower costs just as microwaves have come down in cost in the private sector with real competition costs come down only in defense and health care where the government is messing things up do costs go up so first we want to lower costs second we want to design a system which between managed care for medicine some kind of transitional voucher for people much like an earned income tax credit as they begin to rise and between ensuring that everyone has 100 percent deductibility for buying insurance and that everyone has access to group insurance that we have access that there are no preconditions and that no one loses their health insurance third we unlike the clinton plan want to give every american a real choice the kind of choice you have when you go to a mall and there are 200 shops not the kind of choice you have under the clinton plan where you can have any one of three but by the way you cannot afford the most expensive and even the most expensive is very limited fourth we want to ensure quality this has been the highest value health system in the world there is better health care here and you can tell it by a very simple fact if you have a truly serious illness anywhere in the world you want to get to an american hospital if you have a truly difficult problem you want an american specialist we want to continue that tradition we want to ensure that our children and our grandchildren have the best health care in the world with the finest technology with the widest range of choice we want to ensure that they have access to it and that they can afford it i think with all sadness that an obsolete german model of centralized bureaucracy which is even beginning to grind down in germany a country the size of oregon if you look at the original west german plan simply is hopelessly wrong for a continentwide america stretching halfway across the pacific with 260 million people of all kinds and backgrounds integrating themselves voluntarily by their own initiative and their own incentives i hope we can build an american plan and i hope members will look carefully at affordable health care now and i hope people across the country as they study what is happening in health care will look at affordable health care now as an answer not perfect can be improved but a beginning for a truly bipartisan bill that can truly solve the major problems that are left while maintaining all that is good in our current system"], [7.580590732914061e-08, 7.580590732914061e-08, 0, "i will not take anywhere near my full hour because i assume those that have signed up for a special order will probably not avail themselves of that wonderful opportunity and that this will be the last remarks on the house floor and we can let our hardworking staff catch their breath let me use this opportunity again as i like to do at least every othercouple of months to thank all these patriotic men and women who serve us here in the chamber some of them with far more seniority than most of as have who serve us so well with such good nature and dedication to duty it is alwasys my desire at the beginning of one of these special orders to point out something very important about the outreach of this house as though it is one large town hall meeting reaching out to america through the wonderfal communication abilities we have with eevision and cable systems and it is just being enhanced at a supersonic speed with fiber optics but there about a million the gentlewoman from maryland who is still on the floor argues with me gently pointing out that it may be as high as 3 million american ritizens from alaska to rawall to all 48 continental states watching the proceedings of this chamber as we speak here even after the legislative duties are over and we are speaking with these special orders they are aust like the 1minute speeches at the beginning of the day our fellow american citizens particularly taxpayers are watching the proceedings of this house not only when we are discussing bills but also during these special orders if there are a million or 3 million people watching and 59 nillion american households are wired and all of the cable systems across america pool their services and created cspan 1 to bring the proceedings of this chamber all across america and out to hawaii and then a couple of years later the senate amended their rules it was inevitable and cspan 2 was created to broadcast the proceedings of the senate and i will register again a complaint to our current speaker who did not set this into policy and i know he does not like it but panning this chamber with the six cameras paid for by the taxpayers to convey the impression as even bright reporters deliberately lie in print when they put down donan berley gonzalez speaking to an empty chamber the chamber is not empty there is a member on the floor there are dozens of people up in the gallery and millions of people across the country why do we pan this chamber to convey the impression that i am speaking to what the united nations was once described as a cave of winds it is a demeaning thing it was put into place by a man who is now sorry the longest run any speaker has ever had in consecutive years 10 years for tip oneill a great irishamerican he did it in a fit of pique if not anger to get at my colleague the gentleman from georgia nwr gingch who was hammering away on this house floor against4t was probably newts first 2 yearsagainst president jimmy carters economic policies that were weak those policies look solid now compared to the bubba policies that are coming down at an everincreasing rate from down at the white house up here to the hill i would like to say please my colleagues both sides of the aisle i remember a former fine member and friend from the other aide steve solarz and i signed a letter we got the majority whip the minority whip bob michal signed on board i took it to tow foley our great speaker last year and said stop this panning of the chamber it demeans the whole house you want to know i am telling my fellow americans this when there is a tribute to dead member who is a sittang member who died in service in this chamber or we are paying tribute to a senator who died in office or a former member who has died that earned great respect here when we have one of those colleagues tributes and there are maylbe six or seven members only on the floor and at the leadership table the mikes and down at the two lecterns guess what somebody is able to give a sensible order not to insult the memorial tribute to a former or sitting member who has gone to his eternal reward and the darn cameras do not pan then i feel like going downstairs after i am through and asking the communications room downstairs who are only following orders show me the written order that say you do not pan the chamber when we are doing a tribute to a former member so stop i give an order right now as a sitting unitedstates congressman stop panning this chamber let us see if my order which i sincerely give right now is more powerful than no written order a vocal order of the commander a vocal let us see if some amorphous order out there from tom foley that is not in writing supersedes what i am telling the men downstairs right now do you hear me ladies and gentleman stop panning the empty chamber a million people are watching now why did i get up today to continuespeaking about the onslaught on family values by the man who is now in the white house today for people of my christian denomination actually for all christians it is ascension thursday this is the day 40 days after easter that the son of god rose to heaven to return again and judge the living and the dead for my faith it is a toly day of obligation which means go to church or you are not in good standing i went to church today over here at st peters senators are going over to st josephs on the other side it is pretty nice that we have a church two blocks away in church i started thinking about there our country is headed i think a lot about the abortion issue n church because this adminlstration has unleashed an abortion on demand for any reason or no reason paid with unitedstates tax dollars that is going to send the abortion rate in this country skyrocketing again candidate clinton said that he wanted abortion to be safe it is never safe for the baby whose body is crushed and its life stamped out its heartbeat snuffed out its brain waves zeroed out and that heartbeat starts at day 18 the brain waves start at day 40 the youngest of my sally and my five our kathleen is about 8 months pregnant she thinks she is going to deliver early any day now she is as big as two kathleens i am watching that baby it has to be a young fighter pilot in there male or female because it s doing slow rolls in there when you go after that baby and there are lets say 3 percent of the abortions of this country are in the last 3 months what the supreme court coined this word trimester they are in the last 3 months what is 3 percent of a daily 4 500 abortions a yearly 1 600 0007 what 3 percent is of 1 600000 it is more people than we lost in combat in the entire 10 years of vietnam and then some when a socalled doctor and no ob doctors perform abortions in the second third and fourth month the deftnition of an ob doctor being a doctor that occasionally delivers live children that does not try to kill every child the minute he puts that woman on a delivery table and puts her in that birth position an ob gyn doctor may do abortions and that is tragic that they do but nobody in the military who is a military doctor does abortions and have told the white house we arent going to do them even though you are telling us we should i will say there are thousands of or gyn doctors that do perform occasional abortions and if he wants to hang up an ob shingle i will bet you most of them do not kill more than they try to save lives a socalled doctor who only does abortions to this member is the virtual scum of the earth a demon turned loose those doctors who only do abortions when they look at a pregnant woman or a pregnant young girl and see that she is 7 8 months or in her ninth month of pregnancy and go after that child to kill it which is serious surgery either caesarean or mutilation of that child in the womb with this latest technique that we have all learned about the evacuation of the brain tissue while the child is in the birth canal so they do not run what they themselves call the horrible circumstance of having the child they are trying to kill delivered live and then they have to make a decision which is clearly infanticide to strangle it suffocate it or let it starve to death when that happens out of 1 600 000 you can imagine that happens occasionally but any doctor who is going after a woman carrying a child at the end of her term 6 7 8 9 months that is murder when i sat in my home in my daughters home and looked across the room i could see the movement of the child through her dres when you go to kill something like that you are not just killing which takes place when you smash a mosquito you are killing something we kill germs you are killing from the embryonic stage when does it become murder that should be the great debate of our time on this house floor and it is not when you go after a child that could live outside the womb and we are killing tens of thousands of them even if it is only quoteunquote 3 percent when you do that you are committing first degree murder every abortionist who has performed that deathdea ling process beyond the first few months they know they are a first degree murderer just as the left wing of this house members in both parties say to the national rifle association that they are unyielding that they are always using lines about we dont even want to talk about automatic weapons ak 47s being banned because it to the crack in the door it is the camels nose under the tent it is the beginning of the end it is a slippery slope i say to my friends over here who give me this phony let us call it catholics in the senate phony line about i am personally opposed to abortion but when they give me that stuff that i am prochoice but i am personally opposed why is it there is not legislation generated from those prochoicers personally opposed to do something about waiting periods late term abortions parental not just parental notification but parental consent where is that legislation i say to them dont give me your garbage about all these cliches applied to the gun lobby in this country because the proabortionists over here say that is a crack in the dike that is the camels nose under the tent that is the slippery slope there is no ending no i have decided most people in this country who claim they are prochoice they wont give us the democrat governor bob casey pennsylvania rules of some sense about lateterm abortions clean abortion mills hospitals being involved parents being involved with all the provisions that if you have psycho parents abusing parents an incestuous father who has brought about this pregnancy of course you want court protections as a matter of fact the pennsylvania law says only one parent has to be informed and that parent obviously has to be stable and there are court protections all that is coming out of the white house is abortion on demand for all 9 months the ninth month included for any reason and i have picked up three little words just in the last week even after debating here for 15 years simple words or no reason all 9 months for any reason or no reason overwhelmingly 80 percent of americans particularly in the lower economic levels do not want to pay for abortion on demand as backup birth control overwhelmingly we dont want that and the clinton team donna shalala his arrogant appointee to be surgeon general all the friends of hilary and the fobs that are touching social policy are telling us that within a few weeks we are going to be debating the biggest health plan in the health care system overall in the history of civilization for any country and included is going to be abortion on demand for all 9 months for any reason or no reason at all they are going to make every orthodox jewish person who practices faith pay for it with their dollars every ecumenical christian fundamentalist christian charismatic christian loyal practicing catholic and i dont care about the judas iscariot catholics every loyal practicing catholic every hospital that is catholic or lutheran or any other denomination every other institution every businessman or business woman who owns a company in this nation is going to be told you will participate in a health care system where the abortions will be paid for the white house wants every federal worker to have abortion on demand at taxpayer expense i repeat they are trying to force our military navy air force and army doctors the marine corps doctors who are all navy to offer abortion on demand at taxpayer expense we are in for a moral rough ride in this country that is beyond belief do you think this white house has the bully pulpit to tell kids not to smoke marijuana when every kid i know laughs about not inhaling because those that do put that cannibis to their lips do inhale does anybody here really think that the inspiration from the white house now is going to cause sat scores to go up i doubt it just think just answer in your own head what i mentioned here yesterday about the following words have you got a pencil or any of my colleagues listening or anybody else listening do you have a pencil just write down these letters in a column and if you cant remember the words go back to your economics 101 book you know where you first learned about supply and demand and free markets and free economies and tariffs just write down the letters and you wont remember all of them but you will eventually as you discuss economics with your friends iwlll give you a little acronym for the first one tsar because usually only tsars put this kind of a revenue on their people and it is usually a tyranny tsar tsar the a is for and taxes spending and regulations tsar taxes are going up that is a given spending is going up bigtime around here that is a given do not believe all of this stuff about spending cuts spending will be bigger next year than this year and i do not think it is just adjusted for inflation regulations going up ask my colleague and truly my friend and i served with him 8 years al gore ask him if regulations are going up not just in protecting the environment where i am open to any adjustments and help there and regulation to go up but i do not want to destroy jobs wholesale and i do not want to tell loggers that you are stupid ugly and evil and you do not know what you are talking about we are not even listening to you that is what we are doing with the health care if you are a nurse if you are an anesthesiologist if you are a medical aide if you are a helicopter pilot that flies a hospital helicopter ship if you own a hospital if you have invested in a hospital if you are a hospital administrator do not dare ask to get on ms hillarys task force and do not ask to be allowed to play a part in the rodhamclinton force and i leave out doctors deliberately because if you are a doctor male or female of any age or ethnic background do not show your face around here you provide health care you used to take a hippocratic oath that says i will do no harm i will do everything to maintain life but we do not want to hear from anybody that has an m d or any other medical letters after their names get out of here only bureaucrats need apply as i said in a 1minute this morning i found out only in the last few days that the legislative counsel that means the people that write our ideas into possible law with all of the whereases and the wherefores and diplomatic yes diplomatic and legalistic language and they are terrific i have worked with them since 1977 i have put in some bills today on term limits these are good men and women guess what one of their senior bosss counselors has been secunded lent borrowed by hillary clinton for months to work on health care things does that mean if i put a health care bill into the hopper and introduce legislation and it goes downstairs to the cannon building to the legislative counsel one of the senior guys can pick it up and take it over to the clinton team either as an intelligence foray to say here is what the republicans are up to or to borrow an observably good idea and integrate it into their plans that they are slaving over no i wrote a letter to the speaker i want to know how much that person is paid per year who is paying for that does it come out of our legislative appropriations bill for this house and are there any other people on federal payrolls because i understand that of 489 of the people on the 500person task force ll people still a mysterybut 489 of 500 1 repeat for emphasis no doctors or health care people at all that the 489 are bureaucrats from health and human services under hillarys best friend donna shalala or out of the offices here on the democrat side always of the liberal persuasion that is what is coming up with this health care plan and the abortion part of it is the cancer in the middle to use a good medical word that is going to rot this whole thing tom bliley of virginia told me that he said to the presidents face and bob ichel said it was one of only two notes he took that day a few weeks ago going along in a meeting the first meeting with republican members and tom blley congressman of virginia said mr president if you put abortionondemand in that health care package you start off down 140 votes well i think it starts down with 140 of just republican votes i know 50 good democrats liberal labor democrats like my friend dalz kilde and the whip himself mr bonior of michigan i know 50 people over there that in spite of the way the democrat convention conducted itself in the big apple my home of birth shutting down the honorable bob casey governor of pennsylvania besides the fact that the party of my parents early years the great democratic party founded by thomas jefferson has become the party of abortionondemand for any reason or no reason for all 9 months in spite of that 50 people over there i am sure i can count on them to say i do not vote for any health package with that death killing in spite of his executive execution orders five of them as i and 100 000 other prolifers were actually on our feet marching up jenkins hill on constitution and while we were doing that he signed five executive execution orders abortions in the military at your taxpayers expense being one of them that kind of inyourface approach to the killing of american babies in their mothers wombs and then i think back to the statement safe legal and rare that is going to make abortion rare david gergen a columnist for unitedstates news world report or maybe newsweek i think its unitedstates news who was one of president reagans communications directors gergen who is a conservative very bright articulate moderate republican and he says i am prochoice here and that is his sentence and this is going to make abortion rare and it goes out to point out that every poll ever taken in the last two decades since roe versus wade points out that americans have come to a very peculiar understanding on abortion most americans want it legal but a third of americans say it is murder murder remember mosaic law says that thou shalt not kill i always thought that that commandment should be translated to thou shalt not murder you are allowed to kill if you are being attacked or your wife is being raped and murdered and if you dont use lethal force on an assailant you are what we call today a gutless wimp unworthy of the name of father or husband you are allowed to kill an enemy if your country is at war and god hope it is a moral war a defensive war and even when you are on offense it starts from defense if you are allowed to kill in certain circumstances what you are never allowed to do is in your head make an analysis that this is a grievous offense obviously every killing is but then give sufficient reflection and full consent of your free willpower to murder that you can never do and a third of our nation says it is clearcut murder and some of them flop over to create a majority that will tolerate it i do not understand that reasoning never will but that is what it is but an overwhelming majority of americans 70 percent 75 percent 80 percent 85 percent say parents have a role to play if they are good loving parents you know what was sweet beautiful chelsea trying to have a normal life in that goldfish bowl what did she say to one of the people that wanted to give her an aspirin i believe that we have to have permission now to give her an aspirin we have to have permission and it became a national story because she said well call my dad because my mother is very busy and she was not being funny her mother had just taken on the overwhelming burden of the health care task force but the power in that story is you cannot give the presidents daughter a pill by the way i wonder if abortion providers at an abortuary could abort god forbid some president in the past who might have had a daughter of age could abort a firstladys child without the first ladys knowledge that is notification or permission that is what we call consent i mean what kind of a mad dark alley have we driven ourselves into without as much as we discussed this on the floor where is a debate from lectern to lectern rooted in theology rooted in grecian ethics with a little socrates passed on to plato passed on to aristotelian philosophy and where is thomas aquinas discussed and augustine and the great protestant and catholic theologians still alive where is the debate over this issue instead of this bubba approach that i want it rare and here and i will sign five executive execution orders and let us go and i will put it into the health bill and the devil take the hindmost let us see what happens no this is the most peculiar period in american history for me i know a lot of jewish friends get upset when you use the holocaust the holocaust was a horrendous 6 million murdered brutally of the worlds 14 million living jews that most demographers say existed at the beginning of world war f hitlers ausetreichen his final plan to rip them out by the roots and destroy all of european jewry and with his dying breath in his bunker he bragged that that was his greatest accomplishment tell me that satan was not waiting to embrace this madman we are not supposed to prejudge peoples deaths but there are certain things you want to put on the line in las vegas that this was a sure thing where this madman was headed along with stalin and tojo well where is the debate on this floor that does not involve 6 million murdered or 14 million that we are already bumping up against the 30 million death toll just since roewade just in the last 20 years where is it why are we not allowed to say holocaust when we kill 1 6 million now listen and my fellow americans listen to these statisetos america was suffering among pregnant women about 12 5percent abortion when roe versus wade was signed by the supreme court they said that might limit abortions because it would make it safe free and take it out of the back alleya wrong it doubled to 23 percent of all pregnancies terminated brutally within 3 years every heartbeat snuffed out every brain wave zeroed out and then hsnry hydb came along the year i was campaigning for the first time our bicentennial year i win and that same year henry sets the hyde amendment through i come my first year of 1977 hyde law takes effect and kicks in did it diminish the abortions no the evil dice had been rolled we went up 2 percent to 25 but god bless my colleague and his supporters in 1976 before i got here because he created a ceiling we hit 25 and we pretty much stayed at that ghastly death toll for 20 years 25 percent of all pregnancies are terminated voluntarily and violently in our country today that is where you get that 1 6 million if the hyde law that wild bill has targeted that the white house has targeted if the hyde amendment goes down i think we will see and hnry hydz believes this that 25 percent figure double as the 12 5 went up to 23 and then was ceilinged by hyde at 25 percent it is going to double what happened to candidate clintons line about rare safe legal that is all the now standard blue signs the same ones you saw in the lesbian parade lesbian rights now safe and legal now same printing house some now little logo down at the bottom and i do not care what the parade is the unholy alliance of sodomy and abortion works together in this country and even though only 1 percent of the country is homosexual threequarters of that is in private and they use the ugly term in the closet but in private privacy is what i call the way you should say in the closet that means that less than a tenth of a percent is activist in your face groaning and chanting were queer were here get used to it and that group making an unholy alliance because they think that the tissue of aborted killed babies is going to get them a cure for aids if you ever wondered about the nexus the connection of the unholy alliance that handful of people at naral and at now producing both the sodomy and proabortion stickers at the same time these people know that the 1 6 million is not going to go down if it is free it goes up i do not care whether it is a lunch or whether it is arms given to a country if you create free anything and you get more of it and you get instant usage that is what happened after roe versus wade when the 12 went up to 23 that is why we are at 25 now because there are a lot of charity abortions around this country where planned parenthood inflames people without ever diw cussing the facts without ever looking at the photographs there is one word i would like to mention at this point i think i would have thought we woild have won the debate on this one word sonogram do you know that proabortion people do not want any woman whether she is 13 or a miracle pregnancy at 43 they do not want them to see a sonogram because when you see a sonogram and i have seen this with the last two of our grandchildren no 9 in the hangar and no 8 of our nine not available to me or sally with our five but when you look at that sonogram it is phenomenal you see the baby sucking its thumb see it rolling and i mean in the early stages when it cannot live outside the womb on its own you see hands fingers feet toes you see a baby and those sonograms that some coldhearted abortionist use during the abortion so they do not have complications leaving any of the body parts behind as they rip apart this human being those abortionists who use a sonogram turn the screen away to avert it from the mothers eyes because you can see that little infant that preborn american pulling back in pain whether it is ingesting the saline solution which they are trying to get away from to go to brain tissue evacuation when you see that child recoiling in pain the month opening and that is where those of us who are prolife get the term silent scream when you see that believe me i would love to take that film to the oval office or to the family chambers and show it to bill i know i could break him down the hardhearted one who gives the orders there i think is the person who owns him and made his victory responsible by singing like tammy wynette i will stand by my man in spite of any protestations otherwise here we are going to fight i will be back to the well on this subject when the health care bill comes up this is one fight that i want on my gravestone win or lose he fought the good fight for the sanctity of human life in 1993 i want that there whenever god calls me and on ascension thursday i make that vow to stephanopoulos to dee dee myers i was in new hampshire this weekend and they know i am back in their face i gave them 6 months before i came to this well with this kind of passion and fervor hey dee dee hey stephe tell them please i am in your face and i am in your face to stay if you win this one our country is in decline and i do not know of any republican president who can ever reverse when the great democratic party the party that was on the wrong side during abolition of slavery when that party sold its soul out for a few measly votes to enhance this death toll of 1 6 million american children preborn in their mothers womb when this fight starts it is going to be for the very soul and the existence of our country not as a christian nation because we axe multiplural and multicultural but a moral nation a nation adhering to the western civilized standards from greece and rome and through the son of god jesus christ right down to now the very roots of our law from moses up there the great jewish law the refiner of the l1th century maimonides pope innocent to pope gregory to st louis to st edward the confessor all of these great lawgivers up here and even napoleon the despot understood that abortion was the killing of a human life and he did not have modern science and a sonogram or brain waves or heart noises to show this this is the battle of our lifetime but guess what folks i really did not get up to speak about this today every time i just happened to think it was ascension thursday may 20 there are a lot of nice things i would like to have talked about 1927 charles lindbergh took off for paris all by himself the lone eagle made it in 33 hours and 29 minutes what an inspiration in the age of innocence 1927 that is when babe ruth hit 60 home runs i wanted to get up today to talk about one of my colleagues i just saw who i am pulling for to be ambassador to rome do you know what he told me that drove me out here that the white house today under mr clinton chose sides in the struggle in angola mr clinton has sided with the conmunist murderers the mpla of luanda in angola jonas savimbl is no saint the founder and leader of unita when jonas savimbi lost that election and it was rigged by the communists and he was not the best loser in the world but he came into town or he sent his advanced guard in twenty of his senior officers who had survived years of combat in the jungle against cuban troops russian arms russian brigadier generals russian pilots in migs russians commanding tank units and these thug communists in luanda these 20 leaders of unita jonas savimbis people and i have met with them 3 times on this hill he sent his 20 advanced people into luanda to talk about fraud in the election and they were brutally murdered and machinegunned to death in their hotel so jonas savimbi said to hell with the election i am avenging my murdered generals colonels majors and lieutenants they are all really gut sergeants fighting in the jungle the fight was on again they lost more people in the last year than maybe the last 4 years of the war and jonas savimbi has taken 70 percent of the country and there is no soviet evil empire to help the communists dos santos and his gang in luanda there are no cuban troops there because they were negotiated out and went home to economic decay and the maty 20 1993 serial killer fidel castro in his decaying palmcovered prison but what did clinton and company do today they sided with the communists in luanda without any preparation of the diplomatic battlefield with no rationale whatsoever telling jonas savimbi who controls 70 percent of the country get lost the same communists that ordered the murder by firing squad of daniel gearhart on i do not have to reach hard for that date i did not look it up today i was campaigning and at a press conference in my freshman campaign a month after i won the primary because the pope himself and that would have been pope paul vi then begged for mercy to this former portuguese catholic country angola do not kill danny gearhart he was down on his luck a vietnam vet married three kids and he went over on a cia contract after answering an ad out of his sacramento newspaper he was sent there in other words by henry kissinger secretary of state and by george bush our fine cia chief at the time and they captured danny who captured him the communist troops cuban troops over there to help the communists that clinton recognized today weighing in for no reason on the wrong side and they stood danny gearhart up his wife pouring out her heart sending letters three children writing on the letters please dont kill our daddy the pope saying dont do it and they killed him and guess what they turned around and told our diplomathenry was being forced to contract in those days mr kissingerin fact in those days we had a cavein mentality here in the house because saigon had fallen the year before with a nowin politically manipulated war that was lost in the halls of congress we lost our guts and kissinger said we are a secondrate power and his is going to negotiate the best deal for the united states it was reagan and bush that built us back the worlds only nuclear power with unlimited technocracy to dominate and the technology to dominate the military scene in fact thats why bosnia is such a tough call because there are lots of things we could do but whether we should do it or not and get americans killed when it is a european problem that is why this thing should be debated in this chamber the way somalia was currently debated today what happened to danny gearhart kissinger then secretary of state george bush then the director of the cia they asked for his body back do you know what these communist thugs did that clinton has recognized today they demanded 5 000 for his corpse daniel gearharts corpse and then they sent this proud vietnam vet with a bronze star back in a wooden casket i guess it arrived at dover like all men and women killed overseas trying to help other suffering people they counted over 70 bullets in his body what kind of a firing squad is that he was buried out here in a little catholic church ceremony with a requiem mass with his wife and kids crying in the front row that was july of 1976 one of the reasons i wanted to be a congressman do you think for a minute i ever thought that 17 years later that the president of the united states who had been a draft not just a draftdodger he was drafted you do not know that in america time newsweek unitedstates news new york times l a times particularly even the wall street journal which bailed out halfway through the story that broke nbc abc cbs even cnn which was supposed to give us a fourth way to go i do not know about cspan but all of the major 22 network and print outlets in this country did not tell you deliberately he did not just avoid the draft three times he avoided it evaded it though inducted twice and sent other men off in his place but on the third time in the spring april of 1969 william jefferson blythe clinton iii was drafted that is ed at the end the verb past tense with a short notice to be inducted into the unitedstates army as a buck private july 24 1969 he came home and through a republican governors office winthrop rockefeller with connections there through his wealthy dealer uncle through the democratic offices of the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee he suppressed crushed reversed an induction short notice i never heard of that in my life ever not once if it has ever happened it was with severe political clout and some young man from the hot springs ar quota went off to vietnam and only god knows if the particular person died or is home here in a wheelchair or lost a young marriage because of separation we do not know what happened because of that separation but this young man talk about sending air crewmen including women now into combat into a threeway war between muslim orthodox christians and catholic christians to send it into that 700yearold mess and then to recognize communists in angola and then to hire his cousin today 25yearold to run the airline ticket office and then to let a 747 wait for an hour while he gets a 200 haircut from one of these hairdressers with one name in this case the name is christophe and lets face it i am glad it is the hair i think saturday night live with that girl on there going and his hair what is that all about i am glad he got a haircut he ought to come over and get one of our 10 jobs here at the house or over on the senate side since we take all of this nutty criticism that it is not a freeenterprise operation i get a 6 job back in garden grove ca you know it is like hammer blows some silly like the haircut some ugly like recognizing the communist killers in rwanda i am telling you we are in for one heck of a ride as i said the other day up in new hampshire quoting betty davis from one of her classic films americans fasten your seat belts we are in for a bumpy ride i close on this are you ready with your pencil i give you plenty of time to get them i only give you the first three taxes up spending up regulations up deficit up debt both national and personal up interest rates up inflation up capital flight up that means no europeans or asians are going to invest in this country when we are in this economic mess unemployment up productivity down crime up sat scores down investment down you raise taxes and investment goes down that is econ 101 mr leader in the white house how about job creation down that is jack kemps favorite subject that is how he got elected it is the economy stupid down that is his quote by the way you should not call the president that name that is what james carville called him and al gore any time they got off message off focus on the bus rides all of this that is going up and down the last one and i already said crime up cannabis use with inhaling up crack cocaine inner cities up wife abuse up violence up child abuse up all of that begins and ends with killing children in the womb how do you tell a parent well you had three abortions and you let two be born and now you are beating them gee is something wrong with you no all the ups and downs in this society a bumpy ride how much time do i have left"], [2.3485645783694054e-07, 2.3485645783694054e-07,

than having to interrupt your thoughts as the clock is chasing you i want to continue what i have just loosely called the clinton years part 3 and begin tonight with something from yesterdays wall street journal that i found very disturbing it is a description of the fine state of arkansas that matches something i tried to describe in this well in september and in october of the election year 1992 there is a newsletter that has just come into my possession by kevin phillips published by the american political research corporation it is called the american political report the headline is whitewater the politics of a second watergate when you say this to anyone in the dominant media culture who is a gentleman and admits they are liberal a lady of the same honor and they are rare most of them claim that they are perched on some olympian peak of moderate perfection when you mention in the same breath whitewater or watergate or refer to whitewater as white watergate as does the great columnist for the new york times bill safire they go ballistic on you here are some of the subtitles in kevin phillips american political report clinton whitewater and the polls and the polls are moving severely against mr clinton the clinton scandals a 20th century political perspective i will come back to that the hillary rodham factor the clinton scandals in the midterm elections that is a fascinating part 4 june congressional hearings on whitewater it may be a lot sooner than june after what happened in this house today by a vote of 408 to 15 the house of representatives the peoples great chamber has joined that 98 to 0 vote in the unitedstates senate to start hearings as soonas possible six clinton legal vulnerabilities this is a nightmare for the white house obstruction of justice shredding of evidence intimidating or offering payment to witnesses or offering promotions jobs to arkansas troopers which was not mentioned in there this is under that heading number 6 of legal vulnerabilities whitewater illegal financial dealings troopergate there it is good kevin sexual harassment wrongful death conspiracy then category 7 a clinton vulnerability scenario that is truly a nightmare number 8 impeachment possibilities the big i word finally in print albeit in a newsletter number 9 the clinton scandals and the impact on 96 and then under the headline of the national politics it says clinton job approval it gives time yankelovich nbc gallup usa today singlinger these are all about a week to 2 weeks old they are all dropping let us just take a look at the headlines in the news magazines i misplaced unitedstates news world report but mort zuckermans publication is just as tough as this newsletter here is time magazine it is a jungle out there the administration is in retreat embarrassed by new disclosures unable to head off congressional probes remember this went to bed 4 days ago here is the newsweek headline clintons bleak house bill clinton looking to combat his whitewater blues the president made a flurry of spirited public appearances last week including pounding on a podium in the immature stridently saying no nine times more about that in a second hillary rodham clinton the first lady found her own medicine in a trip to denver to sell the white house health tare pla3l still stalling or as one columnist observed a modified hangout watergate term stunned by more bad news the president tries to change the subject tonight on all three networks particularly on cbs they devoted about 10 minutes on the cbs show to all of the various whitewater stories breaking today on abc they described the vote of this house today to hold hearings as the democrats conceded to and then the reporter took a deliberate dramatic pause and said to do the best we could because we do not have specific dates yet or anything really substantial on whenwe are going to have the hearings the los angeles times which remember has 4 of the arkansas 10 troopers that were talking 4 on tape recording here is the l a times of yesterday a story correctly predicting what would happen today in little rock exmunicipal judge accused of fraud tries to implicate clinton david hales trial begins next week in a case related to whitewater of course he plea bargained today interesting that the unitedstates attorney down there in little rock paula casey could have had him plea bargain months ago this all would be much further advanced maybe some of it is resolved to the clintons satisfaction if she had not stonewalled former judge david hales offer to plea bargain and tell all and then after she had stopped him and demanded that he go to trial then she recused herself as having a biased background on the whole whitewater mess here is todays l a times clinton treasury aide given early briefing on failed arkansas thrift political appointee roger altman was told that the madison guaranty s l case would go to the justice department he is also a regulator raising a possible conflict beneath that another story republicans had planned to raise the whitewater issue at hearings on thursday chairman gonzalez who has called for the impeachment of a sitting president 3 times in the 12 reagan and bush years my friend henry gonzalez instead calls for a select panel to probe the controversial matter we do not know if that 408 to 15 vote today is going to grow into a select panel but if it does it will be more of a jungle out there for the white house as a matter of fact when i pick up the papers these days an old beatles tune always rings in my head i saw the news today oh boy now here is the wall street journal yesterday rose law firm will file ethics complaint in arkansas about hubbells expenses that is webster hubbell best golf buddy of bill clinton the rose law firm has decided to file a complaint with the arkansas ethics authorities about undocumented expenses incurred by former associate attorney general webster hubbell how can they blame that on the republicans of course they cannot it is impossible as i said in my special orders last week walk out the hall here a few steps to the statutory hall which was the house chamber for 50 years from 1807 to 1857 and statue number 7 around to your left in between jeffersn davis the senator from mississippi who became the president of the 10 breakaway confederate states and on the other side is robert fulton of steamboat invention fame and there is one of the two statues from arkansas that every state is allowed to put in this incredible building the worlds greatest governmental building ever there is the distinguished face and form of uriah rose the founder of the rose law firm an appointee to the geneva convention at the turn of the century around 1908 by 1908 president teddy roosevelt was the first president of the american bar association and that rose firm was the first firm west of the mississippi when arkansas was just a frontier state it is really tragic what has happened to the 60 partners down there now that they are going to find themselves possibly as some columnists suggest in a state of bankruptcy within months what a tragedy that the four partners coming to washington what is now being called the gang of four hillary rodham webster hubble vince foster dead since july 20 and now william kennedy william kennedy hi no relation to the massachusetts kennedy family here is the wall street journal article from today kennedy clintons ethics gatekeeper hasnt paid taxes on nannys wages before white house associate counsel william kennedy 3i became a clinton gatekeeper on ethical issues he worked for nussbaum who has resigned under a cloud who had on his desk a parody of james carville clintons campaign managers theme sign about staying on message it is the economy stupid and nussbaum had on his desk it is the ethics stupi that sign must have fallen on its face when they were all conducting these midnight raids into vince fosters office it says kennedy became a clinton gatekeeper on ethics yet he had a hidden problem of his own unpaid taxes owed on a nannys wages but he disclosed it to only one person in the clinton camp surprise surprise vincent foster the deputy white house counsel who died july 20th notice very few of the papers say committed suicide they say alleged suicide or who died i may be naive but i am still clinging to the theory of suicide because anything else is so shakespearian i will be on this floor if there is ever a murder or even an indication of the body being moved i will be on this floor calling for the resignation merciful resignation of the clinton team from the white house that is for sure here is the headline of the distinguished washington times gonzalez gives in calls for hearings hale might hold pieces to the whitewater puzzle grand jury likely to hear of clintons depis it is interesting that hale might be the john dean of this breaking scandal the first one who comes forward and tells all to save himself dean went to jail it looks like hale if going to jail for 10 years maybe with good behavior he will get 5 but this thing grows exponentially here is a column i meant to put in the record from last week when i spoke on st patricks day and the following day in defense of arkansas it says it is time to come to thedefense of arkansas recently maligned with an image of a closeknit political circle of mutual back scratching in this department little rock as nothing on washington dc with webb hubble leaving the justice department jamie gorelick is about to arrive ms gorelicks nomination which went before the senate last week was fascinating because of all the people she has defended clark clifford and robert altman not roger no relation i believe i had better check that out on the first american bank where they worked when it was secretly owned by the bank of credit and commerce international or bccl one of the largest banking scandals in this country guess what i found out who writes these fascinating articles in the wall street journal it is robert bartley he was unflappable on meet the press sunday before the guns of david broder and company he has said to folks that since mlichael kingsley and others accused him on nightline excuse me on crossfire and in print in the new republic that he was one of the proximate causes of a suicide namely vince foster that he said what do these people expect me to do dry up and blow away or to defend my honor here is an article that i think is going to be probably the most quoted over the next months from what i have always goodnaturedly called a schizophrenic magazine because most of the reporters are liberal like michael kingsley and yet fred barnes is one of its senior editors and that is the new republic wait until i read what the new republic says about the scandals interlocking in arkansas by l j davis here it is so powerful it is quoted in a long editorial the longest i have seen yet in any paper in the wall street journal obviously written by robert bartley and i will cut to the chase here and read the part that fascinated me because i had said the same thing on the house floor over 1 year and 7 months ago arkansas mr davis l j davis writes in the new republic a liberal moderate magazine there is a close resemblance to a third world country with a ruling oligarchy a small and relatively powerless middle class a disenfranchised leaderless populace the wall street journal says this kind of civic culture we see in many actual third world countries i have witnessed it all through the torments of central and south america over many trips down there when i was on the committee on foreign affairs a decade ago we see this kind as likely to produce a spoilstothevictor abovethelaw approach to government that is to say the kind of careless arrogance we have seen in the handling of whitewater in the white house passes in webb hubbles law firm billings in travelgate in intervention into an ongoing corruption trial in the handling of vince fosters death and in the handling of various individuals including zoe baird kimba wood lannie gunier and chris emory a white house usher dismissed over phone conversations with barbara bush over how to set up her computer home laptop computer with no warning and less than a weeks notice chris emory longtime white house usher turned into the street whitewater is not merely about a land deal the wall street journal continues it is about all of these things and about the place they are bidding the clintons to assume in washington which god knows is guilty of enough sins of its own and above all it is about hypocrisy say that one after another the explanations are innocent hilary was lucky in commodities and unlucky in land speculation wishing they had lost money jim blair and patsy thomason are just friends she was on the hill today more about that later james and susan macdougal and david hale and dan lassiter are just former friends lay aside all suspicions and accept every cover story we are now supposed to believe that bill clinton was elected president to reform the sins of the highflying 1980s yes the key word there is hypocrisy here is something that my friend senator doi nickles sent over he is chairman of the senate republican policy committee as i have been chairman for 2 years over here a few years ago of the republican study committee he sent over documentation that i would like to include in the record at this point about all of the 25 separate allegations of ethical or legal wrongdoing that were turned into hearings and or investigations during the reagan and bush administration despite the presence of at least five separate instances or allegations of wrong during the clinton administration and senator nickles lists them congress has yet to conduct a single hearing or the slightest investigation on three occasions during the reagan administration congressional committees conducted investigations or hearings concurrent with investigations by an independent counsel four of 19 congressional hearings or investigations conducted during the reagan administration were led by the thenrepublican controlled committees of the united states senate which was from 1981 through 1986 under republican control a recent opinion poll revealed that 60 percent of those surveyed believe whitewater requires a fullscale federal investigation here are the areas where republicans in the senate feel there should be or should have been investigations scandal one travelgate i have here an article a good column by mark r levin that says whatever happened to travelgate why did that disappear this is last week he opens up with a memorandum from william j clinton to all the heads of departments and agencies just a few months ago october 4 1993 the freedom of information act has been one of the primary means by which members of the public inform themselves about their government federal departments and agencies should handle requests for information in a customerfriendly manner the use of the act by ordinary citizens is not complicated nor should it be

ought to get over here on this floor and watch because the american people are watching and you are about to witness one of the most outrageous charades ever attempted on the floor of this house here are 432 pages of testimony of conscientious members of this house republicans and democrats who have been slapped in the face by the democrat leadership 40some denied their rights on the floor of this house you are about to see the taxers the spenders the regulators who control this house the democrat leadership attempt to convince you and the american people that the bill that pays for the operation of this congress has been substantially reduced i get so exercised when i see this mr speaker and members that is an outrageous charade this bill does not reduce spending on we the congress it does not reduce spending by 20 percent by 10 percent by 5 percent not even 2 percent this bill authorizes spending on we the congress of 1 800 000 000 almost 2 billion and yes the taxers and the spenders and the regulators who run this place have magnanimously cut this legislative budget by about 1 percent well isnt that big of them what do you think about that mr and mrs america typically president clinton and the democrat leadership are attempting to foist on the american people the largest tax increase in american history forcing each american family to cough up at least 800 per year in new taxes forcing every american family to tighten their belts yet these same democrats continue on their drunken spending spree refusing to cut their own budgets and even worse through this gag rule refusing to let rankandfile republicans and democratsand here they are democrats look at them you have been slapped by your democrat leadershiprefusing to allow republicans or democrats to even offer amendments that would significantly cut our legislative budget why is this a charade it is a charade because the democrat leadership in an 11thhour rules meeting yesterday kidded 40some members democrats and republicans alikehere they arewho came to us pleading to let them offer significant cutting amendments to the bill why is this a charade mr speaker because after listening to all of these members recite what their constituents were saying back home cut spending cut spending cut spending cut spending cut spending the democratcontrolled rules committee turned down on a partyline vote all 46 of the significant cutting amendments offered by republicans and democrats alike amendments that would have cut several hundred million dollars from this bloated legislative expense budget that continues to hire 37 000 employees which i think is lust to make us look good why is this a charade mr speaker because after refusing to allow any of the significant cutting amendments to be offered and debated on this floor the democrat leadership in a cute little ployand you just heard it recited by the manager herein a cute little ploy made in order six small amendments have you people listened to it up there do you know what those six small amendments were for they were good amendments but none of them individually or in total significantly reduce this legislative budget to show you what a charade this gag rule really is and why i am so exercised and why the american people are going to be so exercised if all six of these amendments pass all six that were magnanimously made in order which my good friend the gentleman from texas has said they were really gracious in allowing all these amendments if all six were allowed to pass they would not even cut our legislative budget by a tenth of 1 percent that means that congress this year will continue to spend on itself almost the same amount that it always has while socking it to the taxpayers of this nation to portray this legislative budget as a costcutting bill is a charade the american people have had enough they have had it with a congress that continues to raise their taxes so that they can spend the money on themselves that is exactly what we are doing here they have had it with a congress that continues to pass laws that regulate the american people but exempt the congress exempt themselves they have had it with you they have had it with a democrat leadership that refuses to allow rank and file republicans or democrats to offer amendments that would do what their constituents sent them here to do this year cut spending cut spending cut spending i cannot say it enough cut spending especially cut spending on themselves mr speaker and members i urge defeat of the rule so that democrats like the gentleman from minnesota a good conservative democrat most conscientious member on your side of the aisle and another democrat the gentleman from utah another very good member who has been slapped in the face by the democrat leadership and refused to be able to come on this floor and offer their significant amendments that would cut millions out of this budget and lord knows we can afford to cut millions out of this budget so that our republican leader the gentleman from illinois could offer his amendment which could cut anywhere between 12 and 25 percent you know they deserve the right to be able to come to this floor and do that mr speaker and members of this house that is what the american people want but it is what the democrat leadership does not want members who are you for are you for the democrat leadership or are you for the american people on behalf of the american people vote down this rule and let these members come on this floor and do what they were sent here to do

think the debate will show that efforts at the state and local levels are far more important and better able to address the problem of radon than a federal solution that gets the environmental

my colleagues are paying attention to this special order tonight because it bears on a very important issue involving a cabinet officer of the clinton administration mr ron brown the secretary of commerce there has been over the past week and especially this weekend a lot of news reports about mr browns activities i watched a number of political talk shows this weekend there were a lot of gaps in the discussions about what went on during the events that took place possibly between mr brown mr hao and mr binh ly so what i would like to do during this special order for anyone who cares to pay attention but particularly my colleagues i would like to go through the chronology of events as laid out to me by mr binh ly who was the gentleman who was involved in this series of events this debacle if you want to call it that i spent 2 hours with him in my office last week and we tape recorded his entire testimony i gave that tape to many members of the media as well as a paper chronology of the events that took place in addition to the chronology of events which i am going to go through which take probably 15 or 20 minutes i also have some additional information that came out this weekend regarding mr brown and some things that have taken place bear in mind this is a discussion between mr binh ly and myself and it makes allegations about mr brown secretary of commerce brown that have not yet been verified but surely need investigating july 1992 binh ly a naturalized american from south vietnam met with mr hao through a family introduction mr hao i will explain in a few minutes used to be an official in the south vietnamese government after their meeting mr hao formed a corporation called the vietnam development corp and he asked mr binh lys assistance in raising money and working with him in getting a prospectus if you will involving the united states and vietnam and negotiating an end to their hostility toward one another and normalizing relations with vietnam that was the purpose of the vietnam development corp to start developing things in vietnam that will get the country back on its feet following the presidential election of november 3 a package was sent on november 13 by federal express to ron brown from mr haos home by mr binh ly mr binh ly took tis package this prospectus if you will he sent this to mr ron brown from mr haos home on november 23 about 20 days later mr hao called binh ly for a meeting hao explained that secretary brown had chartered a private jet which he said cost 8 000 and he flew down to florida to meet with mr hao mr hao mr binh ly a gentleman named xay le and a gentleman named tan nguyen then flew to vietnam tan nguyen had been the principal assistant to mr hao when mr hao was the deputy prime minister of the republic of south vietnam xay le is a houston businessman with connections with mr has hao at that time showed mr binh ly ron browns business card and said he had talked with him while in vietnam from november 30 to december 19 1992 the prime minister of vietnam called from hanoi to talk to hao i believe they were at that time in saigon or what is now called ho chi minh city but the prime minister of vietnam called from hanoi to talk to mr hao the delegation also met with the chairman of the peoples committee the communist peoples committee while they were there in ho chi minh city they were there for 2 weeks the group then flew to hanoi at hanoi government expense and stayed in the government guesthouse the delegation had a 3hour meeting with the prime minister of vietnam and his chief of staff mr hao thei asked for and ree d a private mestins with the prime minister of vetsam hae then tola blab ly imediately after the meeting with the prime mintater that the deal was d e the deal we done and brown secretary brown wasim mr lhaa asked binh ly tor diaft a ltter tcp brown for the prime minster to stgn he then wanted a letter of understanding signed by the pimer minister ta brown so brown would know that this was a legitimate offer or was an offer coming straight from the government of fet am binh ly edited the letter and he changedit into englfsh the letter said in part to brown please sit down and axrange the details of the road map between the united staltea and vietnam the following day m hao met with the chairman of the communist party of vietnam dm muo the delegation saw the signed letter from vo kiet the prime minister of vietnam to brwn hae also faxect a letter to mare ashten from saigon now this letter that was fazed to kar ashton was faxed by bink ly and bfnk ly when he tried to x it ha sad mr ashton piced up the phone and he talked to mr ashton briefly and then mr ashton put the phone down and the fazed letter went through the letter said that things were going well they had had a sueceseflil trip and when they got back they were goig to go tar washington to meet with mr brown bitnh ly their took a separate flight because they had differing things they wanted to o n theft way back from vietam and binh ly went through taipei i believe and he came back to the unlited states another way on a different plane mr hao then when they got back to the united states met with binh ly and told him that he had been to washington dc mr hoer said that he had handca red the letter from prime minister kiet to secretary brawn brown was to respond and then hao would return to vietnam handcarrying a letter back to the prime minister brown had promised to lft the vietnm trade embargo and then to establsk mostfavorednation status there were six other items in the letter as well i want all my colleagues to get this seeretary brown it is alleged then semat letter back to the prim minhne of vietnam sayin that we were going to lift he would work to mt the trader embargo and then to estabifth meetftvorednation status ta vietna= and there were six other item in the letter as well has described the deal as s7000ss0 to bftwn frnm tke vietnamese gavernmet pkv a concesesn on oil and gas reserves i want to tell my colleagues that r believe that the ofi and gas reserves in vietnam are the thid largest in the world so when a lot of these eommentators and others say well v o 000 why would brown do that he is a very wealthy man in his own right t we are not talking about sho400 we are probably talkinw about hundreds of millions of dollars and maybe even billions of dollars because if he got royalties on oil and gas reserves from vietnam we are talking about money that you can hardly imagine inm addition to that brown was to receive a percentage ed or equity irs all new busines from eompanies from the united states that went to vietnam to do business through brown entree now later on we will find out that brown was supposed to have agreed to brig about 1w new american businesses to vletnamn there is another lare amount of money maybe another few hundred million dollars that could have been acquired because 150 major corporatime going to vietnam and him getting a percentage was a lot of money the w7f00 was to be placed in an offshore account through close friends possibly in the name of marc ashton or lillian madsen who is the sister of ashton wife ormr hao on december 28 binh ly confronted haa during a facetoface meeting over the ethics of continuing to work with brown when he had been nominated for secretary of commerce d i420 hao told bfnh ly that he should follow his leadership and be patient that he was a youngman and he had a lot to learn and that ha would groon binh ly as a new leader in the new vietnam ha sid he believed that he himself hoe if all this worked out could win future elections and become prime minister of vfetnam himself rao called binh ly on approximately december 30 to help pack a gift for the mayor of saigon hae told him he had gotten the letter from brown that afternoon the next morning rao left for vietnam but binh was not asked to go on the trip the reason binh ly felt he was not asked to go on the trip was because he had raised some objeetfons to dealing with browiu since he was aow about to become secretary of commerce and because of that they thought they might have a little problem with him down the road they might not be able to trust hfm so they did not ask him to go on this trip binh ly consulted with a friend and mentor hers binh ly is concerned about this re sees deep water he told me and because of that he and his wife got in the ear while mr hae went to vietnam an they drove to louisiana i belleve there he met with af howard crawford who is kind of like a father image to binh ly he told him the whole story he told him how he got nvolved and everything w orawferd recommended that btnk ly remove himself from the group but alse to listen to he when he returned to vietnam he suggested that the group could be subtect to criminal charges if brown stayed in the partnership when binh ly returned from louisina or from lafayette louisiana there were several messages on his answering machine from a very worried mr hao on january 21 mr hoe met with binh ly he threw a bank account statement on hao breakfast table saying that ther account had been opened in the banque indosuer in singapore one of baas dartners in bangladesh a mr uye quang le6 is the senior vice president for the banque indosues and an exlovernor of the central bank of vtetnaml be is the senior vice president of banque indosuez in bangladesh h said that her had opened the account mr hoe said thi gentleman bad opened the account in singaporel there was to be i million put into the account with 370 000 for secretary brown and 5300 0o0 for the vietnam development corp hao then told binh binh ly that he would be appointed as head of the energy group i vietnam working with the vietnamese government and possibly the 150 united states companies that brown was to introduce to vietnam rao told binh that binh and his family would have to then move to washington dc because they were going to be opening an office there for the vfetnam development corp on february 3 binh wrote a resignation letter to mr hao in the letter he smid that hao had breached their terms of agreement and whajt he said he meant by that was that there would be no dishonesty or any collusion or anything that would smack of dishonesty in the negotiations for normali ing zelations with vietnam on februar 14 lys brotherinlaw said that rae had demanded through him that binh attend a meeting with him the next day rao and binh met and haoa asked blnh to keep everything quiet to keep his mouth shut and asked how much money he wanted in cash hae said that i binh kept his mouth shut he would pay him right now bin ly said that was not the issue he kept saying that over and over again he said mr hao get pretty upset and said how much da you want how much do you want how muchk do you want the meeting ended and bin ly decided that it was time to contact the media because he was concerned about possibly is safety because mr hao was so upset so he contacted the mami herald and the miami herald interviewed blnh ly for ai hour en february 18 on february 24 after the story ran in the paper the fbi eon tacted blhk l3 he was intervilewed for 2 houra and they asked wi to take a lie detector test or polygraph test on february 25 they gave him a 6hour very comprehensive lie detector test the next day the fbi contacted bihn ly and said that he passed with flying colors i want all my colleagues to remember that binh ly took a 6hour lie detector test going into all this and he passed it with flying colors on march 14 binh ly or binh lys brotherinlaw said that the miami herald had called mr hao on the phone to ask him about the story and to try to get some answers the message was relayed from mr hao to binh ly through his brotherinlaw to stop what he was doing with the press because the government of vietnam would regard binh ly as an enemy it was a threat he said if you keep this up the government of vietnam is going to consider you an enemy and you might be in real jeopardy the fbi suggested after the meeting on february 24 that binh ly try to work again with mr hao binh ly agreed they tried to tap several phone conversations between binh ly and mr hao mr hao by this time since it was in the papers was very concerned and he would not say anything on the telephone so the effort to try to get mr hao to admit anything on the phone was fruitless on april 23 the fbi asked binh ly to return his beeper mr ly was very concerned why do you want me to return the beeper because they had given him a beeper so they could stay in touch with him about the case the fbi said they wanted the beeper back because their section was the victim of budget cuts mr ly could not understand that because the beeper only cost about 10 a month he saidhe looked at the fbi guy and said you are taking my beeper back you want to break off contact with me because you have budget cuts and the fbi guy kind of winked and shook his head and said well it is budget cuts the fbi thanked him for his help and asked binh ly what he would do next binh ly said that he was going to go to the press i would like to say to my colleagues and i am making no allegations except that janet reno was confirmed as the attorney general of the united states i believe in march early march and a little over a month later the fbi decided to take the beeper back and eliminate the investigation that was involving mr ly nothing happened for about 3 or 4 months then there was a news story in one of the magazines and my colleagues will have to forgive me i cannot think of which magazine it was but it went into great detail on this three weeks after the magazine article a grand jury was empaneled in miami and the grand jury investigation is going on as we speak mr binh ly has not yet been called by the grand jury we wonder why he has not been called because his testimony it seems to me is extremely relevant to the possible prosecution if they feel prosecution is necessary of mr brown i want to go into just a few more things that have happened in the past few days but before i do that i want to go into the chronology of things that i think are very relevant remember that on february 25 binh ly took a 6hour polygraph test lie detector test and he passed it with flying colors remember that binh ly said that mr hao met three times with ron brown to seek his help in lifting the trade embargo against vietnam secretary brown denied ever meeting with mr hao denied ever knowing mr hao through a press secretary down at the commerce department he said he didnt know mr hao had never had any meetings with him then the gentleman at the department the commerce department mr dealer said i may have misinterpreted the secretary in what the secretary told me in explaining that he had never met with mr hao because later on the attorney for mr brown said that yes mr brown had met with mr hao not once not twice but three times after his press secretary denied all this the attorney for mr brown then admitted that he did know mr hao and had met with him three times the last time he met with mr hao was at the department of commerce they had dinner and then they went over to the department of commerce to talk mr brown alleges that his meetings were social he denied meeting this gentleman three times then he admits mqeting the man three times now he is saying they were just social meetings binh ly made the statement that he and mr hao traveled to vietnam in december and met with prime minister vo van kiet binh ly drafted a letter from the prime minister to ron brown asking him to prepare a road map for better relations between the united states government and vietnam the vietnam government has denied that it sought help from ron brown or offered him money however on october 1 abc news reported that the fbi has obtained two fax notes from mr hao to a highlevel government official in vietnam describing his meetings with ron brown in novemb r and december as very positive i dont know why he would have said that in these letters after having been to vietnam twice this was before the second time he went back to vietnam but after having been there and saying they wqre very positive meetings mr ly stated on january 21 that mr hao met with binh ly and showed him a bank statement from banque indosuez in singapore he said 700 000 was to be deposited into an account for mr brown or somebody and another 300 000 to set up their office here in washington on october 2 the new york times reported that federal investigators and this is very important for our colleagues federal investigators have uncovered evidence that the vietnamese government was preparing to establish a special bank account in singapore the evidence is in the form of the transfer of undisclosed sums of money between east asian banks to some bank in singapore these allegations are so important and so severe that there needs to be a complete and thorough investigation by the congress of the united states many of my colleagues have said well wait a minute you have a grand jury investigation going on right now down in miami why are you suggesting we do something while that grand jury investigation is going on the grand jury investigation deals with whether or not a cabinet official mr brown did something corrupt for which he should be indicted and brought to justice through a trial but the clinton administration has taken two steps to normalize relations with vietnam once in july and once in september and those steps to normalize relations create a cloud over this administration that needs to be cleared up and the only way we can clear up that is by the congress of the united states conducting an investigation to find out if a cabinet official used his influence to normalize relations with vietnam when we still have not had a full accounting of the 2 200 powmias that are over there we have said continually that we would never normalize relations with vietnam until we had a full accounting of all of those powmias and yet in july and september steps were taken to normalize relations with vietnam by withdrawing our opposition to our allies giving loans to vietnam so that they could get themselves in a position where financially they could request imf and world bank loans then in september the clinton administration approved a program where american businesses can go over there and if world bank loans are forthcoming they can bid for that business and start doing business in vietnam and the communist vietnamese government ron brown said in testimony before our committee last week and i asked him directly he told me that he has never discussed with mr hao or the administration normalizing relations with vietnam during this period and he has never discussed with his top commerce department officials normalizing relations with vietnam and yet we found out that in june when the national security council met to talk about vietnam it was at the principal level which is the highest cabinet level either the cabinet official or their designees are supposed to be in those meetings that normalization of vietnam was discussed very thoroughly and i have been led to believe that in those meetings the commerce department mr browns commerce department took the lead in pushing for normalization of relations now if that is true and if mr brown or one of his chief lieutenants that his discussed this with mr brown was at those meetings and led the fight to normalize relations with vietnam then if that is true mr brown misled the congress last week when he appeared before our committee all of these things must be investigated this is very very important not just for the 2 200 families of the pows and mias but to this government as a whole i say to my colleagues we need either to have a special prosecutor or an independent counsel law passed so that we can have an independent counsel or we need to have a complete investigation by the congress or possibly two of the three that is having a special prosecutor and an investigation i have written letters to the president of the united states asking for a lot of answers we will be writing another letter to him asking for more information a letter of inquiry we will be writing a letter to mr brown asking for indepth information about these transactions and allegations and if we do not receive a response from them within 10 days or 2 weeks then i will be filing a resolution of inquiry with the congress which i believe will be referred to the committee on government operations which should be the committee of jurisdiction and we will urge them to have a complete investigation to bring all of this to light this is extremely important every day new revelations come forth and we as a congress representing the people of this country need to get to the bottom of this if mr brown is innocent then he should be exonerated and be able to go on about his business conducting his office over there at the department of commerce but if he is guilty then he needs to be removed from office and brought to justice and if he used his influence to normalize relations with vietnam at a time when we have had no full accounting of the pows and mias then by golly this administration should stop the n egotiations with vietnam immediately and we have already written a letter to the president asking him to stop these negotiations with vietnam right now until all of this is cleared up but we should cut off relations with vietnam until we get that full accounting on the pows and mias no 1 and no 2 until the entire issue has been eliminated by the administration and by this congress this is very serious and my colleagues on the other side many of them have said to me oh dan this is a witch hunt i want to tell them that we had other witch hunts in the past we had watergate we had irangate we had what else we had two or three other things and i never heard any of them objecting to that these are very serious allegations and the man who made the charges mr binh ly passed a 6hour lie detector test and the fbi was so convinced that they gave him a beeper and they conducted a very thorough investigation and even tapped mr haos phone we need to get to the bottom of things we can trace a lot of these things if we have the ability to if we get a subpoena from the congress of the united states we can find out for instance if mr brown chartered that plane for 8 000 to fly down to florida which he said or initially his spokesman said he did not do we can find out through federal express if that package of information was sent up to mr brown from mr haos home early on and we can get a lot of other things like telephone records we can find out if mr brown received phone calls for mr hao at the commerce department or before and we can find out through phone records over at the commerce department if mr brown was contacting mr hao there are a ton of things we can find out if we get the authority through subpoena and through investigation in this congress i submit to my colleagues we need to get to the bottom of thisq"], [1.5673206235078396e-06, 1.5673206235078396e-06, 0, "i thank the gentleman from indiana enjoy those eight facts at your town hall meetings over the weekend i just voted against the crime bill as did the gentleman because it left so much on the cutting room floor up in the committee on rules on the third floor on the east side of this building the very best of our republican amendments were not allowed to be debated this cheapens our democratic system i dont want to leave the impression there was nothing good in the bill there were some good things one of them i myself had brought to this house floor almost 6 years ago rfow the police corps which is exactly patterned after the reserve office training corps that we have had in our high schools and colleges for over half a century and from which we sent so many young males off into combat as rotc graduates second lieutenants ensigns and marine platoon leaders today we are sending young men and women off into our military services augmenting our great service academies like west point annapolis and the air force academy in colorado springs the police corps will do the same for police departments i am glad the police corps did get in here are some other good things that got in and do not get excited over these across america and because we do not know if they are going to survive the conference the conference will start in a few weeks between the house and the senate the senate bill was slightly better than ours although a lot of liberal cant went into crippling parts of that bill it had about 58 billion worth of hugathug feelgood social programs that should all be over in the health and human services budget not hidden in a crime bill the liberals have made a habit of putting social spending programs in the defense bill and i am sick that they have now done it with crime here are some good things we did fight to get in these were all from yesterday and a fewgood things today prevent prisoners from receiving pell grants for college education some of them have not even passed their ged high school equivalency test two require the justice department to pay for the imprisonment of illegal immigrants who commit felonies how we can dump this on arizona california new mexico texas and florida it is criminal what the federal government does to the border states when it mandates everything from school benefits health benefits and now the federal governments failure in keeping our borders secure we should pick up that tab and feel the heat here at the federal level another good provision authorize the hiring of 6 000 more border patrol agents of course getting the money for that is not going to be easy will it survive the senatehouse conference i hope so here is one i think a lot of prison guards are really going to appreciate remove the weight training and similar expensive workout machines some prisons have nautilus equipment state of the artand prevent prisoners from engaging in activities to increase their fighting abilities guys actually get their black belt at our expense in prison so that when the rebellion comes in the prison they are taking out guards using the martial arts that they learned at our expense with stateoftheart equipment if they want to exercise let them jog out in the prison yard here is another good provision give law enforcement officials and the courts access to the criminal histories in stalking cases and domestic violence cases if you have got some drunk beating up his wife all the time and he has got a record as long as your arm for violence in the streets fights in bars assault with deadly weapons the courts should know that so that the wife andchildren can be protected and the same with some sick stalker many of these stalkers are deadly enough that they kill the victims that they are stalking here is another good provision some killings have taken place across this countryi know one that happened 25 years agoby people who would get personal information from the state by asking about a license number it used to be in california that for a quarter you could get the home address of anybody if you know their license numbers this bill prohibits all the state motor vehicle departments from disclosing personal information about individuals there were certain exceptions in there that were reasonable we also limited federal judges ability to stick their nose into state prison systems and declare certain jails unconstitutionally overcrowded this has wrecked havoc in texas particularly where the average sentence for murder something like 8 1 years and people have been getting out in three point something years because of this overcrowding problem the biggest mistake made yesterday was passing the race bias test for death penalty nearly 4 000 death row convicts could use this provision passed yesterday to beat the death penalty again if it survives the senate conference hundreds could escape execution the states started reinstituting capital punishment in 1976 less than 205 criminals and i think it is about 204 or 205 have been executed in only 22 states the federal government has yet to execute anybody although we do have six people on death row i am not a fan of capital punishment all of the catholic bishops and all of the episcopalian bishops the majority of rabbis and a lot of other religious leaders in this country do not want capital punishtent amnesty international speaks out regularly against capital punishment most european nations no longer have it most democracies and civilized nations no longer have it let me tell you something when you are approaching an absolute state of anarchy a state has a right to impose martial law as abraham lincoln did during the civil war rebellion in some areas of our country have reached a point that if the state does not say you will pay for these heinous crimes with your life we depress the whole range of punishments so severely down to the very bottom that grand theft auto is a literal slap on the wrist no caning just try not to steal so many cars it does affect the whole criminal system the tory wit john sparrow used to tell the story of the two castaways who wash up on the beach of an unknown country the first thing they see is a corpse dangling at the end of a rope one sailor says to the other well at least its a civilized country the point is only a civilized country restrains crime by the formal process of legal execution in an uncivilized country citizens rely upon private force to defend themselves against lawlessness and casual murders fostered by the absence of effective lawful punishment i myself if i could be convinced that we were building a series of prisons that truly were places where you would incarcerate only the most cruel the most violent the most vicious and they would know when that door slammed that they were going to die there as an old man and that they would not have conjugal visits color pornography color tv mtv every major sporting event coming into their cells nautilus weight equipment three simple meals a day no utensils plastic spoon and that is it i would be willing to say ok if we will film what this is like play it over our televisions regularly publicservice spots let the youth of america that opt so easily for crime because now they know that crime does pay r would be willing to say life is so sacred and ordained only by god that nobody should take a human life unfortunately we arent near that point we have lost just in the last 10 years the societal attitude that a murder was the most horrendous abrogation of gods authority whether of a tiny innocent little fetus baby in the womb or which the chief of police described to me here in the district of columbia of an 84yearold man walking down thd street who was killed by three teenagers who were not on drugs and who then went home and took a nap the late isaac fulwood told me they had no conscience we have raised a generation of kids devoid of conscience i watched five kids none of them africanamericans by the way at a california prison they were discussing killing and two or three of them said they did it to see what it was like to watch the life force slowly go out of a human being we do not have an awe for murder any longer i know that some people who are against capital punishment like amnesty international think that it also cheapens life i always make the case we are not dealing with ireland norway or switzerland here small and sparsely populated we are dealing with an anarchistic situation in many cities around this country and i cannot tell the voters in my district i cannot look a mother in the eyes whose child was kidnaped tortured and murdered in the most awful of circumstances i cannot tell that mother that she is no longer going to be given the right to sleep well at night one of the most stunning crime facts i ever came across was in people magazine of all places it was after ted bundy was executed an official with the state of florida called up a mother whose only daughter had been viciously murdered by bundy by the way in his last interview with my friend dr jim dobson bundy said that pornography just simple ordinary runofthemill womandemeaning pornography of the 1960s is what started him on his path toward the ultimate brutality of torture murder torture rape anyway this mother she picked up the phone and the florida official said two words its over she knew that bundy had been killed she said to the people magazine reporter that it was the first night in 14 years that she had slept for 8 hours how do we deny that that is not vengeance that is giving peace of mind to a victim in this case a surviving parent who lost their only child that is giving justice to the victims of crime it is an answer i have never had anybody from amnesty international or a well meaning liberal answer effectively to me about capital punishment we succeeded in gutting it here today and yesterday now just to go back to a couple of these eight little known facts about crime that mr burton read this one here about outlawing the use of religion in crime prevention you know we could have left this one out of the bill and if somebody was abusing the separation of church and state in this country with federal money and not keeping the church services separate from the other activities then that could have been handled in that area by some court challenge but to tell a nation of young people that they will hear nothing abut moses his full face looking down on this chamber the great lawgiver of the hebrews that they can learn nothing about mosaic law thou shalt not kill thou shalt not lie thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not steal that they cannot hear anything about christianity the combined old testament the judaism that created this civilization we call western civilization that we cannot teach people anything about right wrong absolute guilt conscience honoring your mother or your father to try and strip all o that out of every program that goes out to young people just to tell them to go play basketball at midnight how demeaning how absolutely ludicrous and again a sign of cultural meltdown in our society what i said in a 1minute speech earlier on the day we began debating the crime bill this week most historians consider a generation 30 years a generation ago was in the spring in 1964 as the barry goldwater campaign was ginning up nelson rockefeller was making the rounds in my party it was then that the filthy speech movement even got it down to an acronym the fsm the filthy speech movement at the mother of universities in the western united states cal berkeley that filthy speech movement started participants screamed every vile anglosaxon word at the top of their voice and over bullhorns on the cam pus that was the beginning of the roaring 1960s actually the 1960s were half over i think if you look at an 11year period from the spring of 1964 to april 30 of 1975 when vietnam collapsed saigon fell to the communist invaders the 11year period was one of drug glorification the glorifying homosexuality as equal to normal family life it was the beginning of saying if it feels good do it we were told to make love free love easy love love with strangers love in orgies switchhitting wifeswapping what they got was an aids epidemic that has killed 140 000 within 2 years death from aids will be five times the death toll in combat in vietnam yes a lot of it was energized by the liberals nowin novictoryallowed war in vietnam when that 11 years was up we had a generation the babyboomer generation that was spoiled with too many of this worlds goods and too much misdirected love because their families came through the hell of the depression and then world war ii that babyboomer generation that is now in its prime pulling all the levers of power in some places including parts of this congress and soon the supreme court certainly over at the white house with its overabundance of flower children do you want to hear a statistic that is absolutely incredible now listen to this a boy born in 1974 at the end of what we call the sixties that is 1964 through 1975 a baby born in 1974 a boyand this has nothing to do with ethnic heritage stands a greater chance of being murdered than a soldier in world war ii stood of being killed in combat i mean in my mind i cannot accept that statistic i was a young boy during world war ii it is incredible to think that any boy born more than 20 years ago now has a greater chance of being killed in this beautiful country of ours than he would have been if he were one of the 14 million men and women in uniform in world war ii stood of dying in combat i do not want to bore you and the 1 5 million folks watching with the minutiae of the statistics although that cruel word minutiae should not be applied to the statistics such as these 2 000 women raped every week 1 murder every 5 minutes 1 rape every 10 to 15 minutes i burglary every 45 seconds 1 robbery every 45 minutes these are incredible we hear them so much we are just numbed to all of these statistics at recent homicide rates about 1 of every 133 americans will become a murder victim for males of africanamerican descent the proportion is estimated to be at current rates 1 in every 30 if you put these murders on a health chart as they do at the centers for disease control down in atlanta or up the road here at bethesda md at the national institutes of health this is one of americas greatest killers in some areas it is the no 1 killer of young africanamerican males now on the south side of chicagoi think that used to be a song titleon the south side of chicago 23 percent of students reported seeing a murder in their neighborhood1 out of 4 kids that is 34 percent witnessed a stabbing that is almost 3 out of 9 39 percent had seen a shooting or 4 out of every 10 watching this gang warfare gunfire taking place on our streets i want to ask at this point to put in a few articles that i find are just outstanding a lot of them i must say from the wall street journal here is amttai etzion how our towns fight crime it shows that many times folks have to battle the criminals and the aclu as well i would like to put in an article by what i always refer to as my favorite democrat in the whole world ben wattenberg again this is from the wall street journal from back in dedember he says the crime bill passed by the senate which was passed in november would make the states do what they should be doing anyway and what the public overwhelmingly favors imprisoning violent offenders longer much longer ben wattenbergs column here the crime solutionlockem up is full with more of these gee whiz it cant be this bad frightening statistics i will put that in now here is a letter from my pal grover norquist president of the americans for tax reform i will read the opening two paragraphs and the close he wrote this to our good friend jack brooks chairman of the committee on the judiciary who quarterbacked the crime bill over the last 2 weeks dear mr brooks we want to alert you to our opposition to the house crime bill h r 4092 as written the group represents taxpayers and we cannot support a bill that asks so much from taxpayers but gives back so little now madam speaker and my fellow americans listen to this simple piece of logic grover norquist says we object americans for tax action taking money from working people working americans people who play by the rules and pull the wagon of business industry work at the state and give that money to criminals specifically your crime bill would spend almost 16 billion it is up to 17 billion now of federal money more than half of social welfare programs that lack any record of proven success that wrongheaded approach is particularly evident in the billions you propose to spend on substance abuse programs many substance abuse programsnarco programs drug programs are nothing more than a place for addicts to remain comfortable for a few weeks until they decide when to go back on drugs since 1988 congress has poured billions into those programs and hardcore drug use has actually increased these increases occurred after a decadelong decrease 1978 to 1988half of carters years and all of reagans years which happened without the benefit of congressional programs we should be analyzing what we did there the rest of the socalled prevention programs are equally objectionable midnight basketball is the most obvious example what is disturbing is an attitude that pervades the entire crime debate that attitude unless we bribe people to behave properly particularly young people they will become criminals it reminds me of the early debates over welfare when supporters said welfare would prevent crime when we all know that that idea actually backfired i am afraid this one will too also the bill continues a dangerous trend of giving congress more responsibility for public safety issues instead of leaving those issues at the state and local level where they belong the 8 billion that will go for police prisons and various law enforcement programs once the federal government takes responsibility for funding these traditional state and local activities congress will inevitably rafse taxes to handle these new federal mandates if the limited impact of the past dozen or so crime bills is any indication the crime problem will remain serious even with more congressional intervention i have been telling press people that i have talked to lets make a deal today is april 21 1994 i will make a mark on my kitchen calendar under a little magnet on my refrigerator and tell my staff to put it in our computer for next years calendar lets have a little coffee talk a chat on april 21 1995 let us look at what this bill has done for or maybe to america on april 21that has a nice blackjack sound 21on april 21 1996 lets see if my prediction is correct that violent crime will still be on the increase because we have to live through a generation reaping the wild winds of what we sowed from 1964 in the spring to the fall of saigon and even a few years thereafter when we told a whole generation of young people that bulldog drummond and gangbusters the radio shows their parents listened to were wrong that crime does pay i see my colleague from california from one of the most beautiful areas of the country san diego has arrived i will tell you what we can do to show people how good friends i mean amigos are tormented by this bill i voted against it you voted for it i do not criticize your vote i just read a lot of the good stuff that is in it that would be worthy of a yes vote so i will ask duncan hunter of san diego what is his take and why did he vote for the bill i yield to the gentleman"], [1.5695932233938947e-06, 1.5695932233938947e-06, 0, "with the rush of business yesterday on the authorization bill for the national institutes of health i was unable to come to the floor about an article on the front page of the washington times that really has me upset at the pentagon and that is pretty rare because i admire our women and men in uniform serving our country it is about a lieutenant that was silenced by the pentagon the washington times front page headline is proban lieutenant silenced meaning he is for the ban on allowing professed avowed homosexuals that is by definition activists to be recruited or to stay in the military once they come out of privacy i do not use that stupid ignorant pejorative term in the closet privacy over sexual conduct has nothing to do with a bad naughty stepmother making you hide in a dark closet it is just what it says privacy and for those that want to proclaim openly their homosexuality which is that very important proclamation is therefore an admission of homosexual activity or activism in the military services is something that has got to be blocked and stopped and the current policy should be respected so let us look at this story because i am glad in a way i did not come to the floor yesterday because i have researched who this gentleman is this navy lieutenant david quint and find out that the plot thickens because he is an annapolis graduate and at the naval academy ul> the road here in maryland his roommate was one of the nine battalion commanders who has now become the poster boy of homosexual activism visavis the military because his name is joseph stefans he lives in new york now in a homosexual relationship that he refuses to talk about but i have seen this joseph stefans get front page coverage in sunday magazine supplements to the new york times i believe also the washington post people magazine several page coverage all of it glorifying him as this great lose to the u military i debated mr stefans formerly a midshipman he was kicked out i think as long ago as april 1987 in his last year at the naval academy i have debated him on the larry cing show a nationwide show of some repute and a show that creates presidential candidates as a matter of fact and i have also debated him on nightline a loaded deck the host forrest sawyer always introduced as a reagan defense expert but liberal in nature larry korb three against one but i have been against stefans twice on television and in between the nightline appearance where i would say the truncated imbalanced debate was a draw i was visited in my office by a marine colonel an army marine colonel a navy full captain and an air force colonel explaining this is months ago explaining how they never go on the media spokesmen from the pentagon because we always lose the deck is always stacked by the media culture against us as it was against you mr dornan they said however we never lose in court and they never did in a local decision last or a few weeks ago out in los angeles by a federal judge which pertained only to his jurisdiction there in southern california so that is pretty good 99 9 percent history rate in court for maintaining this ban against avowed open professed activist homosexuals in the military let me go into this article a little bit and try and see what we can learn from this elucidate this issue a bit a little guoting here from rowan scarboroughs article naval spokesman angered superiors is the subtitle the navy has muzzled an official spokesman official spokesman of the public information office for all matters of naval importance for expressing his opposition to lifting the ban on homosexuals in the military he was muzzled the public affairs officer lt david quint was threatened with disciplinaryaction if he did not stop that advocacy as a naval officer in other words if he did not stop upholding a 50year policy that is actually a several hundred year policy lieutenant quint declined to comment yesterday saying any utterance might place him in violation of the gag order i may just be contacting lieutenant quint to come up to the hill and speak before one of my subcommittees of the committee on armed services including having his commanders invited up here friends of the naval officer said the pentagon spokesman believes the navy violated his freedom of speech i am inclined to believe that also the acquaintances one of whom provided the disciplinary memo to the times complained that the navy took no similar action during the past two years of public debate on women in combat during that time female off ers in unliorm gave numerous press interviews on their opposition to the current combat ban let me discuss that statement because it is not only true this member of the unitedstates house of representatives from california witnessed this not only did women in uniform give interviews and they were almost always officers because enlisted women 95 percent said we do not want to be in combat but because of career advancement reasons and i will concede maybe some courage in many of the cases they not only gave interviews in uniform female officers but i went over to the senate side because this chamber as we know gutted out on this issue we did not have day one not a minute of hearings on women in combat in the military we have not even thoroughly debated women in support combat units and what is happening for example 18percent pregnancy rte of all women who go to sea on our auxiliary support ships we have not even debated that but in this house there was no debate we deferred to the senate the senate got it out except it set up a commission thanks to sealor democrat exmarine officer and mig almost an ace shot down three migs in korea astronaut hero john glenn of freedom 7 fame and the first missile program we ever had the first man to orbit the globe and pow hero for 61h years john mccain republican senator thanks to those two taking the lead we had a commission on women i thought it was a pretty balanced commission all viewpoints were heard they issued a decision an advisory decision to thenpresident bush that women should not be in combat when i testified before that commission and went over there and had discussions in the halls and did a little lobbying i saw women in uniform i think particularly of two army captains in uniform lobbying my own past is not particularly perfect in this area i marched with reverend dr martin luther king on august 28 1963 in my air force uniform with two rows of peacetime fighter pilot ribbons my air force silver wings my captains bars my summer silver tans the uniform long gone i knew i was probably violating a milltary regulation for making a political statement on civil rights and using my uniform to do it i was 27 years of age excuse me i had just turned 30 1963 and i have pictures in front of the washington monument sitting with a whol e delegation of some pretty famous people since i was not known outside of my own family sitting next to the late sammy davis jr the late fine actor robert ryan the late great screenwriter of judgment at nuremburg just coming off an academy award abby mann the fine actor and korean army veteran and liaison pilot james garner we were all there in this delegation all i had to offer was my air force captains uniform i was willing to put my career on the line because the kennedy brothers were hiding in the white house they did not want to get out in front of dr king i was proud to be there in august 1963 because i had flown with africanamericans then called black officers who taught me to fly a fighter and flew with me in f100s at george air force base fig newton in the adjoining squadron my own flight commander who is now a medical doctor heard from him the first time in 35 years the other day retired major wilson who was my flight commander a few years before at george air force base i was proud to march in my uniform my best memory of that day other than looking around and seeing the tears flowing down everybodys face as dr king made that beautiful i have a dream speech about all of us living in harmony with brotherhood really meaning something i remember walking down constitution avenue i think it was the parade approach to this gathering of some 250 000 people without even a fistfight not a harsh word not a scuffle that i knew of i remember a little child coming up to me a black child a little boy he says to me sir are you guarding or marching and i said i am marching son and he slipped his hand into mine and for fully half that march all the way up until he went his way in front of the lincoln memorial i held that little black childs hand i never wore my air force captains uniform more proudly than i did that day the fact is people told me later when they saw the photographs come back and you can check them in my office i am proud of them they said you broke air force regulations you were making a statement in your uniform and you were not supposed to do that this article kind of gets into that there are some issues that transcend a rule that limits the freedom of speech of our men and women officers and enlisted who are on active duty or even are quite active in the reserve listen to the rest of this article the quint case and i do not like the sound of that and i am sure lt david quint does not either the quint case illustrates the tightrope proban offlcers including the joint chiefs of staff and now we are talking about people with eight stars four on each shoulder walk as they attempt to implement president clintons order to ease some restrictions on homosexuals in the armed forces it also shows according to allies of lieutenant quint how senior officers moved to stamp out dissent on the issue so as not to appear in opposition the president is preparing to order the ban lifted on july 15 not until wehave had hearings here and in senator nunns committee on armed services and in the subcommittee of my good friend chairman ike skelton the hearings have been put off for a week we do not have to appear on st patricks day next week but the week after on the full committee on armed services we are a bit out of sync we should have mr skeltons subcommittee hearings first and then the full committee but people are interested in this the article continues all six members of the joint chiefs including the chairman gen colin powell proudly of africanamerican descent by way of his parents coming as immigrants to the united states that they loved from jamaica and becoming citizens they all oppose the joint chiefs removing the ban but they stopped expressing that view publicly so as not to contradict mr clinton the commander in chief lieutenant quints superiors ordered him tostop talking the same day senior pentagon officials chewed out several admirals for an antihomosexual comment in the new york times that was attributed by name to a senior navy spokesman a lieutenant commander by the way navy sources said the unhappy senior officials include general powell but the generals spokesman col bill smullen said im not aware of that and i am sure i would have been apprised of that i will bet he would too so people in the press are cranking in colin powell without his permission lieutenant quint expressed his views in several forums including conservative radio talk shows are there any other talk shows these days other than conservative ones including the christian broadcasting service on cable tv that was either their new show or their new 700 club he also addressed the issue during duty hours in his work space his superiors claim at the navys central public affairs office in the pentagon because previous counseling apparently has not been heeded this letter is directive in nature said a memo to lieutenant quint from cap fred leeder deputy chief of information captain fred you will hear from congressman bob dornan from california i want to chat with you fred i admire guys in uniform a full captain like you that would be a colonel in my service or my dads army service i want to talk to you fred want to find out from you what you think of homosexuals in the military it is my privilege to quote you or not but i have a right to ask you as a congressman who sets your pay scale you will refrain immediately says fred leeder to his lieutenant from any activity detailed in this letter violation of this directive may result in disciplinary action which could affect your continued assignment and your professional record this to an annapolis graduate means they are going to wreck your career and i will help them do it if you dont back off did anybody tell this to these women who were over on the senate side and had been on this house side moving in and out of our offices in uniform arguing for women in combat the reason i never came to the floor on that or objected to it was because i will say this to these women they were not trying to get out of something and that is the kind of letters i get from parents or people in the military to which i write back and say i cannot help you get out of anything if somebody said to me they want to get into the special forces get on the delta team go to pilot training get into submarine service get into helicopter school get into special forces they want to do something they want to get into a combat unit and put their lives in harms way if we go to war small or large i bend every rule in my office to help people get into somethiig these women were fighting to get into combat i knew they were bending their free speech that is limited by wearing the uniform but i did not say anything however now this double standard women in combat which i was never convinced was correct they are allowed to lobby but when it comes to keeping people who are disreslected by 95 percent of the military and i feel like saying 99 percent because they think they are morally corrupt because their gender orientation is to their own sex anybody who is a strict biblical student or who is an orthodox jewish catholic protestant or any faith certainly orthodox islam finds it morally offensive to take orders from somebody they consider morally corrupt this cannot be compared to harry trumans order of july 26 1948 anybody who went to the bible that we use when people are sworn in and didnt president clinton put his hand on his mamma kellys bible when he was sworn in 1640 well if anybody said i will not follow that person because of the color of their skin you could go to the bible and say nothing wrong with that person morally you are a bigot you are a racist you are corrupt by scripture you are corrupt by jewish catholic or the teachings of the major religions in the world what harry truman is doing is correct and besides folks get this there were tens of thousands of people of color in uniform in 1848 it is just that they were segregated in their own units and demeaning to their dignity in some of the units the officers were white and that went all the way back to the civil war crispus attucks an african englishman actually or whatever you would call a precolonial american died at lexington green in april 1775 a black american gives his life for his country crispus attucks if anybody saw the move glory and did not have tears come to their eyes with the 54th regiment led by col bob shaw a white officer of boston still in his twenties and the attack on battery wagner now called fort wagner which was not more than a battery at that time that black regiment brought such glory then to all black units throughout the civil war on the union side that it is incredible that it took from 1864 in that battle all the way until 1948 to integrate flack units in with every other unit in the country this cannot be compared to telling an officer or an enlisted man who refuses to follow somebody because he is an avowed homosexual because when you go to the bible in that instance whether it is in genesis or the third book of the penteuch which is called the torah in the jewish law the first five books of the bible book one and three are very explicit about homosexuality an abomination in st pauls letters to the romans when he takes the word of jesus across the thenknown mediterranean world writing to no less than the romans themselves he points out what an abomination it is go to the bible these officers i am sure lieutenant quint as a roommate of the poor pathetic poster boy joseph stephens of the homosexual movement i am sure he feels nothing but pain sorrow and friendship for joe from his annapolis days and this is what may be causing him to speak out let me get back to the larry king show i did not tell you what all of the senior fieldgrade officers the colonels and the navy captains told me in my office that stephens lies when he goes on a television show and said he never engaged in homosexual conduct that he only told a couple of friends and then by implication they ratted on him and destroyed his naval career as an officer they showed me documentation that two freshmen on the main annapolis choirjoe stephens used to be a practicing catholic i am sure he is from a small town in north dakota the only kid from that area ever to go to one of our service academies traditional scandanavian catholic family two sisters mother dad all broken hearted over this so he is on the catholic choir because the whole annapolis choir travels more and he switched over to the main annapolis choir he sang the star bangled banner back at the armynavy games of 198687 and the 198586 season when he went to the main big choir which travels around the country scholastic requirements notwithstanding he woke up two freshmen at night and i see in this print from the navy document he was rubbing their stomachs in other words a pass a pitch a move hitting upon freshmen as a senior battalion commander one of the eight gays i put this proposition right in his face on the larry king show and he turned ashen white even under this makeup and he fled the studio larry king said well you sure hit him and i said go to confession joe and make a confession make a general confession to ease the pain for your mother father and sisters and get back in gods graces and stop being used by those crazed homosexual movement people like act up in new york there but he did not take the advice and he fled i pray for joe occasionally he will come together someday i am going to follow this thing through to its logical conclusion we are suppressing peoples freedom of speech on the key issue of a military units cohesiveness combat readiness morality yes and health yes i am probably not going to discuss the morality issue in the subcommittee or in the full committee hearings or maybe not again on the floor until the dust has settled on the military aspects of homosexuals in the military closing out this washington times headline article from yesterday march 10 here is the payoff captain leeder issued the memo the same day another spokesman comdr craig quigley and he would be a lieutenant colonel in the marine corps air force or the army a middle grade field grade officer he was quoted in a new york times story headlined military cites wide range of reasons for its gay ban my staff will have that article waiting for me when i get back to my office this evening over the computer nexus system hint the commander was quoted as saying this is quigley homosexuals are notoriously promiscuous statement of fact i willi take it from him and make it mystatement statement of congressman bob dornan from california homosexuals are notoriously promiscuous period fact every survey ever done fairly in the history of modern times sources said general powell colin powell troubled by persistent reports the pentagon is bucking mr clinton on the issue was angered and relayed his feelings to the navy after the quote appeared rear admiral kendell pease i think i will be calling admiral pease some of these folks out across america may want to call him too he is navy chief of information that is way up the chain of command of lt david quint he ordered his subordinates to make no further comment on homosexuals in the military now how are we going to learn from people in uniform what they think about this issue if they are all furious about it if morale at the pentagon is on the floor and starting with what they have as a commander in chief a former demonstrator not a draft dodger but somebody who got drafted and had his showup date of 1969 squelched politically a little different from evading but changing the draft notice and making somebody else take your place or that weak salute that spread through the corps kind of poorly a guy who kind of is popping a half salute and morale is at the bottom at the pentagon everybody listening at the pentagon knows that and now you are suppressing them on an issue that is ripping the morale of the military services even further then on that same page quigley caused this admirals memo to come out and that is the day that lieutenant quint was reprimanded via the memo quigley said 2 days ago he knew of no repercussions or complaints from general powell because of his quote in the new york times he said his statement about homosexual promiscuity was not comparable to lieutenant quints statements in opposition to homosexuals in the military he said his statement was based on research articles he read now backed up by dornan on the house floor commander quigley declined to discuss the quint case i would never discuss with you the counseling of any junior officer by a senior officer i like that good going craig quigley but he added as a general principle that if a navy spokesperson has very strong personal convictions on a subject any subject any subject any subject something we are going to have hearings on in the house and the senate and this had been a national issue since veterans day when the presidentelect brought it up in the rotunda on veterans day in little rock ar the rotunda of the state capitol any subject he or she must he very careful to separate their professional role from their personal convictions in other words bob dornan should not have worn his military uniform and marched with martin luther king probably and all of these women should not wear their uniforms when they come here to lobby for women in combat lieutenant quigley should not have worn his uniform to make statements about being in the military if he is on active duty free speech suppressing speech let me tell you my experience i think it is probably that quint started to talk about his roommate poster boy gay midshipman sounds like a dick powell 1930s movie the gay midshipman which was a headline in the washington post article and in one magazine a posh hollywood elitist magazine they had a fullpage picture of stephens with his mouth wide open and it looked like an ad for the former morton downey show screaming the primal scream you open it up and its screaming out unfairness in the naval academy by not letting him go on active duty as a known homosexual so let me close this article i am continuing to quote commander quigley if it is felt that they are crossing the line and blurring the two roles then it is appropriate and expected for a more senior more experienced individual would counsel that person on their performance he said a navy captain who asked not to be named here comes more guts on the parts of these guys that are fighting our wars for us i have seen people who have had 300 or 400 combat missions in north vietnam rolling in against sam missiles mig interference flying from bob mcnamaras mig sanctuaries unbelievable russian supplied directed antiaircraft fire and it is known and able to be called factually the most dangerous air warfare environment in the history of flying since the wright brothers in 1903 they will have 300 or 400 combat missions 6 rows of medals air force cross navy cross silver stars several times multiple distinguished flying crosses and air medals and you tell them that they have to go and testify on capitol hill and they pale i cannot understand that i do not know why more military people are not up here volunteering to tell us what a dangerous world it is and why these savage cuts of the clinton administration are going to serve this country poorly not just 10 years from now but probably as short a periodas 4 years from now i want people in the military to use their own expression to fall on your sword more get on a white charger like paul revere and ride across this country and tell the truth it might cost you your career but you are going to sleep better at night and not only your grandchildren but your greatgrandchildren are going to talk about you in the same way that we talk about great military heroes who gave the warning to their nation in times when people thought the military was not important anymore what is kiplings poem hes tommy this and hes tommy that throw him out of here the brute but hes the hero of his country when the guns begin to shoot we are entering that same period again of disrespect for the military so this brave anonymous navy captain said that the navy is extremely fearful of offending mr clinton and jeopardizing its standing in budget negotiations with defense secretary les aspin and the white house there are some worstcase scenarios that the navys oncegrowing fleet of nearly 600 ships in the 1980s will shrink to 300 vessels during the clinton administration if naval offlcers distinguished men and women of high rank believe that this administration is going to be so petty as to cut naval combat vessels to cut into the meat and the bone marrow of our national security because they take a stand based on combatunit cohesiveness readiness or even morality that lossofrespect factor between enlisted kids and their petty officers or nco sergeants or younger officers in the field grade if not flag grade people in the service if they are afraid to speak out on that what a mess our military is going to be in so all of the aforementioned people i will be calling over the next few days at the pentagon i will tell you this i know what is going on over there i know there are about 157 deputy assistant secretaries assistant secretaries a principal deputy assistant secretary is 157 civilian positions unfilled because my friend and former colleague here for 16 years les aspin is unable to get these positions filled because the white house wants to sign off on them that is not the way mel laird accepted the secretary of defense job under richard nixon he told his former colleague from this house president nixon he said i will answer to you but you let me pick my own team and i will leave the house and i will take that job as secretary of defense and that is the way it works best in a lot of these cases do you know what they are all whispering over there they are saying that they think that this current commander in chief is waiting until the dust settles on some other problems including homosexuals avowed homosexuals being allowed in the military and that he is going to stuff these civilian jobs over there with former flower children from the 1960s who also chanted in the streets ho ho ho chi minh the viet cong or the north vietnamese are going to win hey hey lbj how many kids did you kill today strobe talbott now an ambassador designate to be ambassador to all of the former soviet republics a former senior editor of time magazine admitted in a disingenuous if not totally deceitful april 6 time magazine article trying to cover over clintons draft evasion as draft dodging when in fact he was drafted and had it squelched as i j ust said he covered all of that over which is i think a form of lying strobe talbott admitted on the first page of that twopage foldout article in time magazine of april 6 look it up he admitted that he himself strobe talbott chanted hey hey lbj how many babies did you kill today on the campus at oxford and in the streets of london and now he is going to be our ambassador and the presidents senior adviser on all affairs in russian or former socalled republics all kazakhstan affairs all kirghizia all turkmenistan all moldavia all byelorus affairs are going to be handled by this guy who was pulling for a communist victory and arguing as a moral equivalency that we were as evil as the soviet union during all of this very bloody and very hot cold war period of almost half a century well i know that morale is on the floor and homosexuals in the military is a key item that is wrecking the morale and when i see a brave enlisted man on camera look into a network news camera in somalia and say hey he pretty loathed us when he was a graduate student in england and now it is our time maybe to loathe him but i see officers running for cover because they are afraid they are going to be hurt in the budget more importantly that means hurt in their own career i say to these senior menand women that i admire stand tall put your country first put it ahead of your career who knows god may have a break for you out there in the professional world with a book or a tv show or a teaching position at some university where you will be more fulfilled than during the period when the country is taking so many hits and do not go around figuring out how to suppress lt david quint when he may have a story to tell about the poster boy main spokesman for the liberal media on homosexuals in the military poor joseph stephens who to this day i guarantee you is still making life uncomfortable for his sisters breaking his parents hearts even though in the articles you can see that they are trying to be supportive of him and whoever he is living with that he doubletalks and by the way stephens in print in the most recent article and i do not remember where but i think it was in new york magazine an article that he said i admit at the academy that i was attracted to certain people i remember once my leg brushed somebody and it was very exciting do we need this in the military he said well you have to know when and where how to call your shots and all that yes like hitting on two freshmen on the naval choir and that is why he got busted out so he should stop lying and quint should be allowed to tell the truth and we had

health centers have bipartisan support in this congress and have enjoyed that broad support for many years this funding to expand that system throughout america is not only directly related to the solution to our health care problems but is long overdue there are few things this congress could do that would more affect peoples lives of the 125 new clinics that this would provide all have demonstrated need all have met all of the funding criteria all cannot operate for lack of funds in fact there are 150 centers prepared to open that have demonstrated need and that have met all of our criteria in addition there are 75 additional axpplicants who have been able to demonstrate that they would exist in a medically underserved area it is high time we put our dollars on the line behind all those words that we have been saying for so many years about the 37 million uninsured these clinics tend to be located in the very areas where the majority of americans without health insurance live they are in the areas where there is a shortage they are in the areas where often the poorest live they are in the city neighborhoods they are in the most isolated rural areas they are where the people who have the least access to health care live and furthermore even if we mandate that all employers provide health insurance even if we mandate that everyone in america has health insurance there will still be problems in accessing the system until we expand our community health center system i there is a lack of transportation in cities and in rural areas there is a lack of providers in many areas of the nation it is only by expanding this infrastructure of care that we can make access to community health care a reality for the majority of those 37 million who are uninsured in my state of connecticut these community health centers helped those that went through serious periods of unemployment because it made access available and affordable whether one was covered or not covered i hope that we will lay aside our differences today and vote for this amendment because it is the heart and soul of one of the critical pieces of the solution to access for health care it supports those kinds of institutions that provide holistic care that create the relationships that mean that prenatal care is accomplished that create the relationship that assures that wellchild care is carried out in a timely fashion 0j 1710 community health centers create the relationships through which substance abuse family abuse and violence can be addressed they are comprehensive they are
