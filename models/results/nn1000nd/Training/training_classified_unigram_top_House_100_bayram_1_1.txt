this has gone on so long this issue so much longer than the 3 years and 5 months and 1 day that it took from december 7 1941 to harry trumans birthday on may 8 1945 to crush mussolini and hitler and then you had a handful of days until the shooting stopped on august 15 1945 and it appeared that a country starting from scratch with broomhandle guns and tin cans on sticks simulating mortars in the louisiana army war maneuvers of 1940 with lieutenant colonel eisenhower in just 3 years and 5 months and a day we crushed this nazi terror around the world and this numbing effect that has taken us over the last 8 years with the emergence of the communist dictatorship 9 years this last july 19 the sandinistas have been in power one thing popped into my mind when the gentleman talked about numbing members of this congress in recent years created a first in the capital of managua two members of this chamber including the gentleman from michigan that i debated on crossfire tonight who sat in as speaker pro tempore for about the longest period of anybody tonight they went down to managua and kicked unitedstates state department people out of the room so that they could have a secret meeting with the communist dictator and his staff in the capital of managua the embassy people down there told me a few weeks later when i was there septemnber 22 1 988 that they were shocked that they would be told to get out of tile room as though they could not be trusted they usually take notes about american appearances around the world not to eavesdrop i have just been at meetings with communist functionaries in mongolia in the soviet union in poland i wanted the trained ambassadorial people the staff of our state department around the world to not only brief me before i go in to sit there and witness what i am being told to use their language skills but then after i have had the meeting to debrief what took place at that neeting i had a stunning meeting with the head of the entire prison system in the soviet union and the head of all of the police officers 66 000 precincts as he put it in the soviet union nobody in the internal affairs ministry in moscow has ever met with a unitedstates senator or a unitedstates congressman and that happened to me just at the end of last month i wanted the state department people there to analyze this plus to translate for me but it became a regular occurrance in nicaragua the only nation on the face of the earth where we have diplomatic exchanges and recognition of governments only there did members of the majority party liberal democrats go down there and demand private meetings with the communist dictators instead of an incident being made about it on the house floor and instead of secretary of state shultz bringing it before speaker wright and speaker wrights attention calling in the gentleman who is majority leader in the senate when it was robert dole when we were in the majority and the majority leader now and getting to the root of this thing instead because of national technical means some of the dialog that transpired in those meetings went back and forth let me tell my colleagues something in very careful diplomatic language of my own but i can tell anybody in this chamber who wants to hear it off the floor every member of our embassy in honduras top to bottom every member of our ambassadorial staff in costa rica top to bottom believes that a member of the other chamber is having an affair with a female officer of the government of costa rica and is sharing that mistress with the highest ranking people in that government of costa rica and that member of the other body positions himself in san jose and would use air force airplanes and time and fuel to fly individually to guatemala for meetings back to san jose to tegucigalpa honduras back to san jose fly to el salvador and back to san jose to every country in that area always returning to the san jose base so he is carrying on his affair i had what they call a country team briefing i said wait a minute this is important what you are telling me because it compromises this persons integrity you are telling me everyone of you in this room agrees with this do you do you do you everybody on this staff what does our embassy all of them think down there in costa rica they all agree with the same facts that this unitedstates senator is having an affair with one of the high dignitaries in this government female and that so is another high ranking person of that government i am not going to say how highranking it would astound everybody here and this kind of bargaining is going on in our negotiations down there while young american marines get killed when the terror operation was worked out in a safe house in managua and this congressmen is desparate to see the next 12 legislative days go by so that this socalled historic 100th congress can adjourn we can get george bush elected president of the united states and go into gridlock in the 101st congress with a democratic liberal controlled senate democratic liberal controlled house a presidency at least the white house understanding something about the voices crying out for freedom through solidarity in poland which i witnessed with my own eyes a few weeks ago freedom is exploding around this world free market democracies are on the march and the communist dictators around this world as i told them in the communist foreign ministry in moscow you have on the fringes of your sphere of influence what we call your empire as you call us an imperialist empire you have on the fringes stalinist thugs two brothers in cuba named castro and two brothers in nicaragua named ortega and this infinite beginning of a new relationship between the soviet union and the united states of america is going to be destroyed by these stalinist thugs in cuba and nicaragua disagreeing with some of the commie counsel and they are going to do exactly what they want to provoke stalinist terror in our hemisphere and it is going to damage our relations the no 2 man in their north american division of their foreign ministry at the meeting that i had in the foreign ministry after catching them watching money line on a cnn channel that ted turner has given them as a gift when our own embassy people cannot watch any american television by virtue of satelliteat the luncheon at the ambassadors house later in the same response to the same challenge they said congressman there is much merit in what you say about these people on the fringes of our sphere of influence as you call it i asked our fine ambassador there jack matlock i hope you didnt mind me bringing up some tough questions about nicaragua at this lunch and the ambassador said congressman it was excellent what you did these people must hear from american senators and congressmen how you feel about this regime that they are sponsoring and that they are the cash cow for that they are feeding in both cuba and nicaragua i want everybody to be aware that the communist government in moscow in spite of all of the moves tinder glasnost an d the restructuring of perestroika so called they are pumping into cuba 14 million not rubles dollars a day they are pumping into hanoi the communist conquerors of all of indochina 9 million a day and they are keeping daniel ortega floated in a decaying economy with over 2 000 percent interesti mean inflation at the rate of 4 million a day that is almost a billion and a half dollars a year to keep this communist terror alive in nicaragua and i come back to a line i used on television tonight and that i used 3 hours ago some liberal democrats in this chamber are making central america safe for communism and i cannot believe i am an eyewitness to this from the inside out and heaven knows what course we are going to take over the next 12 to 14 legislative days one of the senior members who i highly respect the gentleman from kentucky said that he thinks our adjournment day will be october 15 that in his 3 decades of experience here we have never adjourned on a tuesday wednesday or thursday we either spill over to a saturday or sunday or sometimes as far as over to a monday so it means that we are probably going to stay here until saturday october 15 we have got a columbus holiday on october 12 that monday i understand the speaker has a big fund raiser in texas on october 11 or thereabouts so we may have some downtime even in that week we hope not to be here we are going to stay here through october 15 and i hope we have plenty of time to analyze the fifth unitedstates tour of communist dictator daniel ortega of the united states and this time let us not have any secret meetings in the speakers

liberty in our hemisphere has been temporarily murdered by a close vote in this house this evening now i am not going to spend much time castigating anybody by name on the majority side of the aisle they gerrymandered themselves in my state into a majority so that one man long dead can laugh about the results of this vote because in 1982 when i was gerrymandered out of my seat on my first 6year goaround the congressman long dead who did it to me said that he would change seven seats in california and he did we were 22 to21 when that lame duck session ended in december 1982 and when we reconvened a few weeks later less than 3 weeks later the california delegation was not 22to21 we picked up two new seats and they went to liberals the new count was 28 to 17 an 11vote spread and what did we lose this vote by tonight five votes if they shifted from no to yes it would have been 216 to 214 and you could not have voted to break a tie five votes when my good friend from california mr berman told me this morning they were hoping deliciously that the margin of defeat would be buried in republican votes and it is twelve republicans voted against their president one of them ate up a half hour in the oval office in the last few days and then had a former president gerald ford spend another 30 minutes on the phone with him wasting his time wasting fords time and this is this gentlemans first vote against contra aid now when the president had tailored a package that sounded for all the world to me like the mccurdy plan named after dave mccurdy of oklahoma a year ago and when the president finally moves to the mccurdy plan mccurdy moves away from it here are five republicans that i think could win by 70 percent in their district if they change their vote because their district loves them and they would not care mr boehlert who got dan mitchells seat in upper new york state mr amo houghton who just for the first time voted against the presiden on contra aid mrs claudine schneider of rhode island beloved wins with 70 percent and could do whatever she wants mr tauke a bush cochairman of iowa i am a cochairman of bush in california so this kind of stings a little bit the fifth one is paul henry who holds gerald fords seat in michigan that ford held for 25 years now there is hope and i hope the ortega brothers are not laughing in their designer glasses tonight because at least 9 of these 12 republicans have told mei polled them on the floor before the votethey told me that they will switch their vote in an instant if ortega screws around with this peace process and does not start releasing these political prisoners and i know at least 30 people on the other side of the aisle because their careers are at stake that would switch in a minute if ortega tries to screw up this peace process now let me tell you a little story that the great lady who was once one of the shining lights of this deliberative body the incomparable claire booth luce told me a few years ago at the international hotel off of scott circle i said is it true claire that you told young presidentelect john p kennedy during the interregnum between eisenhowers 8 years and kennedys brilliant moving and powerful inaugural address the best i have ever heard in my lifetime because i did not get to hear abe lincolns two addresses i said did you tell kennedy that the measure of his presidency would be whether or not castros communism survived in the caribbean she said yes i did and let me tell you something mr dornan i intend to tell president reagan who was then himself a presidentelect that the measure of his presidency will be determined on whether or not communism maintains its foothold in central america and begins to spread now claire booth luce has gone to her eternal reward so i have no way of knowing whether she ever got to president reagan and said to him the same thing about nicaragua that she said to young president kennedy at 43 years of age before he was sworn in but i have a suspicion that she did and that is why president reagan said the other night that he did not become the president to preside over the communization of central america the irony is that you stood in this well and said of course he did not do that he is here to preside over the united states oh i see you are rewriting history right jimbo he is not the leader of the free world he is not the commander in chief of our military forces that has national security obligations that go beyond our borders i do not fault mr arias with only 10 000 police officers and security forces and no navy or army or marine corps or air force as such i do not fault him for operating in his countrys best interests but the united states of america has a right to operate in its best interest as the presidents have told me to my face as azcona told a distinguished colleague of mine on the floor dan burton and myself on september 6 to our face he told us that we must exercise our role of leadership as a superpower and not pay attention totally to what small little weak powers do to cover their own bets as to whether or not the ortega brothers survive in central america february 3 1 988 coi now i think the best essay i came acrossit violates the law of aristotle that nobody should sit down and dare to write philosophy until they are past their 50th birthday i do not know what his ideology is i think one of the most fascinating philosopher essayists in our country is charles krauthammer i think he started out as a liberal but he writes this editorial in the current issue of time on the back page titled whose foreign policy is it anyway and he says that quoting jim wright if we are willing to abide by the determination of those central americans themselves rather than allowing someone in the state department simply on his whim to say who is complying and he is not he says that statement of the house speaker about putting the contra aid in escrow to be released depending on future sandinista behavior to attack that is to say that we do not have a foreign policy and that is what you said here on the floor just a few minutes ago actually krauthammer says that the unitedstates congress with its vote this week now down by a shift of five has by default been designated to be the final judgment on sandinista compliance as though they had been complying on this floor tonight you said they have opened up papers that is not true one paper the press la prensa you said they have opened up radio stations there are 22 licenses pending there were 49 radio stations down there when somoza fell there is one radio station radio catolica and i did an interview on it just a couple of weeks ago and talked about the hidden bank accounts of the sandinistaortega brothers in switzerland and i pointed out on that radio show that a good idealistic marxistleninist following frederick engels dialectical materialism following in the path of that puritan leninist no good communist has a secret swiss bank account and if they do they had better not get caught well they are caught roger miranda has given us the number of the account and to the dollar value that is in humberto ortegas account and when i sponsored a 2hour meeting with him here last wednesday one of the congressmen said how come you know so much about the secret bank account and you know what major miranda said he said congressman i administered the secret account of the defense minister humberto ortega so i said to obando y bravoi spent 1 hour with him just about 10 days ago all alone his next meeting was with ortega as i left he got in his car to drive no ortega was coming to his house we passed like ships in the night the cardinal said to me yes we will run your interview i said will it get you in trouble i talked about their secret bank accounts trying to put wedges between these nine communist sandinistas and he said probably it will get us in trouble and i guess it ran this week i had someone call me and tell methe nicest compliment i have had in my lifethat i am public enemy no 1 to the sandinistas down there well that is fine because i cannot get out of my head during this whole debate those visits that i made with my 28yearold son to two of the farms in honduras where those amputeed victims young men and young women who are fighting for freedom fellow north americans fighting for our freedom right here on the mainland of this continent of ours as claude pepper says our beloved part of the world i cannot get over the fact that they said they would give tip their limbs again my son asked them what do you think when democrats get up on the house floor and say that you bayonet pregnant women they just shook their heads and one man said may i answer and he rolled his wheelchair forward he had all his limbs but they were all twisted and crippled and he said we are of the people we are campesinos the people call us los muchachos the boys the commandos that is why it is so ironic that one of the members from new jersey gets up and says if we drive the sandinistas to it they will go up in the hills the sandinista communists cannot go back into the hills because first of all they were city people it was a city movement the campesinos the peasants that run the hills hate the guts of these communists these fairskinned city boys that have betrayed their revolution how many interviews have we heard where the indians along the coast the suma the rama the miskitos said that somoza was a bum but he left us alone he only corrupted the city of managua and maybe leon how many times have we heard the mestizo the mixed bloods what we gringos refer to as indians from mexico all the way down to patagonia how many times have we heard them say we are the people fighting this war let me tell you something about roger miranda some of my own colleagues did not realize what i was getting at when we had him over here in the ollie north memorial briefing room no 227 and i said what was the straw that broke your back major what made you come over he told us he was a dedicated communist this is a privileged kid from managua he went and got his degree in economics at the university of santiago in chile that is when he told me he became a communist then he was privileged to go get a masters degree up at the autonomous public university in mexico city i said what turned you around more than anything else he said i went pi t on the battlefield along the rama road the road that runs to the east near el bluff on the coast he said i looked on the faces of the dead contras on the battlefield and i realized that all my idealism from my commitnist youth was a lie i was not saving my people as i thought from soioza i was slaughtering my people i said is it a fact that you can easily tell the campesinos the hard working peasants with their sun darkened skins the hard working people who work in the fields like cardinal obando y bravo by the way and he said yes it is easy to tell well that conclusion i had drawn before miranda said this to me that is why i asked this question because when i was talking to the mothers and the young sisters and the wives down in these little beatup storefronts that they are allowed to keep on one of the side streets in managua a month ago i remember september 6 or 7 when i was there with mr burton i said dan did you notice that these people are peasants and then i asked the embassy people what percentage of the 10 000 political prisoners are darker skinned peasants not citified young communists acting out their adolescent marxist fantasies on their people destroying the economy and clinging to their power with the rule of the gun and terror in these prison camps they said oh the political prisoners are 90 percent campesino peasants then i flashed back on all of the visits that we made to the contra camps tip in honduras which by the way are gone they are all inside nicaragua 14 000 of them and i said my gosh the whole force of the fighting people are dark skinned peas ants these are not the fair skinned guardia or the fair skinned sandinista city guys fighting to dump soioza and betray their revolution then it hit me that this was truly a peasant war a civil war i had some befuddled jesuit priest sitting in front of me over in my committee and i can talk in those terms because i may not want to characterize myself as devouti leave that to geraldine ferrarobut i am loyal and a loyal practicing catholic and when some jebby sits in front of me and i have got 7 years of jesuit education and tells me that if we had the equivalent number of people in our country in the hills 14 000 we would have an army in the hills of 1 5 million americans fighting against our government i said did it ever occur to you father if we had one and a half million american fighting commandos in the rocky mountains people would call it a civil war and he had nothing to say when you have 14 000 people fighting in those hills and it is not jungle the way it is commonly misreported by the press by the fourth estate up there it is more like the savanna or the serengeti plain in africa it is easy for helicopter gunships to hunt down these contras who try to move in the daytime now to tell you the truth this vote is so frustrating tonight that i know there are thousands upon thousands of people taking advantage of what we call in arms control talks national technical means i am trying to not violate house rules here about referring to that great expanded audience that is beyond these empty chairs here there are hundreds of thousands of frustrated americans that want a postmortem on this vote that want to know why all the members on our side only got 2 minutes and the members on their side seemed to have 6 8 or 9 minutes i will explain that we had almost twice as many speakers on our side out of 175 republicans two of our members are sick one of them just had a heart bypass out of their 267 members one of theirs is sick and another one just passed away he was a profreedomlover votedan daniel of virginia although they had almost 90 more members than we had we had twice as many speakers do you know why a lot of these members in the majority do not want to match their vote with rhetoric and words that will come back to haunt them with the republicans on this side i am proud of my party and those who did vote with the president because almost every one of them with polls against them in their districts are being called for a profile in courage voting against a misguided public in their districts they are willing to put their words together with their votes and they will stand by their words in the future the reason they are so nervous is this i wish the camera could have played across the faces of everybody on this side as claude pepper brought me to one of the dazzling moments of oratory in this house in his mideighties he was speaking without a note extemporaneously about freedom red white and blue is this distinguished gentleman our senior member in years in this house and the look on their faces was one of oh my gosh is he going to turn votes is he going to turn this with his inspirational speech because he is inspired by the cuban americans and his southern florida and they have risen as no initial first generation ever has in this country do you know that the cuban americans in south florida had seven members of the florida assembly in tallahassee no group of immigrants has ever done that we have two great hungarian americans here one republican and one democrat they were sitting together watching this debate this is pretty unusual for two people born in hungary to make it but we have all the great ethnic groups that make up this melting potmy irish jews poles oermans french and they all slaved in workshops and educated the next generation and that is where thr liticians came from the cubans are doing it in their first generation when i was down in south florida campaigning for bush a week before last they said to me why is our countrys freedom not on the agenda any longer they said we admire bushs courage ninetyeight percent of them are foreignborn and he said i will not lie to you we are not discussing cubas freedom and it is not on the agenda as far as we can see they said we love him but we want you to go to him congressman dornan and change that why shouldnt we be on the agenda and it is a darned good question and who shot them down the same cia that trained them under president kennedy that confiscated over 400 of their boats and locked them up in a bayou that i flew over once in south florida one of those back waterways cut out of the swamp they took their means of fighting for their freedom away from them and shut them down and they said ok we will make it in america but we are never going to give up we are praying for and waiting for that moment to drive that dictator castro out of cuba let me read from krauthammers editorial it is just absolutely dazzling what this man says this is entitled whose foreign policy is it anyway here is the line i love what then gives a costa rican more moral authority to decide the fate of nicaragua than 14 000 nicaraguans fighting to liberate their own country and asking only for the materials with which to do it i want to yield to my colleague the gentleman from indiana but before i do i want to tell something about this maj roger miranda i said roger how many fighters did you have in masaya on cbs news last night dan rather said masaya the birthplace of the revolution that toppled somoza it is a suburb just to the east of managuawell not a suburb but a separate city i said i know you were a combat hero in masaya were you the commander no i was the deputy how many sandinistas were there fighting i meant in all of nicaragua he misunderstood me he said 12 i said 12 he said 12 in masaya 12 of us in 1978 by 1979 after eden pastora who hates the communists who was their no i combatant fighter commandante zerohe was the only name known to the people of all the fighters most of the guttiest ones were killed in combat the ortega brothers were bankrobbers who were either in jail or in exile during the whole struggle but here was roger miranda the deputy commandante in masaya with 12 men he said by 1979 we had 98 i said only 98 he said but this was happening in the cities it was in the cities not the hills over nicaragua i said what was your sandinista fighting force at the end he said 2 500 the news media usually says 3 500 and so does your cia he said that there were 2 500 people how did they do it against somoza well for one thing jimmy carter turned back two israeli small freighters loaded with bullets that is what the president was asking for tonight just small arms to keep them as a viable fighting force and he was going to seal it up for 2 months until march 31 depending on whether the ortegas are going to keep the democratization process and open up more than one paper or more than one radio station and let out more than a handful of the 10 500 prisoners by tine way i asked obando bravo have you met one prisoner released of the socalled 1 000 that he released and he said no but honestly i had 4 or 5 calls and i am so busy shuttling back and forth to san josed and santo domingo and going to europe to brief ortega on what to expect from this tough anticommunist pope that i have not had a chance to return those calls i said monsignor which is the term you use in latin countries or your excellency or your eminence for a cardinal your eminence have you a list of 1 000 prisoners i said the american media is accepting ortegas release of 1 000 prisoners he said no no we are still below 100 now the networks say that ortega is going to release thousands more and we do not have a list of over 100 of the socalled 1 000 that he has released when the israelis released 1 100 arabs on the northern border into lebanon the news cameras were there to record every single person released by name and we do not have any 1 000 people released then what i love is when he said they ended the state of emergency do you know what all your embassy people tell me down there when you have a police state as far gone as the rule of terror in managua what difference does it make if you end the state of emergency nothing changes the peasants down there told me nothing changes if he ends the state of emergency it doesnt change any of the terror in this state i know the sovieth at this very moment are telegraphing to the kremlin the results of this vote gorbachev has been emboldened by this vote tonight i hate to report that but it is a fact he will see that we do not have a resolve he wonders where our resolve comes from in afghanistan that is another hypocritical irony of the voting patterns in this house but this lourdes as they say in french lourdesin cuba is this major listening facility the biggest in the western hemisphere where they are reporting on this vote to the kremlin tonight i had a briefing from the new national security adviser yesterday the whole foreign affairs committee did and about 10 of us showed up out of 40 and they told us there is not 11 prisons camps or 12 in nicaragua their only growth industry their only building program it is now up to 16 16 major prisons under the hated olilgarchs of somoza there was one and a quartertipitapa which is now expanded to five times its size and one little torture operation that he had behind the international hotel that had 12 cells in it but now they have 16 prisons and 9 of them are devoted totally to locking up the campesinos off the coffee and cotton farms locking up thousands of people because the commandos the los muchachos swim in the sea of the people miranda told us the ortega brothers have already cut a deal with the soviet union for asylum in the soviet union if all goes bad the turning point when they realized they were in trouble was a year ago when humberto ortega the defense ministerjust as raoul castro is fidels brother humberto ortega controls the guns and the partys army as it was pointed out here and the party owns the military that is not a blue and white rondel on the side of these helicopters that is the sandinista party emblem it would have been like richard nixon trying to take over the whole pentagon and painting every air force airplane with that little dumb looking republican elephant with its trunk down i prefer the one with trunk in the air for victory and then suddenly he would say well i was thinking about resigning i wonder if the pentagon would agree to that since the pentagon is controlled by the national chairman of the republican party imagine if paul kirk had say over the commander in chief and the joint chiefs of staff that is the situation in nicaragua the only country in the world to my knowledge that is in this situation in all of the other countries even in the soviet union the army is the army of the soviet union controlled in its ultimate decisions by the party which runs the politburo 12 men under gorbachev but dictating to him more than he would ever let on but you could read the diplomatic traffic if you have the top secret clearance of a congressman and see how much they do control them at this stage so now let us take a iook at these prison camps here are 9 out of the 16 here was somozas only prisontipitapa they like to call it modelo the modern prison part of it is where they keep the women this black urea here is the old somoza prison it is expanded three times by physical plant and five times by real estate this is estell this is the area where they first used soviet helicopter gunships flying tanks the mi25 the export version with a few avionics off of the mi24 that is used in afghanistan was first used here on august 2 1985 that was the first time soviet equipment was directly killing our fellow first cousins right here our norte americanos the mayor of esteli was just killed in combat and they tried to act like he was a political death he was in uniform doing his weekend warrior duty as a reserve officer this is la palmera prison this is near the tlilrd largest city grenada it is a brand new prison this is zona franco right near the airport every american senator and congressman who has gone down there flies right over this prison in these prisons tonight they are getting the word because the grapevine is an amazing thing it is like jungle drums the word is already reaching these godforsakenwell god has not forsaken themthese libertyforsaken people rotting in these prisons they are getting the word that by a lousy shift of five votes this congress has destroyed their hope i wish i had all 16 pictures here this is puerto cabezas on the coast i got a topsecret briefing down there i have to be careful what i say now the soviet union and the cubans have been jerryrigging sovietmade transports to try to shoot down these freedom fighter airlift airplanes with 57millimeter cannons with rockets 3inch rockets they have actually fired at some of these planes coming in at night and they are on the cheap down there they do not get the high tech that we give through socalled covert programs to afghanistan that dan rather loves to keep showing on the evening news it seems like everybody around here loves the afghanistan effort i want to comment on that in a second but right out of here they are building surfacetoair missile sites they lucked out and got this dc6 with people dying and with colombian pilots dying for us in the cause of freedom but puerto cabezas the sam site there would probably have gotten one sooner or later this is ascuncion prison near julgalpa look at the size of that thing as i said even the military installations which are the only other building projects are not as big as these prisons this is club hipico guess what that is a former motel when i first looked at that i said is that a club mcd somebody said oh yes so finally i went up to matagalpa about 5 weeks ago and met with some of the people up there i met with the mothers in the main cathedral in the middle of matagalpa which again was one of the fighting places that got rid of soinoza only to have their revolution betrayed we drove by club hipico which was an old motel rebuilt and turned into another one of these vicious political prisons this is palo alto near managua this is not an extension of stanford university look at these places this is chimandega up along the coast near corinto where soviet freighters are unloading during this entire debate soviet freighters are unloading weapons of killing this is 2 billion worth as was pointed out here when ortega was down conning everybody at san jose he had just left his deputies to sign a 294 million contract with the soviets with gorbachev just 2 weeks ago that was while we had a congressional team down in san jose costa rica they were advising the communists as it came out in the debate here this is waswali prison look at the size of that place all the building materials down there are going to these gulagtype fascisttype concentration camps it is unbelievable the torture stories that are now coming out from the human rights groups it sickens me that some of the contras we are supporting in their fight revert to the brutality that somoza engendered that creates human rights violations many of them have been courtmartialed some of them have been executed in the field and yes some of them are not serving their sentences i have griped about that but all the people down there that are worthy of the word truth tell me that the violations on the sandinista side are 10 to 1 but we would not get that out of some of the befuddled bishops networking nuns and trendy ministers and vicars to quote henry hyde on this house floor

year 1988 and 500 000 during fiscal year 1989 for cultural exchanges associated with the staging of goodwill games in seattlein 1990 the designee of this earmark is the seattle goodwill games

unitedstates information agencys oppose direct federal funding of the goodwill games second this money would be used to subsidize activities promoting a commercial enterprise created by ted turner turner launched these games last year in part as a means of generating advertising revenue for the turner broadcasting systems cable television empire with a projected federal deficit of more than 169 billion for next year or more than 61 billion over the grammrudman deficit target for 1988 we cannot afford even half a million dollars of unnecessary spending lets not forget that the department of defense barred the participation of army athletes in the 1986 goodwill games because they were a commercial endeavor additional we must note that organizers of the 1984 summer olympic games held in los angeles received no direct federal authorization this is a precedent we should not seek to reverse i think it is important to remind by colleagues that the goodwill games held in moscow did not achieve their objective of divorcing politics from international sporting events indeed the goodwill games were themselves political in nature seeking to advance one mans viewpoint about united statessoviet relations indeed the politicization of the 1986 goodwill games was distasteful to many americans who were shocked at mr turners acquiesence to the soviet governments demands that israeli and south korean athletes be barred from participation that action alone stripped away whatever veneer of international goodwill the games might have achieved i also wish to point out that these games are to be held in a city which is closed to soviet diplomats posted in the united states thus the games offer soviet intelligence operatives visiting seattle on exchanges associated with them a unique opportunity to gain access to a region chock full of sensitive high technology operations and military installations some may argue the funds earmarked in section 203 annually do not subsidize the games since they are targeted for cultural exchanges such as art exhibits and ballet performances which will be conducted in association with these games i strongly dispute this notion since any taxpayer money granted to the seattle organizing committee for these activities frees up other private ted turner funds for the games moreover these cultural exchanges should properly be viewed as advertising for the goodwill games these exchanges are certainly expected to heighten interest and increase attention for the games which should increase their viewing audience thus h 5262 cor they directly enhance the value of ted turners investment in those games and further promote his profitmaking enterprise such expenses should be shouldered by those who expect to turn a profit from themted turner and not by the american taxpayer the list of reasons why this earmarking of some 1 million in taxpayer money is inappropriate goes on and on but let me close with this one thought ted turners

which is if this bill were to be opened up and if we were to be considering new legislation in a new congress rather than the bill that already passed overwhelmingly he would feel constrained to take the legislation back to committee and begin the committee process that is a responsible position for new legislation in a new congress the problem is if that happens we will find many states running out of money and the nations highway program in great jeopardy not to mention the thousands if not hundreds of thousands of jobs which will be lost so our strategy simply is to pass this bill send it to the senate and get together to negotiate a compromise this member will undoubtedly be a member of that conference as i was in the last congress and i support a compromise on the 65mileanhour speed limit i support a compromise whereby we accept the 65mileanhour speed limit in exchange for seat belt laws in states and we give the states their state rights but the place to do that is not on this floor today the place to do that is in negotiation with the senate so i would urge my colleagues to support the rule and to support the previous question in closing make no mistake about it the crucial vote here today is the vote on the previous question if you vote against the previous question you are voting against an expeditious highway bill for our 50 states that is the test that is the crucial vote and i urge all my colleagues to vote in support of the previous question in support of this rule so that we can have this vital transportation program enacted on this floor today"],

california will be offering will be identical and we hope for consistency sake that those who consider themselves to be prolife in that they are opposed to abortion and the use of funding whether it be local or federal for the purpose of abortion will vote the same way the issue is also that we are talking in the districts use of its own money about abortion on demand we are not talking about exception to abortion on demand in fiscal year 1980 there were approximately 3 600 abortions which were financed and subsidized by the district we do have the power of the purse here we have the power to dictate some policy at least with regard to the federal enclave the district of columbia and i believe we ought to exercise it when such a momentous and important issue of abortion is involved when the lives of children are literally at stake i would hope the membership would stay consistent with last nights vote to recommit the bill with instructions it is my view that will get us to a bill

colleague mr obey a member of the committee on appropriations in opposing this amendment in fact the amendment to the amendment as well i do so soberly because i have agreed with my friend the minority leader in prior years when he moved for example to terminate revenue sharing because we did not have the money to pay for it we probably had not provided money in the budget or appropriations process for this very popular program i agreed with him in his approach to providing for drugs in the last session of congress i think it was patently inappropriate a violation of our trust to be up front with the american people to provide funds that were not there really to fight a problem we all took very seriously this is a different situation than we were in at the end of the last fiscal year mr obey has said it well we are messing around with an appropriations process that has not even had an opportunity to play itself out during the remainder of this fiscal year we are marking up a supplemental appropriations bill now there remains some 7 7 billion i believe in discretionary budget authority available that is not enough to satisfy all demands and we will have to make some choices in the next several months about how we are going to use that authority before the end of this fiscal year the last thing we need to do is to cause the appropriations committee to have no influence about how to allocate and apportion among our priorities as we make these decisions on the supplemental in addition there is no question that we have cut over the last 6 years some 300 billion in domestic spending out of essentially 12 of the 13 subcommittees of the house committee on appropriations everytlfing but defense to be clear we have in fact reduced our domestic budget from the congressional budget offices baseline in real terms well over 300 billion this amendment would simply force us to cut more this year out of discretionary appropriations that have declined as a percentage of the total budget by some 5 percent in the last 6 years without being able to sensitively do so without being able to set priorities on behalf of all the members it is obvious that this amendment is politically motivated it will not work more appropriately though we ought to be focusing on the job the appropriations committee will have over the next several months as i have indicated and that is not an easy one because we have already had requests that exceed the budget we have already been asked for funds by the administration by the committees the authorizing committees that really does make it impossible for us to remain within our budget amount but we cannot operate with our hands tied behind us as this amendment would require we cannot do a fair job of allocating resources if we have some automatic process working where the committee on appropriations does not have the opportunity even to comment on where we will get the funds to aid the homeless we have made the mistake of not providing enough for these people in the past we are about to rectify that mistake let us not agree to amendments that will totally gut this proposal and hold out a promise that we will not be able to keep i yield to my friend from minnesota mr venrol"], [0.34630608558654785, 0.15369391441345215, 0, "let me say to the gentleman from massarchusetts that i would like to reclaim my time i know that point was made but let me say that the gentleman from new york and i went down and looked at those things ourselves personally after that report was made we met with the icom representatives and i am here to report to the gentlemanand i know he would do the same with me that my conclusions are that icom procedures and data are much better than reported here the only advantage i see in this whole bill in one respect right now is that we probably get corroboration on that fact from an additional report and spend more time doing it the fact is that icom has indeed done its job and it is doing an excellent job let me make one concluding point some people say that we ought to pass this bill because of the issue of president duartes concern over the oconomic questions down there i think his concern is well taken and well met he is concerned about the fact that he might get a lot of people back from this country in a hurry because of the new immigration bill we passed last year the problem with that as it has been with the farmers in the west and in other places is that there is a lot of misunderstanding in the beginning and many people start to return the illegals here not understanding 4our law time is passing and it is showing that is not well founded and indeed i think at this point in time passions have cooled and we are not going to see that occur it is not a good basis for policy in this country to let people stay here for economic reasons we would have an awful lot more stay if that werethe case let me summarize and conclude in this fashion evd extended voluntary departure which we are talking about granting the isalvadorans and nicaraguans in this country now a suspension of their deportation pending a report being given is an unprecedented legislative step we have never done anything like this for any other country before it is something on which we have given some discretion to the attorney general if an amendment or a bill were out here and the alternative was as the gentleman from new york offered in committee to let us dosome kind of a strengthening of the july 28 987 attorney generals hand in this area that would be one thing but this is not a discretionary matter this is a legislative fiat it sends the wrong kind of message at the wrong time when we are not having human rights violations of any significance in el salvador it tells the world that we think there is a problem down there when there is none there we ought to be telling the world about how wonderful the domocracy is indeed progressing in el salvador it sends the wrong message about bringing people here and encouraging more to come to this country and i think that is a mistake i urge the members to vote no on this

law as well as the chairman of the subcommittee on courts civil liberties and the administration of justice for their efforts to make certain that this legislation not only passed through the committees but also reached the floor in time to pass during the 100th congress it is critical because what we deal with in this legislation is in effect whether or not individuals who are now incarcerated will receive the type of due process that the fifth amendment guarantees to citizens and noncitizens alike i think we all remember very vividly what occurred roughly 1 year ago it was an unprecedented situation because frankly we have never had to face the situation where this number of individuals will not be received back into a country when they are to be deported fidel castro as you recall refused to accept these individuals and as a result it placed our immigration system in an unprecedented crisis this bill addresses that in this respect i do not think it would be fair to this congress to criticize it for a law that was passed at a time that it would have been impossible to have foreseen these circumstances i do want to say for those individuals like myself who believe that individuals who pose a clear and present threat to society they ought not be released and ought to be deported that this legislation does not in any way change that what it does do is to assure that due process of law attaches in order to answer the question of whether or not they pose any type of threat to society and ought to be deported so it is in that vein that i say this is a remedial piece of legislation that protects both the rights of the individuals incarcerated as well as the rights of the citizens of the united states who may if they were to be released be jeopardized or threatened having said all that i would encourage my colleagues who value the constitution who value the principles of the fifth amendment to vote in favor of this important piece of legislation i reserve the balance of my time"]]}
