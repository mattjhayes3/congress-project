on the the home loan bank act was subject of this special order signed by president hoover ina turbulent time the campaign that would lead to roosevelts election was just getting underway the terror of economic dissolution was palpable indeed on the day hoover signed the bill the angry remnants of what had been 17 000 members of the bonus armys world war i veterans were camped in washington the house had passed the patman bonus bill less than a month before only to see it defeated in the senate most of the veterans left washington but on july 22 there were still about 2 000 angry and desperate veterans in washington only 6 days after signing the home loan bank act hoover ordered the army to remove the veterans by force in an infamous act troops led by douglas macarthur in whose train was dwight eisenhower evicted the bonus army and burned its camp that was the climate that existed when this country took its first halting steps toward a national housing policy franklin d roosevelt announced the new deal in his nomination acceptance speech less than a month before hoover signed the law creating the federal home loan bank system interestingly enough his new deal platform did not include specific reference to housing it was a program for economic reform designed to bring some order out of the chaos of banking and securities restore some confidence and encourage states to create what later became the social security system in mid1932 when the new deal speech was written the full magnitude of the great depression was still developing needless to say the home loan bank act could not by itself do what needed to be done to house the poor let alone make home ownership possible for the great majority who were at the time tenants less than 40 percent of americans owned their homes then and many who did lost them in the depression in the chaos of the depression it represented little more than a faint flicker of hope when franklin d roosevelt became president in march 1933 he faced utter chaos nothingnot farms not banks not industrieswas working cities and towns had run out of money to feed and clothe the growing army of desperate people thrown out of work and off their farms you must remember that at that time america was mostly rural in that disastrous time urgent action had to be taken and it was within 100 days an incredible amount of legislation was enacted to restore order and begin finding the way to recovery among those acts was a relief program for homeowners the home owners refinancing act signed june 13 1933 this emergency relief act was the second great step toward a national housing program the refinancing act created a corporation capitalized by 200 million to refinance the mortgages of hardpressed homeowners a few months later in april 1934 an additional 1 billion in capital went into the corporation it did more than refinance mortgages the corporation could advance money to pay back taxes and provide for repairs and maintenance these cash advances could be for as much as 50 percent of the appraised value of the loan the whole thing being secured by the value of the property the home owners loan corporation remained in business for only 4 years but in that time it had made loans covering more than 1 million mortgages and it produced a profit fifty years later with the country in a recession as deep as any seen since 1933 notwithstanding to the contrary what we heard a few minutes ago i offered a bill to provide emergency help to hardpressed homeowmers and we called it that the emergency homeowners assistance act in colorado for instance in the city of pueblo where the steel mill was shutting down the sole source of employment the foreclosure rate on homes was 100 a month at that time i took the floor and asked this house to approve the homeowners emergency assistance act the house did indeed pass it the one and the only what my minority members called a new program that has been approved by the house under the reagan administration that is since 1981 it languished in the senate and it died in the senate a senate that in 6 years never once even had so much as a hearing on housing needs or community development needs of our country the senate proposed to do nothing and my proposal did nothing radically more than essentially what we had seen and i had witnessed during the depression in the homeowners loan corporation in fact did the research work on that bill myself and with the able help of the staff and counsel we reshaped it in terms of modern needs all it would do would be the same thing make loans against home equity to prevent those homes from being foreclosed ironically not too long in fact less than a year and a half after that in my home town of san antonio when i walked the line of about 203 fellow americans destitute homeless waiting to make their entry into the homeless shelter that had been provided them by the city i talked to one young relatively young because i consider anybody under 40 very young homeless father of two who had lost his home in pueblo co and had we enacted that program that i had envisioned he would have been enabled to have been assisted and to have remained under the roof and the shelter of his home instead of having to park his wife and kids with his parents in another state and wander through the south thinking that perhaps in the south he could find employment and come to a city such as san antonio where indeed the need was just as great as the city that he left i have never been able to understand why this simple humane eminently workable ideawas so adamantly opposed by the administration why it was willing to let so many thousands of people needlessly suffer the loss of their homes when hundreds of thousands could have been helped at virtually no real cost or risk to the government why not extend help to people who are suffering economic disaster through no fault of their own as a result of forces they cannot control it made sense in 1933 and it should make sense today a little more than a year after the home owners loan corporation bill was signed the national housing act of 1934 became law this law was truly monumental it brought up the capital of the home owners loan corporation to 3 billion but more than that this was the law establishing the federal housing administration at this point i want to render tribute to a man who passed on just last month on august 9 the great leon keyserling and i want to render testimony that it was his architectural hand his designing hand that devised the basic 1934 and 1937 national housing act and whose friendship and counsel i never dreamed i would be able to enjoy years later after those miserable dim days that i recall vividly because i am a depression kid and i was in school at the time and would enjoy his great wisdom and would have shared his last supper literally because he died 4 days after i had enjoyed an invitation to supper at his home here in washington leon keyserling actually is a man that i hope we can memorialize in a more lasting and meaningful way when the time comes but his real monument has been etched into these great acts of humanitarian legislation for he was the architect and the counsel and lawyer that devised and structured the basic fundamental framework of reference for this noteworthy legislation the fha became the engine of housing and home ownership as a matter of fact the miracle of the world in the 20th century was performed here in america because between 1940 and 1980 we reversed where a minority of american families owned their homes to a percentage increase of the overwhelming majority by 1980 the sad thing is that since 1980 we have had an increase in the emergence of this phenomena of modernday homelessness which is in epidemic proportions and for which this congress has passed emergency legislation just this year and all because there is cause and effect you cannot turn back on the basic commitment to housing and the allocation of national credit for construction of affordable housing affordable to the main mass and stream of our families today the average cost of a new singlefamily dwelling unit in the united states is over 175 000 that means that we have priced out all but 6 percent of americans from the dream of owning a brandnew singlefamily dwelling unit for their loved ones it was the fha through its system of mortgage insurance that made home loans a low risk proposition and made it possible for lenders to extend the longterm fixed rate mortgage that was the cornerstone the inspiration and the motivation of mass home ownership in this country under fha tens of millions of people have obtained home loans it has turned a profit its property standards insured a consistent quality of housing and its operations remain at the heart of home ownership in this country today since the national housing act of 1934 home ownership has become the rule not the exception no longer do twothirds of americans rent though we are in a period of regression and headed back to that twothirds live in their own homes thanks to these programs through fha the affordable mortgage became a reality and with it the affordable home the sensation of 1937 was president roosevelts famous fight to transform the supreme court by increasing the number of justices that is the old supreme court vehemently opposed packing charges the president was accused of trying to pack the supreme court in order to have a patsy supreme court which would give him the opportunity to pack the court with justices he believed would not overturn as the conservative court had his industrial recovery act the court fight made the bork case seem utterly tame it mesmerized the country from february to july but the great court fight was not all that was going on that year on september 1 the capstone national housing act of 1937 became law by 1937 the banking system was stable there was deposit insurance the refinancing programs for homes and farms had stemmed loan losses and the home loan bank system was in place the fha had begun its work what remained was to deal with slum clearance and to try and provide decent housing to the millions who could in no way afford to pay market rents the 1937 housing act created the unitedstates housing authority which was empbwered to make 60year loans to local housing agencies the local agencies had to put up 10 percent of the cost of clearing slums and erecting housing projects the authority had the power to grant operating subsidies so that rents could be geared to the incomes of poor families that basic mechanism remains in place to this very day what an honor to be able to rise at the end of this month to memorialize the congress on the fact that on the first day of this month exactly 50 years ago in this month of september the 1937 basic housing act was approved that in that day and time the congresses and their presidents did in fact have faith and confidence in the average american family in the faith that with just a bit of help it could be tided over in dire circumstances over which it had no control that not only would those loans made then under those conditions be repaid but that they would earn a profit to the treasury of the united states as indeed those programs did within a few years slum clearance could be seen and felt within 4 years the unitedstates housing authority had helped create 511 new housing projects for lowincome families with more than 161 000 units in the 50 years since enactment of the landmark 1937 housing act this government has expanded the assisted housing stock to some 4 million units about half of which are publicly owned today we still have in place in being and in operation the same basic housing tools that were created during the cataclysmic years between mid 1932 and mid1937 those tools were revolutionary in their concept and in their effect before this nation set out on what became a bipartisan commitment to a comprehensive housing policy a full third of our people lived in poor sometimes inhuman conditions today the proportion of people in substandard housing is perhaps 10 percent this reflects a monumental achievement and yet the need should not be that great its 5 percent more than 1980 nor would the need remain so great had not the present administration elected to withdraw from housing as far as it could in 1982 the administration even tried to eliminate mortgage insurance for most people it has managed to virtually stop construction of publicly owned housing units it has managed to prevent enactment of an emergency homeowners assistance program but it has failed to kill housing it has failed to stop enactment of this nations first effective emergency shelter program for homeless people and it has failed to prevent members of its party from joining in this years effort to reassert and begin to revitalize the comprehensive housing program that came into being with the housing act of 1937 the nations commitment to a decent and affordable home for every citizen has been fiercely advocated and honestly administered by a small dedicated extremely proficient corps of public servantsvisionaries and practical administrators innovators and financiers regulators and politicians it has worked it works still and after 50 years the dream is as alive as ever after 50 years we still have not reached the goal of a decent safe and affordable home for

killed in the lamblance plaza cpllapse in bridgeport ct in april of last year twentyeight construction workers lost their lives when the partially built 13story apartment complex toppled to the ground this catastrophe was the worst human toll from a construction accident in a decade the legislation establishes a trust fund from the record 5 1 million in fines levied by the occupational safety and health administration against the contractors and subcontractors that engaged in sloppy construction and engineering practices and wantonly disregarded worker safety if the government successfully collects the 5 1 million in fines there may be little left to compensate the victims families the purpose of our bill is to ensure that the victims claims come first once the civil suits have been settled the remaining monies in the trust fund if any will be paid to the secretary of labor to be deposited into the treasury the fund will be administered by the unitedstates district court the government must share in the responsibility for the tragedy after listening to extensive testimony at five congressional hearings it is clear osha has failed to properly carry out its mandate to protect workers health and safety in several important areas of responsibility today i would like to share my impressions of osha and the way it has handled events surrounding the lambiance plaza collapse first it is imperative that osha review and change its reporting requirements current osha regulations stipulate that a construction accident must be reported only when a fatality or five or more hospitalizations occur i find it incomprehensible that an accident of the magnitude of lambiance would have gone unreported if fewer than five people were hospitalized or no life was lost oshas investigation into the lambiance collapse revealed a near disaster involving the same liftslab contractor at the metro center construction site in stamford ct 1 year earlier this accident should have served as a warning of impending tragedy but it was never reported because osha had no requirement that it be reported the metro center accident occurred when a shearhead failure caused part of a concrete floor to sag some 15 inches in an accident nearly identical to the lambiance incident not only was the same contractor involved in both accidents but the same faulty building techniques and practices were responsible osha officials expressed astonishment that more devastating damage did not take place at the mero center site it is clear an accident of this severity warranted a thorough investigation even though no lives were lost and only one worker wav injured had osha officials been notified of what happened at metro center they could have taken steps to prevent the tragedy at lambiance second from the testimony i heard from representatives of labor and the construction industry it is obvious that osha is severely understaffed and underfunded in the state of connecticut there are ten osha inspectors however of those 10 only 2 specialize in construction given the inherent hazards in the construction industry i find this statistic unacceptable regrettably osha officials testified before the health and safety subcommittee that they have all the resources they need third besides requiring more resources osha may need to reorganize itself at the very least a separate division should be established within osha solely to monitor and regulate the construction industry given the unique dangers of this industry it may even be advisable to create an ent ely new agency under the department of labor finally the assessment of high financial penalties such as the record 5 1 million in the lambiance plaza disaster cries out for criminal sanctions as well employers who knowingly violate safety codes should be held accountable for their actions for too long individuals within a corporation have been allowed to hide behind their corporate shield the company is fined the major decision makers within the company walk away scotfree it seems so obvious to me that an employer who knowingly disregards safety regulations resulting in the serious injury or death of an employee should be subject to criminal prosecution murder in the workplace cannot be tolerated recently osha referred the lambiance case to the department of justice for criminal prosecution the justice department must now decide whether to prosecute twentyeight workers lost their lives fines were imposed and yet no one has been prosecuted but even if individuals are prosecuted under current law the penalties can only be a maximum of 10 000 and 6 months in jail according to testimony before the employment and housing subcommittee osha has referred only 38 cases since its inception in 1970 for criminal prosecution of those 38 cases the justice department has pursued 14 this record is pathetic it is my understanding no one has spent 1 day in jail for violating federal osha law because of this dismal record states such as new york illinois and california have had the take the initiative in cases where osha has imposed a minimal monetary fine for a serious violation of safety codes state prosecutors have successfully pursued homicide convictions regrettably state prosecutors have recently pursued cases and won criminal convictions only to have them challenged on the grounds that feder al law preempts state law osha should immediately clarify the right of state prosecutors to impose criminal sanctions against employers who knowingly and recklessly disregard worker safety if necessary it should recommend to congress that the law be amended to make absolutely clear that the federal statute does not preempt the states in addition we must have a tougher and more aggressive federal statute the penalties are simply not strong enough it has been more than a year since the lamblance collapse tragically we have seen little movement to change any of the factors that contributed to the accident osha has not reviewed or modified its reporting requirements osha is undermanned and underfunded yet it has not requested additional resources osha has made no effort to establish a separate divislon to oversee construction in spite oi the unique dangers of the industry osha refuses to recommend any legislative or regulatory charges imposing tougher criminal sanctions or addressing the preemption issue twentyeight people lost their lives the victims families must not only live with the loss of their loved ones but also with the reality that their government has not responded to their tragedy the legislation we introduced yesterday will not correct the shortcomings of osha but it will ensure that the victims families be afforded every opportunity for a just and fair financial settlement 1630"], [0.8904391527175903, 0.8904391527175903, 0, "i want to assure the gentleman that the aspect of the national technical

going to accomplish this extended voluntary departure perhaps some facts might be of interest to the members el salvador is the second most densely populated country in the world behind india and the most densely populated nation in our western hemisphere forty percent of its population is unemployed 60 percent is under the age of 19 these factors obviously contribute to the desire to leave in fact in a spanish international network poll conducted of the people who were voting in elections in el salvador a couple of years agoobviously people who had a commitment to their country because they were willing to go ahead and vote even though under penalty of death by the rebels at that time67 percent of them responded that if given the opportunity they would naturally emigrate to the united states it had nothing to do with fear of persecution but had to do with the great economic opportunity here in the united states perhaps the most important point is this one el salvador has been the second largest source of illegal immigration to the united states for more than 30 years let me repeat that el salvador has been the second largest country to send us illegal aliens for over 30 years that was before mr duarte before the communist insurrection that was before what some people are talking about now as the cause for these illegal immigrants being here historically it is ranked behind only mexico in terms of illegal aliens apprehended in the united states the question is do you create a situation where you grant extended voluntary departure to a ountry which is the second largest source dfillegal immigration into the ultniea states if you do that what precedent do you set for the rest of the world if these salvadorans were primarily motivated to leave their country because of fears of persecution why is it that they pass through two or three safehaven countries on the way to the united states if the reason for leaving el salvador primarily is fear for ones safety why do you go through two or three other countries that grant you safe haven to go to the united states if you actually fear for your own safety and that is why you are leaving why do you not stop at the next country that grants you safe haven why do you continue going on to the united states probably for the same reason salvadorans have been leaving their country for over 30 years you have greater economic opportunity in the united states it is natural if i were born in el salvador i would come north so that i could give my children a better opportunity in their lives irrespective of what the situation happened to be concerning violence in that country as a matter of fact if if came to the united states there are probably some areas in the united states i would avoid does anybody realize we had 20 000 murders in the united states last year under the basis for this bill there are probably some areas of the united states that we would declare unsafe and would allow people to come from as refugees there are certain inner cities of these united states in terms of violence which are every bit as bad as the worst places of el salvador last i would say this this bill simply flies in the face of the adoption of the refugee act and of the immigration bill we passed just last year many of us were on the floor imploring the house to support the immigration bill we asked the members to vote for a legalization program so that we could somehow do justice to the people who are here and also settle on a realistic and enforceable immigration law here we are less than a year after that bill has gone into effect on a countryspecific basis making an exception we are saying that the exception is based on the question of violence but extending it not to just those people who have a fear of persecution but any savadoran who happens to be here including all of those who got here prior to the problems that were occurring that they referred to in this particular

felt then that there ought to be a continuing law that prevailed we are going against that with this legislation this is specialinterest legislation it blows up what we did last year with the immigration bill it blows up what we did with the refugee act of 1980 it opens the door to ad hoc legislation in the future to whichever group comes forward and says we have a specific need that is

united states ninetyfive percent of the work that it does is understood to be critical to our national security and in fact enjoys bipartisan support which is reflected in this bill i would also like to take a moment to add my words of admiration and commendation to our distinguished chairman i have had the privilege of serving on this committee now for 4 years one of the great benefits in doing so among many has been in serving under two very distinguished chairmen the gentleman from indiana mr hamiltoni and the gentleman from ohio these gentlemen are among the very best that public service has to offer not only in this congress but in the country it is a real joy and an education to serve with them and to learn from them and in some small way to contribute with them to the work of this committee which is so important to the congress and to the country i also want to comment the ranking member the gentleman from illinois with whom i sometimes disagree on a small fraction of issues but for whom i have great admiration as well"], [0.0002498030662536621, 0.5002498030662537, 0, "i have a number of amendments at the desk i ask unanimous consent that they be considered en bloc and

reauthorize the older americans act of 1965 this bill has been carefully nurtured and has grown considerably since that time and today we deliver to the house the final product of several months of labor h r 1451 has received a great deal of attention this year and it has traveled extensively since its conception it has been to montpelier vt flint mi and algona ia where testimony was heard on its development additionally dozens of experts appeared in washington to offer suggestions and advise on the proper formation of this legislation the primary subject of all of this scrutiny is the older americans act of 1965 the fundamental structure of this act survived these months of inspection intact and the underlying framework of the act has emerged undamaged in the conference report we have before us the popular and effective congregate and homedelivered meals programs will continue to serve millions of elderly nationwide supportive services will continue to be provided and senior centers will continue to receive funding upon enactment of this conference report as the ranking republican on the subcommittee which considered this legislation i support this conference report iowas over65 population currently represents 14 3 percent of the states population which places it third among all states in its percentage of elderly residents in the over75 age group iowa has an exceptionally high number of citizens there are 128 000 iowans between the ages of 75 and 84 and an additional 45 000 iowans over the age of 85 iowa in fact leads the nation in the percent of its population age 85 and over i am particularly concerned about the ability of the older americans act programs to meet the needs of these older individuals i am especially supportive therefore of the provision in this conference report which expands inhome services to the frail elderly i believe this provision appropriately emphasizes and directs funds to this highly vulnerable population many of the frail elderly would be forced into longterm care institutions if it werent for the assistance they receive under the older americans act enabling these individuals to remain independent in their own homes is therefore not only humane but very costeffective unfortunately the act has also gained somenew wrinkles as a result of this reauthorization that are not as attractive the act will carry some added weight and potential expense over the next 4 years that may not be effective although wellintentioned i am concerned that some of these changes and additions will overburden the aging network and unnecessarily limit the flexibility of the network to meet local needs nine months ago i noted that the older americans act network will be faced with new challenges and greater demands in the 1990s and beyond the number of elderly in this country is increasing rapidly traditional caregivers are becoming scarce and the elderly population is becoming more and more diverse moreover as the baby boom ages a larger and larger percentage of our population will be old services provided through the older americans act must be able to adapt to meet these dramatic demographic changesthe socalled graying of america rather than taking a comprehensive approach to these challenges however this conference report offers a piecemeal solution to a wide variety of needs this report includes a total of 18 separately authorized individual programs doubling the number of programs authorized in the act prior to this reauthorization this is not a constructive way to legislate nor is it an effective way to distribute funds i am concerned that we have not only fragmented the funding for older americans act services in this legislation but that in the process we have also diluted the mission of the agencies that carry out these programs i believe that this dilution of mission may severely hamper the effectiveness of and weaken support for the older americans act thus while i support this conference report i caution those who will carry out its mandates to be wary of overextending their resources and diluting their mission to the detriment of older individuals this conference report is not a perfect document but it will ensure the continuation of important services to our nations elderly the older americans act provides nutrition and support services that are an integral part of the daily routine of millions of elderly americans i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this conference report and the vital services that it represents"],

outstanding leadership of joe paterno players have not only succeeded on the field but most importantly they have also succeeded in the classroom clearly this is the best of what college athletics has to offer unfortunately the situation at penn state is not universally shared in far too many instances our colleges and universities have become training grounds for professional teams instead of institutions for higher education despite the outcry for reform the ncaa the primary governing body for intercollegiate sports continues to ignore the education problem this will be evident later this week when the ncaa holds its convention and once again adjourns without passing substantive reform measures a recent editorial in sports illustrated suggested renaming the presidents commission the panel of university presidents formed to correct the many abuses in intercollegiate athletics to presidents omission as a result of this continued inaction i am reintroducing the college athlete education and reform act this urgentlyneeded legislation will require universities to either graduate their scholarship athletes or forfeit federal tax preferences while the ncaa may feel no need to take any corrective action i dont see why the federal government should continue to play a role in the exploitation of athletes under my bill 75 percent of student athletes with athletic scholarships for 3 or more years would be required to graduate in a maximum of 5 years failure to meet this goal would result in the removal of tax deduction status for contributions ot an institutions athletic department under current law an individual can deduct contributions to an athletic department because they supposedly are used to advance education it was not surprising that the ncaa did not support this legislation in the last congress however i was shocked that it referred to erroneous studies which concluded that athletes and nonathletes graduate at comparable rates at my request the general accounting office reviewed these studies and found that they were terribly flawed either the ncaa intentionally mislead the public by referring to the studies or they are ignorant of the scope of the problem some criticized my bill by saying that the federal government should not get involved in this issue i suppose they feel government involvement is acceptable when it subsidizes"],

about the block grant project ms tonelli said i know there have been some block grant funds given through the provision to mental health under the mckinney act and they have been very helpful i think probably that approach will work because they are at the level where they know the money is needed so i certainly support that ms cancilla from northwestern pennsylvania said i definitely support the block grant approach so long as it is the result of a shared consensus of people who are involved in the service in a particular community to decide where funds should be disbursed mr leary said i would also support the block grant approach in the competitive programs under the mekinney act especially a few large programs if any are receiving funding like i mentioned earlier we have 27 transitional programs in minnesota and only one of the agencies was able to access that money mr suko said i think the block grant approach is a very useful way of focusing attention on coordinating all the services we had bearings we recognized there was a problem so we invited service providers in they said to us as you are looking through the housing portion of the homeless bill why dont you give the block grant approach a try we think it would be a better more useful tool to coordinate our approach toward dealing with the real needs of these people who are affected by the plight of homelessness i also asked the council of state community affairs agencies state agencies which deal with the problem of homelessness they wrote a very supportive letter which i might just quote the block grant concept nonetheless is viewed as the simplest and most effective 1 6224 way of overcoming the weaknesses and inefficiencies of the mckinney act ilousing progam and maximizing the efficacy of those programs the national association of counties remarked similarly restructuring the mckinney act to provide housing and other services to the homeless through block grants simply makes more sense with block grants there is more local flexibility the facilities setting priorities and developing a comprehensive stra gy to meet the needs of the homeless i might say we also received a letter in support from the national assoriation of state mental health prcgram directors finally the national league of cities which i will quote the national ljague of cities has long supported leg4 lative efforts that would enhance the ability of local governmnnts to exercise the maximum amount of flxibilty in addressing local concerns given the growing complexity and diverse service demands of the homeless crisis it is vitally important that local officials have the p bility to utilize federal financial assistance in a manner that is best suited to their unique community requirements so i would urge my colleagues to take a very very careful and studied look at the approach that the gentlewoman and i are offering n the form of this amendment a categorical approach benefits those organizations and communities that have good grantsmen not necessarily the most homeless we do not think having a qualified grantsinan is necessarily the most appropriate and most effective way of meeting the needs of the homeless it is better for local service providers and the homeless to target the money through the cdbg program lets take the money from these three programs and put it in a block grant lets distribute these moneys as we distribute moneys through the community development block grant program eighty percent would go to entitlement communities twenty percent to the states i would just encourage the members to examine this amendment carefully because i think it has considerable merit certainly there is more efficiency and a lot more flexibility here the decsionmakers who are most knowledgeable about the needs of the homeless in their communities make the decisions we trust our local officials the homeless are better served when service providers get together to avoid duplication and to provide a very comprehensive approach to their problems the amendment distributes the funds to states cities and urban communities through the well respected and understood cdbg program formula we must remember that this has the added feature of allowing the grantees to channel that money to the nonprofit providers it permits allocation of funds to communities with the greatest need we think there is also another very important element and that is predictability in this way these communities that are making a very aggressive effort to meet the needs of the homeless will have a predictable source of funding on which they can base not only an annual program but a program projected in the future to help the homeless if you truly want to help the homeless if you are really concerned about the men and women and families that are out on the streetand i think we are all concerned about themplease support the block grant approach i think it is a much more effective
