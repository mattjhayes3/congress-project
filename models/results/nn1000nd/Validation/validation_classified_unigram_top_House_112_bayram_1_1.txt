leadership is bringing before the house today is reckless thoughtless and heartless and most disturbingly its a jobs killer i believe that the best way to reduce our deficit and longterm debt is to grow our economy to help businesses create jobs at a time when our economy is emerging from the worst recession in our lifetimes when millions of americans are out of work and millions more are struggling to make ends meet this continuing resolution takes exactly the wrong approach instead of making needed investments in education medical research infrastructure and other priorities this bill takes a meat axe to them instead of strengthening the middle class on main street this bill gives sweetheart deals for wall street instead of investing in our workers it protects special interest subsidies for big oil companies and hedge fund managers a few weeks ago on this floor republicans told us that veterans programs education child nutrition and health care research would be protected it is clear now that those were empty promises for veterans the bill eliminates a program that offers housing vouchers for homeless veterans in education the bill decimates the pell grant program by reducing the maximum award by 800 and by cutting another 4 9 billion from other education programs for child nutrition the bill cuts 750 million from the women infants and childrens program and the bill slashes 2 5 billion from the national institutes of health jeopardizing important research into diseases like cancer and alzheimers and diabetes it destroys the land and water conservation fund a commonsense program to preserve and protect our natural resources and outdoor recreational space helping local economies grow when we brought up the prospect of these cuts a few weeks ago we were accused of demonizing the debate now that we have seen the numbers before us i am sad to say it is worse than any of us could have predicted i find the cuts in education funding to be particularly troublesome as president obama made clear in his state of the union we must invest in our children if we are to compete in the 21st century economy in order to maintain our economic standing in order to create the jobs of the future in order to compete against china we must have a welleducated workforce so why on earth would we slash pell grants which help millions of families 12 000 in my district alone pay for college we shouldnt this bill will also decimate important lifesaving food aid programs to feed hungry children and refugees it would literally take the food out of the mouths of some of the most vulnerable people around the world retreating from the global war against extreme poverty and hunger will undermine not just our moral authority but our national security as well i also want to point out that this bill continues the same misguided policy under republican and democratic presidents alike that borrows hundreds of billions of dollars to pay for the wars in iraq and afghanistan if we are truly serious about reducing the deficit then those wars need to be ended or paid for along with my colleagues like walter jones and others im going to continue to talk about this issue these wars are bankrupting us and we need to have a meaningful thorough debate about them so again i believe this continuing resolution contains exactly the wrong prescription for our nation we should be focusing on creating jobs and growing our economy instead this republican bill would lead to more unemployment more unfairness and more hardship with the american people i urge my

across the aisle i was struck by the fact that he didnt actually mention any possible regulations that could do that i also would like to point out that our hands as congress are not tied this bill ties the hands of regulators if he is able to come up with a good idea to lower fuel prices he can bring it to congress we can pass it the senate can pass it and the president can sign it just the way the founding fathers intended just to be clear i also want to point out that nothing in h r 4078 prevents the administration from taking any number of actions that would increase the supply of domestic oil and gas and lower the price of gasoline at the pump the passage of this amendment however would do nothing to lower the price at the pump now i realize this amendment seems to preserve the option to impose price controls thats the only thing i could think of that it could do we learned back in the 1970s that price control does nothing but lead to shortage and lines at the gasoline pump theres absolutely no reason we need to return to the failed policies of the carter administration now if the current administration were truly interested in providing relief at the pump there are any number of actions they could do to increase the supply of oil and gasoline and lower the price at the pump but the obama administrations done little to tap into vast domestic resources that would increase the supply of american oil rather under president obama permitting and leasing on federal land is actually down alas the president has also vetoed or is opposed to the keystone pipeline which would have connected not only canadian oil to refineries in the south but would have also have connected the new finds in north dakota in the bakken shale sands canadian sands production is expected to double to 3 million barrels a day between 2010 and 2020 and domestic oil production will increase by as much as 20 percent the lack of a keystone xllike pipeline means slower less reliable and less safe forms of transportation that will continue to necessitate transporting domestic oil from north dakota by much more expensive and much less safe means of truck and rail rather than pipelines lowering the cost of that transportation would lower the cost of that crude oil and would lower the cost of gasoline at the pump as a matter of fact a barrel of north dakota sweet sells for 62 thats lower than the international price of oil predominantly because of the additional transportation costs necessary to bring it down to be refined in the refineries that are currently set up in this country if this bakken oil were made available to the rest of the country we would see an economic boom we would see lower prices for gasoline at the pump we would see more jobs in america the east coast in particular needs this oil and this gas made available to bring costs down bakken may lead to some price relief there but it will also open canadian oil we talk about energy independence but realistically north america is the energy unit that we should be looking at for providing our source as we tap resources throughout the united states canada and mexico we are going to be able to become energy independent much more rapidly than anyone ever thought as these new technologies develop to let us reach oil and gas deposits that we never even 10 years ago thought was possible i was talking to a geologist just recently when i attended a field hearing in north dakota and he told me when he was in school they always considered shale to be the source and would never be able to tap it but technology has proved that wrong and in fact even with our current technology were only getting a small percentage of the actual oil trapped in that shale im confident that as our technology develops that is going to become more and more available and this is going to take care of it but what we know is whats running up the price of oil and gas is excessive government regulation and if we can put a hold on government regulation so our businesses can know what they have to do to comply with those regulations and not have the goalposts moved in the middle of the game well have new refining infrastructure built well have new factories built well have new jobs created and we will get to an unemployment rate of 6 percent a whole lot faster i think than anybody is predicting this

they need relief it is important to point out in this context that when president obama took office gas prices were at about 1 85 per gallon now that they are up to about 3 75 per gallon we can see a steady increase over this 38month period of time of his presidency so far gasoline prices have risen an average of about 5 cents per gallon per month this is staggering when we think about the fact

gasoline in the united states that simply is not true and it cannot be true with oil being the input ingredient into gasoline it is the precursor for gasoline anytime we do anything that cuts off or restricts or limits the supply that is necessarily going to have an impact on the price and it does the fact that it is indisputable that there are other factors which also influence the price of gasoline makes it no less true that we have to produce petroleum at home in addition to buying it from other places in order to keep gasoline prices at reasonable levels we have to produce more there are some things we can do in order to help improve that trend for example we could open anwr for drilling we could open our countrys vast federal public lands to development of oil shale it is a

estimated the cost of a potential release of foot and mouth disease at 9 billion to 50 billion while it is correct that earlier this year dhs indicated this risk had been mitigated with additional design features the national academy of sciences is still revising the revised risk assessment common sense requires that until the revised risk assessment is complete we should not be entertaining the idea of appropriating precious taxpayer dollars for construction of this project nbaf has also become a financial boondoggle the estimated cost of construction has skyrocketed from an original estimate of 451 million only a few years ago to well over 1 billion today at this time it is a colossal risk to the american taxpayer to advance a project the cost of which has doubled in less than 5 years and when funding for fiscal years 2011 and 2012 remain unobligated at a time when my republican colleagues continually argue that our nations debt is out of control and the deficit must be reined in it is both hypocritical and unwise to spend taxpayer dollars that the president has not requested for a project that is still under design review to be placed in a region that is acutely sensitive to the horrible diseases that will be studied at the facility the only logical responsible thing to do while the many questions surrounding nbaf remain unanswered is to wait to invest taxpayers hardearned money and continue to utilize existing dhs assets to study the various animal diseases that face our agricultural community funding for the construction of nbaf is tantamount to a 75 million earmark for the kansas delegation funds were not included in the presidents budget and the project has yet to spend the money that has already been appropriated dhs has other important

33 years in college coaching ranks at his retirement gary williams ranked as the fifth winningest college basketball coach in america with 668 wins stretching over his remarkable career he is also the third winningest coach in atlantic coast conference history behind two legends dean smith and mike krzyzewski gary williams inherited a struggling program and turned it into a perennial national contender under his guidance the terrapins reached the ncaa tournament 14 times 11 times consecutively won three acc regular season titles and an acc tournament championship made seven sweet sixteens two elite eights two final fours and in a memory that all terrapins still treasure and i had the opportunity of attending in atlanta won the national championship in 2002 coach williams was honored as

when they are multilateralthe more multilateral the better we are particularly strong in such matters when we and our friends and allies in the european union stand shoulder to shoulder thats why europes seemingly inexplicable refusal to classify hezbollah as a terrorist group has been so disappointing over the years hezbollah is a charter member of the foreign terrorist organizations list in the united states its crimes are legion spread over many continents and far too numerous to list here they begin in the early 1980s with deadly bombings of the unitedstates embassy and the unitedstates marine and french army barracks in beirut and they have continued up to the present day i still remember ronald reagan president reagan talking about it after so many of our marines were murdered in lebanon let me mention just a few of the other lowlights countless kidnappings of americans and europeans in the 1980s and 1990s the khobar towers attack that killed 19 americans in 1996 the 1992 bombing of the israeli embassy and the 1994 bombing of the jewish community center in buenos aires again with multiple killings the murders of americans in iraq and the training of other iraqi militants and countless assassinations in lebanon including most likely that of former prime minister rafik hariri in 2005 in 2006 hezbollahs unprovoked murder of three israeli soldiers caused a war during which hezbollah rocketed civilian targets in lebanon and used lebanese civilian as human shields over the past 2 years it has staged attacks from turkey to thailand today it has forces in syria fighting on behalf of assad and the murderous assad regime and helping to train assads thugs in addition this year hezbollah twice has been directly implicated in terrorism on european union territoryin bulgaria where a suicide bomber killed five israeli tourists and a bulgarian and in cyprus where an apparent hezbollah terrorist attack was thwarted the failure of most european nations to designate hezbollah has been based on the flimsiest of reasons namely that hezbollah provides social services to the shiite community and participates in electoral politics in lebanon in fact hezbollah takes a very novel approach to electoral politicsusing a militia to intimidate voters into voting for them by the way its a lesson that hamas has learned very very well but europes failure to designate hezbollah as a terrorist group is not merely a problem because it accords legitimacy to a terrorist organization rather it has important operational consequences as well the failure to designate makes it more difficult to prosecute cases against hezbollah crimes committed in europe it allows hezbollah to use eu territories to fundraise recruit new members propagandize and train and thus the freedom hezbollah enjoys in europe ultimately affects noneuropeans as well the european union obviously will make its own decisions on this matter but its hard to escape the conclusion that the eus failure to designate hezbollah undermines both europes security and ours as well the state departments top counterterrorism official recently said that hes cautiously optimisticat lastabout the prospects for an eu designation of the group i hope his optimism is justified until it is borne out with an actual terrorist designation however it is important that we join the senate in going on

here is an interesting story just 2 weeks after texans in randall county voted for republican barry goldwater over their native son lyndon johnson in the presidential race in the 1960s the pentagon announced randall countys air force base was closing folks were flabbergasted said an amarillo newspaper columnist the air force had just made millions in investments at the base but now airmen and equipment were moving to a nearby county that supported johnson it was this kind of abuse of executive power that led congress to write a new law ensuring we had proper oversight over base closures in my pennsylvanias 18th congressional district were finding out why that law must be strengthened last week i learned the air force is again attempting to shut down the 911th airlift wing an air force reserve base for a reason that has nothing do with cost or military strategy in fact the 911th is one of the most lean and costeffective bases in the country how and why they can do this without congressional approval is interesting the air force claims inaccurately there are fewer than 300 civilian employees authorized to be employed at the 911th allowing the pentagon to close the base without congressional review the pentagon however has invested over 50 million in improvements in the base including new buildings in the last 5 years the 911th however has lower overhead costs because emergency responses like fire and safety air traffic control security runway maintenance and land are provided by pittsburgh international airport for free hence if the 911th were forced to insource those activities the number of authorized personnel would be hundreds more and would far exceed the 300person threshold thus the pentagon would be prevented from unilaterally closing it further the air force reserve would have to invest millions more in equipment and training if it was not provided for free but the air force did not look at any of these numbers and they did not review the cost of the space the pentagon is trying to close the base because they can not because they should in their haste to come up with a quick cut it will cost the taxpayers over 100 million in coming years and that is why congress needs to have oversight the house has passed a defense bill to prevent a suboptimal decision like this one in the future the house bill includes language requiring the pentagon to notify congress about any base closure or transfer of troops impacting more than 1 000 uniform personnel unlike the way the air force is operating now the defense department would have to include a justification for the reduction an evaluation of the costs and benefits and an evaluation of the local economic environmental strategic and operational consequences by requiring significant reductions in uniform personnel to be included in the budget request congress will have two opportunities to review block or approve a base closure in the annual defense authorization bill and the defense appropriations bill the senate is nearing completion of its version of the defense bill today and its my hope that both chambers will work to restore congress proper oversight authority the issue facing congress is not a new one since the 1960s the executive branch has tried repeatedly to close bases for reasons other than the best interests of taxpayers or the military the necessity of a strong base closure law giving congress oversight of these decisions was perhaps best expressed in 1985 by senator carl levin he said these protections against untrammeled executive power to close bases came because members of this senate and this congress felt that the power to close bases had been abused and had been used as a club over members of congress today it is

a result the gao has placed this issue on its high risk list unneeded and underutilized buildings are languishing in the federal inventory when their sale could generate muchneeded revenue for the

congress four separate pieces of legislation have been introduced to help solve the problem h r 665 combines the best elements of these legislative proposals and creates a timely and workable method

permits congress to appropriate the equivalent of two 2 percent of the proceeds from the sale of these properties to fund grants to eligible organizations that serve the homeless this requirement preserves our commitment to the goals of the mckinney vento homeless assistance act this bill will also expand transparency surrounding the disposal of federal property it requires that gsa report

established by gsa agencies will also be allowed to retain the net proceeds from the disposition of real property and use those funds to maintain repair and dispose of their other properties net proceeds not used for such costs would be used for deficit reduction this provision will incentivize agencies to move properties quickly through the disposal process and will keep revenues moving into

majority my good friend on the other side that represents that they are interested in adhering to the constitution and i dont know why they have not studied the supreme court decision in massachusetts versus epa that clearly indicates even though this was motor vehicle emissions that they were talking about but it held that greenhouse gases widely viewed as contributing to climate change constitute air pollutants and therefore that phrase as utilized under the clean air act and the epa has jurisdiction to regulate under the clean air act i assume what we are doing is trying to bash a longstanding process rather than coming up with better ideas i think my amendment brings about a better idea because energy is a national security issue and what my amendment poses to do is to ask serious questions about the impact of eliminating the epa authority finding a way to work through this question what would be the longterm impact because the legislation that is now written by my friends on the other side of the aisle is telling the united states of america in conflict with the united states supreme court decisionand let me just hold up a visual the constitution which is what this majority says that they are basing their whole legislative agenda on well we have constitutional authority and they are now telling us that we should not regulate water vapor carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide sulfur hexafluoride hydrofluorocarbons perfluorocarbons and any other substance i dont hear a scream and cry of the industry i do hear the idea that there are burdens that will come upon the industry that we should address so the amendment that i have that i am asking for real consideration on the basis of a national security question how will we provide for resources that will provide for the engine economy of this nation the longterm impact of the environmental protection agency having no authority to regulate emissions of greenhouse gases also if there are alternatives to ensure compliance with the clean air act if you have a better alternative and best practices with respect to greenhouse gas regulation under the clean air act which the supreme court decision clearly dictates that it has the authority to regulate it but we need to collaborate and cooperate and understand how we balance the needs of an energy policy might i also say that energy recognizes all forms of energy and energy companies that are in oil and gas are looking at alternatives they have whole sections that are addressing the question of alternative fuels why are we raising a bill that has no sense of direction in what it is trying to do and to eliminate an oversight that is protecting the american public in their quality of life and also doesnt speak to how we work with the industry to actually make sure that we check these emissions but as well provide the opportunity for domestic growth and domestic energy growth i ask my colleagues to support this amendment i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.0054686665534973145, 0.5054686665534973, 1, "reclaiming my time again i would hope and i know that the gentleman and the chair of the rules committees intentions and goals as are the speakers are more transparency in this congress and i dont think its particularly helpful to cite what may be a failure of the democrats to deliver on reforming the patriot act and say therefore we dont have to succeed either in reforming the patriot act i want to discuss the importance of this vote we all agree that this affects our national security and the civil liberties of americans and yet unfortunately from a process perspective we have reverted back to getting this through first on a suspension vote then on a longterm extension and now on a shortterm extension again there is no doubt that the shortterm extension is favorable to a longterm extension from those of us who have legitimate concerns and i think there is even a bipartisan consensus that these concerns are legitimate about the overreach of the patriot act we will have as a result of this a 90day period to try to work through in a bipartisan way some of our concerns and make sure that we protect what is special about being americans we had an emergency meeting of the rules committee late last night which was the second emergency meeting for this bill alone again i think we all knew coming into this congress that these provisions were set to expire there would have been time for the judiciary committee to hold hearings and even a markup with regard to this bill because they have held hearings with regard to other bills they were constituted they held hearings on immigration on abortion on other topics and i think that regardless of where one stands on this bill it rises to the level of importance for american citizens that we do strike the right balance between security and protection of civil liberty if house republicans are going to honor the promise of openness and transparency we must make sure that they do schedule the hearings and markups that are necessary to have a proper debate of this bill now this new version before us today the shortterm cr provides a window for that and i am hopeful that the chairs of the respective committees of jurisdiction and subcommittees will be able to offer some assurances to members of both parties that are concerned that this 90day period will be used to improve upon the bill to hold hearings on the bill and offer classified briefings for members so we can determine exactly how these authorities have been used only after the initial effort to push this bill through under suspension failed did republican leadership bring it to the floor under a closed rule new members have not even had a classified briefing nor have i the members from last session so its hard for us to understand exactly how these authorities that are delegated are being used it is clear that theres bipartisan support to improve this law in fact even as we speak the senate is debating several versions of the longterm reauthorization bill and i think theres a very legitimate and important security concern in support of longterm reauthorization so law enforcement can plan accordingly and have longterm planning with regard to exactly what powers and the balances they have with protecting civil liberties they will have i think we can all agree a 90day extension is not the right answer its not the right answer for law enforcement its not the right answer for protecting our civil liberties it may be an answer that affords us a chance to get it right and i would call upon members of both parties to work hard to do that apart from the procedural flaws with the process the patriot act is a bill that really has been plagued with abuse since it was first passed after 10 years of public record there are some clear sections of the law that need to be improved and yet here we are again instead of debating those sections of the law and finding solutions we can agree on we are facing an upordown vote on this bill with very little debate this reauthorization fails to provide the administration with the tools and predictability it needs to fully protect and defend our nation the administration supports a permanent reauthorization and has asked for a real one and i think they are willing to work with us in this body on improving the patriot act so this bill fails both to please the advocates pushing to reform the patriot act and also fails to provide for the administration whose job it is to protect our country again we ask why is the republican party jamming this bill through here today instead of debating a real bill that would improve our national security this bill before us today specifically reauthorizes three provisions of the patriot act section 215 allows the government to capture any tangible thing any business record that might be relevant to a terrorist investigation that can include medical records a diary even in one case books that have been checked out of a library there was a library where somebody checked out a book about osama bin laden and who that person was was reported on in the past these orders were limited to certain classes of businesses and records and also required that we show specific facts that pertain to an agent of a foreign power and if the patriot act is stripped away of those basic requirements thats something i think that every american who values privacy should be concerned about this section 215 goes against the basic constitutional notions of search and seizure we began this session of congress by reading the constitution on the floor of the house and this really comes at the very core identity of what it means to be an american the government under our constitution is required to show reasonable suspicion or probable cause before they can infringe upon an americans privacy we should seriously consider making changes to this section instead of blindly giving the government the ability to secretly spy on its citizens section 206 the second provision of the bill allows the government to conduct the roving wiretaps these allow the government to obtain surveillance warrants that dont even specify a certain person or an object thats going to be tapped another problem with this is the fourth amendment of our constitution which again im sure all my colleagues are familiar with having read it on the floor of the house it states that warrants must specify the person and places to be seized and searched with particularity this is to make sure the executive branch doesnt have unfettered power to decide singlehandedly who and how to search private citizens and seize their property the founding fathers were concerned and worried about the possibility of a central government authority issuing general warrants that would give it farreaching power to spy on its citizens and intervene in their private lives thats an american value that we share today and i think its critical to craft protections for our privacy as americans that can be consistent with the need to secure our country before authorizing the government such overwhelming power the final section would be the lone wolf provision which allows secret surveillance of noncitizens in the unitedstates these are foreign citizens who are here legally even if they are not connected to a terrorist group or foreign power so again this authority is only granted in a secret court so from our perspective in congress without having had the benefit of a classified briefing its very difficult for us to exercise any meaningful oversight on a provision when were not aware of how or if its been used my friends on the other side of the aisle have said in numerous debates that they are worried about the growth of government yet in spite of the recent rhetoric about how the government is trying to take control over our lives this bill their fifth bill under rules since taking control of the house actually gives the government the ability to spy on innocent americans no wonder so many republicans joined democrats in voting against this bill earlier this week i encourage my colleagues to continue standing strong for civil liberties with that i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.0054863691329956055, 0.4945136308670044, 0, "i yield myself such time as i may consume i want to thank my colleague from florida who has made some terrific comments regarding this legislation about the importance of oversight i know my colleague from new hampshire has been very keenly involved in the oversight efforts as well let me just say as chair of the communications and technology subcommittee that we will be doing oversight on how this program is working we hear some reports that there have been problems getting access to fiber because of the earthquake in japan that may have slowed build out we understand that some of the smaller companies may have run into all kinds of problems working their way through rightsofway issues that have delayed the build out of getting this broadband build out into many of our communities especially those who dont have broadband today so i think its incumbent upon us and i wont presume to speak for the minority but i assume they would agree as well we need to keep an eye on this just to see how is it working and what impediments are we running into and are we going to see this broadband actually get built out as it was envisioned the grants have been issued the money is obligated hasnt been spent so it looks to me like we have two tasks here one is to make sure we get what were paying for as the american taxpayer and the money that isnt going to get spent comes back or if theres any kind of fraud developed all that money we can recover will come back and that there is a very surefire method without question that it comes back to the treasury and that also to take a look at what are the impediments to building out i know we run into it where i am at that we do have problems sometimes getting these permits getting through the various regulations that really impede our opportunity i would encourage members on both sides of the house to approve this legislation and i yield back the balance of my time"]]}
