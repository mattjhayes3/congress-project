the congressional black caucus during the 113th congress thanks to her dedication and tireless work this caucus is better positioned to address the diverse challenges of the african american community i also want to thank the new cbc chair the honorable congressman g k butterfield of north carolina i am confident that he will do a great job leading this caucus with steadfast commitment to justice and to building an america that works for everyone let me also thank my counterpart the honorable congresswoman robin kelly for joining me in leading the cbc special orders this year i am truly honored to take on this new role and i look forward to working with her as we help carry out the critical mission of this caucus 50 years ago in the midst of the civil rights movement hundreds of brave men and women gathered in selma alabama to begin a long arduous march to montgomery in support of the fundamental truth that every american regardless of what they look like has the right to vote on march 7 1965 600 men and women set out from selma following the death of 26yearold jimmie lee jackson a deacon from marion alabama who died from gunshot wounds inflicted by a state trooper at a nonviolent demonstration theirs was a peaceful nonviolent march but it was met with fierce brutality it would take the marchers two more attempts to arrive at montgomery but on march 25 after a 12day journey they did arrive since that day our country has made significant strides in achieving equality and justice for all but significant challenges remain unmet tonight we will examine where we have come from where we are and where we would like to go as a society we must be ready to go in 1965 selma became the focal point of voter registration efforts in the south at the time only 2 percent of the citys eligible african american voters had been able to register the impact of selma to the montgomery march was profound as dr king said selma produced the voting rights legislation of 1965 the voting rights act of 1965 banned discriminatory voting requirements that disenfranchised african american voters throughout this country yet today the dream of full equality is still something many african americans can only dream of where we are nearly 6 years after the end of the recession people still struggle to find work and the gap between the rich and poor continues to grow for african americans this situation is severe given the disproportionate effect of unemployment on our communities at the same time there remains widespread poverty a defining challenge of our time this persistent economic inequality threatens to undercut the gains that african american communities have made and it undermines the idea of economic mobility the idea that if you work hard in this country and have ambition you can get ahead the economic crisis is not only facing african american communities where we are in education education is the most important economic investment we can make now and for future generations yet across the country we still have seen cuts to education at all levels and attacks on critical programs like head start and pell grants these attacks undermine the ability of african americans to get aheadthat is why i strongly support president obamas new bold initiative for free access to community collegesso too do efforts to dismantle social safety net programs which our communities depend on those efforts are irresponsible unjust and contrary to who we are as americans the congressional black caucus will make criminal justice reform a centerpiece of our agenda we will work to reduce the epidemic of poverty in this country we will work to create educational opportunities for african american children and we will support efforts to strengthen our 105 historically black colleges and universities the cbc also remains committed to fighting against efforts to dismantle the social safety net we are determined to restore section 5 of the voting rights act and to make sure everyone regardless of what they look like or where they come from has equal access to the polls and we resolve to ensure that increasing diversity in this nation is reflected in american corporations together these policies will bring us closer as a nation where we are empowering the communities of african americans and they will benefit from the full equality and live the american dream there is no doubt that we are in difficult times in this nation injustices are widespread and threaten some of our most fundamental rights but we will find no answers in

judiciary committee it is there that we deal with the problems particularly on the crime subcommittee at the end of someones detour in life do you know what mr chairman those detours in life that wind up with 75 000 persons in the federal prison system on mandatory minimums has been because people cannot read do not have opportunities and do not have jobs i want to invest in a budget that lifts the boats of all people if you work hard you get a home if you work hard you can send your kids to school if you work hard you can retire that is the budget i want to support not this nosuccess budget that is being proposed by our republican friends i ask my colleagues to support the alternative budget along with the cpc and the cbc budget mr chair i rise in strong opposition to h con res 27 the house republicans budget resolution for fiscal year 2016 because it continues the reckless and irresponsible approach to fiscal policy that the house majority has championed for years with disastrous results mr chair the budgeteers on the majority side have a very poor track record when it comes to economic forecasts and projections for years they have based their entire legislative agenda and strategy on their belief that the affordable care act or obamacare would be a failure the wish was father to the thought but they were wrong because of obamacare more than 16 4 million americans now know the peace of mind that comes from affordable quality health insurance that is there when you need it house republicans oppose increasing the minimum wage claiming that it costs jobs wrong again every increase in the minimum wage has been accompanied by an expanding economy especially during the clinton administration house republicans opposing comprehensive immigration reform claim that it will lead to lower incomes and lost jobs wrong again studies conducted by groups as far apart as the chamber of commerce and the aflcio consistently show that comprehensive immigration reform will grow the gross domestic product by 1 5 trillion over 10 years given this sorry track record of economic forecasting i strongly oppose the republican budget because it favors the wealthy over middle class families and those struggling to enter or remain in the middle class i oppose this republican budget because it asks major sacrifices of seniors who can barely make ends meet and fundamentally alters the social contract by turning medicaid and snap programs into a block grant and medicare into a voucher i cannot and will not support a resolution that attempts to balance the budget on the backs of working families seniors children the poor or mortgages the future by failing to make the investments needed to sustain economic growth and opportunity for all americans mr chair the gop work harder get less budget squeezes hardworking americans by making it 1 harder to buy a home by keeping their paychecks stagnant 2 harder to send your kids to college by cutting student loans and 3 harder to enjoy a secure retirement by privatizing medicare if the house republicans work harder to get less budget were adopted here is a sample of the pain and misery that will be visited on middleclass and working families 1 an end to higher education tax credits 2 an end to needed increases in the child tax credit 3 the loss of access to tax credits for affordable health care for millions of americans and 4 a reduction in tax rates for the wealthy yielding an average tax cut of 200 000 for millionaires financed by a 2 000 tax increase on the typical middle class family mr chair this price is not right budget will make it harder to middle and working class parents to send their kids to college by 1 ending higher education tax credits and 2 cutting student loan programs and pell grants making college less affordable and adding to the already huge levels of student debt the damage caused by the republican budget is not limited to working families and students there are also lumps of coal for seniors who have earned and deserve a secure retirement 1 the medicare guarantee is turned into a voucher program with increased costs for seniors 2 seniors who have worked hard for a financially secure retirement will immediately have to pay new copays for preventive care and much higher costs for prescription drugs the republican budget also disinvests in americas future 1 slashes the part of the budget we use to invest in our childrens education and 2 devastates our investments in scientific research and innovation mr chair the republican budget exacerbates the drag on the economy resulting from a crumbling infrastructure by cutting 187 billion or more than 19 percent from transportation funding over the coming decade and provides no solution to address the current shortfall in the federal transportation fund which means we can expect construction slowdowns beginning this summer mr chair compared to the presidents budget the republican budget would result this fiscal year in 35 000 fewer children in head start and up to 6 000 fewer special education teachers paraprofessionals and other related staff the republican budget also shortchanges americas future by cutting investments in scientific research and innovation in real terms by failing to lift the draconian sequester on domestic priorities as a result under the republican budget there would be 1 300 fewer medical research grants at national institutes h and 950 fewer competitive science research awards at the nsf affecting 11 600 researchers technicians and students finally mr chair the republican budget mistreats the poorest and most vulnerable persons in our country the republican work harder get less budget takes aim at millions of families with children struggling to make ends meet and put food on the table by converting the supplemental nutrition assistance program snap into a block grant beginning in 2021 and cutting funding steeplyby 125 billion 34 percent between 2021 and by 2025 these dramatic cuts could mean in 2021 through 2025 either cutting off assistance to 11 to 12 million eligible people each year or cutting benefits by almost 55 per person per month in contrast the democratic budget works for american families by giving them the tools to buy a home send their kids to college and enjoy a secure retirement mr chair the democratic budget represents a better way we democrats understand that we are all in this together and that our current economic situation calls for a balanced approach between increased revenues and responsible reduction in expenditures our plan will protect and strengthen our recovering economy reduce the deficit in a responsible way while continuing to invest in the things that make our country strong like education health care innovation and clean energy mr chair this republican budget is bad for america but it is disastrous for the people from my home state of texas who sent me here to advocate for their interests let me highlight a few examples 1 if the republican budget resolution were to become the basis of federal fiscal policy 3 435 336 texas seniors would be forced out of traditional medicare and into a voucher program under the republican plan to end medicare as we know it texas seniors will receive a voucher instead of guaranteed benefits under traditional medicare 2 for the 3 435 336 texans aged 4554 the value of their vouchers would be capped at growth levels that are lower than the projected increases in health care costs previous analyses showed that this type of plan would cut future spending by 5 900 per senior forcing them to spend more out of pocket and diminishing their access to quality care 3 additionally private insurance plans will aggressively pursue the healthiest least expensive enrollees thereby allowing medicarecurrently the lifeline for 3 187 332 texas seniorsto wither on the vine 4 if the republican budget resolution were to be adopted by

in her leadership in the congressional black caucus it is with a heavy heart that i stand on the floor of the house of representatives today and with great sadness acknowledge the pain and the suffering and extend my condolences to those who have suffered this great tragedy in orlando florida the worst mass shooting in the history of the united states of america it is a complicated shooting we understand that it most likely is an act of terror a hate crime of unspeakable proportions there are indications that the shooter may have some degree of mental illness and a history of domestic abuse the shooter appeared to have been in some measure on the fbis radar but you can add all those things up and there is still something that is missing that we here in congress have the capacity to deal with and that is the fact that one individual was able to purchase a weapon of mass destructionwhich should be reserved for war not the hunting of human beings in this great democratic republicand inflict death on 49 individuals and maim in ways that are inhumane to more than 50 others martin luther king jr once said in the end we will remember not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends during the 114th congress there have been more than 100 mass shootings we often come to the floor of the house of representatives and the speaker or one of his designees stands at the rostrum and asks us as members of the house to stand in a moment of silence and then we go on with business as usual having done nothing about the tremendous gun violence problem that we have in america the rest of the world is looking around and saying what are they doing in the united states of america five percent of the worlds population 50 percent of the worlds guns it is estimated that there are more than 300 million guns circulating throughout this great land the fbi and local law enforcement cant tell you where the overwhelming majority of them are because of legislative silence and malpractice this is an issue of course that has great impact on the african american community homicides are the leading cause of death through guns of younger african american men so we in the cbc view it as a public health crisis certainly for our community i think it is one that all americans should view as a health crisis for the entire country but the thing that is also troublingand we will have time to deal with this tragedyis hopefully we will be able to take some commonsense steps in the right direction including making sure that individuals who are on the terrorist watch list cant purchase weapons of mass destruction how complicated is that to do but the thing that is striking for many of us in the african american community is that when you look at some of the leading causes of deathheart disease being number one and then of course diabetes and childhood obesity being problematic certain forms of cancer hiv aids infectionmany of these illnesses these ailments that plague the neighborhoods that i represent in central brooklyn in bedfordstuyvesant in east new york in ocean hillbrownsville in canarsie and in the west end of coney island are preventable preventable by better exercise preventable by dealing with some of the environmental racism that many lowincome communities of color have been subjected to resulting in incredibly high rates of asthma and other forms of respiratory illness preventable by better diet senator booker recently said to many of usand this has stuck with methat more african americans in the united states of america die as a result of drivethroughs not drivebys that is because the diet the access to healthy food is limited the food deserts within which many african americans particularly at the lowest socioeconomic level are forced to reside in are scandalous so we in the congressional black caucus believe that we have to deal with these issues in a more meaningful comprehensive fashion i am thankful that back at home in the west end of coney island coney island cathedral one of the most important religious institutions in brooklyn is actively engaged in a public health campaign to deal with diabetes and heart disease and many of the other ailments that result from a poor diet that exists a lack of access to healthy food in the black community it is a campaign that we want to take across the nation we are thankful for the work that has been done by the congressional black caucus and by president obama through his leadership of the affordable care act we now know that over 20 million previously uninsured americans now have access to quality affordable health caredisproportionately african american that is a positive step in the right direction but instead of trying to dismantle this monumental step forward as house republicans have attempted to do more than 60 times over the last few years they have a clinical obsession with a law that has been declared constitutionalnot once but twiceby the united states supreme court lets figure out ways to come together as a nation despite our racial religious and ethnic differences to deal with the disparities that exist in the african american community and beyond and let us come together as a congress and as a nation to deal with the scourge of hate in its most recent form directed at the lgbt community

provisions which are intended to diminish the ability of the department of interior and the environmental protection agency to protect public health and the environment as ranking member of the science committee i am certainly familiar with the antiepa rhetoric emanating from too many on the majority side fortunately their attempts to override the growing chorus of american voices demanding action on climate change is failing and communities across the nation are showing strong support for epas efforts to reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions implement tighter ozone standards and protect public health unfortunately there are those in this house who apparently have turned a deaf ear to the american people and instead provide a forum for those who seek to undermine epas work

action to address methane emissions from the oil and gas industry while the people in california are still reeling from the largest methane leak in unitedstates history it seems unconscionable to me that we would prohibit epa from taking any action on issues related to methane emissions in addition some of my republican colleagues have grown fond of insisting that epa should only rely on publically available scientific information to support their rules and actions while the goal of a transparent government is laudable the consequence of their insistence is not a more transparent epa but an epa that would be limited as to what science they may consider as my colleagues and i have said before we cannot support a bill and accompanying report that limits or prohibits epa from using the best and most relevant science moreover in response to perceived delays in providing documents requested by congress the authors of this legislation would seemingly punish the hardworking men and women of epas congressional affairs office by reducing their budget request by 4 million dollars if my colleagues really want to address epas inability to provide timely responses to an ever increasing amount of congressional document requests they would not cut the budget of the office tasked with providing those responses it may feel good to those proposing the cut but it is a selfdefeating approach to addressing the ostensible problem finally i would note that a number of amendments have been made in order that if adopted will only make a bad bill worse i intended to

senior member of the house judiciary committee and as the ranking member of the subcommittee on crime terrorism homeland security and investigations as the representative of houston i am privileged to be able to support this legislation legislation that i am very glad to say had been included in our draft prison bill a bipartisan bill but because of the urgency of this matter i am very glad to be on the floor of the house with the cosponsors sponsors and the chairman of the full committee mr goodlatte and the ranking member of the full committee mr conyers as well joins in the importance of this effort my heart aches for eric williams family and it aches for the circumstance that caused him to lose his life obviously this young man was committed to public safety the criminal justice system and in fact the rehabilitation of those who were incarcerated even in highrisk circumstances i rise to support s 238 the eric williams correctional officer protection act of 2015 to make sure that this provision providing a tool of safety for these brave corrections officers does not go out of existence i want to extend my thanks again to judiciary chairman goodlatte and ranking member conyers as i indicated for their ongoing bipartisan leadership but again let me refer back to eric williams the namesake of this legislation and the tragedy of his death i want to offer my sympathy to the family members and to again say that this death did not have to happen as i discuss the bill i want to make the point that we should not shortchange the resources needed for the men and women who are on the front lines of protecting us and securing a criminal justice system to make it work in this instance that is what happened a death had occurred earlier but the pilot program did not reach to erics facility and that is inexcusable but fortunately this permanent adding or expanding of this bill will make sure that every highrisk facility under the bureau of prisons will have this pepper spray the judiciary committee unanimously passed the groundbreaking prison reform bill as i said 2 weeks ago this measure was included s 238 codifies a pilot program that has increased federal prison safety nationwide it is crucial however it is set to expire in a few days and i look forward to my colleagues bringing forth the criminal justice bill it is important to move this bill now tomorrow marks 3 years since the death of correctional officer eric williams who was stabbed by an inmate at a highsecurity facility he was working alone as i said with 100 inmates high risk armed with only a radio keys and handcuffs he was unable to defend himself against the aggressive attack if officer williams was equipped with pepper spray then he might still be here with us today passing s 238 will honor officer williams the provisions of this bill require bop to issue oleoresin capsicum spray known as pepper spray to certain staff at a higher security prison this requirement is truly common sense and does not apply to minimum or lowsecurity facilities it only applies to staff that may respond to an emergency situation in the prison s 238 includes critical safeguards to ensure pepper spray is used appropriately and only when necessary to prevent acts of violence it is determined that pepper spray is not dangerous only in limited circumstances the legislation requires the officer or employee to complete a pepper spray training course before being issued the spray annually thereafter it establishes parameters for using the spray and it may only be used to reduce acts of violence in doing so s 238 makes it clear that pepper spray may not be used to punish or coerce inmates or in an excessive inappropriate fashion finally let me say that it is with sadness but with pleasure that we provide this legislation and move it quickly so that we can provide that permanent armor if you will to protect these officers who are dealing with highrisk inmates i ask my colleagues to support this legislation as a senior member of the house judiciary committee as the ranking member of the subcommittee on crime terrorism homeland security and investigations as the representative from houston and as a cosponsor of legislation that includes this same measure i rise in support of s 238 the eric williams correctional officer protection act of 2015 let me extend my thanks to judiciary chairman goodlatte and ranking member conyers for their ongoing leadership on bipartisan criminal justice reform when the judiciary committee unanimously passed a groundbreaking prison reform bill just two weeks ago that bill included the measure before us today s 238 codifies a pilot program that has increased federal prison safety nationwide this crucial program however is set to expire in just a few days while i look forward to working with my colleagues to bring our bipartisan criminal justice reform bills before this chamber soon we must pass s 238 now to avoid letting this important program expire tomorrow marks three years since the death of correctional officer eric williams who was stabbed by an inmate at a high security facility in waymart pa officer williams was working alone in a unit of more than loo inmates armed only with a radio keys and handcuffs he was unable to defend himself against the aggressive attack if officer williams was equipped with pepper spray then he might still be here with us today passing s 238 will honor officer williams the eric williams correctional officer protection act of 2015 provides officers in higher security facilities with the means to protect themselves when necessary s 238 requires bop to issue oleoresin capsicum spray known as pepper spray to certain staff at higher security prisons this requirement is truly common sense it does not apply to minimum or low security facilities and it only applies to staff that may respond to an emergency situation in the prison s 238 includes critical safeguards to ensure pepper spray is used appropriately and only when necessary to prevent acts of violence specifically this legislation requires the officer or employee to complete a pepper spray training course before being issued the spray and annually thereafter and establishes perimeters for using the sprayit may only be used to reduce acts of violence committed by prisoners against themselves or others in doing so s 238 makes it clear that pepper spray may not be used to punish or coerce inmates or in an excessive and inappropriate fashion the need to provide permanent protective equipment cannot be overstated mass incarceration has led to dangerously overcrowded federal prisons such conditions can frequently lead or at least contribute to unnecessary violence high and medium security level facilities make up 42 percent of the total bop population in fy2013 these facilities were operating 52 percent and 45 percent over capacity respectively officers in these facilities must be equipped to protect themselves and others in 2010 there were almost 1 700 assaults on bop staffabout 49 per 5 000 inmates bop requires officers on regular duty to carry a radio body alarm and keys outside the pilot program and aside from emergency situations and special teams officers do not carry pepper spray or batons officers must rely on communication skills and training to deescalate confrontations these are critically important skills and we know that our welltrained federal correctional officers are generally able to use these skills to avoid violence in some instances however these skills may not be enough and when they are not these officers must not be defenseless the issuance of pepper spray alongside proper training will go a long way to assisting these officers when all else fails we ask a lot of federal correctional officers we support these officers with training and skills but that is not always enough when faced with acts of violence against themselves and others they must be wellpositioned to cut that violence short it is therefore vital that we pass s 238 now accordingly i urge my colleagues to join me the national association of police organizations
