by locking away 100 percent of social security revenues and surpluses for retirement security republicans want to pay down the national debt and republicans also want to lower the tax burden for middleclass working families i believe this year as we work to lower the tax burden for middleclass families that we should focus on making our tax code simpler and making our tax code fairer to families and let me raise a series of questions today that really illustrate what i believe is the most unfair tax and that is the tax on marriage the marriage tax is not only unfair it is wrong is it right that under our tax code married working couples pay higher taxes than two single people living together outside of marriage do americans feel that it is fair that 28 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married that is right under our tax code today a husband and wife who both are in the work force pay higher taxes than two single people living together with identical incomes that is wrong let me give an example here of what it means as i pointed out earlier there are 28 million married working couples paying on average 1 400 more in higher taxes here is an example of a south chicago suburban couple i represent the south suburbs of chicago if we take a machinist who works for caterpillar in joliet and a schoolteacher in the local public schools of joliet and they have a combined income of 62 000 the machinist makes 35 500 and as a single individual when he files his taxes if we subtract the personal exemption and the standard deduction he pays a certain amount of taxes but if he chooses to marry and his schoolteacher wife with an identical income and when they are married they file their taxes jointly their combined income of 62 000 when he subtracts the standard deductions and exemptions under our current tax code this machinist and his schoolteacher wife making 62 000 a year pay the average marriage tax penalty of 1 400 now there are those particularly on that side of the aisle who believe that this is no big deal that is money that we have to spend in washington back in joliet 1 400 is 1 years tuition in joliet community college 3 months of day care in the local child care center and also several months worth of car payments the marriage tax elimination act which i am proud to say has 230 cosponsors a bipartisan majority of this house we propose to eliminate the marriage tax penalty for all americans under our legislation we double the standard deduction for joint filers to twice that for single filers we double the brackets so that those who are married filing jointly can earn exactly twice what a single filer can make and be treated fairly under taxes the bottom line is the marriage tax elimination act would eliminate the marriage tax penalty for this machinist and this schoolteacherwife who are married in joliet illinois eliminating the marriage tax penalty is really an issue of fairness and will help simplify the tax code what is the bottom line the marriage tax elimination act puts two married people on equal footing with two single people that is fair and that simplifies the tax code i am proud to say i was part of this congress when republicans succeeded in passing into law the adoption tax credit to help loving families find a home for a child in need of adoption we accomplished that as part of the contract with america in 1996 and we followed up in 1997 by enacting into law the centerpiece of the contract with america the 500 per child tax credit which benefits 3 million illinois children that is 1 5 billion that will stay in illinois rather than coming to washington and of course i believe the folks back home can better spend their hardearned dollars back home than we can here in washington we can build on that helping working families by working to simplify our code by working to bring fairness to our tax code by eliminating what is the most unfair tax of all and that is the tax on marriage let us stop taxing marriage let us pass into law the marriage tax elimination act and eliminate the marriage tax penalty once and for all let us make the elimination of the marriage tax penalty the centerpiece of this years tax cut"], [0.02625683881342411, 0.02625683881342411, 0, "i certainly have been intrigued by the speech that we have been hearing about the census and about how we have heard words like partisan motives and tactics and basically the same things that we have been hearing for years that democrats have been attacking republicans for back room maneuvers and saying all these horrible things because we do not want people to be represented according to them as my colleagues know the one thing though that i find really intriguing about this debate is that while republicans are being attacked for this the one thing that we do not hear about when it comes to reapportionment and when it comes to using the census to count voters in 2000 is the fact that this decision has already been reached not in a back room in congress not by meanspirited republicans getting together and figuring out how they can harm human beings but now it has been decided already across the street by the united states supreme court who ruled not long ago just a month or two ago that it is unconstitutional it is unconstitutional to run a census the way the administration and the way that the radical left wants to run the census ih 2000 i say radical left why do i say radical i say radical and my definition of radical is somebody or a group of legislators who want to radically break with the past and that is what this is all about as my colleagues know they can talk about scientific means of measurement they can talk about fairness they can talk about whatever they want to talk about but when they turn and point and blame the republicans for the census in 2000 they are avoiding some very basic facts the main fact they are avoiding is and there are two facts actually first fact is the united states supreme court says it is unconstitutional to guess how many americans should be able to vote in an election it is unconstitutional the second fact that they conveniently avoid so they can come down here and make meanspirited radical assertions that just are not based on fact is that the united states constitution itself the framework for this great constitutional republic says itself that you have got to count each person when we decide about reapportionment now what did we hear as my colleagues know i do not know why we did not hear that other than it does not really play into their strong point as well as criticizing republicans attacking us as meanspirited listen the republicans on this issue are irrelevant if they have a problem they need to take it up with the united states supreme court they need to take it up with madison and hamilton and those people that drafted the united states constitution over 200 years ago now maybe they do not like the constitution maybe they think that this part of the constitution is not suited well for the 21st century maybe they want a radical departure from our history maybe they want to take an extremist approach because they think they can pick up four or five seats but i can tell my colleagues the supreme court the united states constitution and 222 years of american history does not support their argument facts are stubborn things facts not name calling not meanspirited attacks facts are stubborn things it reminds me during the impeachment hearings and even before the impeachment hearings as we led up to the impeachment hearings i remember ken starr being castigated time and time again he is a renegade ken starr is dangerous he is trying to do things that he should not be able to do that is what we heard from the radical left but facts are stubborn things the presidents attorneys the radical left the democratic caucus all would attack ken starr and say he was doing things that would destroy the presidency and the constitution and yet every time the legal question was taken to the united states supreme court the united states supreme court the highest court in the land would come back and defend ken starrs right to conduct his legal investigation now whether colleagues agreed with mr starrs investigation or not do not say that he is an outofcontrol prosecutor that is trying to violate the law because the highest court in the land the court sanctioned by the united states constitution 222 years ago said that what mr starr was asking for was constitutionally correct now again maybe the radical left the presidents counsel and the entire democratic caucus does not like the constitution maybe they are offended by 222 years of history but do not attack the person that is living by the law and the constitution because facts are stubborn things this is something i have seen now for 4 years it was about 4 5 years ago that i was an american that sat on my couch and watched the news watched cspan had never been involved in politics i decided that i should get off the couch come to washington and try to make a change i did that i have to tell the members i was shocked absolutely shocked by some of the meanspirited things that were said from the left to the right any time they disagreed on principle they would attack personally i just do not know how many times i have heard somebody from the radical left call an opponent a nazi because they disagreed with them politically a nazi a member of an organization that killed 6 million jews just because you disagree with the way somebody votes on a school lunch program whether someone wants it administered by the state the local school agency or the federal government does not mean that we should resort to this meanspirited radical approach it is just like social security i do not know how many times i have heard people on the left talk about social security and talk about how republicans want to destroy social security we have heard it from the administration time and time again it is almost like they a onetrick pony that is all they know how to do is to scare people once again facts are stubborn things it was just this week that cbo director crippen criticized the president and the administration and for doing what for planning to raid the social security trust fund by 270 billion steal 270 billion from social security even in washington d c even among the radical left 270 billion is a lot of money the idea was let us go ahead and raid social security for 270 billion take it from social security put it in the general account and then after we steal 270 billion from this federal program that was set up on a promise then we spend that 270 billion on new federal programs new bureaucracies making new promises that this government will not keep we have to say once and for all to this administration and to those on the left that want to raid the social security trust fund to create new bureaucracies and new jobs and new power in washington d c keep your hands off social security keep your hands off social security there is a republican plan by the gentleman from california that would allow us to finally after all of these years keep politicians hands off of social security this plan would set aside the social security trust fund and stop politicians from raiding that trust fund the president would not be able to steal 270 billion from the social security trust fund members of the radical left would not be able to create new federal jobs create new federal bureaucracies and create new federal regulations with their illgotten dollars instead we would set aside social security we weuld keep it solvent not only for my parents but for all of americans we have got to do that we have got to stop looting the social security trust fund ironically this is something that back in 1995 when i came here with a group of 73 other freshmen republicans we actually put out a bill that mark neumann helped draft that would set aside the social security trust fund and protect social securitys funds for our seniors we were told at the time it was radical that nobody would do it that listen we have to go ahead and count the social security trust fund and raid it or there is no way we can balance the budget the administrations budgets looted social security right now though i think we are getting to a point where most conservative and moderate members of congress agree that we have got to keep social security safe and keep it offbudget so our grandparents and our parents will be able to get back the money that they put in is it a plan that will work i do not know but i would like the administration i would like members of the radical left i would like everybody to come to the table and at least talk about it instead of saying let us raid social security by 270 billion and then turning around and saying we are the ones that are protecting social security they cannot have it both ways either they are for protecting social security and keeping their hands off the social security trust fund or they want to raid social security to the tune of 270 billion like the administration to create bigger federal bureaucracies they cannot have it both ways facts are stubborn things why are we in a position now that we can set aside the social security trust fund it is because when we came here in 1995 we were not only concerned about senior citizens we were concerned about our children we were concerned about teenagers we were concerned about people in their 20s 30s and 40s and people who would be on social security down the road the only way we could take care of our future leaders the only way we could allow them to enjoy the american dream that so many americans have enjoyed in this great american century was to stop raiding social security and stop stealing from our next generation when we got here the deficit was 300 billion 300 billion the debt was 5 trillion what does that mean it is hard to figure out exactly how much money that is all i can say is this senator bob kerrey headed up a bipartisan task force on social security and his social security task force back in 1994 concluded that if social security spending and if spending on our federal budget continued at current rates then people in their teens and twenties would be paying 89 percent of their paychecks 89 percent of their paychecks just to pay off their federal taxes i think what senator kerrey did was a courageous thing senator simpson now retired was also on that commission it is a commission that came up with good conclusions regarding the solvency of social security what does that mean i guess we have to boil this down basically as much as we can so people in their teens and twenties can understand let us say you have a job at wendys and you make 200 a parttime job and you make 200 every 2 weeks if you have to pay 90 percent of your salary in federal taxes that means you will get 20 at the end of the day and the federal government will get 180 that simply is not the right thing to do but that is what our children and our grandchildren face and what they faced if we did not dare to stand up to say no to more and more spending what do we hear now 4 years later just 4 years later we have gotten to a point where we could not only erase the deficit but also erase the 5 4 trillion debt just in 10 or 15 years how did this come about we hear an awful lot about the recovery a lot of people want to take credit but i remember back in 1995 when we got here we said we are going to balance the budget and we are going to do it in 7 years or less i actually voted on a plan that would balance the budget in 5 years they called us radical and extreme because their views were radical and extreme i guess to a political faction that had spent 40 years borrowing from their children and their grandchildren and stealing from their grandparents social security trust fund i guess our concept was radical this was our concept if you spend 1 then you had better bring in 1 stop borrowing from the next generation and from the generation that survived the depression and won world war ii instead let us be fiscally responsible so we brought out a plan to balance the budget it was the plan of the gentleman from ohio it was a courageous plan i got up here in my first couple of months in washington and everybody in washington told me we cannot do it this will never happen we cannot balance the budget in fact i remember the president coming out and saying if we tried to balance the budget in 7 years we would destroy the american economy the president of the united states just 4 years ago said if we tried to balance the budget in 7 years we would destroy the united states economy we had some other people that knew a thing or two about economics come and testify before congress the gentleman from ohio chairman kasich had fed chairman alan greenspan come to congress the chairman of the fed said if you people will only do what you say you want to do and pass a budget that will balance in 7 years you will see unprecedented economic growth you will see interest rates rocket down you will see unemployment go down you will see the stock market explode you will see america explode economically in a way that it had not exploded since the end of world war ii do members know what he was right his prediction before the committee on the budget in early 1995 was deadly accurate it is a good thing that we listened to our hearts that we listened to the chaiiman of the fed and ignored the naysayers on the radical left and ignored the president who said do not balance the budget it is a very bad thing facts are stubborn things it was only 1 year later when he was running for president that he said his first priority would be to keep up the fight for balancing the budget it is very interesting because he vetoed nine appropriation bills he shut down the government all because he did not want to balance the budget in 7 years he said it would destroy the economy what has our work accomplished what has the work of the gentleman from ohio chairman kasich accomplished what has speaker gingrich when he was still here as a speaker accomplished what has the courage of republicans and conservative democrats alike accomplished well let us look at it when we first got here 4 years ago the deficit was approaching 300 billion now we are told that the budget will balance in the next year when we first got here the dow jones was at 3 900 today it is at 9 500 and middle class americans have gotten involved in the market in their 401 k plans and america is enjoying unprecedented economic growth unemployment is down inflation has remained down america has not enjoyed better times why all because we ignored the naysayers and the people who said we cannot balance our checkbooks we cannot run washington the way middleclass americans have to run their homes we cannot do it we said we can do it mr president and we will do it mr president and because we did america enjoys unprecedented economic growth it is time for us to step back not to assess credit not to assess blame but just to say let us remember the facts and let us remember what got us here the gentleman from ohio chairman kasich was for it the speaker was for it every republican was for it a few democrats were for it the president was against it and the radical left was against it 0 1515 it is a good thing a good thing that we stuck to our plan but yet to hear the administration talk one would think my gosh this was our plan all along it was not it just was not and i suppose they can say it as much as they want to say it they can take the credit as much as they want to take the credit but facts are stubborn things so what we have to do in 1999 is remember the lessons of 1995 just because it is unpopular does not mean it is not the right thing to do just because less government may not be popular in washington d c does not mean it is not the right thing to do just because destroying the death tax cutting capital gains tax ending the marriage penalty and allowing people that make from 45 000 to 60 000 to pay less taxes just because it may be tough does not mean it is not the right thing to do it is the right thing to do it may seem radical to people whose entire life their entire existence is based in washington d c who believe that all roads lead to washington who believe that washington knows how to spend out money better than we know how to spend our money that believe washington knows how to educate our children more than we know how to educate our children that believe that washington knows how to clean up crime better than communities know how to clean up crime it may seem radical to them but it does not seem radical to me it did not seem radical to ronald reagan and it certainly did not seem radical to thomas jefferson we have to stop turning our backs on what made america so great that is the individual it is people gop in the past has stood for grand old party i think that is a lousy name i think that is a stupid lousy name what we ought to say is gop stands for government of the people now why do i say that because think about it who is the one who is the party that is saying parents and teachers know more about educating children than the federal department of education certainly not democrats they believe that the federal bureaacracy in education should continue to grow and the president has budgets to prove it who believes americans should keep more of their money and washington should take less it is not the democrats of the radical left in fact the president of the united states went up to buffalo a few weeks ago and made a statement that i am sure he wishes he could retract now this is a statement that unfortunately reveals his heart when it comes to washington d c he said to this group about cutting taxes he criticized republicans because they actually wanted americans to keep more of their money and he said you know we in washington could let you keep more of your money and hope you know how to spend it right oh we cannot do that hope what is there to hope about i mean it is so painfully obvious that americans know how to spend their money better than washington d c i will guarantee that if i went to the president of the united states today and i said mr president i have got 50 million for you and you can either have a bureaucrat in washington d c invest that money or you can invest that money yourself i will guarantee that he will say i will invest it myself let us say that someone won a 50 million lottery across america and they said they want to give all of their money away to charity they want to help people if i gave them the option would they rather give that 50 million to federal bureaucracies or would they rather give that 50 million to private charities i will guarantee that they would give it to private charities in a second because washington d c does not have all the answers washington d c cannot do it as well as communities all roads do not lead to washington d c i still believe in the genius of america i still believe in the genius of communities and as the father of two boys in public schools i still believe parents know how to raise their children and teach their children better than bureaucrats in the federal department of education maybe that is not in vogue in 1999 maybe it is not in vogue to say that americans are paying too much in taxes in 1999 maybe the economy is doing so well that americans want to give the federal government more money well i hope not because i do not think that is good for america and i do not think it is good for the federal government because if we give the federal government one dollar they will figure out a way to need two dollars next year if we give them two they will need four if we hire one employee this year they will figure out a way that they will need to hire two next year we have got to get back to basics not only in this congress not only in this country but in this party the party of lincoln the party of madison and jefferson the party that believes that the genius of america lies in the heart of america and not in washington d c so hopefully when we talk about social security we can keep our word with the american people we can stop stealing from social security we can stop the presidents plan dead in its track to loot the social security trust fund of 270 billion 270 billion we can stop the presidents plan to spend more and more money and yes we can stop the presidents plan to raise taxes by almost 100 billion this year we have tried that before that is the past that is the history i know his poll ratings are high and every time they are high he comes to congress and he wants to spend more money and raise more taxes it happened in 1993 we had the largest tax increase in the history of the world that is why i think i got elected in 1994 because of his tax increase in 1993 i was against it then i am against it now i think it is immoral for the federal government to take half of what anlericans earn when we look at it look at it and see a great example is the death tax now the radical left will tell us that the death tax is about nothing more than helping the rich say that to the farmer that has spent his entire life with his hands in the soil building a farm praying to god every year that his crops will come in praying that he will have something to pass on to his sons and his daughter only to pass away and have his children have to pay 55 percent to the federal government just because he had the bad fortune of dying fiftyfive percent on money that he has already paid taxes on eight or nine times that is obscene with the new collection of wealth in america with middleclass americans that are actually getting to earn a little bit of money and investing in small businesses and using their hands and using their minds and sweating day and night to build a small business in the hope of passing the american dream on to their children they find out that when they die they are going to have to pay 55 percent to the federal government and what is going to happen to their small business what is going to happen to their small farm they are going to have to sell it they are going to have to have a sale on the courtroom steps because their children are not going to have the money to pay death taxes and keep that family business or that family farm running it makes no sense it makes no sense that americans while they are alive spend half of the year paying for taxes fees and regulations put on them by the government now what does that mean that means that when americans wake up to work on monday they are working for the government and all day they are working for the government when they wake up and go to work on tuesday they are still working to pay taxes fees and regulations to the government it is not until they come back from lunch on wednesday afternoon that they are able to put aside a few dollars for themselves and a few dollars aside for their family and a few dollars aside for a mortgage god help us all to be able to save a little bit of money for our childrens education see this is not the agenda that the president or the radical left want to talk about because what does this do why is this offensive to people on the left because it makes sense it makes sense i think to most americans but why is it offensive to people on the left it is because it takes money out of washington d c and returns it to americans i think in the end the difference between the right and the left is that the left just does not trust americans with their own mpney like the president of the united states said in buffalo a few weeks ago yeah we could give you your money and hope that you spend it the right way but we just cannot do that i am hoping that we will be coming to a time in the coming months that we can debate the real issues and debate the real facts if we are talking about spending we will keep spending down we will adhere to the spending caps that we passed in we have had speaker hastert and several others come out this week and talk about their desire to stay in the spending caps we have had the president of the united states talk about more taxes more spending more government two very separate visions of america republicans are fighting hard to cut taxes hopefully we can cut the death tax hopefully we can help americans that make 45 000 to 60 000 get out of the 28 percent tax bracket and go to the 15 percent tax bracket why is an american making 45 000 paying 28 percent in federal taxes that is insane and wrong the federal government has enough money it does not need money that badly hopefully when we talk about social security we can say no to raiding the social security trust fund and say yes to keeping social security off budget say no to the presidents plan of looting social security by 270 billion according to cbo and say yes to the herger plan the republican plan to keep social security off budget if we do that and if we go back to what we were talking about doing in 1995 which was balancing the budget cutting taxes cutting spending saving social security and being responsible with taxpayers money then i think we will really be on to something and we will go into the next century and the new millennium a stronger freer prouder country than we have in many many years that is my hope that is my prayer and that is what i will be

procedure only to reemphasize the importance of the process that we presently find ourselves today unfortunately president clinton vetoed the foreign operations bill and with that veto he made the statement that we did not have enough money in the funding for the things that he wanted in terms of foreign operations as we have struggled this year to limit the spending in this congress so that we do not touch social security money part of the way we have done that is to flatline the amount of money that is spent on the foreign operations bill in fact it is the only bill that we sent to the president that is somewhat less than the spending from the year before that bill as i recall was 200 million less than what we actually spent last year as we think about the options spending money and the 1 7 trillion budget that we have i think it is important to look at what the president said in his own statement of administration policy which was issued august 4 1999 in terms of his desires for the commerce justice state appropriations bill which this motion to instruct is directed at on the second page of that he talks about international affairs programs which ties back into what he vetoed today in terms of the foreign operations bill it is his message that the committee underfunds activities to support the ongoing conduct of effective diplomacy and does not fully fund payments to international organizations necessary to ensure unitedstates leadership in international affairs this weekend i happened to share my weekend on call that i do every 4 weeks in my medical practice in oklahoma starting friday night about 11 30 and finishing up about 4 30 this morning 10 young oklahomans came into this world the debate we are going to be having with the president whether we want to or not and whether we talk about it now or whether we talk about it in the future is going to be focused on these 10 young lives the fact is that the congress and the president all too often make decisions in the short term and in the short run what we find in the commerce justice state bill is many international organizations i thought i would just kind of look at what the bill as coming out of the house funded in terms of international organizations and affairs programs that the president objected to i just want to spend a minute talking about those there is 1 949 000 for funding the following programs the international copper study group the international cotton advisory committee the international lead and zinc study group the international rubber organization the international office of the wine and vine the international rubber study group the international seed testing association the international tropical timber organization and the international grains council the amount provided includes funding for travel and for arrears as we looked into some of these i think it is very important that the american public knows what these organizations do and remember this money very likely if the president has his way will come from the future benefits of these 10 babies that i delivered this weekend their future is going to be compromised because we are going to borrow money from their future to actually pay for this 1 949 000 let me give my colleagues a little outline of what the international office of the wine and vine does first of all remember that the wine industry in america exports 537 million worth of wine each year and it is growing each year in 1999 we sent 64 000 to this international organization i want members to know what we got for our money so we did a little research it turns out that the international office for the wine and vine wrote the rules for the chardonnay of the world competition that is a healthy very important thing for our taxpayers and these 10 new babies from oklahoma to be saddled with in the future a qualitative confrontation of the worlds best chardonnay that is where the american taxpayers dollars are going but that is not all the international office of the wine and vine also wrote a press release touting a danish study that confirmed that the consumption of wine has health benefits well our own surgeon general said that 15 years ago we know that and actually that was all we could find that they actually did for 1999 for 64 000 now let us talk about the rubber the administration has proposed funding not one but two rubber organizations dedicated to supporting the rubber supply industry not the rubber manufacturing industry but the rubber supply industry we spent 300 000 on the international rubber organization last year 111 000 on the international rubber study group the first organization we spent 300 000 what is their job to keep the price of rubber high to keep the price of raw rubber high we are a total importer of rubber raw rubber we produce no raw rubber in the united states so we spent 300 000 asking that organization to help keep the price of our imports high the third organization the international copper study group established in 1992 we spent 77 000 what did we get for our money you ask according to the web site you can order a number of products from the international copper study group we spent 77 000 but you cannot get any of that information unless you pay them bigtime bucks 350 for a report a directory of the copper mines in this country is 350 and if you want to use their database another 550 the american taxpayer has already paid for it these dollar figures do not sound like much but when we put it in perspective it does i want to pull up a couple of charts for a minute and let the members of the house see just in these international organizations 475 american families their tax rate if the average family is earning 55 000 they are paying 4 100 in federal income taxes that is what they are paying to fund this looking at it a different way the average senior in this country earns 9 396 receives that in terms of social security payments if we look at the amount of seniors that is the equivalent of shipping 207 seniors receipts overseas for programs that the president wants us to spend more money on in terms of international organizations mr president we are not going to spend a penny of social security this motion to instruct is to reaffirm what the house has already done and to say that we are going to stand by the appropriated amounts and not go any higher than the house level the senate version actually is somewhat lower we would expect you to be a better steward of our international moneys all we have to do is look at what has happened in russia we do not need more money for foreign aid because the money that we are sending in foreign aid whether it be through the international monetary fund whether it is through the world bank we are not a good steward of it all we have to do is trace the 3 to 4 billion that has been absconded from the money that we sent to russia i reserve the balance of my

that thank you by mr rogan q you recall that now a yes q thank you mr blumenthal did the president then relate a conversation he had with dick morris to you a he did q what was the substance of that conversation as the president related it to you a he said that he had spoken to dick morris earlier that day and that dick morris had told him that if nixon richard nixon had given a nationally televised speech at the beginning of the watergate affair acknowledging everything he had done wrong he may well have survived it and that was the conversation that dick morris thats what dick morris said to the president q did it sound to you like the president was suggesting perhaps he would go on television and give a national speech a well i dont know i didnt know q and when the president related the substance of his conversation with dick morris to you how did you respond to that a i said to the president well what have you done wrong q did he reply a he did q what did he say a he said i havent done anything wrong q and what did you say to that response a well i said as i recall thats one of the stupidest ideas i ever heard if you havent done anything wrong why would you do that q did the president then give you his account of what happened between him and monica lewinsky a as i recall he did q what did the president tell you a he uhhe spoke uh fairly rapidly as i recall at that point and said that she had come on to him and made a demand for sex that he had rebuffed her turned her down and that she uh threatened him and uh he said that she said to him uh that she was called the stalker by her peers and that she hated the term and that she would claim that they had had an affair whether they had or they hadnt and that she would tell people q do you remember him also saying that the reason monica lewinsky would tell people that is because then she wouldnt be known by her peers as the stalker anymore a yes thats right q do you remember the president also saying thatand im quoting ive gone down that road before ive caused pain for a lot of people im not going to do that again a yes he told me that q and that was in the same conversation that you had with the president a right inin that sequence q can you describe for us the presidents demeanor when he shared this information with you a yes he was uh very upset i thought he was a man in anguish q and at that point did you repeat your earlier admonition to him as far as not trying to help troubled people a i did ii think thats when i told him that you cant get near crazy people uh or troubled people uh youre president you just have to separate yourself from this q and im not sure based on your testimony if you gave that admonition to him once or twice let melet me clarify for you why my questioning suggested it was twice in your grand jury testimony on june the 4th at page 49 beginning at line 25 you began the sentence by saying and i quote and i repeated to the president a right q that he really needed never to be near people who were a right q troubled like this and so forth do you remember now if youif that was correct did you find yourself in that conversation having to repeat the admonition to him that youd given earlier a im sure i did uh i felti felt that pretty strongly he shouldnt be involved with troubled people q do you remember the president also saying something about being like a character in a novel a i do q what did he say a uh he said to me uh that uh he felt like a character in a novel uh he felt like somebody uh surrounded by uh an oppressive environment that was creating a lie about him he said he felt like uh the character in the novel darkness at noon q did he also say he felt like he cant get the truth out a yes ii believe he said that q politicians are always loathe to confess their ignorance particularly on videotape i will do so im unfamiliar with the novel darkness at noon did youdo you have any familiarity with that or did you understand what the president meant by that a ii understood what he meant ii was familiar with the book q whatwhat did he mean by that per your understanding a uh the book is by arthur koestler who was somebody who had been a communist and had become disillusioned with communism and its an anticommunist novel its about uh uh the stalinist purge trials and somebody who was a loyal communist who then is put in one of stalins prisons and held on trial and executed uh and its about his trial q did you understand what the president was trying to communicate when he related his situation to the character in that novel a i think he felt that the world was against him q i thought only members of congress felt that way mr blumenthal did you ever ask the president if he was ever alone with monica lewinsky a i did q what was his response a i asked him a number of questions that appeared in the press that day i asked him uh if he were alone and he said that uh he was within eyesight or earshot of someone when he was with her q what other questions do you remember asking him a uh there was a story in the paper that uh there were recorded messages uh left by him on her voicemail and i asked him if that were true q what did he say a he said uh that it was that uh he had called her q you had asked him about a press account that said there were potentially a number of telephone messages left by the president for monica lewinsky and he relayed to you that he called her did he tell you how many times he called her a hehe did he said he called once he said he called when uh betty curries brother had died to tell her that q and other than that one time that he shared that information with you he shared no other information respecting additional calls a no q he never

the floor again to talk about the subject of illegal narcotics and its impact on our society and tonight i would like to start with a small tribute first of all to our drug enforcement administration administrator tom constantine who will be feted tomorrow upon his retirement and i would like to first pay tribute to his tremendous service next month in just a few days tom constantine the administrator of the drug enforcement administration will retire and return to schenectady in new york where he lived prior to moving to washington d c and serving this administration tom constantine has been the administrator for dea for the past 5 years and he had a very long and distinguished career before he came to our nations capital mr constantine began his career as a deputy sheriff in erie county in new york in 1960 and became a state trooper in 1962 in 1986 he was named superintendent of the new york state police and he served in that position with great honor and recognition since tom constantine has taken over the dea in 1994 the agency has added 1 200 new agents and he is overseeing the revamping and the modernization of the agencys intelligence operations during his tenure he has initiated new programs to foster closer cooperation which is so important with our state and local law enforcement agencies and to enhance their ability to fight violent crime caused by drugs recently tom constantine opened a 29 million training academy for the agents of dea and also for our foreign state and local police that they participate in with training the facility which can house 250 trainees is located in quantico va mr constantine also was one of only 19 people ever to be named as an honorary fbi agent and for anyone aware of the longstanding rivalry between dea and fbi they really can know and appreciate the significance of this award and recognition over the past few years administrator constantine and the fbi director mr louis freeh bridged the gap between those two department of justice law enforcement agencies and i believe they increased the effectiveness of our law enforcement efforts against major drug trafficking organizations mr constantine believed that if mexican authorities wanted to hurt the drug trade then they could hunt down and arrest their countrys top smugglers and major drug lords and send them to the united states for trial and we know how many of them have been requested for extradition from that country as he stated in testimony before our subcommittee the one i chair which is the subcommittee on criminal justice drug policy and human resources there are 15 to 25 key drug traffickers who are primarily responsible for the drug trade cases have been prepared against them they have been indicted in the united states and arrest warrants have been issued but they still have not been extradited tom constantine i believe is one of the finest examples of law enforcement professionals to ever serve at any level in our law enforcement agencies whether it be local state or national his service to the safety and the wellbeing of our nation should be noted and i know that i join many other of my colleagues tonight on the eve of his being recognized on his retirement in saluting his fine work to both the drug enforcement administration and to every citizen in our nation tonight in addition to that small tribute to a great leader in the war on drugs mr tom constantine i would like to provide my colleagues and the american people with an update since my last speech last week on the floor on the topic of illegal narcotics and talk about the impact some of the happenings and some of the tragedies that have faced our nation and even our nations capital in the last week since i last talked on this subject then i would also like to talk about a geraldo rivera report which was aired a very lengthy report some of it accurate some of it inaccurate but since we have raised the question of legalization since we have raised the question of decriminalization since this topic is now very much in vogue in talk shows and special programs and in news reports i think that it is important that we deal with the facts and i would like to talk about those facts tonight the first thing in the update of some of the news the news relating to the war on drugs and the situation relating to crime that emanates from illegal narcotics continues to be bad just in todays washington post i would like to read from an editorial that said and i will quote the headline is shot 5 months old the latest stray gunfire victim may be the most innocent of all a 5monthold baby boy he was seated with his mother and a man on an apartment stoop in southeast washington on friday this past friday when they were shot in an attack by two masked gunmen the man apparently the intended victim is dead the mother is hospitalized the baby guiltless as a lamb is in critical condition as with hundreds of other children caught in the citys violence the wounded baby did not elect to enter this world neither did he choose to live in a neighborhood where drugs gangs or gun battles flourish i think if we look at our nations capital as an example and what a tragic example the last week with death and mayhem in the streets of our nations capital even critically wounding a 5monthold we see the roots of some of the problem in drug trafficking and illegal narcotics last week the nations capital congress anyone with any sensibility was absolutely distraught by what took place with the death and killing of a 55yearold grandmother in thedistrict of columbia we saw those of us who serve in washington our nations capital and the local residents in this area saw the funeral and the tragedy of again this slaying i thought i would read a little bit this is from the washington times about that tragedy and the root ofthat problem tuesday night police charged derek terrell jackson age 19 with first degree murder while armed in the shooting death of mrs fosterel 55 a grandmother who was shot in the back while shielding children from gunfire d c police said the cause of the southeast shooting is unusual in drugravaged areas of the city rival gangs normally shoot each other in turf wars an open air drug market has operated for years only a block away from ms fosterels backyard in the 100 block of 56th place southeast again headline a tragedy and a neighborhood filled with drugs crime violence todays washington post gives us a story under the crime and justice heading of maryland and if they are not killing each other they are killing innocent folks with guns this is an account from maryland in todays paper a 16yearold gaithersburg youth pleaded guilty yesterday to first degree murder in the slaying of a 15yearold who was beaten and stabbed to death after being blamed for a bad drug deal prosecutors said this goes on to say that the individual charged struck the teenager in the head with a large rock and stabbed him repeatedly after he begged for his life prosecutors said another tragedy in the area of our nations capital a 16yearold first bludgeoning a 15yearold and then stabbing him to death another report on thetuinei death this is from an associated press story in mckinney texas former dallas cowboy offensive tackle mark tuinei died of a lethal combination of heroin and a form of drug called ecstasy according to autopsy results released tuesday i spoke in a previous special order about the tragedy possibly being linked to illegal narcotics and here we see that deadly combination of heroin and ecstasy we find high purity heroin coming in from colombia and also from mexico and young people and even strong athletes do not realize the deadly potential of heroin just by itself and then to mix it with some other drug proves to be fatal not only in texas but as i cited in my own central florida area where we now have the number of drug overdose deaths in central florida exceeding the number of homicides further update on the news i spoke last week of an article relating to plano texas which has also been ravaged by drug deaths tonight there is a story that was published i believe over the weekend 62799 by tracy eaton in the dallas morning news a rather large story about the regions heroin supply and this would be the texas region linked to deaths in plano the headline says mexican production driving economy in the mexican area the story goes on and talks about the fields now of poppies again part of this administrations policy did not serve us well in certifying mexico and congress must also take the blame for certifying mexico with fully cooperating while it is increasing dramatically the production of illegal narcotics particularly black tar deadly heroin let me read a little bit from this story in the dallas morning news over the past 3 years and i think i cited this last week 18 young people from plano or with ties to the city have died of heroin overdoses plano with its wholesome reputation and allamerican city status is not the only spot that has been hit oklahoma city cleveland milwaukee seattle boston and atlanta have all seen tragic strings of heroinrelated deaths as part of what united states officials call a national epidemic let me quote and this is a quote the world is awash in heroin it is really a nightmare said retired army general barry mccaffrey he is director of the white house policy on drug control and our nations drug czar he goes on to say and let me quote barry mccaffrey he says ask our eighth graders are they fearful of using heroin and around 50 percent say no it is crazy that is what barry mccaffrey said our drug czar the article goes on to cite an interesting report this news reporter had obtained and let me read a little bit further it says a confidential unitedstates intelligent report obtained by the dallas morning news calls heroin and again this is a confidential report that the news folks have that we do not have it but it calls heroin and this is in quotes a growing national threat an increased supply of heroin is causing prices to drop and encouraging traffickers to develop new markets this in turn leads to a new generation of consumers that is the end of this confidential report maybe the administration does not want this to get out many of these new customers are in small towns and communities the report read and let me read again a quote from the report suburban consumers age 12now listen to this suburban consumers age 12 to 25 have been one of the fastestgrowing user groups the report read then it goes on to another quote heroin use among women of all ages has increased significantly so the most vulnerable in our society our young people age 12 to 25 are becoming our leading consumers they go on to cite how heroin deaths nationwide have nearly doubled since this administration took office according to the latest government statistics i always quote the absolutely startling statistic since 1992 1993 again with the institution of this administrations drug policy heroin use among our teenage population has soared 875 percent this is a story today in the dallas morning news that i thought would be of interest and provide my colleagues with a little update let me talk a little bit more about the impact of illegal narcotics and drug deaths and what is happening again a sampling just a recent case just in the past few months there has been a distressing number of drugrelated deaths this is in new york for example heroin users in the east village of new york city have been overdosing at an alarming pace this year according to a report one local expert estimates that more than 30 people have died from heroin overdoses since midmay it is suspected that the high purity levels are poisoning people who are not prepared for its strength and i spoke about the tuinei case a very strong athlete who died from a heroin ecstasy overdose in orlando last march a heroin overdose victim was left to die as his friends watched him turn blue from suffocation the victim was left sitting on a toilet for 8 hours after he was found semiconscious in his bathroom he was then moved to a bedroom where he stayed for 4 hours before someone called 911 at least one of his friends played video games while his friend died in the next room two roommates in san francisco died of a socalled flesheating bacteria this is recently after injecting themselves with mexican black tar heroin this should be good news for the heroin users out there that this flesheating bacteria is now a special surprise from the mexican heroin producers two others were hospitalized with the infection the bacteria suspected in the deaths produces toxin that degrade human tissue it is suspected that the bacteria may be in the dirt that adheres to the drug in the processing facilities in mexico another report and this is also from my area in sanford florida central florida a gentleman there plowed into a car driven by a pregnant woman which caused the premature delivery and death of her twin sons he had cocaine valium and methadone in his system the concentrations found in his blood indicated that he had probably taken one dose of each of the three drugs within 24 hours of the crash the pregnant woman was 7 months pregnant at the time the crash pinned her in the car once freed she was flown to the hospital where doctors delivered the boys 13 weeks premature one of the boys died the day of the crash and the other the next day this is an example again that i cite time and time again of drugrelated deaths these two premature babies may not be counted in the 14 000plus that were killed last year because of drugrelated deaths those who were on our highways and in highway fatalities may or may not be counted those who were suicides may or may not be counted those who again have died in some other fashion may or may not be counted here is an example of several more lives snuffed out by illegal narcotics in probably the biggest social problem that we have facing our nation this month a former nurse accused of holding 2 women hostage for nearly 3 days in a hospital then killing one and critically injuring another had struggled with a heroin problem for more than 15 years how will those deaths be recorded how will those injuries be recorded in texas last week a man convicted of beating his girlfriends 4yearold daughter to death because babysitting kept him from buying drugs was sentenced to death by lethal injection in a murder that shocked mexico early this month and i think i cited this death before and it takes quite an incident to shock mexico but early this month a prominent tv and radio celebrity francisco stanley was gunned down in broad daylight by two men who sprayed the victims car with automatic fire mr stanley was carrying credentials provided by the ministry of interior identifying him as a federal agent additionally autopsy results indicate that he was a cocaine user mexican media reports have stated that he may have dealt cocaine in the show business world the way the killing occurred has led investigators to suspect that in fact this too was the work of drug traffickers that is a little bit on some of the recent news and an update on some of the cases i have cited before this past week our subcommittee on criminal justice drug policy and human resources conducted a hearing on the topic of the del toro case in particular and the subject that we posed and the title of the hearing was getting away with murder is mexico a safe haven for killers or drug dealers and in particular the del toro case the del toro case is an absolutely heinous crime that was committed by a united states citizen even though his name is del toro he was born in the united states he was not a mexican national he was born to unitedstates citizens there is no question from the testimony we had or from what law enforcement has made public that on november 7 1997 sheila belush was found murdered in her home in sarasota florida she was murdered while her young children some of them just babies were left with her with the body this is a particularly heinous crime as isaid she was shot then she was finished off with a kitchen knife stabbed in her own home in sarasota her husband testified before our subcommittee asking for justice jose luis del toro fled to mexico and has used the mexican corrupt judicial system to flee from justice from the united states we have asked for his extradition and it has been refused again the system which is so corrupt which we heard about in this hearing denied justice to mr belush and the children that she left behind this is not the only case of an extradition request being ignored by the mexican government it is one of dozens and dozens in fact in the last 10 years there have been 275 requests of extradition and in particular relating to murders and illegal drug dealers drug lords we have some 30 or 40 requests of these major traffickers and murderers that have been ignored to date not one mexican national has been extradited to the united states only after complete disruption caused by members of congress and by others have we received one american a mr martin was returned several weeks ago but this committee or this subcommittee showed that justice is not being done in the del toro case that the mexican judicial system is becoming a haven for murderers and drug dealers and that that country is not complying with simple requests for extradition anyone who heard the testimony of this father this husband and the details of how this crime was committed against his family and to hear the pain he has suffered and they have suffered in losing the wife and mother of these children would cry out also for justice again this is not the only case tonight i might cite a couple of cases just for information of the congress first of all first of all i often refer to mexico as a haven for drug dealers certainly one of our major wanted individuals is rafael caroquintero he is a drug lord who is wanted for the kidnapping and killing of our united states dea agent special agent enrique camarena 14 years ago unfortunately justice has not prevailed in the del toro case in the murder of sheila belush justice has not prevailed in the just incredible again heinous torture death of enrique camareno who was tortured to death and rafael caroquintero has been convicted of kidnapping and killing our united states agent special agent camareno was kidnapped and tortured by this individual and his cohorts his cohorts i might say included and we have evidence of this scores of mexican police and mexican government accomplices who participated in again the murder and torture of our drug enforcement agent some 14 years ago caroquintero ordered the killing because raids organized by camareno our agent ware disrupting his drug operations the united states would like this individual extradited so that justice can be served in the united states in the camareno death again at least this individual was responsible for organizing the death and mayhem committed against our dea agent this is one individual tonight we also have with us an individual another individual who is a drug dealer this is agustin vasquezmendoza mr vasquezmendoza is believed to be responsible for the 1994 murder of another united states dea agent and that is dea special agent richard fahs vasquezmendoza is not believed to have been the actual trigger man but he was the criminal mastermind behind the murder of special agent fahs our special agent dea agent was fatally wounded by vasquezmendozas henchmen during an undercover drug buy in glendale arizona after the murder vasquezmendoza fled to mexico where he is still believed to be hiding we have indicted this individual we have also requested the mexican government to extradite that individual so that he also can meet justice in the united states and under our system where we know he would be tried fairly and where we have the evidence to convict that individual i might say there is a 2 2 million award for information leading to the arrest or conviction of this fugitive again his name is agustin vasquezmendoza and the date of birth is march 23 1974 and he is suspected of being in mexico there will be 2 2 million for return of this individual and also having this individual agustin vasquezmendoza brought to justice those are a couple of points i wanted to make and bring folks up to date relating to news in the drug war and also the hearing that we conducted in our subcommittee on the question of extradition and two of our unfortunately numerous cast of individuals who have been indicted and we have requests that have been ignored by the mexican government for extradition to see justice in the united states additionally tonight i wanted to spend some time as i said earlier talking about a report that aired on television i saw it over the weekend geraldo rivera had over the weekend at least a 1hour story there was a series of stories he called it drug bust the longest war and he had some information that was correct and he had some information in it that was way off base i thought it would be important to set the record straight particularly since so many members of congress and the general public watch some of these shows and obtain information about what is going on in the war on drugs from these reports i think it is critical again to correct information that came out first of all i think geraldo rivera did a fairly accurate job describing the situation in mexico the corruption that exists the drug lords running rampant the problem with no extradition the interviews relating to again corrupt activities and drug activities in mexico being conducted in a routine manner and very few people being brought to justice i think also the report did summarize that part of the problem was that the congress and also the administration we must say did not bring mexico to task and that has been a difficulty in trying to get members of congress to pay attention to this problem the major source of illegal narcotics some 60 to 70 percent of the hard drugs cominginto the united states heroin cocaine methamphetamines come from and through mexico as i cited mexico is now a major producer producing 14 percent of all the heroin coming into the united states i think the report was on target about some of the problems also on target that this congress has not responded and this administration has not responded in appropriately decertifying mexico for trade and for financial benefits because the dollar has reigned supreme here and both members of congress and the administration are afraid in any way to impact that trade that business that finance that is unfortunate that we have allowed our neighbors to the south to become close to a narcotrafficking state it is not at the stage of a colombia but if it continues the whole system of justice the entire governmental process could be lost and it could become a narcoterrorist state that is not that farfetched mr rivera had in his report some statements that i believe need correction he went on to talk about waging the war on drugs and said that the war on drugs is basically a failure in fact i have a transcript of his report let me read a little bit of it it says we have always made waging the war the top priority if only we could get more boats more planes more soldiers we could win this fight then his second sentence here is drug treatment has always been a distant second place now first of all we have to deal with the facts now i know mr geraldo rivera is not noted for always dealing with the facts but i thought it would be an interesting approach to try to bring some of the facts out tonight that he spoke about first of all he thinks that the emphasis during this administration has been on getting more boats more planes and more soldiers well mr rivera is wrong in fact i had our staff pull up subcommittee staff pull up drug spending for interdiction and this would be the account under which we would get more planes more boats more soldiers the military spending if we could trace this chart before 1991 maybe we could focus on this chart here but you would see from early 1980 when president reagan took office a steady increase in expenditures for interdiction this would be using the military and other sources getting to drugs just as they came out of their source interdicting them before they come to our borders that certainly has to be a federal responsibility you would see that all the way up to 1992 with president bush and that was his policy in 1993 and again you have to remember the democrats controlled the white house the senate and the house of representatives by overwhelming majorities in the legislative bodies and of course the executive agency the presidency they began a steady decline and it went right to 1995 in expenditures in fact there are some absolutely incredible figures and let me see if i can dig those up here about the cuts that were made well you can seeright here for example just in military spending on the war on drugs there was a 50 percent cut during that period then the other part of this would be what about what is going on now well i put this little cover on here to show that with the republicans taking over congress we have restarted the war on drugs the war on drugs basically ended in january of 1993 when this president took office we restarted the war on drugs and you can see from this period in here ivhere the new majority took over to here we have just begun to get back to the point where we were and we still are not there even this shows a projection for 1999 to get beyond where we were but again this chart shows the actual spending on boats planes and soldiers now of course this is also shown in 1999 dollars and we began in 1991 dollars so we actually have a net decrease in spending the war on drugs was closed down by this administration in the area of international programs now international programs in this category again if we looked at what this does this is stopping drugs at their source while this program dealing with the military was in the several billion dollar range again the military is still operating they are operating in the caribbean they are operating around the world they have been operating in panama they have been operating from our bases and they have a military mission so it is slightly different i would have to even argue about that being a total cost it is something that they are given as an additional mission this budget deals with federal drug spending for the international work that would be at the source country this is in the millions of dollars back with president reagan and president bush we would have seen the same curve from the early eighties to 1992 with president bush in office then we saw basically again a closedown in the war on drugs this chart shows exactly what took place on january 1 1993 this president took office closed down the war on drugs this is particularly significant because this is stopping drugs at their source now if you took cocaine for example 100 percent of the cocaine was grown with coca in peru and bolivia this is the 19921993 era we knew exactly where the cocaine was and it can only grow at certain altitudes in the coca bush et cetera they closed this down we saw huge increases in production what happens here is when we stop spending money closest to where the drugs are produced you have greater production and we will talk about that in just a second but this is the most effective way if you could stop drugs for example we have been able if you look when the republicans took over here working with speaker hastert who was then chairman of the national security international affairs criminal justice subcommittee which had oversight over drug policy in the prior congress this is where we restarted this program and this is where we achieved in two countries that we would operate with that we had permission from the administration to operate with peru and bolivia we have now cut their production by 50 percent of cocaine actually where the administration had a terrible policy in colombia colombia has now become in the last six years the major producer of cocaine they are actually growing it and producing it processing it the largest producer in the world so our program in these two areas has been significant in cutting 50 percentbf the supply the administration stopped military assistance helicopters supplies equipment on sort of a human rights basis and i could spend the rest of the evening talking about that bogus position which has now turned colombia into the major cocaine and heroine producing country in 1993 there was no heroin produced really to speak of in columbia now colombia is again through the policy of this administration not getting the guns boats and ammunition to that country the direct policy of this administration and is now becoming the major producer i also put a little cover on this to show what we have done in the last year to try to get us back up to the levels because stopping illegal narcotics is far less costly and again this is only in the millions of dollars as opposed to the billions of dollars on the other charts if we can stop the supply we can at its source eliminate a lot of the interdiction costs and the law enforcement costs what is absolutely fascinating is staff produced this little graph and this graph is very interesting because it shows that 12th grade drug use among our young people actually mirrored the spending patterns of this administration when they decreased the amount for international programs and interdiction what happened is the supply increased the price went down it was available and when heroin can be bought for the price of marijuana or cocaine you have developed a nice market and a young audience and consumer group that we have heard about that again begins using this hard stuff coming in this is an incredible graph because it absolutely mirrors the pattern of failure that this administration adopted now again mr rivera said here drug treatment has always been a distant second place this is not something i made up i am quoting from the text which we obtained of his program another myth mr rivera made and that is borne out by this chart this chart shows at the bottom the actual amount of dollars expended on drug treatment if we go back to 1991 and we compare it with 1999 we see that in fact drug treatment expenditures have gone up almost every single year there is one year in here 1996 where it did not go up but we have actually doubled the amount of moneyplus on drug treatment so it is not taking a distant second place and this is the policy also adopted in 1993 by this administration to spend more money on treatment cut the interdiction the source country programs and put emphasis here so this policy and liberalization policy which we have pointed out not only gives us more spending for treatment but more people to treat and we use baltimore as a great example it has now risen to 39 900 heroin addicts in the city of baltimore through a liberal policy again this debunks some of the statements that were made by mr rivera in his recent account it is interesting too that in todays washington post and possibly in other publications across the country our drug czar barry mccaffrey made an opinion editorial piece that was published and let me read from that and what he says first of all let me pick up on the part about the effectiveness of some of these programs drug use in this country has declined by half since 1979 the number of users dropped from 25 million in 1979 to 13 million in 1996 again this does not coincide with what the report of mr rivera said and again this is according to our drug czar you would think that under the republican administration there might be less spent on drug treatment and again im quoting from barry mccaffrey the head of our office of drug policy under the clinton administration and this is his quote in this oped today in the past 4 years the administration increased spending i have to beg to differ with him but the republican majority increased spending on prevention by 55 percent while spending on treatment rose 25 percent so treatment and prevention in fact have risen dramatically under this republicancontrolled congress contrary to mr riveras statement that drug treatment has always been a distant second place additionally the liberal policies we found actually create a bigger dependent population i thought it was interesting what mr mccaffrey said about who commits crime and who is responsible for the disproportionate share of our nations violence that we hear about and these are his words drug dependent individuals are responsible for a disproportionate percentage of our nations violent and incomegenerating crimes such as robbery burglary or theft the national institute of justice surveys consistently find that between onehalf and threequarters of all arrestees have drugs in their system at the time of the arrest in 1997 a third of state prisoners and about one in five federal prisoners said they had committed the crimes that led to incarceration while under the influence of drugs this is again part of the oped of general mccaffrey then the myth about liberalization and that we should allow more folks to become addicts and hooked on hard drugs and that this is harmless and this is what barry mccaffrey says in h5 03 todays oped injection drug users place themselves at great risk a university of pennsylvania study of philadelphia injection drug users found that four times as many addicts died from overdose homicide heart disease renal failure and liver disease as did from causes associated with hiv disease dr james curtis director of addiction services at harlem hospital center explains and this is a quote from him it is false misleading and unethical to give addicts the idea that they can be intervenous drug abusers without suffering serious injury so in fact the myth that we have folks behind bars and again i appreciate the sensationalism that mr geraldo rivera tries to provide and some of it is entertaining but we must deal with facts particularly on such a serious subject as what is happening in our society as a result of illegal narcotics trafficking mr rivera in his piece cited and again from his transcripts two women and one with tears in her eyes testified that she had only been arrested this one time on drug trafficking and in fact i think she said whe was duped she claimed into carrying a package of cocaine for a drug dealer that was one case the second lady who had received a mandatory sentence was there because she was dealing with four ounces of cocaine he also cited that most of the people in federal prison were nonviolent offenders well the facts are a little bit different and i have cited this study but a study just out from the new york state commissioner of criminal justice reports that in 1996 87 percent of the 22 000 people in jail in new york for drug crimes were in for selling drugs or intent to sell of the 13 percent doing time for possession 76 percent were arrested for selling drugs and pleading down to possession the study further shows that the most convicted firsttime drug offenders end up on probation or in treatment again contrary to what this national report by geraldo rivera tried to portray it just does not hold water in fact at a recent hearing we held in the subcommittee on criminal justice drug policy and human resources the drug czar from florida mr jim mcdonough testified that in a thousand cases they looked at only 14 out of the total were there for possession and in fact some of that may have been also watered down for other offenses the facts are that in fact virtually all convicted criminals who go to prison are violent offenders repeat offenders or violent repeat offenders it is simply a myth that our prison cells are filled with people who do not belong there or that we would somehow be safer if fewer people were in prison a scientific survey of state prisoners conducted by the unitedstates department of justice found that 62 percent of the prison population had a history of violence and that 94 percent of the state prisoners had committed one or more violent crimes or served a previou sentence of incarceration or probatiofi the new york study that we cited last week and again tonight was interesting it was a rather indepth study and it showed that in new york for example one reallyhad to work at it to be incarcerated in prison and that no one was there just for a minor offense or for even for a firsttime felony in california the 1994 prison population rose to 125 000 inmates numberous experts and journalists insisted the states prisons were overflowing with firsttime offenders and harmless parole violators the results of another study this california department of corrections analysis of randomly selected felony offenders admitted to the states prison and classified as nonviolent reveals that 88 5 percent of these offenders had one or more prior adult convictions the average number of prior convictions was 4 7 a fifth of these socalled nonviolent felons had been committed to prison once or twice before there is study after study to refute what geraldo rivera would try to lead the american people and the congress to believe a 1996 study of individuals in prison in wisconsin found that about 91 percent of the prisoners had a current or prior adult juvenile conviction for a violent crime about 7 percent of the prisoners were in for drug trafficking none were sentenced solely for possession or as a drug user and fewer than 2 percent were firsttime drug or property offenders prisoners served less than half their sentence time behind bars and 82 percent were eligible for discretionary parole within a few years so the facts are not as presented again sensationally by geraldo rivera they do show a different picture if we just take a few minutes to look at them according to a study published in the journal of american medical association last year nondrug users who live in households where drugs including marijuana are used are 11 times as likely to be killed as those living in drugfree households drug abuse in a home increased a womans risk of being killed by a close relative some 28 times so again the myths that were portrayed in this presentation tried to make us feel warm and fuzzy about releasing folks into the population i do not want to say that we do not need to treat folks in prison and i think a very good case could be made for that but we must have effective treatment programs not only in prison but also for other individuals such as those portrayed those individuals such as the young woman who was on drugs as a young man who went back to drugs we must work together to find solutions to this incredible problem facing our society but we must also not just listen to the geraldo riveras but to the facts about drugs and illegal narcotics and their impact on our society china"],

california i am in my fifth year as a member of congress from oklahoma i am also in my last term as a selfimposed term limit on myself one of the reasons i think that we only have 40 percent of the people voting in elections is that in fact there is a crisis of confidence in the congress of the united states i want to spend some time tonight outlining what we have heard many people say whether it is the president in his state of the union speech or others in terms about our budget this socalled surplus that does not exist explain to the american people why it does not exist and what it is really made of and then talk about some of the facts of the last 3 or 4 years of what has gone on and what we can expect in the future if in fact we do not have honesty with the american public in terms of our budget the budget process and speaking honestly about where american tax dollars go i also might add that besides being a medical doctor who continues to practice and deliver babies on the weekends and the days that we are not in session my original training is as an accountant i can tell my colleagues there is not an accountant in this country that would sign off on the books of the federal government the reason is because it moves money around it does not account for it it uses the same money twice and then claims it as a surplus to start this discussion i really want to try to explain to the american public the social security trust fund most people are paying 12 5 percent half of it themselves half of it by their employers in to fund the social security system at the present time we have a significant excess number of dollars coming in above and beyond what is required to pay out benefits for our seniors under social security what really happened is we are collecting more than we are spending in terms of social security dollars what happens now is that the federal government uses the excess social security money to pay for more spending and to pay off publicly held debt but as they pay off publicly held debt they incur another debt and that is an iou to the trust fund that says we will pay this back that also incurs interest the fancy way washington talks about that is that that is a surplus in fact it is only a surplus in that we have transferred the obligation to our children and grandchildren and they will pay that back through increased payroll taxes so we put ious that are credited to the trust fund in 2013 we face a major problem and that is the year in which the revenues that come into the social security trust fund will be less than the payments that we have to pay out what is going to happen then social security spends more than it collects in order to pay all the social security benefits social security is going to have to try to collect from the federal government on the ious the money the congress has borrowed what happens having spent all the money the federal government has to raise the income taxes or the payroll taxes on the people who are paying social security taxes just to meet the obligations that is borne out a little bit better when we actually see what the social security administration says about what is going to happen to the fund as you can see all this in red is actually money coming in to social security in excess of what we are paying out you will notice in 2013 we actually spend more money but if you go out to the end of this graph what you will see is we are getting close to 750 billion more a year in payments from general tax revenues or increased raises in the tax paid on hourly wages in this country we have a terrible picture developing i say all this because the politicians in washington claim we have a surplus there is no surplus the money that they are using to pay down external debt is actually money they are going to be obligating our grandchildren for with a treasury iou that is interestbearing that money is a false surplus all it is is the difference between what we paid out and what we have collected versus what we have spent more in other revenues that the federal government has taken in we are going to have only three options in 2013 and better we only have three options now to fix this problem one we can save 100 percent of the social security surplus and we can transition to a system that increases the earnings for all payments on social security between now and 2013 and thereafter the annualized yield the return on the investment on social security over the last 20 years has been less than 1 percent we would have been better to put it in a passbook savings account by 300 percent in terms of the power of compound interest had we done that we would have displaced this day of reckoning where the imbalance in payments out versus revenue in would have been at least delayed another 10 to 12 maybe even 15 years had they gotten some return i think the other point that needs to be made why are we in trouble on social security we are in trouble on social security because politicians easily spend your money without coming and saying were going to give you an increased benefit but were not going to tell you that your children and grandchildren are going to have to pay that back how do they pay that back they pay that back by lowering their standard of living and sending more of their hardearned dollars to washington to pay for the benefits today that we did not have the courage to tell the american public that for this benefit this increase in benefit we have to pay for it what is easy to do in washington i have found in 5 years is to pass on a benefit and not be responsible for paying for it it is called spin the real thing it is called is a halftruth a halftruth my daddy taught me was a whole lie we have seen a lie the second option we have we can repay the money from the trust fund by raising income taxes we are at the highest rate of taxing the american public that we have ever been with the exception of world war ii almost 22 percent of our gross domestic product is now consumed by taxes in this country that is not a good option the third option is we can change the retirement system we can delay the onset we can decrease the benefits that is just like we have done to the veterans we promise one thing and then we deliver far less it is not a principle of integrity to do something less than what you commit to do so we only have three options when we are faced with social security i want to just develop this for about another 5 minutes and then i will recognize the gentleman from minnesota now we hear washington say we have a surplus but the fact is is every day 275 million is added to the national debt if we have a surplus if we have more money coming in than we are paying out how come the debt for our children and grandchildren is rising it is because we are not honest in our bookkeeping we are not honest about it in 1997 each citizens share of the national debt was 19 898 by the end of this year every man woman and child from baby to grandmom will owe 20 693 you cannot have a surplus and the debt rise the question that the american people should ask when they hear the word surplus is did the debt go down there is another tricky word that the politicians use they say publicly held debt because that is the debt that is external to the internal ious that the government has paid or made with social security so it is true that the externalheld debt of the united states went down but only because we took money from the social security trust fund and wrote another iou so the total debt in terms of the social security increased revenues or excess revenues have not changed at all we have just decided we are not going to pay ourselves and we will slow down the pain to those people on the outside so less debt is held by the public that is true but the total debt is rising and as my colleagues can see it is rising 275 million per day and where i come from 275 million is one whole heck of a lot of money it is about enough to run the state of oklahoma for a month so we are talking about huge sums of money again i would make the point washington says we have a surplus if we have a surplus why is the debt that our grandchildren and children are going to have to bear rising why is it going up it is because we are not honest in our bookkeeping another way of looking at that and this chart shows exactly what we have seen and heard about 1998 is what i call the politicians surplus here is what we claim was a surplus the washington establishment but as my colleagues will note here is the debt in 1997 what has happened to the debt the debt went from 5 325 trillion to close to 5 440 trillion almost a 120 billion increase so if the surplus was 60 some billion dollars how come the debt went up 120 billion look what is projected in 1999 we are going to have this great big surplus that everybody wants to save or spend in a certain way but look what the debt projection is these are not my numbers these are from the congressional budget office a nonpartisan agency made up and influenced by both democrats and republicans and they are saying the debt is going to continue to rise despite this surplus so i think we can see that there is a lack of honesty about our budget policy and there is only one answer it is called restrained spending we have to be fiscally disciplined in the money that comes to the federal government the other thing i have learned is that if we leave money in washington do my colleagues know what happens to it it gets spent somebody always has a goodidea on a way to spend the money except the money we are spending now we are stealing from the social security system and we are transferring a lowered standard of living to our children and what we can see under president clintons budget and this is real numbers by the congressional budget office under the budget that he proposes to see that there is no surplus the red indicates real deficit in terms of moneys in versus moneys out and even though all sides of the aisle democrat republican and the president are claiming the surplus we can see from here that one does not exist even with a conservative plan that restrains spending we are still going to see a deficit up until about 2000 it may be that the economy is good enough that we may see a real surplus this year but look at the difference if we restrain spending in terms of real surplus in other words something that will actually slow down the growth and the debt decrease the debt decrease or in an inverse increase the standard of living for our children that if in fact we will restrain spending that in fact we will markedly help the children of tomorrow mr gutknecht"],

delaware it is a bipartisan bill aimed at giving greater flexibility to local schools to do their job the important job they do of educating our children during the past couple of months i have visited 10 or 12 schools in my district and visited the school districts there to sort of find out what they think of the federal role in education the federal role in education usually accounts for about 4 to 8 percent of the budgets of the average school district and i wanted to know if they thought that was helping the answer i got back was yes the money helps but there is too much red tape and there is too much regulation they want greater freedom so that they can exercise their skills and use the teachers and principals and parents and everybody involved in education on the local level there is too much federal red tape and the education flexibility act would target that red tape right now we have a pilot project that allows some 12 states in the country to take advantage of education flexibility this bill would expand it to all 50 states and what it would do is give local school districts the ability to get waivers from those federal regulations but the important thing about education flexibility is that it combines flexibility with accountability which is the way it ought to be done you can get the waiver the local school districts can get the waiver from the federal requirements but only if they have local standards that they can demonstrate that they are meeting the key word in there is local not national standards they can have their own standards but they have to have that accountability flexibility mix the education flexibility act that is being proposed and introduced this week offers that mix and is a key to helping our schools move forward with the important job they do of reforming the education system and educating our children i think it is very important that we go further than the education flexibility act right now there is far too much red tape and far too many regulations in hundreds of different areas generated from the federal government that does not really help our local schools but only ties them in knots i do not want the people working in the schools in my community to spend all of their time filling out forms and justifying their existence to the federal government i want them to be educating the children there and doing the job that really matters right now far too often they are filling out the forms and trying to qualify for the money and continually justifying what they axe doing we need to change that we need to shift to local control from one end of this country to the other exciting things are going on in states and school districts they are making the reforms necessary they are moving towards accountability and right now the federal government is too big of a noose stopping them from making progress on that we need to make changes like the education flexibility act as a democrat i have always been a strong supporter of education and i support my fellow democrats in supporting spending the money necessary to help with education and supporting public education public education is responsible for over 90 percent of the children in this country getting educated it needs our support but we cannot simply spend money on it we must show that we are willing to move in two other critical directions one is accountability and the other is flexibility which means local control giving the power back to the individual school districts and the individual schools and ultimately to the teachers and parents who are closest to the product closest to our children and closest to educating them and who know best how to do it we need to make those changes so that we can have the world class public education system we need the education flexibility act that we introduce this week as i mentioned primarily sponsored by the gentleman from indiana and the gentleman from delaware is a

conservation wildlife and oceans for yielding let me say from the start that i very much appreciate the cooperation of the gentleman from new jersey and his staff for working with the minority in shaping this legislation i do not oppose the minor changes that have been made in the bill since it was reported by the committee on resources certainly the bill falls short of what i think could be done to strengthen and protect the coastal barrier resources system nonetheless i believe we have effectively eliminated the most problematic provisions to arrive at a fair consensus and i urge members of this body to support the bill this legislation would reauthorize the coastal barrier resources act when congress passed the coastal barriers act in 1982 it declared that the purpose of the act was to and i quote minimize loss of life wasteful expenditure of federal revenues and the damage to fish wildlife and other natural resources associated with coastal barriers by restricting future federal expenditures and financial assistance which have the effect of encouraging development of coastal barriers this innovative policy has made good sense since 1982 and it continues to make good sense even today hurricane floyd as we have recently seen again demonstrates the wisdom and benefits of discouraging development in some of the most dangerous hazardprone coastal areas of our nation most importantly this legislation will begin the long overdue process of modernizing coastal barrier resource system maps section 5 of this bill would direct the secretary of the interior to conduct a pilot study to determine the feasibility and costs of creating a digitized series of coastal barrier maps current maps were prepared in the 1980s by using primarily color infrared aerial photography and unitedstates geological survey quadrangle sheets handrendered delineations of coastal barriers were drawn upon these sheets in order to produce the inventory of coastal barrier maps however major technological advancements such as the new digital spatial data global positioning systems computerized geographic information systems and the new cartographic and survey methods make far greater detail and accuracy now possible it is essential for the fish and wildlife service to investigate how these new information systems and mapping technologies might enhance the accuracy usability and transferability of existing coastal barrier maps we will be looking for the fish and wildlife service to expedite completion of this pilot study as soon as possible i am however disappointed that we were not able to consider more creative ways to increase the amount of undeveloped coastal barriers in the system and i suspect that the congress will have to revisit this matter at a later time this legislation does authorize the voluntary donation of private property for inclusion in the system however it remains doubtful that any significant tracts of additional private land will be forthcoming in the absence of any new inducements to encourage donations nevertheless we encourage the fish and wildlife service to pursue aggressively opportunities for donations should they become available i am also compelled to express my sense of concern with the inability of the fish and wildlife service to complete and submit to the congress a study of undeveloped coastal barriers along the pacific coast the secretary of the interior was directed in 1990 under section 6 of the coastal barrier improvement act to prepare and submit a study which examines the need for protecting undeveloped coastal barriers along the pacific coast south of 49 degrees north latitude through inclusion in the system the secretary of the interior was also directed to prepare maps identifying the boundaries of those undeveloped coastal barriers of the united states bordering the pacific ocean south of 49 degrees north latitude all deliverables were to be provided to the congress not later than 12 months after the date of enactment of the 1990 law well the fish and wildlife service has failed to provide congress with either a final report or the maps this 8year delay is plainly unacceptable i am greatly concerned that the pace and growth of the new developments along the pacific coast may have significantly reduced the number of coastal areas that meet the section 31 definition of undeveloped coastal barrier i urge the fish and wildlife service to complete this directive as soon as possible finally i would be remiss if i did not restate the minoritys longstanding concern with the majoritys decision to include three other separate technical correction bills as section 6 7 and 8 in this reauthorization bill these provisions would change existing boundaries for three different otherwise

these proposed changes are given appropriate scrutiny yet even today we are still awaiting additional information from the fish and wildlife service concerning the boundaries of a coastal barrier unit adjacent to the cape hatteras national seashore it is my understanding from the chairman that we will continue to work in good faith to resolve issues concerning this final boundary consequently we have agreed to move forward with this reauthorization bill at this time however should this boundary issue not be resolved to our satisfaction we do reserve our right to reconsider support of this

defenders of human rights and freedom in this body for yielding me this time i rise as a proud supporter of this resolution which commemorates the 10year anniversary of one of the most astounding historical events of the 20th century the fall of the berlin wall and the collapse of communism throughout central europe what started out as a trickle solidaritys victories in poland during june of 1989 hungary opening up its border with austria later that summer led to a deluge of east germans flooding across the berlin wall and a few weeks after that the velvet revolution in czechoslovakia took place and no one could predict these events and no one knew how to react to these events one of my most cherished possessions that i still keep here in washington with me on my desk is this chunk of the berlin wall it still has graffiti painted on it coincidentally it is shaped like the state of wisconsin but it is a chunk that i personally whacked out of the berlin wall on october 3 1990 during the reunification celebration when i was over there as a student traveling throughout central europe this came at a crucial time in my life as a third year law student i was watching these historical events unfold with rapt attention like the rest of the world was but i was feeling a little bit disillusioned and a little bit cynical about our own political process here in this country so i decided a few months after the revolution had taken place to travel through central europe to visit the european capitals live out of a backpack survive on cheese and bread during that time and see firsthand these remarkable changes taking place i met when i was traveling through there the real heroes in my mind of the revolutions and the changes that took place they were students such as myself about my age who had literally on the front lines of the demonstrations literally looking down the barrel of communist guns and facing soviet tanks not knowing whether they were going to succeed or whether this was going to turn into a massacre they knew their countries individual histories 1968 prague spring 1956 hungary when the communist authorities did in fact crack down and as history later showed during the velvet revolution the politburo voted 5 to 4 not to use force to bring down the demonstrations one vote could have made all the difference in prague during that fall of i asked many of these students what they remembered most about those demonstrations and the events and they said two things how terribly cold it was as they were maintaining candlelight vigils all night long and the fear that they felt again not knowing whether or not the military was going to open fire on them but perhaps the most important wall that fell in that region to make this all possible was not even visible it was the wall of fear that fell and we cannot overestimate the role that fear does play in any totalitarian or authoritarian regime to keep them in power but this was made possible because mikhail gorbachev as the gentleman from california already indicated changed the dynamics in the region by denouncing the use of force in order to keep communist governments in power by pursuing his policies of glasnost and perestroika the general opening of information and ideas in these regions it diminished the fear and empowered people to have the courage to demand change perhaps it is the greatest magnificent irony that one of the most oppressive communist regimes in that area czechoslovakia would later be led by former poets and playwrights vaclav havel the first democratically elected president in czechoslovakia was a former playwright himself the first democratically elected president since masaryk and edvard benes just before the second world war he was the founder of charter 77 the moral blueprint for change in the area and also founded the civic forum that gave the people in czechoslovakia the political alternative to the communist regime but not before he was imprisoned on four separate occasions in fact during one of those imprisonments he was on his deathbed literally the communist authorities did not want a martyr on their hands so they went to him and said listen the people who give out the obie award will allow you to direct your own play in new york and get proper medical attention and he said i just have one question if i go will you allow me back in and they could not give that assurance and so he refused the rest as we say is now history but in conclusion i just want to pay a special tribute and wish a special happy 10year anniversary to those students who really were on the front lines and showed through their courage that there are causes and ideals greater than ones self that are worth risking everything for so on this day my thoughts and my memories go to many of those students who i personally had a chance to meet and who inspired me to get involved in public service when i did return to the united

the world that we want to at farm programs but unless we deal with the fact that the agriculture industry is largely dominated by oligopolies we are not going to do very much to help either the consumer or the farmer in the process there are four companies that now control 81 percent of cattle purchases beef processing and wholesale marketing and in only 5 years we have seen the margin between the price paid to farmers and wholesale price of beef jump by 24 percent it just doesnt apply to the beef industry if you look at the pork market four companies now control 56 percent of the pork market and the margin between the wholesale price of pork and the price paid to the farmer has jumped by more than 50 percent we have had a continuous consolidation in the grain industry and in the dairy industry and an amazing concentration of economic power in the poultry industry where giant corporations such as perdue and tysons are not only squeezing farmers but also abusing workers and wreaking havoc on the environment in the process to really address these problems it seems to me we need substantive legislation for example to grant the agriculture department authority to review

of the funding by the federal government it means the federal government only has about 10 percent of the control if there is any control at all so the american people should understand that the whole

attempt to destroy the federal governments role totally we are back to where we were in 1995 with a call to abolish the department of education it is just another approach it is a more sanitized approach to destroying the federal role in education the new york times today has said what i said in the committee they said it in much more succinct terms the wise thing to do this is an editorial of march 10 today the wise thing to do would be to put edflex aside until later in the session when congress reauthorizes the entire elementary and secondary education act what we are doing here is stampeding education there is an emergency in america on education it deserves a serious response from congress what we are doing here is not a serious response this is a stampede to push us into a political posture we want to open the door for block grants that is what we are doing today it is trivializing the legislative process because we have on our agenda for this year the reauthorization of the elementary and secondary education act of 1965 that is on our agenda why can we not wait as the new york times says we should and i agree why can we not wait the new york times editorial also says the edflex expansion being debated in congress would extend waivers even to states that have no intention of innovation and no means in place of evaluating what they do correct the new york times starts its editorial with the following the achievement gap between affluent and disadvantaged children is a challenge to american education and a threat to national prosperity unfortunately a bipartisan bill that is scheduled for debate and a vote today in congress could widen that gap by allowing states to use federal dollars targeted at the poorest students for other educational purposes the socalled edflex proposal could damage the poorest districts which have traditionally been underfinanced by the states and cities even though they bear the burden of teaching the least prepared students why did the federal government get involved in education lyndon johnson what was his argument when he started the elementary and secondary education act of 1965 that we would help the poorest students in the poorest districts what edflex does is provide money for greedy governors who have shown by the way they have handled the welfare reform money that they do not intend to spend money for exactly what it is intended for they want to have the freedom to use it in various ways that do not necessarily focus on the poorest people for which the funds are intended we have a continuation of

educated populace we can have what the majority in this congress is seeking to do is what they sought to do in 1995 get rid of the federal influence it is only a tiny influence the american people

percent of the funding that they put up they have maximum flexibility with all that flexibility they have not been able to keep up with the demands for modern education the federal government needs to

that traps women by denying them all reproductive decisionmaking the ban is unconstitutional because freedom of choice is a right that has been protected under our constitution for 25 years furthermore the great majority of women who enter our federal prison system are impoverished and are often isolated from family friends and resources we are dealing with very complex histories that often tragically include drug abuse homelessness physical and sexual abuse to deny a basic reproductive choice would only make matters worse than the crisis in essence that the women are already faced with by being in the federal prison system the ban on the use of federal funds is a deliberate attack by the antichoice movement to ultimately derail all reproductive options for all women as we begin chipping away basic reproductive services for women i ask my colleagues what is next the denial of obgyn examinations and mammograms for women inmates who is next limiting choice for incarcerated women puts other populations at great risk this dangerous slippery slope erodes the right to choose little by little freedom of choice must be unconditionally kept intact therefore i strongly urge my colleagues to protect this constitutional right for women in america and vote yes on the degette amendment"]]}
