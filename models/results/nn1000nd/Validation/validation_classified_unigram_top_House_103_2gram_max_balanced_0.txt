did i get a wrong number tonight i got a mailing at my office within the last couple of days from the speaker of the house not the acting speaker but the real speaker of the house the gentleman from washington and it was headlined how you robert s walker can help president clinton succeed i opened it up and it has got a lot of fascinating stuff in here about how i can help the president mainly how i can help the president by sending money to the democrat congressional committee and also by sending back their survey but i was fascinated by some of what was in this letter it was addressed to me i mean it says dear robert s walker and then it says to me you are one of a select group of democrats from around the nation whom im asking to take part in this important survey now obviously this is a computer glitch that got this to me but it did reveal some very fascinating things for example there is an underlying paragraph here that says unfortunately newt gingrich and his rightwing allies succeeded in cutting our congressional majority in last years election and all i could say was yippee and so that was the right thing i also kind of had the feeling at that point that i ought to start flapping my right wing but the fact is that they are admitting here that the gentleman from georgia has in fact gotten his message across to the american people and that we are in fact beginning to win new majorities but then it goes on and it tells the american people a couple of fascinating things it says here because the success or failure of the clinton administration depends upon which party has control of the congress righto i say to my colleagues if you wanted to have the clinton administration succeed what tom foley is telling you in this letter is you want democrats in the congress if you dont want the clinton administration to succeed with higher taxes and more spending you want to change the congress the gentleman from washington is absolutely right and i am pleased that he sent me this letter then he went on down here this is a fascinating little p s that they put on the letter it says if the republicans gain more control in congress it will severely cripple bill clintons agenda well let me tell you after spending some time at home over the last several weeks and listening to what people are having to say about bill clintons agenda my guess is that this is an admission by speaker foley that the republicans are going to take control of the congress let me repeat that to you it says if republicans gain more control in congress it will severely cripple bill clintons agenda america at this point wants to cripple bill clintons agenda they have decided that this tax and spend is not what they want tom foley is telling you america what you should do tom foley is saying elect republicans to congress because if republicans gain control of the congress we will stop bill clintons agenda thanks speaker foley for this letter this is a very revealing document i appreciate it now i did notice that you asked me to send a contribution i do not think you are going to get one you asked me to return the survey i do not think i am going to do that on a

are conning the american people and this is why i checked with my doctors yesterday to get their approval to cast my vote against president clintons budget this vote is the first i have made since i underwent triple bypass surgery on july 16 to remove arterial blockage i believe this vote is crucial to my constituents and the country and this is why i am here before you instead of at home recuperating the democratic leadership claim that the goal of the clintons tax package is to pare 500 billion from the federal debt over the next 5 years what president clinton and the democrats fall to say is that even if they pass the presidents budget the nations debt will still increase by a staggering 1 2 tillion if this doublespeak is not insulting enough to the intelligence of taxpayers clinton and the democrats are trying to pull a fast one on american families and businesses by frontloading 275 billion of gross tax increases without significant spending cuts the clinton tax package heaps taxes on americans already struggling to provide a decent standard of living for themselves and their families rather than making americans pay their fair share the clinton tax plan will ensure that americans will be sharing most of their income with the federal government maybe the president and the democratic leadership in congress have convinced themselves of this but my constituents are not persuaded history has demonstrated to us time and time again that increasing taxes does not reduce the deficit higher taxes means increased spending i ask you my colleagues the question my constituents have asked me how can these tax increases be justified with the knowledge that no mechanisms exist to cut spending in the budget three parts of this budget represent a particularly onerous tax burden that will affect the middle class seniors and anyone else in america who breathes the gas tax the social security tax and surprising new retroactive taxes first the gas tax this federal gasoline tax of 4 3 cents per gallon will be more burdensome to families living in the large states of the west and south california will not escape the affect of this tax this increase will tax gasoline diesel compressed natural gas and noncommercial aviation fuel california will be hit extremely hard since it has a large population that utilizes various forms of transportation transportation costs will inevitably increase the clinton energy tax is inflationary and will escalate the already spiralling tax burden passed on to american families the energy tax will stifle the economic recovery we see occurring right now according to the tax foundation it is estimated that 54 299 jobs will be lost in my state of california behind every number there is a human face a family someone who can blame their unemployment on clintons tax package next the tax on social security benefits or if you listen to the president a spending cut seniors will be penalized for working and saving for their retirement under the clinton tax plan even though in his manifest putting people first candidate clinton promised to protect the integrity of the social security trust fund he hag decided to balance the budget on backs of senors cintons proposal will affect seniors with incomes of over 32 000 or coups incomes over 44 000 by inrea the tax on 85 percent of their social secuty benefits in addition to this these taxes increase the elderly surtax on pensions ira withdrawals interest from municipal bonds and certifcates of deposit the tax revenues generated by these new taxes on seniors will then be used to fund other programs rather than going into the socal security trust fund the president should not wonder as he pillages senlors benefits to pay for other programs why in addition to te budget deficit he also must contend with the trust fund this elderly surtax is anything but fair the increase in the elderly surtax hits the prudent and frugel who live on ixed incomes accordlng to the heritage foundation it is estimated that in calilomia 566 328 households over 65 with incomes greater than 3 000 will be hit and more spedlically in my district 13 884 households affected the 29 billion clinton hope to rsm at the expense of our seniors could easily be achieved by implementing just a handful of seniors wastecuting recommendations that have been put

increase in his white house budget when all is said and done the appropriations committees response funds white house activities at precisely the same level they were funded in 1992 george bushs last year yet as a candidate bill clinton talked about a 25percent cut in the white house staff many anericans are wondering at current levels whether we are not paying too much already particularly in light of the continuing allegations of grave misconduct by members of the white house staff yet bill clinton the man who promised a 25percent cut tb the american people has this year proposed an 8percent increase for the white house budgetv i congratulate my colleague the kdntlelnan from florida who did not see fit to give mr clinton more money but is instead proposing that we hold him to at least some of the spending cuts that he proposed as a candidate in light of what the white house staff has been up to it seems to me they hardly deserve a raise just 18 months ago the clinton white house started out with travelgate it consisted in the firing and smearing of honest career employees in the white house for the benefit of the clintons relatives and campaign workers even the white house press corps were scandalized by such a noxious mixture of cronyism political manipulation of law enforcement and scapegoating the likes of which washington has not seen since the spoils system was first set into motion by andrew jackson all of this certainly set the tone for what we have now come to know as the prototypical clinton scandal the cornercutting the greed cronyism and above all the deceit there has been more serious misconduct by the clinton white house than travelgate but certainly nothing more contemptible than firing and smearing longtime apolitical lowlevel government workers in order to benefit the presidents cousin and his wealthiest friends no less disgraceful was the tampering with the fbi by the white house counsels office the office in which i once served as senior associate counsel to the president the white house counsel is supposed to be preeminently responsible for preventing ethical lapses by the president and senior white house officials instead it was this white house counsels office that was the very source of the scandal including flagrant qbvious misconduct by white house lawyer william kennedy who did not contact the attorney general who did not contact fbi director sessions but interfered directly in the operations of the fbi to target specific individuals yet kennedy remains in the white house two reprimands and several additional scandals later as a seemingly permanent sourceof ethical trouble for this president and the other white house staff as we all know mr kennedy like webb hubble and vince foster and hillary rodham clinton was part ofthe same law firm that represented arkansas wheeler dealers in whitewater and madison savings and loan and dozens of other transactions including the clintons own personal finances one of the most unsavory aspects of this staff arrangement is the cronyism from the first it turned the highest echelon s of the white house legal staff and the justice department into little more than the washington branch office of the kose law firm the predictable result was the president and hillary rodham clinton felt they could treat the white house lawyers as their personal lawyers bu t federal law prohibits government employees including the white house counsels office from performing private services for the president yet shortly before his death vince foster was working in his white house office in the west wing on government time at taxpayer expense at preparing the delinquent whitewater tax returns not only was this improper because it was the personal investment business of the clintons rather than official business but it also covered a period well before the clintons took office most observers who have commented on this fact have speculated on its relevance to mr fosters death as a former member of the counsels office i am at least as struck by its obvious impropriety using a fulltime government lawyer to work on the clinton familys personal business affairs is clearly improper i recall very well the extraordinary pains that for example president reagan took to ensure that none of the white house lawyers worked on his personal business his tax returns were prepared by his own private lawyers and his accountants even his blind trust which unlike the clintons was set up before his inauguration was prepared at his personal expense obviously the clinton white house does not follow the same ethical guidelines what does this mean from a budget standpoint obviously it means today in 1994 we are already paying for too much white house staff yet the size and the composition of the white house staff whose budget we are debating foday is itself another mystery the clintons have repeatedly denied requests from congress for a list of white house

killed in defending a logistics convoy of the unitedstates company brown root when it was ambushed by a band of armed somalis as we honor the dedication and sacrifice of our own soldiers i believe we must do the same for those such as these indian soldiers who have served and sacrificed along side our own forces this is especially important to keep in mind for on this dayjust 2 days after the lost of our troops have left somalia5 000 unitedstates troops are being deployed in haiti in yet another mission again as in somalia the initial massive unitedstates military intervention will be followed by a much longer presence of international forces under the united nations in terms of the deployment of unitedstates military forces abroad i am deeply disturbed that successive presidents have gone to the united nations for authority to use military force internationally rather than to the unitedstates congress as the president is required to do under the constitution president bush did this in iran and somalia then president clinton rubberstamped the actions in somalia and now has pursued the same course in haiti and looked favorably upon both the invasions by president reagan of grenada and then the what i consider to be n infamous invasion on our part of panama with the results that the avowed purposes we had for invading panama has resulted in us having to keep right now twothirds of the number of our troops that we had at the height of the invasion of panama if we do not it will not be an american life safe in panama we went in ostensibly to capture what we said was the chief drug peddler and try to put a stop w the extensive dope and drug peddling as a natte of fact since our invasion the amount of narcotics illegal through panama and by panama and from panama is three

just a few hours ago regarding the mostfavorednation status for china i as many americans across the nation and many members of this body just learned of this decision just a few hours ago i have not read the presidents statement i have not studied the text of his thinking with regard to this decision but i believe that it does warrant a response from those of us who have deep concerns about our relationship with china in light of extensive human rights violations i believe it is important for we in congress and we as americans to ask ourselves some fundamental questions about who we are as a nation what we stand for what is the foundation of this country what should be the foundation of our foreign policy and what is it that we mean by human rights indeed do we as americans believe what we say and do we stand by what we say with respect tohuman rights i believe respect for human rights human dignity is a fundamental value that we as americans share o 1930 it is something that is extremely important to all of us regardless of our political persuasions regardless of where we come from in this great country i truly believe that deep down inside of us we have a very deep and firm commitment to the rights and the dignity of human beings in our country and outside of our country there is a thing called mostfavorednation status and it is what it suggests a declaration that certain nations on this planet are most favored in the eyes of the united states and in the eyes of americans and so it is when we look at the human rights abuses at the hands of the chinese of the repression at the hands of the chinese when we look at the evidence of torture of imprisonment of people for standing up and expressing their political views it becomes of great concern to all of us as americans because it violates that fundamental principle and value that we share so it has been that the question of whether or not we declare a nation such as china with the record that china has on abuse of its citizens and others clear violations of human rights whether we should extend mostfavorednation status to such a country whether we should declare a nation that engages so systematically in violations of human rights a most favored nation last year the president of the united states declared that if china was to have mostfavorednation status extended in 1994 that it had to make overall significant progress in the areas of human rights what has happened in that years time i know of no one who can say with a straight face that china has made overall significant progress toward human rights in this past year no one who i know who is familiar with the situation in that nation and no one i know who is familiar with the situation in tibet would suggest that overall significant progress has been made with respect to human rights by the chinese asia watch provided testimony to this country and to this congress that last year as a matter of fact was the worst for political arrests and trials they cited evidence upon evidence upon evidence of repression in every province in china and then they turned their attention to tibet the people who are seeking dignity and respect seeking the basic fundamental right to live as tibetans to practice freely their religion and their culture to not be the objects of systematic torture and repression by the chinese and we find there are now more prisoners in tibet than in every province in china combined and we find strong evidence of a systematic attempt by the chinese to repress if not annihilate the religious traditions and culture of the tibetans so in light of all of this evidence in light of all of this testimony in light of the hearings that we have held here in congress in light of evidence and testimony that experts have brought to us of the systematic repression at the hands of the chinese the clear evidence that the chinese have failed to meet the condition that we asa nation established for extension of its most favored nation status the question for us becomes what are we to do well the president of the united states today has announced that despite these facts and this evidence he believes that we should in fact extend most favored nation status to china that we should through that policy declare that this nation is a most favored nation of the united states i was pleased to learn just a short time ago that the senate majority leader of the other body senator george mitchell indicated that he disagrees with the presidents decision he made a statement just a short time ago in which he said that the experience of recent years has been that each concession to the chinese communist regime encourages its intransigence and he went on to say i believe this will be the unfortunate result of this decision it will confirm for the chinese communist regime the success of its policy of repression on human rights and manipulation on trade ladies and gentlemen i believe very strongly that two things need to happen no 1 this congress needs to engage in a debate over whether or not we should declare china a most favored natidn of this country i believe that if we have a fair and honest and thoroughdebate this congress will respond if it hears from the people of this country as members of congress go back to their districts when they hear from the people of this country about our belief if human rights and the principles and values that we hold dear that they will come back to this body and we will have a debate and we will recognize that human rights means something and most favored nation status should mean something as well and that we should not stand idly by and declare china a most favored nation but there is something else that i think that we as americans need to do in light of todays announcement by the president i think we all have to ask ourselves who are we as a people what do we stand for what should be the foundation of americas foreign policy when we tell the world that we believe in human rights do we really mean it when we declare to the world that our foreign policy decisions are going to be based upon the recognition that human rights should be respected everywhere in the world do we really mean it what happens ladies and gentlemen when the united states says one thing and does another when we stand up and declare our support for human rights our support and respect for his holiness the dalai lama in tibet for the people of tibet and then declare china a mostfavorednation status what does it all mean what does our rhetoric mean what do we really stand for what in fact drives american foreign policy is it human rights is it respect for individuals is it the values that we cherish or is the bottom line the bottom line pure economics pure trade pure opportunities for profits ladies and gentlemen we are embarked on a very new and important era in world history the cold war is over the old ways of defining our planet and aligning our nation have changed we are engaged in a new challenge and a new opportunity we have to establish at this time in our countrys history what is the rudder beneath this ship of state what is the foundation of this countrys foreign policy where are we going and how does it reflect our values and our principles as americans and are economics and profits the only foundation on which we stand i believe that many in this body i believe that the president of the united states believes in human rights is deeply committed to the principles that we cherish as americans but it mr cox at the request of mr raises a fundamental question what in michel for today on account of his this new era are we to do about those wife having a baby beliefs about those principles what are we

h r 4296 is a vehicle for this house to clearly state its will on a selective assault weapon ban not to tinker with the fine print of such a proposal i understand the benefits of focusing on the broad philosophical issue will this ban on selected assault weapons help to reduce violent crime in our communities statistics and evidentiary experience show the answer is no but this rule precludes discussion of the other half of this crucial question wouldnt the guarantee of tougher penalties do more to reduce violent crime in our communities i am convinced the answer to that question is a resounding yes many of us who feel this selective gun ban will prove ineffective in combating crime believe very strongly that tough and consistent penalties for abuse of firearms will work yet under this rule the house is denied the chance to debate mr mccollums proposal to ensure tough mandatory minimum sentences for possession and use of guns in the commission of a crime most law enforcement officials tell us that assault weapons are not the key to crime in this countryin fact even proponents of this bill know that assault weapons are responsible for only a small fraction of all violent crimes we have failed to hold people accountable for their actions we have failed to guarantee that heinous crimes and violence will lead to sure swift and stringent penalties we have failed to make sure that crime in this country will not pay in the rules committee we were told that mr mccollums proposal for mandating tough minimum sentences in cases of unlawful activity with guns is nongermane or not relevant to this discussion in my view this ban on certain selected assault weapons is nongermane and not relevant to solving our very serious crime problem in this country a 1990 florida commission studied the merits of a ban on assault weapons and concluded that such a ban would have no impact on crimerelated deaths in our state in fact an informal survey of lawenforcement officials in southwest florida confirms that only three deaths can be traced to assault weapons although they are not necessarily those on the select ban listand one of those deaths was a suicide americans have a constitutional right to own guns for selfprotection for deterence for hunting for target sport shooting for collection and for other lawful activity i make a very clear distinction between ownership and use of those weapons sadly a selective ban on assault weapons will not stop criminals from getting their hands on deadly weapons and committing deadly crimes what it will do is further restrict lawabiding folks from going about their business the understandable passions and thoughtful sincere concern on both sides of this debate demonstrate the true problem americans are fed up with being afraidwe have had enough of our misguided and ineffective criminal justice system which is sending the signal that crime in america still does pay so as we struggle to make our neighborhoods safe once again for lawabiding citizens let us not be fooled by highprofile but unfulfillable promises i wish i could believe that this ban will reduce violent crime but after listening to the arguments on both sides and looking at the facts of crime in this country i am convinced the criminals will go right on committing violent crimes and they will still be able to get their hands on guns selective ban or no selective ban who knows some may actually become emboldened by knowing that their lawabiding victims will not be able to match their firepower in the end this bill asks americans to give up part of their freedom but what do americans get in return i am afraid it will be little and we will have once again missed the chance to do something significant to stop crime i oppose this rule and will vote

other firearm there is no difference in the action of a semiautomatic hunting rifle and the action of a semiautomatic rifle that would be banned except for the outward appearance of military hardware
