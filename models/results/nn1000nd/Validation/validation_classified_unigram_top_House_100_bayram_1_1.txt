are guerrillas what north did was to elevate the debate and take the shroud off this debate that liberal democrats have liked and have worked to append to this entire issue the point is that it is much easier if you are a liberal in america to talk about ollie norths life and times and ask why he got the snow tires or whatever than it is to explain to the american people what we are going to do

being given to the american people regarding the aids issue in florida today and in other parts of the country some religious organizations and other organizations are giving out information and condoms telling people that there is such a thing as safe sex the fact of the matter is that the aids virus the aids epidemic that we are facing right now in this country and around the world does not give us much latitude there is no such thing outside a monogomous relationship such as safe sex any longer any young person any married person any old person who involves themselves with another person that they do not have a lifelong experience with runs the risk of getting aids it is like playing russian roulette there has been a lot of information given out by the media by the surgeon general and others regarding the aids virus in fact the surgeon general and others have advocated the use of condoms as a step toward controlling the aids virus the fact of the matter is there is no foolproof method i said earlier today there are approximately 240 million aids viruses that can fit on a period at the end of a sentence so if you have contact with someone who has that aids virus you run the risk of getting it no matter what preventative measure you may employ i am not the only one who is saying this in fact i have gleaned the information i have from a number of sources i would like to read to you a letter that i received from dr robertson who is with the research and development corp in lexington ga he has done extensive research on the acquired immune deficiency syndrome and i think everybody in america ought to know about this so that there is no misinformation o 1350 as we gain more information as time goes by it is going to be important that we take the steps that are necessary to protect the vast majority of the population from this epidemic this dread disease dr bowen the head of hhs said not long ago in a speech that tens of millions of people are going to die from aids the way it is going it could be more than that it is the worst plague to hit the world since the black plague and it may be the worst ever it is estimated right now that 4 million people in the united states alone have the virus within their systems it is doubling every 8 to 12 months which means that the attitudes of the american people do not change rapidly so next year there will be 4 to 8 million the following year there will be 8 to 16 million and the year after that there will be 16 to 32 million who are infected with the disease or who at least have the virus within their systems and so on there have been articles written saying that sometime within 12 years onefourth of the unitedstates population would have the virus within their systems and that may be conservative i would like to read this letter now it gets a little technical but i think most people if they will listen closely will glean from this letter what it really means the text of the letter is as follows dear mr burton i am writing in response to your telephone call today when you asked whether there might be a risk of transmission of the aids virus hivi other than by sexual intercourse homosexual acts the use of blood or blood products or during pregnancy and birth the answer to this question is yes the most pressing problem is that we cannot measure the risk though we can set some limits i will expand my answer in two waysfirst by telling you why one must be cautious in reaching any conclusions about the disease or its transmission and second by telling you why there is cause for concern about transmission by the nontraditional routes the most important source of information is the tabulation of aids cases reported to the centers for disease control these reports must be interpreted carefully since they represent disease diagnosed a long time after infection with hiv since there is no mechanism for collecting or reporting information about the development of antibodies to hiv or knowledge of infection and its routes is limited for example the majority of those coming down with aids male homosexuals in california drug addicts in new york come from the population first infected in this country but their proportions in the epidemic do not represent the proportions in the same groups infected now in contrast recent army data show that in some parts of new york there is an equal rate of infection amongst male and female applicants this will be reflected in aids cases reported in several years time these delays led many people to assume that aids would remain a disease exclusively a largely of homosexuals heterosexual spread of hiv in the united states has only recently been generally accepted with the publication of clear case reports although the epidemiological evidence has been strong for some time there have always been cases which could not be classifed into the known risk groups these represent a roughly constant 3 of the total when other categories of risk e g consorting with a prostitute are excluded this is not to say that these 3 acquired the virus casually but it does say that the unknown category is increasing roughly in step with the epidemic as a whole obviously there could be several explanations for this none of which can be excluded without considerable further study in particular if casual transmission were possible it would be difficult to prove without largescale prospective studies of the risks of associating with infected individuals studies to date are too small to exclude a risk though they may set limits on it indeed some appear to demonstrate a risk but again they are too small for us to be sure in this context it is important to remember that it is only recently that it has become clear that the risk of heterosexual transmission is roughly equal to the risk of homosexual transmission as is the risk of transmission from man to woman and from woman to man the early apparent differences in the risk of transmission by these routes appear to be accounted for by the delays in infection spreading to each group they are not real differences thus if transmission by nontraditional methods is either possible or likely it is only now with the virus quite widespread that we are likely to obtain good epidemiological evidence as was true for the traditional routes of transmission the first acceptable evidence of nontraditional transmission will come from case reports in which all other routes have been eliminated it is disturbing that we do in fact have several such cases reports these include transmission without sexual intercourse between an elderly couple whose only intimate contact was kissing transmission from a nursing mother to her child possibly in breast milk transmission between two young brothers by an unknown route and transmission between a patient and a neighbor who was nursing him it is likely that case reports of this kind will become more frequent as the general population becomes more heavily infected with the virus on the other hand without knowledge of the prevalence of seropositivitythat is of the number of infectious peoplein an environment it will be hard to detect transmission in say the workplace until the virus is quite prevalent as it will be in several years unless transmission is reduced now here we must for the moment rely on our theoretical knowledge of hiv and similar viruses as well as on what information we can glean from the case reports to hand hiv belongs to the family of retroviruses and the subfamily lentivlrinae the lentviruses are known to infect ungulates and primates by several routes including aerosols and even hiv has apparently spread from one chimpanzee to its cagemate without sexual contact in addition all the lentiviruses evolve rapidly so that their envelope proteins which contain the sites that recognise and blind to receptors on the cells they infect are very variable leading to the possibility of variation in infectiousness as is found in hiv as well as in specificity which might also lead to a variation in the efficiency of different routes of infection it is prudent therefore to assume that hiv can share these properties since it is extremely closely related to the other lentiviruses particularly in view of the fact that hiv can be found in most bodily secretions and excretions including urine tears and saliva as well as breast milk blood and semen hiv is also much tougher than had been thought being capable of surviving with undiminished infectiousness for at least two weeks at room temperature if damp there are therefore strong theoretical grounds for caution these grounds supply a possible february 19 1 987 basis for the transmission of the virus in those cases of nontraditional infection already reported and are cause for growing caution as the virus becomes more prevalent leading to an increasing number of contacts with infected people in the traditional modes of transmission it appears to be the case that risk per exposure is constant with infection becoming increasingly likely with an increasing number of exposures the analogy between the transmission of hepatitisb and aids has often been drawn the cdc recommend that hepatitisb precautions be taken to minimize the spread of hiv in the health care setting it seems that the routes of transmission are very similar but that the hepatitisb virus is more infectious than hiv in other words it is reasonable to expect that more cases of hiv transmission between household members will occur as prolonged exposure to hiv carriers becomes more common it will be much more difficult to detect transmission by these means outside the household without welldesigned prospective epidemlological studies the studies reported to date have been too limited to allow any conclusion other than that casual transmission is probably not easy we should remember however that this was said at first for heterosexual transmission of the virus though now we know that it is easy indeed the case reports we have are extremely strong evidence of transmission within the household and cannot be rebutted by the limited epidemlological studies of household transmission even amongst trained healthcare personnel there are cases of transmission that cannot be accounted for by riskgroup membership again all we can say is that transmission in the healthcare setting is not very likely at the moment we cannot say that it is impossible in an attachment to this letter i list the main points and give references to the most important papers copies of which are also attached my considered opinion is that transmission by contact within the family happens and that casual transmission is possible but that we have too few data to determine how efficient each casual route is some routes of transmission are not likely at all for example it does not seem possible for enough virus to be transmitted by mosquito though it is possible that other insect vectors in warm climates could play a role we simply have no direct evidence of insect transmission and what evidence we have suggests that if it plays a role at all in the tropics it is a very limited one transmission by coughing or sneezing is clearly possible in theory but does not yet seem to be likely if it were likely then we would expect to see a fillingin of the age distribution of those infected with the virus this could be happening since we have little information about the prevalence of infection by age group but if it is it has not yet affected the agedistribution of aids cases in the united states again this tells us the population at large the traditional routes are more efficient transmitters than the casual routes however i believe that there are more serious issues than the question of casual transmission one statistic illustrates this well it is likely that at least 4 million americans are infected by the virus we will not know the true number unless we perform widespread blood testing or until those infected begin to develop aids study of relatively small groups here and abroad shows that infection spreads rapidly through a population saturating it in about 58 years very roughly there is a doubling time for prevalence of infection of no more than a year if we accept this conservative estimate then there will be 4 million new infections in the united states in 1987 this is a daily rate of over 10 000 and just exceeds the annual number of live births in the united states even if only 2 million are now infected this statistic will be true in a years time if more are in fact infected now then we are already exceeding the number of live births with the number of new hiv infections since we now know that at least 50 of those infected will develop aids and then die and in fact have no reason to assume that this will not be the case for all or nearly all of those infected the situation is already extremely grave this is particularly true because what evidence we have suggests that no actions taken to date have had any measurable effect on the spread of the epidemic and because actions that are likely to be taken in the near future depend solely on changes in behavior in people who do not even know that they are infected with hiv and do not consider themselves at risk such behavioral change has not occurred in the past under these or any other circumstances without regulatory force to back it up the prognosis is therefore grim and relatively little time is left if we are to have any hope of controlling the epidemic in the united states we certainly cannot afford to wait for an hypothetical cure of the development of a vaccine

communities in the midwest for example when they are undergoing tough economic times to understand why it is important to be concerned about that part of the world one reason they should be concerned is that about 50 percent of the exports the grain that is sold for export from their farming communities goes through that canal and now if it does not go through the canal i asked one of the people at the canal one of the executives i said what happens if you dont go through the canal he said then you have to go all the way around south america one affect that that has on our grain markets is that then perhaps it will go to different customers because our grain is going to be more expensive than it would be if it went through the canal the point is that everybody in america who makes a living and depends to some degree on export whether you are farmer manufacturer et cetera has an interest in the panama canal that is why the american people acted so fervently when jimmy carter gave away the panama canal they knew they knew even if they were not intellectualizing about it even if they did not have a complete intellectual or technical analysis of it they knew the panama canal was fundamental to our economic system and that is why they did not want it to go they probably were right because general noriega is tearing the country up in panama now we are going to have a very

than in the entire atlantic it is a very vulnerable area you know one thing that impressed me today about the liberals who stood up and were upset with colonel norths photo presentation i listened and

communist dicatatorship now how does this fit in what point and the gentleman and the gentleman from connecticut and the gentleman from california have covered the other points it leads me to the major point that i want to make in 1938 there was a gentleman in this country named whittaker chambers who was a communist he was a member of the communist party here in the united states whittaker chambers became repelled by what he saw in the communist party the executions that took place in soviet russia and many other things he left the communist party in 1937 in 1948 he testified in many congressional hearings which resulted in the conviction of alger hiss who later went to prison in 1952 this is a man who was a communist whittaker chambers wrote a book the book is called witness now i would encourage all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to read this book it is a very profound book and tells a story for today let me read the first page from whittaker chambers book witness he said in 1937 like lazarus lazarus from the bible who came back from the dead i began like lazarus the impossible return i began to break away from communism and to climb from deepwithin its underground where for 6 years i had been been buried back into the world of free men when we dead awaken i used to sometimes say in those days to my wife who though never a communist had shared my revolutionary hopes and was now to share my ordeals when we dead awaken for this title of an ibsen play i have never read somehow caught and summed up for me feelings that i could not find any other words to expressfears uncertalnities selfdoubts cowardices flinchings of the willnature to any man who undertakes to reverse in midcourse the journey of his life at the same time he said when he left communism i felt a surging release and a sense of freedom like a man who bursts at last gasp out of a drowning sea this elation was not caused and this is the frightening thing of the book this elation was not caused by any comparison of the world i was leaving and the world i was returning to whittaker chambers went on to say by any hardheaded estimate the world i was leaving that is the communist world looked like the world of life and of the future the world i was returning to that is freedom and democracy the world i was returning to seemed by contrast a graveyard it was in fact the same world i had abandoned as hopeless when i joined the communist party in 1925 only now its crisis which few men could diagnose 13 years before had reached the visible brink of catastrophe and still that stricken world did not know the nature of the catastrophe it still did not know or even want to know two facts that it must know to survive the meaning of communism and the meaning of the new breed of man the communist whittaker chambers went on to say i wanted my wife to realize clearly one longterm penalty for herself and for the children of the step i was taking i said you know we are leaving the winning world for the losing world i meant that in the revolutionary conflict of the 20th century i knowingly chose the side of probable defeat almost nothing that i have observed or that has happened to me since has made me think that i was wrong about that forecast but nothing has changed my determination to act as if i were wrongif only because in the last instance men must act on what they believe right not on what they believe probable since whittaker chambers wrote those words in 1952 19 countries have turned communist cambodia laos vietnam mozambique ethiopia angola cuba now nicaragua and i do not believe and i think we should do everything to see that it is the case i do not believe that whittaker chambers was right i think this body republicans and democrats and americans should do everything they can in their power to prove that when whittaker chambers says that when he was leaving communism he was leaving the winning side and joining the losing side as the father of five children who are going to have to live in this world long after i depart this troubles me deeply now to be opposed to contra aid and i would reprimand myself and the h 1174 co other

do not have pressure on that government they will never abide by negotiations and met with arias and duarte and the other members i just want to urge my colleagues here you may want to cut off aid later on in the semester or later on in the year perhaps but to do it now would basically doom president arias negotiations a vote to cut off aid to the freedom fighters or contras or democratic

provisions now in the bill which will authorize improvements to the great lakes connecting channels and harbors and ensure the containment of dredged material section 13 which improves the environmental management program for fish and wildlife enhancement in the upper mississippi river region also adds to the bill section 18 regarding the corps reservoirs in the upper mississippis headwaters region responds to recent criticisms of proposed drawdowns during this years drought concern about a drawdowns impact on the environment and local economy prompted me to introduce legislation to prevent imprudent actions section 18 proposed by the gentleman from minnesota responds to the same concern section 35 authorizes the technical resources service for the red river of the north basin in minnesota and north dakota this new authority will supplement the ongoing section 22 and section 206 efforts in the basin because of its unique physical features and jurisdictional boundaries the basin needs increased flood protection and coordination among land and water officials the intent of this section is to have the corps and the two states work closely with the international coalition for land water stewardship in the red river basin another section in the bill modifies the existing flood control project at roseau river mn to allow the corps to go forward with a smaller and more economical component of the overall project the corps is authorized to construct a levee in the vicinity of duxby mn under their section 205 authority this will allow an important flood control project to proceed i think its important for every member to know that the administration has severe and i think justified reservations about various aspects of this legislation therefore we will need to make a number of adjustments to the bill in conference our goal in these final days of the 100th congress is to produce legislation that the president can sign and that can return congress to the traditional 2year authorization process this can happen only if we make some difficult decisions in conference in order to make h r 5247 more modest in its size and scope thus it bears repeating that the more amendments we adopt the more difficult it will be to return to the 2year cycle quite frankly we may lose this bill if it grows larger in size or scope nonetheless in its current form hr 5247 can get us into conference with the other body and back on track with the regular authorization process i urge each member to support the bill if given the chance we can work to improve the legislation in conference in working with the other body i will do my best to produce a bill that the president can sign and that can return us to the regular

suffered under foreign domination trying vainly to win their independence on february 16 1918 lithuania was finally able to do just that this independence was soon followed by german occupation during world war i but thereafter and for the next 20 years until 1938 the lithuanian people were free that small nation then came under soviet domination during the course of world war ii and in 1940 lithuania was declared a constituent republic of the unitedstatess r thereafter during world war ii germany occupied this land once more for another 4 years until the end of the war unlike other nations after the war lithuania was unable to return to independence and was by 1945 firmly incorporated into the soviet union where it remains to this day while lithuania lost its independence as did many other eastern european nations the lithuanian people lost neither their desire for freedom nor their strong culture it is for these reasons that we recognize lithuanian independence day and

support of h r 3435 the charitable assistance and food bank support act of 1987 this bill was reported out of the committee on agriculture unanimously and enjoys bipartisan support hl11381 in addition a number of charities including the unitedstates catholic conference have indicated their support for this legislation the purpose of h r 3435 is to correct two inequities in thetreatment of atypical income received by certain households participating in the food stamp program the bill also authorizes demonstration projects to test new expanded ways of distributing surplus agriculture products through food banks the first provision would amend the food stamp act so that small charitable contributions which are given to poor people particularly at holidays do not count as income in determining benefits under the food stamp program this provision is especially appropriate as we approach the holiday season when many communities have private charity campaigns in which small cash donations are provided to the needy for the purchase of food gifts or other items unfortunately section 5 d 1 of the food stamp act while it does allow for this kind of gift deductions does not do the same with regard to cash contributions this is a time of year when those who are more fortunate in our society have traditionally been called upon to help the needy we are a generous society and community efforts of this kind are usually successful we all recognize the problem of hunger and homelessness in our society is a national shame and requires cooperation to deal with it at the federal state and local levels as well as the private sector we encourage the private sector to establish efforts to provide assistance in this time of need but it is frustrating for those who do wish to help to see their contributions offset by inflexible federal regulations it does not make sense to me to discourage such contributions in this way instead we should be encouraging this outpouring of holiday spirit the problem in the current law was brought to my attention last year when the monterey peninsula herald conducted a campaign operation christmas to get subscribers to donate money to help needy families over the holidays the donors and the recipients were both justifiably outraged when they discovered that this altruism caused cuts in welfare benefits to correct the problem in the food stamp program this bill provides that up to 300 in a 3month period would be excluded from income if this amount represents nonrecurring cash donations based on need that are received from one or more private nonprofit charitable organizations cbo estimates the cost of the charity disregard to be less than 500 000 a year this bill will also correct a bureaucratic problem which has come to light in the food stamp program the food and nutrition service interprets the food stamp act as requiring that any payment which a food stamp recipient receives for providing his or her blood must be counted in determining food stamp benefits i personally think it is tragic that some people find themselves in such desperate straits that they have to sell their blood if the money they get from selling their own blood causes their food stamp benefits to be cut the inequity iscompounded at a time when there is obviously a need for blood contributions it is tragic to discourage these contributions but it is actually more tragic when a person receives payment for their contribution to have it deducted from their benefits the purpose of this provision is to correct that correction of this inequity will cost 1 million a year the third provision would authorize the department of agriculture to carry out at least one food bank demonstration project using section 32 commodities my distinguished colleague and the ranking minority member of the subcommittee on domestic marketing nutrition and consumer relations bill emerson and i held a hearing on food banks earlier this year in missouri at that hearing we received impressive testimony about the capability of food banks to meet emergency nutrition needs we came away from that hearing convinced that we should test ways to increase the flexibility of the food banks cbo advises that the cost of operating this demonstration would be 200 000 a year the cost is kept low because the department of agriculture will use commodities that are already available for donation under section 32 of the agriculture adjustment act of 1935 the house approved this demonstration earlier this year when we considered the commodity

mackay1 a member of the committee mr mackay i thank the chairman i would like to discuss the nasa budget which has recently been mentioned and i would like to put it this way that budget was a point of very severe discussion within the budget committee it is true that the budget committee did not see fit to fund this program at the level that it was funded by the president the question is not whether we cut it but the question is whether those programs funded through the nasa budget can be continued adequately at the level they are funded i am convinced that they can i am convinced that there may have to be a stretchout in the space station program and i personally as a member of the committee on science space and technology would say that this is not altogether bad there is good evidence to indicate that the space station program is not as well thought out as it should be and that perhaps a stretchout of a year or maybe 2 years will enable the funds that are put there to be much better spent let me go forward with a discussion of the other budgets that are in function 250 because this function essentially is the part of the federal budget that funds civilian research and development the only place where there has been a cut in this function is in the nasa budget in the national science foundation there has been an increase of 200 million above the existing programs this year these are essentially the programs that fund civilian research at our universities the doe general science programs have been continued at a freeze level our committee is convinced that this is adequate funding to continue our commitment to civilian research and development i hope members will look very carefully at this function i believe if they do they will see that the budget committee has done a responsible job and although this is lean funding this is adequate i urge adoption of the budget"], [0.009368032217025757, 0.49063196778297424, 0, "as the ranking republican member on the science space and technology committee and as the senior republican member of the committee on interior and insular affairsthe two committees of jurisdiction for this legislationi rise in support of h r 1612 as amended by the senate this legislation reauthorizes the national earthquake hazard reduction act of 1987 a 3year reauthorization bill originally passed the house under suspension of the rules on june 3 1987 by a voice vote and it has been amended by the senate to reflect an agreement reached between the committees of jurisdiction of the two bodies this 3year renewal will provide necessary stability to these vital programs the earthquake hazards reduction act was originally constructed to coordinate the federal research and earthquake mitigation activities of four federal agencies the national science foundation the national bureau of standards center for building technology nbscbtj the unitedstates geological survey usgs and the federal emergency management agency fema1 h r 1612 with the senate amendments will provide for a total authorization of 73 078 million for fiscal year 1988 79 766 million for fiscal year 1989 and 85 060 million for the programs in fiscal year 1990 the science committee has been interested in a comprehensive multiyear 50state approach to the national program among other activities we view the next 3 years as a test for incorporating earthquake monitoring stations located east of the rocky mountainsoriginally operated by the nuclear regulatory commissioninto permanent usgs datagathering facilities further the expansion of earthquake research activities to universities across the country in order to study both known and potential seismically active areas nationwide will broaden the knowledge base and professional training for earth scientists beyond just the west coast where much of the research program has been concentrated in the past a 3year reauthorization will provide fema state agencies and state legislatures adequate time to work out costsharing arrangements for state and local emergency management planning currently the federal government provides planning grants with no requirements for states to provide matching resources however california has voluntarily elected to cost share under h r 1612 beginning in 1989 costsharing requirements will be extended to all states who receive federal moneys we believe this is a reasonable approach both to aid in dealing with the federal deficit and to help maintain a proper balance between federal and state responsibilities i urge passage

discussions with the united states about a regional peace similar signs had been given to other american government officials but even now in 1988 we are still waiting for nicaraguan president daniel ortegathis time to fulfill his hollow promises of compliance with the arias peace plan opponents of aid to the freedom fighters tell us that the sandinistas want to talk about peacebut in light of their continued resistance to negotiation can the american people truly believe they are sincere it is true that in past decades the united states did not conduct an enlightened foreign policy with regard to nicaraguawe supported the government of somoza when the nicaraguan revolution succeeded we tried to establish relations with the sandinistas instead they threw dirt in our faces we tried to build a new relationship with nicaragua in 1979 for 2 years america was the major source of food aid and a most important fiancial source we sent millions of dollars of assistance including thousands of tons of food to feed their people but the sandinista government refused to participate in a dialog with us i continue to believe that the united states should pursue a foreign policy of encouraging a regional peace if the sandinistas would stop exporting their revolutionary communism we could encourage mutual peace among the nations of central america then central america could be economically revised but now ortega is blatantly stalling the peace negotiationsa manipulative strategy cloaked in the name of peace to delay further unitedstates aid to the contras the united states has high

great to be held in peoples memories for too long we need constant reminders of what humankind has been capable of in order to ensure that the world will never see an attempt to exterminate an entire people this day provides us an opportunity to remember prior to 1914 there were over 2 million armenians living in turkey since the end of the first world war there have never been more than approximately 100 000 this is a truly staggering fact that a population could be reduced to 5 percent of its original size in the space of a few short years is almost incomprehensible the 20th century has seen horrors previously unknown and unimagined by human beings the final solution in hitlers germany the firebombing of dresden by the allies during world war ii which left that historic city looking like the surface of the moon in cambodia we still see the horrors of pol pots regime weapons have been developed and used which have destructive power that is almost beyond understanding all of these horrors have been acknowledged by the world community and all have been subjected to the shame of universal denunciation yet before any of these terrible events occurred the armenian population of turkey was reduced to onetwentieth its previous size the world community has been strangely silent on the methods through which this happened in 1908 there was a revolution in the ottoman empire and the group which would come to be known as the young turks rose to power the young turks endorsed a policy of turkish supremacy and attempted to assimilate all the various nationalities within the ottoman empire into one huge turkish people the armenian people had preserved their cultural integrity for centuries they had a tremendous sense of themselves and pride in their history needless to say they would not allow their rich cultural heritage to be stripped away armenians resisted conscription into the ottoman armies and in some cases formed armed resistance groups these groups gave the young turks the excuse they needed to systematically slaughter an entire people the turkish government began wholesale deportation and murder of armenians claiming it was necessary for reasons of national security united states ambassador morgenthau in turkey and witnessing these activities wrote that the treatment given the convoys clearly shows that extermination was the real purpose the turkish government claims that the armenian genocide is a fabrication cleverly created by the armenian insurgents i find this hard to believe the armenian genocide happened millions of people were killed in a deliberate attempt to eliminate an entire culture the united states and the rest of the world cannot must not continue to deny history the armenian people resisted the efforts to crush them and their courage and strength in the face of tremendous adversity should be praised it has been 80 years since the young turks came to power how much longer will the world wait to acknowledge the tragedy that befell the armenian people genocide is a crime against humanity that is unrivaled by any other when we next hear the plaintive cry never againt let us think of all
