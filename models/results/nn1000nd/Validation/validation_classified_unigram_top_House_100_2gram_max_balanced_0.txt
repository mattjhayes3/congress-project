the administration when they say that the contras are a democratic movement actually the contras most powerful military leaders are former members of general somozas national guard and the contra leader who had the most genuinely democratic and antisomoza credentials arturo cruz resigned this week from the contra leadership and is it really true that the contras pose a credible military threat to the sandinistas well the former head of the military command that oversees central america gen paul gorman has stated that he doesnt believe the contras can defeat the sandinistas actually the reagan administration has been supporting military efforts to overthrow the nicaraguan government while ignoring diplomatic opportunities to reach a negotiated settlement in the region is this policy really consistent with americas values the temporary moratorium on contra aid that we are voting on today can give us a chance to formulate a new policy toward nicaragua the peace plan proposed by

roosevelts election was just getting underway the terror of economic dissolution was palpable indeed on the day hoover signed the bill the angry remnants of what had been 17 000 members of the bonus armys world war i veterans were camped in washington the house had passed the patman bonus bill less than a month before only to see it defeated in the senate most of the veterans left washington but on july 22 there were still about 2 000 angry and desperate veterans in washington only 6 days after signing the home loan bank act hoover ordered the army to remove the veterans by force in an infamous act troops led by douglas macarthur in whose train was dwight eisenhower evicted the bonus army and burned its camp that was the climate that existed when this country took its first halting steps toward a national housing policy franklin d roosevelt announced the new deal in his nomination acceptance speech less than a month before hoover signed the law creating the federal home loan bank system interestingly enough his new deal platform did not include specific reference to housing it was a program for economic reform designed to bring some order out of the chaos of banking and securities restore some confidence and encourage states to create what later became the social security system in mid1932 when the new deal speech was written the full magnitude of the great depression was still developing needless to say the home loan bank act could not by itself do what needed to be done to house the poor let alone make home ownership possible for the great majority who were at the time tenants less than 40 percent of americans owned their homes then and many who did lost them in the depression in the chaos of the depression it represented little more than a faint flicker of hope when franklin d roosevelt became president in march 1933 he faced utter chaos nothingnot farms not banks not industrieswas working cities and towns had run out of money to feed and clothe the growing army of desperate people thrown out of work and off their farms you must remember that at that time america was mostly rural in that disastrous time urgent action had to be taken and it was within 100 days an incredible amount of legislation was enacted to restore order and begin finding the way to recovery among those acts was a relief program for homeowners the home owners refinancing act signed june 13 1933 this emergency relief act was the second great step toward a national housing program the refinancing act created a corporation capitalized by 200 million to refinance the mortgages of hardpressed homeowners a few months later in april 1934 an additional 1 billion in capital went into the corporation it did more than refinance mortgages the corporation could advance money to pay back taxes and provide for repairs and maintenance these cash advances could be for as much as 50 percent of the appraised value of the loan the whole thing being secured by the value of the property the home owners loan corporation remained in business for only 4 years but in that time it had made loans covering more than 1 million mortgages and it produced a profit fifty years later with the country in a recession as deep as any seen since 1933 notwithstanding to the contrary what we heard a few minutes ago i offered a bill to provide emergency help to hardpressed homeowmers and we called it that the emergency homeowners assistance act in colorado for instance in the city of pueblo where the steel mill was shutting down the sole source of employment the foreclosure rate on homes was 100 a month at that time i took the floor and asked this house to approve the homeowners emergency assistance act the house did indeed pass it the one and the only what my minority members called a new program that has been approved by the house under the reagan administration that is since 1981 it languished in the senate and it died in the senate a senate that in 6 years never once even had so much as a hearing on housing needs or community development needs of our country the senate proposed to do nothing and my proposal did nothing radically more than essentially what we had seen and i had witnessed during the depression in the homeowners loan corporation in fact did the research work on that bill myself and with the able help of the staff and counsel we reshaped it in terms of modern needs all it would do would be the same thing make loans against home equity to prevent those homes from being foreclosed ironically not too long in fact less than a year and a half after that in my home town of san antonio when i walked the line of about 203 fellow americans destitute homeless waiting to make their entry into the homeless shelter that had been provided them by the city i talked to one young relatively young because i consider anybody under 40 very young homeless father of two who had lost his home in pueblo co and had we enacted that program that i had envisioned he would have been enabled to have been assisted and to have remained under the roof and the shelter of his home instead of having to park his wife and kids with his parents in another state and wander through the south thinking that perhaps in the south he could find employment and come to a city such as san antonio where indeed the need was just as great as the city that he left i have never been able to understand why this simple humane eminently workable ideawas so adamantly opposed by the administration why it was willing to let so many thousands of people needlessly suffer the loss of their homes when hundreds of thousands could have been helped at virtually no real cost or risk to the government why not extend help to people who are suffering economic disaster through no fault of their own as a result of forces they cannot control it made sense in 1933 and it should make sense today a little more than a year after the home owners loan corporation bill was signed the national housing act of 1934 became law this law was truly monumental it brought up the capital of the home owners loan corporation to 3 billion but more than that this was the law establishing the federal housing administration at this point i want to render tribute to a man who passed on just last month on august 9 the great leon keyserling and i want to render testimony that it was his architectural hand his designing hand that devised the basic 1934 and 1937 national housing act and whose friendship and counsel i never dreamed i would be able to enjoy years later after those miserable dim days that i recall vividly because i am a depression kid and i was in school at the time and would enjoy his great wisdom and would have shared his last supper literally because he died 4 days after i had enjoyed an invitation to supper at his home here in washington leon keyserling actually is a man that i hope we can memorialize in a more lasting and meaningful way when the time comes but his real monument has been etched into these great acts of humanitarian legislation for he was the architect and the counsel and lawyer that devised and structured the basic fundamental framework of reference for this noteworthy legislation the fha became the engine of housing and home ownership as a matter of fact the miracle of the world in the 20th century was performed here in america because between 1940 and 1980 we reversed where a minority of american families owned their homes to a percentage increase of the overwhelming majority by 1980 the sad thing is that since 1980 we have had an increase in the emergence of this phenomena of modernday homelessness which is in epidemic proportions and for which this congress has passed emergency legislation just this year and all because there is cause and effect you cannot turn back on the basic commitment to housing and the allocation of national credit for construction of affordable housing affordable to the main mass and stream of our families today the average cost of a new singlefamily dwelling unit in the united states is over 175 000 that means that we have priced out all but 6 percent of americans from the dream of owning a brandnew singlefamily dwelling unit for their loved ones it was the fha through its system of mortgage insurance that made home loans a low risk proposition and made it possible for lenders to extend the longterm fixed rate mortgage that was the cornerstone the inspiration and the motivation of mass home ownership in this country under fha tens of millions of people have obtained home loans it has turned a profit its property standards insured a consistent quality of housing and its operations remain at the heart of home ownership in this country today since the national housing act of 1934 home ownership has become the rule not the exception no longer do twothirds of americans rent though we are in a period of regression and headed back to that twothirds live in their own homes thanks to these programs through fha the affordable mortgage became a reality and with it the affordable home the sensation of 1937 was president roosevelts famous fight to transform the supreme court by increasing the number of justices that is the old supreme court vehemently opposed packing charges the president was accused of trying to pack the supreme court in order to have a patsy supreme court which would give him the opportunity to pack the court with justices he believed would not overturn as the conservative court had his industrial recovery act the court fight made the bork case seem utterly tame it mesmerized the country from february to july but the great court fight was not all that was going on that year on september 1 the capstone national housing act of 1937 became law by 1937 the banking system was stable there was deposit insurance the refinancing programs for homes and farms had stemmed loan losses and the home loan bank system was in place the fha had begun its work what remained was to deal with slum clearance and to try and provide decent housing to the millions who could in no way afford to pay market rents the 1937 housing act created the unitedstates housing authority which was empbwered to make 60year loans to local housing agencies the local agencies had to put up 10 percent of the cost of clearing slums and erecting housing projects the authority had the power to grant operating subsidies so that rents could be geared to the incomes of poor families that basic mechanism remains in place to this very day what an honor to be able to rise at the end of this month to memorialize the congress on the fact that on the first day of this month exactly 50 years ago in this month of september the 1937 basic housing act was approved that in that day and time the congresses and their presidents did in fact have faith and confidence in the average american family in the faith that with just a bit of help it could be tided over in dire circumstances over which it had no control that not only would those loans made then under those conditions be repaid but that they would earn a profit to the treasury of the united states as indeed those programs did within a few years slum clearance could be seen and felt within 4 years the unitedstates housing authority had helped create 511 new housing projects for lowincome families with more than 161 000 units in the 50 years since enactment of the landmark 1937 housing act this government has expanded the assisted housing stock to some 4 million units about half of which are publicly owned today we still have in place in being and in operation the same basic housing tools that were created during the cataclysmic years between mid 1932 and mid1937 those tools were revolutionary in their concept and in their effect before this nation set out on what became a bipartisan commitment to a comprehensive housing policy a full third of our people lived in poor sometimes inhuman conditions today the proportion of people in substandard housing is perhaps 10 percent this reflects a monumental achievement and yet the need should not be that great its 5 percent more than 1980 nor would the need remain so great had not the present administration elected to withdraw from housing as far as it could in 1982 the administration even tried to eliminate mortgage insurance for most people it has managed to virtually stop construction of publicly owned housing units it has managed to prevent enactment of an emergency homeowners assistance program but it has failed to kill housing it has failed to stop enactment of this nations first effective emergency shelter program for homeless people and it has failed to prevent members of its party from joining in this years effort to reassert and begin to revitalize the comprehensive housing program that came into being with the housing act of 1937 the nations commitment to a decent and affordable home for every citizen has been fiercely advocated and honestly administered by a small dedicated extremely proficient corps of public servantsvisionaries and practical administrators innovators and financiers regulators and politicians it has worked it works still and after 50 years the dream is as alive as ever after 50 years we still have not reached

killed in the lamblance plaza cpllapse in bridgeport ct in april of last year twentyeight construction workers lost their lives when the partially built 13story apartment complex toppled to the ground this catastrophe was the worst human toll from a construction accident in a decade the legislation establishes a trust fund from the record 5 1 million in fines levied by the occupational safety and health administration against the contractors and subcontractors that engaged in sloppy construction and engineering practices and wantonly disregarded worker safety if the government successfully collects the 5 1 million in fines there may be little left to compensate the victims families the purpose of our bill is to ensure that the victims claims come first once the civil suits have been settled the remaining monies in the trust fund if any will be paid to the secretary of labor to be deposited into the treasury the fund will be administered by the unitedstates district court the government must share in the responsibility for the tragedy after listening to extensive testimony at five congressional hearings it is clear osha has failed to properly carry out its mandate to protect workers health and safety in several important areas of responsibility today i would like to share my impressions of osha and the way it has handled events surrounding the lambiance plaza collapse first it is imperative that osha review and change its reporting requirements current osha regulations stipulate that a construction accident must be reported only when a fatality or five or more hospitalizations occur i find it incomprehensible that an accident of the magnitude of lambiance would have gone unreported if fewer than five people were hospitalized or no life was lost oshas investigation into the lambiance collapse revealed a near disaster involving the same liftslab contractor at the metro center construction site in stamford ct 1 year earlier this accident should have served as a warning of impending tragedy but it was never reported because osha had no requirement that it be reported the metro center accident occurred when a shearhead failure caused part of a concrete floor to sag some 15 inches in an accident nearly identical to the lambiance incident not only was the same contractor involved in both accidents but the same faulty building techniques and practices were responsible osha officials expressed astonishment that more devastating damage did not take place at the mero center site it is clear an accident of this severity warranted a thorough investigation even though no lives were lost and only one worker wav injured had osha officials been notified of what happened at metro center they could have taken steps to prevent the tragedy at lambiance second from the testimony i heard from representatives of labor and the construction industry it is obvious that osha is severely understaffed and underfunded in the state of connecticut there are ten osha inspectors however of those 10 only 2 specialize in construction given the inherent hazards in the construction industry i find this statistic unacceptable regrettably osha officials testified before the health and safety subcommittee that they have all the resources they need third besides requiring more resources osha may need to reorganize itself at the very least a separate division should be established within osha solely to monitor and regulate the construction industry given the unique dangers of this industry it may even be advisable to create an ent ely new agency under the department of labor finally the assessment of high financial penalties such as the record 5 1 million in the lambiance plaza disaster cries out for criminal sanctions as well employers who knowingly violate safety codes should be held accountable for their actions for too long individuals within a corporation have been allowed to hide behind their corporate shield the company is fined the major decision makers within the company walk away scotfree it seems so obvious to me that an employer who knowingly disregards safety regulations resulting in the serious injury or death of an employee should be subject to criminal prosecution murder in the workplace cannot be tolerated recently osha referred the lambiance case to the department of justice for criminal prosecution the justice department must now decide whether to prosecute twentyeight workers lost their lives fines were imposed and yet no one has been prosecuted but even if individuals are prosecuted under current law the penalties can only be a maximum of 10 000 and 6 months in jail according to testimony before the employment and housing subcommittee osha has referred only 38 cases since its inception in 1970 for criminal prosecution of those 38 cases the justice department has pursued 14 this record is pathetic it is my understanding no one has spent 1 day in jail for violating federal osha law because of this dismal record states such as new york illinois and california have had the take the initiative in cases where osha has imposed a minimal monetary fine for a serious violation of safety codes state prosecutors have successfully pursued homicide convictions regrettably state prosecutors have recently pursued cases and won criminal convictions only to have them challenged on the grounds that feder al law preempts state law osha should immediately clarify the right of state prosecutors to impose criminal sanctions against employers who knowingly and recklessly disregard worker safety if necessary it should recommend to congress that the law be amended to make absolutely clear that the federal statute does not preempt the states in addition we must have a tougher and more aggressive federal statute the penalties are simply not strong enough it has been more than a year since the lamblance collapse tragically we have seen little movement to change any of the factors that contributed to the accident osha has not reviewed or modified its reporting requirements osha is undermanned and underfunded yet it has not requested additional resources osha has made no effort to establish a separate divislon to oversee construction in spite oi the unique dangers of the industry osha refuses to recommend any legislative or regulatory charges imposing tougher criminal sanctions or addressing the preemption issue twentyeight people lost their lives the victims families must not only live with the loss of their loved ones but also with the reality that their government has not responded to their tragedy the legislation we introduced yesterday will not correct the shortcomings of osha but it will ensure that the victims families

intelligence community truly enjoys the work that it does is critically important to the security of the united states ninetyfive percent of the work that it does is understood to be critical to our national security and in fact enjoys bipartisan support which is reflected in this bill i would also like to take a moment to add my words of admiration and commendation to our distinguished chairman i have had the privilege of serving on this committee now for 4 years one of the great benefits in doing so among many has been in serving under two very distinguished chairmen the gentleman from indiana mr hamiltoni and the gentleman from ohio these gentlemen are among the very best that public service has to offer not only in this congress but in the country it is a real joy and an education to serve with them and to learn from them and in some small way to contribute with them to the work of this committee which is so important to the congress and to the country i also want to comment the ranking member the gentleman from illinois with whom i sometimes disagree on a small fraction of issues but for whom i have great admiration as well"], [9.936094284057617e-05, 0.4999006390571594,

pass this we will have put ourselves under some very very impu tant legislation if you are going to ask for the public trust as we do every two years you ought to be acting in the public interest since we go around defining that every day it ought to apply to us too that is what this is all about a group of us started by congressman rose in north carolina congressman udall in arizona and myself about 10 years ago started doing this there have been about 100 members of congress for the last 10 years who have belonged to the fair employment practices committee where we have put ourselves under these laws i think those 100plus members should be very proud of the fact that there has been a group of us who have not been afraid to abide by the laws we extended to others we should point out that those 100plus members should get a lot of credit for being ahead of their time about 10 years ahead of their time so we are happy that the rest of the body will be catching up where many members have been all along it is great to have this apply acrosstheboard because one the frustrations of that group was that we would hear from staff people whom we could not help because their members had not signed our agreement to comply now members will not have the option to opt in or opt out of the agreement they will all be under it when this legislatir passes so i really compliment the committees for doing this because i know how hard it has been to do it having been out there for 10 years with this in trying to get members to sign up i know it is like being the skunk at the garden party i know the chairman has not had an easy time getting this going but it is the right thing to do and it is saying we will practice what we preach and it is saying that we will go forward with our head held high saying what we impose on others we too can live by after all it is what america is about equal opportunity fairness civil rights and equal rights for every single human being so i compliment the gentleman from california and his making this happen believe me i did not think it ever would happen so congratulations and thanks for his patience in putting this all

i think it is important at this time if this threat of revolution to which the gentleman refers is so imminent then why is it that virtually every latin american country with the exception of honduras and with the exception of costa rica is urging us to change our policy in fact the latin american countries through the contadora leadership are deploring our action in central america and they are

one of the worst tragedies that can happen and it is even more tragic because it is needless it is needless because we now have available costeffective automative sprinkler systems that effectively stop fires before they get going and before they snuff out a life yet the public in the united states remains at terrible risk from hotel fires despite the fact that there has never been multiple lives lost from a fire in a properly sprinklered building and despite the publics instinctive and reasonable assumption that the hotels and motels that they check into are protected by reasonable means we find that less than onehalf of the hotel rooms in the united states are now protected by sprinklers and it is time that public safety regulations caught up with public expectations ninetyseven americans died in 12 minutes in the dupont plaza hotel fire in puerto rico new years eve 1986 just several days before this congress convened it is i think especially fitting that the house of representatives in this session make a start on passing the kind of laws that will in the end assure that hotels and motels in america will truly be fire safe this bill represents a noncontroversial start down that road it is an argument between the committees on science space and technology and on government operations and i want to particularly salute those on the committee on government operations the gentlewoman from illinois and particularly the chairman of the full comittee the gentleman from texas for the attention they were able to give to this legislation as it came before them as passed originally by the comittee on science space and technology we would have simply prevented federal employees from receiving reimbursement for lodging expenses at hotels which were not firesafe i think we should be able to provide even stricter penalties than that nevertheless we were not able to reach that kind of agreement that would have been able to move that kind of legislation this alternative that is being considered today simply encourages hotels and motels to put firesafety features in place without using federal employees as the enforcement mechanism i believe that the bill should not be controversial the agreement developed by the two committees essentially would bar hotels and motels from being listed in the gsa federal travel directory which lists places of public accommodation that provide special government rates unless they meet firesafety guidelines for hotels and motels as issued by the unitedstates fire administration the bill would require these guidelines to include smokedetection systems in all hotels and motels with five or more rooms but most importantly it would require sprinklers in all hotels except those that meet the following criteria those that are two stories or lower those that have no interior corridors and those that have direct exits to the outside from all rooms to a groundlevel area this bill would at least put in that directory and focus the gsa on this kind of presently available fire protection it would also require the gsa to negotiate special rates for federal employees only with those hotels and motels that meet those guidelines and it would prohibit federal funds from sponsoring conferences or meetings or similar events at hotels and motels that do not meet those guidelines this bill does not solve all the safety problems the public will encounter in staying in hotels across the country indeed federal employees will still be able to stay in hotels that do not meet that standard but it does demonstrate the federal governments support for firesafe hotels and indirectly it will enhance the safety of the public in staying in all hotels when we can install sprinklers for the cost of redecorating we ought to be requiring strictly requiring sprinklers i urge my colleagues to vote for h r 3704 the public has the right to expect firesafe hotels wherever they travel in this

only to point out some violations of international law and then i would hope the gentleman would take some time and discuss this on his own in a moment within this order i want to point out the fact that this particular butterfly mine that only maims not only is devastating in a human rights sense but it is actually prohibited under the protocol that has been signed we had an article recently in the christian science monitor which quoted a mr norchi an international lawyer specializing in human rights and a fellow of international law at yale university he teaches there of course mr norchi has testified before congress he has given information to various publications he says the international law on the matter is clear and i quote the customary international law is codified in the protocol on prohibitions or restrictions on the use of mines boobytraps and other devices known as protocol number 2 referred to as the land mines protocol annexed to the 1981 u n convention on prohibition or restrictions on the use of certain conventional weapons which may be deemed to be excessively injurious and to have indiscriminate effects under the u n convention remotely delivered mines such as butterflies are prohibited by article v 1 of the land mines protocol except within an area which is itself a military objective or which contains military objectives and then not unless their location can be accurately recorded in accordance with the protocol or unless each mine has a selfactuating or a remotely controlled mechanism which will render the mine harmless or cause its destruction when the mine no longer serves its intended military purpose article iii 3 prohibits all indiscriminate use of mines this is the placement of a weapon a which is not on or directed at a military objective or b which employs a method or means of delivery which cannot be directed at a specific military objective or e which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life injury to civilians damage to civilian objects or a combination thereof which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated now i cannot imagine anything more in violation of this protocol than the kind of a mine that is laid this butterfly mine that the gentleman from california described a few moments ago which caused this injury that kind of a mine is what is all over afghanistan randomly placed by the soviets cannot have a good military purpose certainly is in violation of international law and they will not even give the united nations the maps if they have the maps to show where any of these mines are laid so that they can be cleared when they move out and the refugees are going to move back in that is the real crux of the problem here

glass five years ago we made an eastwest policy decision we decided to confront communism in central america by aiding the freedom fighters called contras on tle home turf of the communist presence in nicaragua it was a policy i agreed with it was a policy many of you disagreed with but it was a policy we could all understand on february 3 we made a new eastwest policy decision on february 3 this house voted to end that confrontation to end our support for the freedoma fighters who are confronting communism in nicaragua it was a decision i disagreed with i pointed out we are abandoning forces in the field we had helped place there it was a bad decision but it was a decision nevertheless it made some sense to some and it is one that we could all understand but today like alice in wonderland we step across the looking glass today we are asked to vote on a proposal that says let us aid both sides of the conflict lets send money to both parties in this conflict between east and west in nicaragua it is the equivalent if you will to a decision to send aid to nazi germany during world war ii after all hitler had innocent civilians who were victims of that war did we decide to send aid to nazi germany in the middle of that conflict of course not a decision to send aid to both sides in this conflict would be just as silly and just as ridiculous no this is not an eastwest policy vote any more it is simply a foreignaid vote it is simply a decision to send a whole bucket of money to nicaragua to everybody over there on both sides of the conflict it is simply a foreignaid vote now we have people in america who are hurting as much as anyone is hurting in nicaragua and if what we want to do is send some money to somebody i suggest that we look at our districts and look at things at home if you want to defend in a 30second commercial a decision that you sent money to both sides in an eastwest conflict that you added to the foreignaid budget of this nation on this vote today that you could make no real policy decision about which side you wanted to fall on in this eastwest conflict then perhaps you can vote for this program but i suggest in the meantime that the comment made to me by a cajun friend is beginning to make more and more sense as we face this proposal this afternoon i was riding with him in my car and he said you know billy things are not like they are no i said to myself what on earth does he mean then it dawned on me that he could be in this congress today he could be proposing this ridiculous offer to send money to both sides because let me say to the
