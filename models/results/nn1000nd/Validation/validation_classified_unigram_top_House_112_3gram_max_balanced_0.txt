took it on the chin more than 8 million americans lost their job through no fault of their own and as millions of americans were losing their jobs and their homes the big banks received bailouts and ceos continued to receive milliondollar payouts while too many middle class americans are still out looking for work this congress is voting again to give over 160 000 a year in tax breaks to the richest 2 percent of americans while the average american will be lucky to get about one100th or maybe two100ths of that can anyone in this chamber blame the middle class for thinking the system is rigged against them we all admire financial success but when we give away trillions in tax cuts that we cannot afford to those who need them the least its the middle class who has to make up the difference to pay for these tax cuts our republican colleagues have voted to end medicare and would force seniors to pay 6 400 more for their own care on top of that republicans propose changing social security slashing its budget by over 800 million its an ideological agenda that chooses millionaires over the middle class regular folks pay more so that folks like donald trump and mitt romney can get yet another tax break einstein is credited with saying that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results eleven years after the bush

come together in recognition of our shared values from world war ii to 9 11 to hurricane katrina americans came together when needed thats why its so sad to see house republicans draft a budget reconciliation bill that carries dangerous implications for millions of americans and will fundamentally erode our shared values of course this is nothing more than political theater because authorization for budget reconciliation has to pass both the house and senate which it hasnt but that hasnt stopped the house republican majority from trying to deem it to be so therefore the republican majority has directed six house committees to use this reconciliation ruse to find drastic and damaging investment cuts not to reduce the deficit mind you but to prevent any cut in military spending which they originally agreed to and to give the richest 1 percent yet another big tax cut last year congress agreed in a bipartisan fashion after the majority brought us to the brink of default to cut 2 1 trillion from federal deficits establishing automatic cuts designed to be universally painful to encourage us to reach an agreement on a longterm deficit reduction proposal that more equitably spreads the burden a bipartisan majority of the supercommittee including every senate republican did come up with just such a plan to put everything on the tablespending cuts revenue increases entitlement reformbut it needed a supermajority and sadly every republican house member on that committee voted no which leaves us where we are today facing damaging automatic cuts to defense and nondefense spending but republican reconciliation ruses wont stop the automatic cuts to the nations seniors and disadvantaged it doubles down on the pain the republican reconciliation ruse literally takes food out of the mouths of needy children and senior citizens it eliminates social services block grants providing assistance to states and localities across the nation to serve millions of disadvantaged americans it ends the meals on wheels program for 1 7 million seniors it guts the supplemental nutrition assistance program formerly known as food stamps that serves 46 million of our fellow americans every month under their plan 1 8 million people would lose the most basic of assistance in addition 300 000 lowincome children lose their free and reduced lunches at school this reconciliation ruse once again singles out federal employees for ever more sacrifices federal workers already have contributed 60 billion to deficit reduction through a 2year pay freeze theyve contributed another 15 billion through recent changes to their retirement system the ryan budget demands an additional 3year pay freeze the new proposal goes further and cuts paychecks by 5 percent to shift more of the burden to employees this draconian measure would add another 79 8 billion in the sacrifice put on the backs of federal workers more than double the 75 billion theyve already made the reconciliation ruse actually will increase health care costs for millions of american families it eliminates tax credits that help lowerincome families maintain affordable health insurance premiums in fact 350 000 people will actually lose their health insurance with their plan of course the one glaring omission in the republican reconciliation ruse is not surprisingly revenue while millions of lower and middleincome families are being forced to sacrifice what do republicans ask of the wealthiest 1 percent nothing over the last 4 years oil and gas companies made a profit of 290 billion private companies should make profits and its a good thing but in that same time frame they lobbied to keep their 16 billion in tax breaks representing less than 6 percent of their profits but it sure would make sure a lot of hungry kids go to bed with full bellies at night the ryan budget actually seeks to cut the top income tax bracket from 35 percent to 25 percent who pays the current top tax bracket those making more than 388 000 each year not only are they not asked to join in any of the shared sacrifice but theyre actually offered a new christmas present early just for them its time to call the republican budget plan what it is an outright attack on american values how else do you explain shifting the burden from partisan priorities entirely to the middle class and those who are less fortunate thats never been an american value i urge my colleagues to reject this ruse to reject the reconciliation process and to work toward a comprehensive and responsible and

individuals and most profitable corporations to contribute their fair share in my lifetime i have never seen such a concerted effort to ransom the american economy in order to extort the american public while i support bipartisan efforts to increase the debt limit and to resolve our differences over budgetary revenue and spending issues i cannot support a bill that unduly robs average

about sharp cuts in the very near term because of the potential impact on the recovery that doesnt at all precludein fact i believe its entirely consistent witha longerterm program that will bring our budget into a sustainable position the boehner plan does just that it will cut cut cut without taking into full consideration the serious cuts to social security medicare and medicaid this bill is essentially a rehashed version of the same bill that president obama promised to veto and the senate vowed to reject it asks for 917 billion in cuts from domestic spending for a 900 billion dollar increase in the debt ceiling while demanding nothing in revenue from the nations wealthiest this is nothing more than a ransom note irresponsibly raising the debt ceiling for only a few months so that in just a short period of time the american public will be hit again for 1 6 trillion in cuts from social security medicare medicaid and veterans benefits anyone who believe that this plan will not result in a serious cut to social security should consider this social security represents 20 percent of all federal spending making it unrealistic to think such large cuts in mandatory spending will not affect social security benefits i state here today that the boehner proposal is illconceived and fails to offer a balanced approach to decreasing the deficit instead of requiring shared sacrifice the boehner plan places the entire burden on the backs of seniors the middle class and our nations most vulnerable citizens while doing nothing to close corporate tax giveaways and increase taxes on those most able to afford them the boehner plan calls for large cuts in discretionary programs of 1 2 trillion over the next 10 years through strict new spending caps most experts predict that the first round of cuts would target discretionary programs including education infrastructure job training and law enforcement the boehner plan would then require an additional 1 8 trillion in savings to be identified by the end of the year as a condition for raising the debt ceiling again at that time given the magnitude of these additional required savings it would result in deep draconian cuts in federal entitlement programs such as social security medicare and medicaid a repeal of health reforms coverage expansions and a dramatic reduction in safety net programs for vulnerable americans such as food stamps and unemployment and disability insurance this is unacceptable and each is avoidable if corporations and the wealthy are required to shoulder a fair share of this burden the speakers plan requires a vote on an illadvised constitutional balanced budget amendment in both chambers of congress by the end of this year the details surrounding exactly which proposed constitutional balanced budget amendment will be voted on are unclear however earlier proposals that have appeared in the house of representatives including h j res 1 would have a devastating impact on discretionary spending and on our modest economic recovery passing an amendment to the constitution is one of the most serious processes the united states congress can undertake requiring a two thirds supermajority of support in both the house and senate and ratification by threefourths 3 4 of the states the founders purposely made the amendment process a long and arduous one do my republican colleagues really expect congress to capriciously pass an amendment altering our nations founding document on such short notice an amendment that will fundamentally change our country without reasonable time for debate without the opportunity for a hearing or questioning of witnesses without any reports as to what impact it may have by tying the fate of whether the united states pays its debt obligations to the historically prolonged constitutional amendment process the republicans who support this bill have demonstrated at this critical juncture in american history that they are profoundly irresponsible when it comes to the integrity of our economy and utterly bereft of sensible solutions for fixing it the speakers plan will result in for 2 7 trillion in deficit reduction and a 2 5 trillion increase in the debt limit in two stages with the two debt ceiling increases being conditioned upon enactment of an initial set of spending cuts and a later second deficit reduction measure i do not believe that congress should yield its authority to what amounts to a commission boehners plan creates a 12member joint congressional committee to develop a plan for an additional 1 8 trillion in deficit reduction that congress would vote on in december in addition the speakers plan authorizes the president to submit a 900 billion increase in the 14 3 trillion debt ceiling immediately after enactment of this bill and a 1 6 trillion increase if the 1 8 trillion deficit reduction measure is enacted both debt limit increases would take effect automatically unless congress enacted resolutions of disapproval the speakers plan also requires the house and senate to vote by the end of the year on a balanced budget amendment to the constitution as i have stated before this will tie the hands of congress finally as noted above the boehner proposal provides only a shortterm extension of the federal debt ceiling this means that the gridlock that now prevails in our government will continue for the remainder of the 112th congress according to the center on budget and policy recent reports have suggested that rating agencies will downgrade the unitedstates credit rating if the boehner proposal is enacted this would result not only in higher interest costs to the federal government but also would raise the interest rate paid by individuals and families on car loans credit cards and mortgages throughout the united states taken together all of these factors would undermine the nations fragile recovery there has been a theme this congress of focusing on cutting programs that benefit the public good and for the most at need while ignoring the need to focus on job creation and economic recovery this bill is wasting a tremendous amount of time when we should be focused on paying our nations bills and resolving our differences in my district the texas 18th more than 190 000 people live below the poverty line we must not we cannot at a time when the census bureau places the number of american living in poverty at the highest rate in over 50 years cut vital social services not in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis and persistent unemployment when so many rely on federal benefits to survive like the supplemental nutrition access program snap that fed 3 9 million residents of texas in april 2011 or the women infant and children wic program that provides nutritious food to more than 990 000 mothers and children in my home state in 2009 there were 43 6 million americans living in poverty nationwide according to the 2010 federal poverty threshold determined by the us census a family of four is considered impoverished if they are living on less than 22 314 per year children represent a disproportionate amount of the united states poor population in 2008 there were 15 45 million impoverished children in the nation 20 7 of americas youth the kaiser family foundation estimates that there are currently 5 6 million texans living in poverty 2 2 million of them children and that 17 4 of households in the state struggle with food insecurity there is no doubt that we must reduce the national debt but my republican colleagues desire for instant gratification through deep spending cuts to benefits medicare medicaid and social security is reckless and threatens the financial security of millions of americans instead of closing corporate tax loopholes to reduce the deficit the budget control act cuts discretionary spending and requires congress to draft proposals to cut at least 1 8 trillion from medicare and social security this is an outrage and an insult to the american dream forcing congress to draft plans to cut 1 8 trillion from medicare and social security forces members to disregard the best interests of their constituents medicare guarantees a healthy and secure retirement for americans who have paid into it for their entire working lives protecting medicare represents the basic values of fairness and respect for our seniors including the 2 9 million texans who received medicare in 2010 any cuts to medicaid would be just as damaging harris county has one of the highest medicaid enrollment records in texas limits and cuts to medicaid funds would significantly hurt the citizens of texass 18th district harris county averages between 500 4300 and 600 000 medicaid recipients monthly thousands of people who may not have access to healthcare should congress sacrifice medicaid to cut spending yes we must take steps to balance the budget and reduce the national debt but not at the expense of vital social programs it is unconscionable that in our nation of vast resources my republican colleagues would pass a budget that cuts funding for essential social programs poverty impacts far too many americans and social safety nets provide these individuals with vital assistance perhaps my friends on the other side of the aisle are content to conclude that life simply is not fair equality is not accessible to everyone and the less advantaged among us are condemned to remain as they are but i do not accept that that kind of complacency is not fitting for america as we continue to discuss the necessity of increasing out debt ceiling i have heard the concerns of many of my constituents and the american people regarding the size of our national debt and the care with which taxpayer money is spent i too am concerned about these issues for to burden future generations of americans with tremendous amounts of debt should not be a way to avoid our fiscal responsibilities to the american people however the task of resolving our debt ceiling crisis must take precedence over other concerns including political ideology the game is up and the american people understand that increasing the debt ceiling has nothing to do with any new spending and everything to do with paying off the obligations that we have already agreed to and promised to pay prior to the existence of the debt ceiling congress had to approve borrowing each time the federal government wished to borrow money in order to carry out its functions with the onset of world war i more flexibility was needed to expand the governments capability to borrow money expeditiously in order to meet the rapidly changing requirements of funding a major war in the modern era to address this need the first debt ceiling was established in 1917 allowing the federal government to borrow money to meet its obligations without prior congressional approval so long as in the aggregate the amount borrowed did not eclipse a specified limit since the debt limit was first put in place congress has increased it over 100 times in fact it was raised 10 times within the past decade congress last came together and raised the debt ceiling in february 2010 today the debt ceiling currently stands at 14 3 trillion dollars in reality that limit has already been eclipsed but due to accounting procedures by treasury secretary geithner the debt limit can be artificially avoided until congress must act now in order to avert a crisis never in the history of america has the united states defaulted on its debt obligations we must be clear on what this issue means for our country america has earned a reputation as the worlds most trusted borrower united states treasury bonds have traditionally been one of the safest investments another country or investor could make for investors around the world purchasing a unitedstates treasury bond meant that they held something virtually as safe as cash backed by the full faith and credit of the united states government in turn with the proceeds from the bonds the federal government of the worlds largest economy is able to finance its operations if the united states defaults on its debt obligations the financial crisis that began in 2008 would pale in comparison according to economic experts the ensuing economic catastrophe would not only place the unitedstates economy in a tailspin but the world economy as well the fact that congress a body that typically has its fair share of political battles has never played political chicken when it came to raising the debt ceiling should give us all pause and is a testament to the seriousness with which we must approach this issue however this time around my republican colleagues have created an impasse based upon an ideological commitment to spending cuts while i understand and share the concern of my republican colleagues with respect to deficit spending and will continue to work with them in order to find reductions now is not the time to put ideology over pragmatism the reality is that on august 3rd the united states will begin to default on its debt obligations if the debt ceiling is not raised this unnecessarily places the american public and the economy between a rock and a hard place either congress sides completely with the radical agenda of the tea party which irresponsibly pulls the chair out from under the average american while polishing the throne of the wealthiest this detour into a spending debate is as unnecessary as it is perilous as increasing the debt ceiling does not obligate the undertaking of any new spending by the federal government rather raising the debt limit simply allows the government to pay existing legal obligations promised to debt holders that were already agreed to by presidents and congresses both past and present moreover the impending crisis would have already occurred were it not for the extraordinary measures taken by treasury secretary timothy geithner including the suspension of the investment in securities to finance the civil service retirement and disability fund as well as the redemption of a portion of those securities already held by that fund if the united states defaults on its obligations on august 3rd the stock market will react violently to the news that for the first time in history america is unable to keep its promises to pay not once in american history has the countrys full faith and credit been called into question once america defaults investors who purchase unitedstates bonds and finance our government will be less likely to lend to america in the future just as a person who defaults on a loan will find it harder to convince banks to lend them money in the future a country that defaults on its debt obligations will find it harder to convince investors to lend money to a government that did not pay showing the world that the united states does not pay its debts makes the purchasing of that debt less desirable because it requires the assumption of more risk on the part of the investors the proponents of this bill are putting the country at serious risk of losing its status as the worlds economic superpower our allies will lose faith in our ability to manage global economic affairs our status in the world will be diminished which will undermine our leverage on the world stage that allows us to command the respect and compliance of other nations when it comes to decisionmaking this bill will reduce americas ability to compete with a surging china furthermore any investors that do continue to purchase unitedstates treasury bonds will demand much higher interest rates in order to cover the increased risk once a default occurs investors figure that the chance of the united states defaulting again is much greater and will require the government to pay higher rates of interest in order to make the loan worth the risk for investors to take on imagine the impact on our stock market if we do not pay our debts as we have seen throughout the recent financial crisis a bad stock market hurts not only big businesses and large investors on wall street but small businesses and small investors as well families with investments tied to the stock market such as 401 k s pension plans and savings will once again see the value of their investments drop the american people are tired of the uncertainty of the value of their retirement accounts we must not allow another wild fluctuation to occur due to default and add to the uncertainty still lingering in the minds of citizens the speakers plan is a short term fix for a long term issue it is a patch rather than a proper repair boehners plan requires that congress address debtceiling once again in a short span of time which will once again lead to market uncertainty in a time when we are trying to rebuild our nation this plan is not good for wall street and it is not good for the american people the speakers bill is a shortterm debt limit increase that will only ensure that congress will go through this exact same standoff again in the next few months shortterm proposals risk further uncertainty and the potentially damaging downgrade of the unitedstates credit rating the markets have made it clear that a shortterm extension is not sufficient and could result in very serious consequences while democrats support deficit reduction we support doing it in a balanced way that provides certainty to the economy as if another stock market crisis were not enough the housing market would take another hit if america defaulted higher mortgage rates in a housing market already weakened by default and foreclosures would cause a further depression of home values destroying whatever equity families might have left in their homes after the housing crisis moreover the longterm effects would reduce spending and investment in the housing market increasing the debt ceiling is the responsible thing to do congress has already debated and approved the debt that an increased ceiling makes room for however my republican colleagues have chosen to use this as an opportunity to hold the american people hostage to their extreme agenda even prominent republicans like senator john mccain and christine todd whitman have criticized the radical elements of their party who insist upon holding up the entire political process in order to flaunt their extreme irrational and unrealistic ideology senator mccain has called the tea partys stance and the way they have conducted themselves during this manufactured crisis bizarre and i am inclined to agree their agenda for this country is even too radical for speaker boehner with the tea party vowing to reject their leaders own bill they live in a world that is not the world that the american people live in in their world they believe that taxes are always too high even on people making over a billion a year in a struggling economy that any increase in revenue is fundamentally wrong even if it comes from large corporations who use tax loopholes at the expense of our jobcreating small businesses that investing anything in our economic future above tax revenues is impermissible even in the midst of an economic downturn and that tax cuts for the wealthy are always the nations top priority even at the expense of people that depend on social security medicare medicaid and veterans benefits to survive these beliefs place them on the fringe of american society and yet due to the nature our political process they have held up the entire government and placed our economy on the precipice of a turbulent second recession if congress cannot find a resolution then congress will open the possibility that the president may invoke the fourteenth amendment to united states constitution section four which states the validity of the public debt of the united states shall not be questioned the argument can be made that if congress will not resolve our nations pending default then the president to protect the interest of our nation must act the president would then have to consider his powers under the fourteenth amendment which may grant him the authority to raise the debt ceiling on his own through executive order and if congress fails to raise the debt limit by the august 2 2011 deadline as a body we should not place the president or our country in this position for those reasons i urge my colleagues to consider the constituents in their home districts who would be hurt by this bill i urge my colleagues to return to the world in which the vast majority of americans live in a world in which our shared destiny is determined by reasonable minds and good faith efforts to compromise federal reserve chairman ben bernanke warned that defaulting could throw the financial system into chaos and destroy the trust and confidence that global investors have in treasury securities as being the safest liquid assets in

institute says they are wrong estimating that a mere 3 percent of americans under 65 will face the choice between purchasing insurance and paying a penalty lets review what the affordable care act actually does we know it extends health insurance to 32 million uninsured americans which will prevent the unnecessary deaths of 45 000 people who die each year because they lack health insurance we know it will enable millions of americans with preexisting medical conditions to get insurance this has gotten publicity also every middle class family today is one cancer diagnosis away from bankruptcy fiftyfive percent of all personal bankruptcies are caused by health care emergencies and 75 percent of these bankruptcies are of people who had health insurance but health insurance that proved inadequate to cover an expensive disease like cancer by preventing insurance companies from denying coverage for preexisting conditions and by eliminating the annual and lifetime caps on coverage found in most current policies the affordable care act will guarantee that middle class families will no longer have to fear going broke because of an expensive illness despite all of the benefits of this law republicans have decided the whole law must go fine they want to repeal and replace replace it with what what is the republican plan to stem the everrising cost of health care in this country and to reduce outofpocket health costs what is the republican plan to help millions more americans gain access to health insurance what is the republican plan to end discrimination in the insurance market for women for those with preexisting conditions for those who are sick and going broke with medical bills and those who die because of lack of care there is none the simple truth is

boehnercould never go against grover norquist the republicans shake in their boots they will not do anything even though the american people by a more than 70 percent majority say people making more than 1 million a year should contribute to what the problems are in this country so that fell apart then we had the gang of 6 senatorsthree republicans three democratswho had been on the bowlessimpson commission who said we should do something about this they were in the press they had press conferences and this was going down the road and doing all kinds of great things while that was going on there was a decision made and a law was passed to create a supercommittee to which i appointed senator patty murray of washington to run no one in the senate democrat or republican has more respect than patty murray she worked so hard with the other 11 members of congress to come up with something a few days before they were to arrive at a decisionand the gang of 6 members are out here doing all this stuff all the timei get a letter signed by virtually every republican senator saying we are not going to raise revenue for anything the supercommittee didnt work there the gang of 6 is gone so we passed this last august to fund government for 2 years and to say if we dont arrive at another 1 2 trillion in deficit reduction during this year it automatically kicks in at the end of this year or the beginning of next year so that is where we are and the republicans in the house are trying to change that so that is what this little history lesson has been all about i dont like to sequester i wish we didnt have to do it it was a hard pill to swallow but it was the right thing to do if we are ever going to reduce the staggering deficit we are going to have to make some hard decisions so that is what this is all about but that is the point it is hard to do therefore we have to do it to sequesterwhich in effect would take almost 500 billion from domestic programs and almost 500 billion from defense programs they were designed to be tough enough to force two sides to reach a balanced deal it hasnt happened yet as i said earlier with general eisenhowers statement i didnt make that up that is what he said my complaint about the republicans being so unreasonable about everything is something where i am not a lone wolf crying in the wilderness we have two longtime nonpartisan watchers of congress one from the american enterprise institute which is a conservative think tank another from brookings institute that wrote an article saying it is the republicans cant you see what they are doing here is one thing they said we have been studying washington politics in congress for more than 40 years and never have we seen them this dysfunctional in our past writings we have criticized both parties when we believed it was warranted today however we have no choice but to acknowledge that the core of the problem lies with the republican party they further said the gop has become an insurgent outlier in american politics it is ideologically extreme of scornful compromise unmoved by conventional understanding of facts evidence and science and dismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition what brave men to do that to write these commentswhich are true i have been saying that i dont want to fight about everything republicans insist on balancing the budget on the backs of the middle class seniors students single mothers and those who could least afford it that is what they are doing over there today it is their refusal to compromise that leaves us facing the threat of sequester and it is difficult but it is balanced going back to the august budget agreement now in order to protect wealthy special interests is no solution neither is refighting the battles of last year democrats agree we must reduce our deficits and make hard choices but we believe in a balanced approach that shares the pain as well as the responsibility is the sequester the best way to achieve that balance no but republicans refuse to consider a more reasonable approachone for example that asks every american to pay his fair share while making difficult choices to reduce spending democrats will not agree to a onesided solution that lets the superwealthy off the hook while forcing the middle class and those in greatest need to bear all the hardship democrats believe we can protect americans access to health care create jobs while investing in the future and protect the poor and elderly but we cant do it alone it will take work and compromise and so far republicans have been unwilling to make a serious effort to achieve that result republicans have rejected our balanced approach their onesided solution to acrosstheboard cuts would take away from the many to give to the few here is what the plan would donot all of it but here is what their plan would do remember they are taking it up over there in the house today it would cut medicaid benefits increasing the number of uninsured children parents seniorsand that is in addition to people with disabilitiesby hundreds of thousands just eliminate them it would also put seniors in nursing homes at risk some of them would have to move out of the nursing home i guess it would punish americans who receive tax credits to purchase health insurance when their financial circumstances change causing 350 000 americans to have no coverage this would add to the tens of millions who already exist that way it would weaken wall street reforms protecting big banks at the expense of consumers their legislation would once again target middleclass workers food inspectors air traffic controllers border patrol agents drug enforcement and fbi agents they would have to be laid off it would cut funding for preventive health care programs that fight chronic illnessessuch as heart disease cancer strokes and diabetesthat cause 70 percent of the deaths in america preventive care would be reined in it would

as unprecedented and i believe that it probably is unprecedented what it saysi mean i have almost memorized the one sentence it says that we need to make sure that the budget committee and the appropriations committee work to get us to 2008 spending levels or less i personally believe that we should be substantially below 2008 levels i believe that we need to take that kind of action and its true before the president stands right over my shoulder at 9 oclock this evening and delivers his state of the union message we want this institution to have a chance to go on record saying that we are committed to doing everything that we can to get the spending levels to 2008 or less now we are in the position we are and that itself is unprecedented and thats why unprecedented action is necessary now i began my remarks by talking about the fact that probably one of the most enduring and powerful memories of 2010 was what took place in athens greece we saw the riots take place in the streets from public service employees in the wake of the government facing the responsibility of imposing austerity standards on the people of greece and what happened we saw this huge outcry come because they were arguing that they couldnt in fact bring about cuts in spending i juxtapose that to what we saw in the last year here we saw tens of thousands of americans taking to the streets carrying this message taxed enough already they came together to petition their government to bring about spending reductions not complaining that the government was making cuts complaining that the government wasnt making enough cuts and thats exactly what were doing in fact i believe that this may be the first time in human history that we have witnessed what it was that we saw take place last year and led to the outcome in the november 2 election we know that the greatest change in threequarters of a century took place in this institution sixtythree members of the democratic party were defeated we now have 87 new republicans and nine new democrats who have joined with us and they have carried this message to us that we need to rein in spending now i think its important to note that our real goal is above that it is job creation and economic growth getting our economy back on track so that people out there who are trying to get onto the first rung of the economic ladder are able do just that we have a painfully high unemployment rate and people across this country are hurting now what steps can we take to create jobs i personally believe that we need toand i look forward to having the president talk about this tonightopen up new markets around the world so that union and nonunion workers in the united states of america can have the opportunity to sell goods and provide services into countries like colombia and panama and south korea where these pending agreements exist i believe that since japan has brought about a reduction in its top corporate rate the rate of those job creators we can reduce the top corporate rateits the highest rate of any country in the world nowfrom 35 to 25 percent i understand the president may be proposing that this evening that will go a long way towards creating jobs but what were doing with h res 38 is we are getting ourselves on a path towards fiscal responsibility and i believe that that is one of the most important things that we can do as we seek this shared goal of job creation and economic growth so if we can let this institution go on record in support of getting to 2008 levels or less i am convinced that that will

in having had the opportunity to review tsas operations actually one of the individuals responsible for creating tsa back after the events of 9 11 when we had to put in place a transportation security measure and operation for the nation which we didnt have prior to that when we set up tsa and particularly where we provided for a new way of aviation passenger screening we actually created two models one a private sector model which is the federal setting of guidelines and all of the rules for conducting screening and then federal operation of the screening but also a second model which was federal government setting the rules and the protocols for operation but using private screeners we set up five models of differentsized category airports to test this and see how it would work testing the allfederal model against the federal model with private operators i can tell you that after testing this several years after operational testing not by me but by the government accountability office they found in fact that the private screeners performed statistically significantly better than the other screeners tsa wasnt happy with these findings and it captured a great deal of the market and activity so they did everything they could to distort some of the findings and change the way the airports were tested even so about 16 airports now operate with private screeners under federal supervision tomorrow our committee and this is the transportation committee our investigations and oversight committee will reveal the most comprehensive report of looking at these operations and we are comparing apples and apples to see which one runs better and more cost effectively for the taxpayer without a doubt this report will show the substantial savings in fact within 5 years if we converted 38 of the top airports to federal operations again federal oversight with private screening we could save 1 billion and i was prepared to try to transfer earlier in the bill double the amount of money theres 144 million in here for private screening operations under federal supervision that we currently have and double that amount of money which could have gotten us much more passenger screening and do it much more cost effectively for the taxpayers and actually most of our initiatives positive initiatives have come from these private screening models in any event that was my intent at this point in the bill i can only take money from the overall screening activity or limit it its my understanding that after i strike the last word ill have an opportunity to offer an amendment that will in fact limit the amount of money for the allfederal screening modelnot taking it out of tsa but giving discretion to the administrator and hopefully applying it once again we restart the private screening under federal supervision actually as i speak all 16 airports continue but we restart opening it to other airports i want to make certain that we have the funds available to accomplish that goal and thats the purpose of my amendment so im not taking away from the overall money to tsa im limiting the amount of money that can be used and now we have a federal screening force im told of some 41 000 give or take 500 screeners this bill authorizes up to 46 000 im told so we stay within the caps"], [0.001047968864440918, 0.4989520311355591, 1, "i oppose the gentlemans amendment in drafting this bill the chairwoman and i sought to strike the right balance between protecting homeowners and strengthening the flood insurance program i believe that the bill before us today does just that unfortunately i do not believe that the gentlemans amendment strikes the same balance specifically by creating a reserve fund the gentlemans amendment would allow the nfip to increase insurance premiums on homeowners so regardless of their flood risk homeowners will have to pay more in order to fund a reserve fund that will never have enough money to pay out claims for catastrophic events this isnt fair to our taxpayers and in fact would stall the already slow recovery of the housing market i understand the problem that the gentleman is attempting to solve we all know that the flood insurance program is over 17 billion in debt due to claims resulting from hurricane katrina however i think we have to be clear that hurricane katrina was a catastrophic once in a lifetime event prior to katrina the flood insurance program operated completely in the black in addition i believe that the bill contains many provisions that would allow the flood insurance program to reform its premium structure so that it can collect the premiums it needs to pay out claims for example the bill ends subsidies for 350 000 prefirm properties including second homes commercial properties homes with new owners homes substantially damaged or improved and homes with repetitive claims by making these properties pay actuarial rates that reflect their full risk the bill would make these properties pay their fair share thereby increasing the amount of funding to the flood insurance fund while i believe that the gentlemans amendment is very well intended i believe that it is unnecessary given the strong reforms in this bill and the potential problems it may cause for homeowners particularly those that have been phased into actuarial rates for these reasons i must oppose the amendment and i would urge a no vote i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.0010851919651031494, 0.49891480803489685, 0, "i raise a point of order against the amendment the acting

quickly before i turn to my colleague fromrhode island you mentioned student loans now the president has been out in california in los angeles and in san francisco near my district and hes been saying something that really caught my attention and that is we cant wait speaking for the american people we cant wait for congress to act we cant wait and he did something that is really really close to home my daughter and soninlaw just finished medical school they have huge loans that they took out to go through medical school but across this nation about 1 trillion of loans have been taken out by young men and womenand olderwho have gone back to school to improve themselves to get an education to learn a skill 1 trillion out there and many of those loans are at a very high interest rate and they may be from different sectors and the president says we cant wait to help these people these young men and women and others who have these loans they need help today and so he put together a new program based upon a law that we passed last yearthe democrats passed last yearthat said were going to do some consolidation so hes taken that step hes going to allow for the consolidation of these loans into one loan package and allow the interest rate to be reduced on the average at least a half percent interest rate and stretched outand a small percentage of the income and many of these young men and womenim just going to say men and women theyre not all youngarent able to get a job other than just a minimum wage and so they cant pay so hes giving them a break and thats what we want our president to do we want our president to go out there and say we cant wait for congresseven though im ready to go and i know my colleagues areand giving them a break this is really important that he has done this"]]}
