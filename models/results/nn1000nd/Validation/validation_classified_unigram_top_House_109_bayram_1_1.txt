general shinseki who was right about iraq he had the huge error in this administration of being truthful forthright and accurate when he said we needed 400 000 to 500 000 troops to provide security in iraq so it would not degrade into anarchy as it has done and as a result of that the president in the way they do this with the military effectively fired him he is the only person who the bush administration has removed from office in iraq not the people really responsible for the problem at abu ghraib not the secretary of defense not paul wolfowitz who came to us and told us the incredible falsehood that this whole operation was going to be paid for because iraq was going to pump more oil and it would not cost a penny to the american taxpayers and you know how many billions of dollars now the taxpayers have suffered none of those people who have gotten almost every single thing wrong in iraq that you can imagine if you were going to design a train of errors misjudgment inefficiency incompetence acceptance of outright fraud in the contracting procedure it would be hard to design a more inept train of abuses than this one yet this president has sat there and done nothing now i have to admit he has not said they have done a heck of a job he has not used that language but he has failed to hold anybody accountable and one of the things that i am very pleased that you have been a leader on is holding the administration accountable for this is accountable for unitedstates tax dollars you know there was a democrat harry truman during world war ii who convened the truman commission in the unitedstates senate and he insisted that during war time even during war time it is important to notallow the abuse of unitedstates taxpayer dollars and he ferreted out some of the fraud and abuse in military contracting that was going on in world war ii even when our whole nation was in jeopardy in an existentialistic sense was in jeopardy but he still said we need to be careful with these dollars we have had umpteen billions of dollars disappear into the sands of iraq with nothing to show for it no meaningful reconstruction but tens of billions of dollars gone we have seen multiple gao reports inspector general reports we have seen multiple contractors many of whom have been very closely aligned with this administration there is no secret about that what we are saying as democrats is real simple the unitedstates congress needs to do its job to ferret out these abuses find the people responsible relieve them from duty and hold these contractors responsible to the american taxpayers that is not too much to ask this congress has been a lap dog it has been a seenoevil hearnoevil group while one of the greatest abuses of the american taxpayer ever happened in the sands of iraq despite the tragic loss which of course is a thousand times worse of our men and women in iraq so the democratic real plan for security is that it is the job of congress to hold the administration accountable to the american people and the american taxpayer and we will do that job at the right moment so i am glad that you have brought this issue up"],

in america i salute him for his excellent presentation today today the house is considering the ultimate values debate the question bafore us today is do we want to cut taxes for the ultrasuperrich or instead do we first want to give hardworking americans a raise do we want to live in an aristocracy or do we want to live in a democracy do we want to perpetuate wealth or reward work the estate tax is central to our democracy it is rooted in our commitment to create a strong and vibrant middle class and to give every american the opportunity to achieve the american dream after the gilded age in which the elites of the time held power and wealth that far far far outstripped what the average american had america decided to go in a new direction one of americas great republican presidents theodore roosevelt made the argument for an estate tax saying that the really big fortune the swollen fortune by the mere fact of its size acquires qualities which differentiate it in its kind as well as its degree from what is possessed by men of relatively small means therefore president theodore roosevelt said i believe in a graduated tax on big fortunes properly safeguarded against evasion democrats believe that we must create wealth we recognize that that we must reward entrepreneurship and risk and we must encourage hard work that is why democrats supported a targeted estate tax relief for small businesses and farmers and fami lies that would ensure 99 7 percent of all americans dont pay any estate tax this is in the spirit of theodore roosevelt targeting the vast fortunes that differ not only in the quantity of wealth but in the kind i salute congressman earl pomeroy for his leadership in giving congress an alternative that is morally and fiscally responsible unfortunately once again the republican leadership just as they have blocked a vote on the minimum wage are blocking mr pomeroys option to bring his proposal to the floor which is responsible which is paid for and which is fair to all americans under mr pomeroys proposal only the top 3 percent that means 99 7 percent of americans most people in america would not pay any estate tax but it would leave that 3 percent the very very superwealthy to pay their fair share there are very few people involved but a great deal of money we will have a chance to vote on it in the motion to recommit unfortunately we will not have the time to debate it as an alternative we have these questions that have come before us when we are talking about this we are talking about giving 800 billion to a few families in america democrats stand for fiscal responsibility payasyougo budgets and no new deficit spending republicans instead have put forth the bill that will cost the american people again almost 800 billion 800 billion that we dont have that we are going to have to borrow our national debt is becoming a national security issue countries that now own our debt it is over 1 trillion already and this doesnt include this 800 billion those countries that now own our debt will not only be making our toys our clothes and our computers they will be soon making our foreign policy they have too much leverage over us with this bill today the republicans are giving tax cuts to the wealthy and asking the middle class to pay for it by writing checks to china and japan for the interest payments on the debt and ultimately the payment on principal it isridiculous it is ridiculous let me get this straight we are at war in iraq many of the same people who wanted to support the staythecourse that the president is on in iraq which has around a 400 billion price tag on it that is off budget they dont want to pay for that and that is a huge figure and now the republicans are saying not only that not only are we not paying for the war it is off budget we will just heap that debt on to future generations they are saying we are going to give twice as much as that to a few families in america it is so unfair this same week that we are taking this up as i said earlier this is the ultimate values debate how can a person of conscience say to the congress we do not support an increase in the minimum wage instead we are going to give 800 billion to the wealthiest people in america the minimum wage is 5 15 an hour it hasnt been raised in 9 years this is a shame it is a disgrace it is unfair and what does the leader on the republican side say about the minimum wage mr boehner says i have been in this business for 25 years and i have never voted for an increase in the minimum wage i am opposed to it and i think the vast majority of the republican conference is opposed to it so thank you mr boehner for making a differentiation for us you are for 800 billion for the wealthiest families in america and not an increase of over 5 15 an hour for americas working families so instead of giving 7 millionamericans a raise by increasing the minimum wage again the republicans are proposing 800 billion that is nearly 1 trillion as a gift to the wealthy this is robin hood in reverse we are stealing from the middle class to give to the wealthy pope benedict just recently put out his new encyclical god is love and in his encyclical he quoted saint augustine when he wrote this is in the popes encyclical you can find it there he talked about the role that politicians have and that a government should be just and we should be promoting justice and he goes on pope benedict does to quote saint augustine he says a state that is not governed according to justice would be just a bunch of thieves this is the pope saying this in an encyclical quoting a saint a state which is not governed according to justice would be just a bunch of thieves i ask this congress is it justice to steal from the middle class to give tax cuts to the ultrasuperrich it is not just and it is an injustice we cannot afford americans can no longer afford president bush and the republicans it is time for a

decreased services and will be asked to deal with deficits for years to come the democratic and cbc budgets recognize that this is the wrong thing to do and a great threat to our nations future

budget is dishonest by omission and dishonest in how it portrays the overall budget projections the president claims that the steep budget cuts he advocates are necessary to cut the deficit in half in 5 years this is simply not true and the budget the president proposes fails to accomplish his stated goal first the budget is dishonest by omission nowhere in the fy06 budget does the president account for significant costs including fails to account for the enormous costs of privatizing social security as proposed by the president a whopping 6 trillion over the next 20 years 754 billion

part of this year aloneand an estimated 384 billion over 10 yearsyet still omits it in the budget fails to account for growth in interest costs fails to reform the alternative minimum tax that is disproportionately burdening middle income families in my district on long island as troubling as the glaring budget omissions is the knowledge that the deficit is largely a selfinflicted wound the president inherited a record annual surplus of 236 billionwhich now 4 years later has tanked into a deficit in excess of 400 billion any attempt at honest accounting suggests that we are looking at a decade or more of similar deficits the reason we are faced with an unethical budget is because the president refuses to acknowledge the fiscal irresponsibility of his choices and will not entertain even the most moderate suggestions such as repealing only the portion of the tax cuts that benefit the top 1 percent of taxpayers unfortunately this budget builds on a disturbing trend this administration and the leadership in congress appear to be intent on valuing wealth over work thereby placing working families at a distinct disadvantage the tax policies the president advocates disproportionately advantage the wealthiest to the detriment of working americans and working families will continue to bear the brunt of the rising inflation spurred by the rising interest rates the bill gates of the world pocketed their tax cut at the insistence of the president however this president sees no problem eliminating funding for perkins loans in his budget even though the cost of tuition is rising and will continue to rise as the administrations policies force inflation as a result of the decision to eliminate perkins this year more than 670 000 student borrowers could lose out on loan forgiveness if they become teachers law enforcement officers or if they serve in the military this is just one of many examples of valuing wealth over work in my district the budget scales back and eliminates several longterm shore protection projects important to the safety and economic security of long island the president has no problem zeroing out the fire island to montauk point study just as it nears completion the president eliminates funding to dredge the patchogue river even though this creates a huge safety hazard for boaters the president does not hesitate to slash funding for the long island sound study office from 7 million to less than 500 000 even though this is vital to the livelihoods and economy of the east end of long island the president falls far short of his promise under the no child left behind bill even though this means that taxpayers will have to foot the bill at the local level to pay for education finally the president does not seem to mind taxing veterans health care at 250 per year and doubling copayments for veterans prescription drugs at a time when we should be saluting our veterans our values as a society are not reflected in this

lives every day to protect us the spratt substitute contains 1 1 billion more than the republican budget for vital law enforcement programs such as cops fire grants and byrne grants these programs provide rhode islands police and fire departments with the equipment and training to keep us safe how does this blueprint make us healthier the republican budget requires 20 billion in cuts to medicaid this reduction will jeopardize a critical health care safety net for seniors children and people with disabilities and shift more of the burden to states medicaid cuts would result in 80 million less for rhode island the loss of federal funding places an enormous burden on states like rhode island by pressuring them to cut eligibility for medicaid my state has successfully leveraged federal medicaid dollars and currently offers coverage to many vulnerable lowincome pregnant women parents of young children and other groups not included in the federal mandate without medicaid these

the bill we have before us is fatally flawed this rewrite is outdated unfair and unconstitutional i cannot support it in its current form this rewrite treats georgia as if nothing changed in the past 41 years in other words this rewrite seems based on the assumption that the voting rights act hasnt worked as a georgian who is proud of our tremendous progress and proud of our current record of equality i am here to report to my colleagues in the house that the voting rights act has worked in my state and now it is time to modernize the law to deal with the problems of today not yesteryear it is true when the voting rights act was first passed in 1965 georgia needed federal intervention to correct decades of discrimination now 41 years later georgias record on voter equality can stand

congressman john lewis an icon of the civil rights movement under oath in federal court 5 years ago congressman lewis testified there has been a transformation its a different state its a different political climate its a different political environment its altogether a different world we live in weve come a great distance its not just in georgia but in the american south i think people are preparing to lay down the burden of race if he said that under oath sworn to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth why is he telling the house something different today the reason he was under oath was because he was testifying in front of the department of justice that it was okay for the majorityminority districts in georgia to be diluted in direct violation of the voter rights act my other friend from georgia congressman scotr voted for that though it defies common sense this rewrite of the voting rights act gives no consideration to any changes that may have occurred since the first law was passed in 1965 the house is voting today to keep my state in the penalty box for 25 years based on the actions of the people who are now dead by the end of this renewal georgia will have been treated by federal law as a bad actor for 66 years to put that in perspective 66 years ago fdr was in his second term and the japanese were more than a year away from bombing pearl harbor by passing this rewrite of the voting rights act congress is declaring from on high that states with voting problems 40 years ago can simply never be forgiven that georgians must eternally wear the scarlet letter because of the actions of their grandparents and greatgrandparents we have repented and we have reformed and now as fannie lou hamer famously said i am sick and tired of being sick and tired lastly this renewal is unconstitutional in 1966 the supreme court of the united states ruled that section 5 of the voting rights act the section that singles out certain states for federal oversight was constitutional only because it was narrowly tailored to fix a specific problem and temporary you dont have to have a law school degree to know that this rewrite of the voting rights act fails both of those tests at 41 years we are already way past temporary and the application of section 5 is now arbitrary because this house cannot present evidence of extraordinary continuing statesponsored discrimination in the covered states that is different from the rest of the nation as such section 5 has served its purpose and is no longer an appropriate remedy in light of todays new

products duty free into the united states it is fundamentally unfair for american farmers and has had dramatic repercussions in my district in central washington state one of the peruvian products that have benefited most from the atpa windfall is asparagus which grows in the sandy coastal areas of perunot the mountain highlands where coca is produced since the implementation of the andean trade preferences act in 1991 imports of fresh peruvian asparagus have soared from 2 800 metric tons to well over 55 631 metric tons similarly imports of frozen asparagus from peru have increased more than twenty times this flood of dutyfree imports has been devastating for american asparagus growers in the major production areas of washington michigan and california it has also decimated much of the domestic asparagus processing capacity in fact facing a flood of inexpensive peruvian imports many asparagus processors simply closed their unitedstates operations and reopened down in peru perhaps if you are not from an asparagus production area in this country you may think this tradeoff is worth it if it results in less narcotics production the unfortunate reality is that this policy has failed according to the white house office of national drug policy coca cultivation in peru has increased to 94 000 acresthe highest level in eight years the international trade commission noted that any impact to narcotics trade from atpa is small and indirect yet the impact to the american asparagus producer is the exact opposite nevertheless here we are asking american farmers to sacrifice their livelihoods for another six to twelve months under this bill to pursue a wholly unrelated antinarcotics strategy i regret that we are once again putting the interests of a handful of large

nothing to change the underlying law this is because we are dealing with constitutional issues that cannot be altered by resolution if the judicial branch ultimately finds the pledge or the national motto to be constitutional then nothing needs to be done on the other hand if the court ultimately finds it to be unconstitutional no law that we pass will change that although i tend to agree with the dissent in the 2002 ninth circuit decision in newdow v unitedstates congress which found that the words under god in the pledge are permissible under the constitution i believe it is important to review the reasoning of the majority decision in that case which held that the words under god are impermissible on constitutional grounds the majority in the newdow case applied each of the three supreme court tests that have been used over the last 50 years in evaluating establishment clause cares that review is essential because if we support the pledge we need to make sure that we support it based on appropriate constitutional principles one test the ninth circuit cited was whether the phrase under god in the pledge constitutes an endorsement of religion the majority opinion said it was an endorsement of one view of religion monotheism and therefore was an unconstitutional endorsement another test was whether the individuals were coerced into being exposed to the religious message and the majority opinion concluded that the pledge was unconstitutional because young children are compelled to attend school and may not be placed in the dilemma of either participating in a leligious ceremony or protesting finally the court applied the lemon test naned after the 1971 supreme court case lemon v kurtzman part of that test holds that a law violates the establishment clause if there is no secular or nonreligious purpose the pledge was amended in 1954 to add the words under god to the existing pledge and so the ninth circuit concluded that the 1954 law had no secular purpose and was therefore unconstitutional while i believe that the majoritys reasoning was sound i indicated that i tend to agree with the dissent in the 2002 newdow case the operative language in the dissent which persuaded me was as follows legal world abstractions and ruminations aside when all is said and done the danger that under god in our pledge of allegiance will tend to bring about a theocracy or suppress someones belief is so minuscule as to be de minimis the danger that phrase represents to our first amendments freedoms is picayune at best judges including supreme court justices have recognized the lack of danger in that and similar expressions for decades if not for centuries i agree with the dissent and support the pledge of allegiance as is under the theory that the words under god are de minimis because the language fails other traditional establishment clause tests the principle that the words under god are de minimis is the only principle that supports the pledge as

resolution is both timely and appropriate we all agree that the unitedstates faces a difficult task in the coming days and months ahead in iraq we must maintain enough of a presence to allow the newly elected government to survive but not so much as to undermine its legitimacy thus the plan is to turn over control on an aggressive schedule as soon as iraqi forces are able to handle the jobs themselves the objective is to create a democratic government that is able to manage its own affairs and keep the civilian population safe this entails a gradual turnover of responsibility to iraqi troops and an incremental redeployment of american forces the schedule of withdrawals must be based solely on the iraqis ability to handle the job not an arbitrary timetable furthermore the message from elected leaders must be that troop withdrawals are part of a plan not due to the fact that we are tired of being there as you know there have been many successes in iraq notwithstanding the violent insurgency that seeks to thwart democratic change there has been economic progress in every sector of iraq and as we have all witnessed there has been significant political progress as well yesterday approximately eleven million of the fifteen million eligible iraqi voters participated in their national elections this represents over 70 percent voter turnouteven larger than the 10 million who participated in the referendum on the new constitution in october and the eight million who voted for their interim government last january we can view this as yet another positive sign that the disparate ethnic and religious sects have opted to engage in the political process rather than civil war in fact 82 percent of iraqis polled believe their lives will be better in a year and there is reason to share their optimism however there is also the need to have realistic expectations although they are making progress iraqi troops are not yet selfsufficient iraqi forces do control and police more than onethird of baghdad in addition iraqi forces also secure fallujah mosul and tal afar and most of the syrian border american military commanders estimate that approximately 100 000 members of the iraq military are able to work independently on operational matters with logistical support from unitedstates troops they expect this number to double in the next year thus it is quite possible that a significant number of american forces will be able to leave the country in the coming year however it is also likely that we must maintain a sizeable american presence in the region for years to come our efforts in iraq must also be viewed from a broader middle eastern perspective other countries in the area have taken steps toward openness and democracy lebanon recently"],

medicaid and barely funding the bold initiatives that the president set out in his state of the union its greatest moral fault is that it leaves our children a legacy of debt and an even heavier burden to bear as the baby boomers begin to retire that is from the gentleman from south carolina the ranking member on the house budget committee the fault in his quote there is that we are not cutting education we are not cutting medicare we are not cutting medicaid these things are absolutely off base what our budget does say to the american people these are our moral choices so congressman spratt should be commended for saying that a budget is a moral choice and i agree with that but what we do with this budget is say boldly that we will set out the fences around which government spending should be held within that is a positive thing i ask my colleagues on the left wing of this body the democrats and the liberals here to come and support this budget because what we are saying is our children should not be left with a legacy of debt we need to control wasteful government spending what this rule provides for in this budget document is a restraint of spending it

unfortunately the same northern indiana community mourns her sudden and tragic passing megan had just completed her junior year at michigan city high school where she was a member of the wolves ladies soccer team she was on her way to soccer camp with fellow teammate katherine stoll on friday when they were involved in an automobile accident katherine was seriously injured and megan tragically lost her life just hours before megan and her parents were busy planning their visit to washington d c they were coming to capitol hill today to attend the congressional art competitions dedication ceremonies photography was one of megans favorite hobbies and it was her artistic photo project highlights that was chosen from indianas second district to hang here in the capitol building when i attended the awards ceremony at indiana university south bend megan talked about her love of art and herinspiration for her winning piece at first she was going to portray a towering lighthouse on the shores of lake michigan but when she got to the beach something else caught her eye a simple picturesque lifeguard tower looking out over the water megan photographed this scene instead and she was able to capture it with striking effect she said she chose the scene because of her love of the beach and she wanted to express her feelings and emotions in a way that could be shared with others i think it is truly fitting that her artwork will now hang in the united states capitol where it can be enjoyed by thousands of visitors and passersby sadly megan and her family will not be here for the congressional art competitions ribboncutting ceremony this week but we will still celebrate the accomplishments of a gifted young woman whose life was cut short by tragedy to thousands of visitors to
