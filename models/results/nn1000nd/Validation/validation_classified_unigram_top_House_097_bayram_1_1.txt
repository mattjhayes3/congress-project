so that we the delegates to the interparliamentary union might report to the congress and to the american people the results of that rather auspicious and important conference as you know the spring meeting of the interparliamentary union was held this year in lagos nigeria from april 12 through 17 i was honored to have been appointed as one of the delegates by our speaker i want to express my appreciation to my fellow delegates the honorable claude pepper who headed the house delegation and senator robert stratford who headed the general delegation i also express my appreciation to my other compatriots representative robert mcclory and representative caldwell butler representative mcclory is a senior member of the illinois congressional delegation and has been a stalwart moving force behind unitedstates participation in the interparliamentary union i also wish to express appreciation to certain esteemed public servants like the honorable donald easum former ambassador to nigeria and the president of the africanamerican institute who was in strumental in giving me some tremenduusly excellent briefings also mrs clara ossinulu the nigerian representative of the africanamerican institute the honorable walter carrington director of the department of international affairs at howard university and former unitedstates ambassador to senegal to the honorable abudu yesufu eke ambassador to the united states from nigeria and last of all to our own ambassador thomas r pickering and his excellent staff at the unitedstates embassy in lagos nigeria one must be aware both of the significance of the interparliamentary union conference in lagos and also of the very close ties between this country and the federal republic of nigeria which used the american constitution as a blueprint for its own democratic government the honorable alhaji shehu shagarl president of the federal republic of nigeria and commanderinchief of its armed forces stated in his opening remarks to the ipu thatthe interparliamentary union has over the years succeeded in establishing for itself a good reputation as an institution for the fostering of international understanding peace and harmony through a healthy exchange of parliamentarians and parliamentary practices and procedures he further stated i am fully convinced that this exchange and crossfertilization of ideas has helped a great deal in promoting wider international understanding and cooperation not only among lawmakers but also among the dif ferent states represented in the union the interparliamentary union has fostered international peace unity and harmony through constant dialogue i would ask to include the full text of president shagaris speech at the close of my remarks i was assigned to the committee on nonselfgoverning ter ritories and ethnic questions and i am also submitting for the benefit of the house the draft resolutions which came out of that committee and which will be voted on in rome in september of this year the central issue of concern in the ipu committee on nonselfgoverning territories as well as elsewhere in discussions amongst the african and other third world delegates was south africas continued occupation of namibia it may be difficult for many americans to understand the immediacy and depth of feeling attached to this issue indeed in the past 18 months we have been encouraged by officials within our government to redefine the situation in southern africa and to view it from within the definitions of ideological and geopolitical conflicts that trou ble western europe in doing so the united states has taken a giant step backward into the 19th century this is a naive and dangerous view not one on which strong and lasting unitedstates relations with the countries of africa and the third world can be based it is a view in which even our staunchest nato allies part company it is a view attractive to people who have completed political science sequences within universities which stress only the history of 19th century political conflicts between european nations however it is a view which has nothing to do with the realities of contemporary africa and with the determination of nonwhite populations to shake off the yokes of colonialism and apartheid anyone who fails to see that this struggle against apartheid and its extension to namibia will remain the primary determinant of african sentiments toward america and europe is dangerously insensitive and out of touch in this regard it is clear that current unitedstates policy toward southern africa represents at best a highrisk strategy which shows no signs of working at worst a dangerous drift toward permanently redefining unitedstates commitments to human rights and lacial justice the implications for our own society are extremely troubling the negative impact that this apparent attempt to reverse unitedstates policy is having on our relationships with the nations of africa and the third world was starkly evident in lagos i do not wish to make a partisan speech but it is recognized that outside of africa unitedstates diplomatic interests and long range strategic objectives are extremely frayed within africa unitedstates interests are held hostage by and are completely at the mercy of the south african government at any moment some event within south africa or namibia or even some event external to the region may crystallize world sentiment against the united states i submit that this is a result of the radical policy reversal that has taken place within the past 18 months it is not a solution in which the congress can afford to acquiesce the reagan administrations southern africa policy is based on two conflicting views the first is that south africa is a bulwark against soviet expansion and as such must be supported by the united states no matter how repugnant its internal policies the second view is that the africaners are a prickly people who must be humored by the united states if they are to be encouraged to make changes essential to their own survival the truth of the matter is that south africa has no intention of making changes within south africa nor of seeing an independent government come to power in namibia so long as it can avoid it unless it is forced to by events which remain unforeseen the south african position with respect to the united states is simple as previously articulated by south african officials in meetings with our own government some time ago south africa feels that through internal repression and the forced relocation of black and nonwhite populations it can contain any developments which might occur among its black and nonwhite populations provided the united states will guarantee protection from any outside force including south african freedom fighters who are foreigntrained or fighting with foreign advisers like a hapless giant the united states has apparently acquiesced the result is ai increasingly dangerous isolation of our government in africa and among the nations of the third world in addition those major nations such as nigeria which risked their own international standing in order to counsel patience in this and other conflicts now feel increasingly that they have been toyed with by the united states in short we are at a pivotal point the positive regard with which our efforts in southern africa were viewed has been dissipated a policy which is not seen as bungling is increasingly viewed as duplicitous my question is is it worth it for the united states and is this dangerous drift in unitedstates relations something to be acquiesced in by the congress i believe most of my colleagues are unaware of how radical the unitedstates policy drift has been the documented information i cite has been developed by the house committee on foreign affairs and puts into sharp focus criticisms that were made by the ipu delegates it is time we took a hard look at the unitedstates policy shift in the 18 months that it has been in office the reagan administration has initiated a number of changes in american policy toward south africa following are some of the changes which have been undertaken in march 1981 the administration granted visas to three senior south african military intelligence officers including general vander westhizen chief of military intelligence and the former south african military attach6 who had been asked to leave the united states following the expulsion of the unitedstates military attach6 in south africa even though there was a policy of not permitting senior military army and intelligence officers to come to the united states visas were issued to these three officials supposedly by error they subsequently met with unitedstates ambassador to the u n jeanne kirkpatrick and officials at the national security council and the defense department the united states upgraded its milltary attache office at the american embassy in pretoria and allowed the south africans to do the same in washington in november 1981 and march 1982 two south african generals visited the united states as part of a namibia negotiating team in october 1981 two police officers attended international conferences in the united states the presence of these officials casts doubt on the departments earlier statement that the admission of three south african generals was in error the united states permitted the south african government to establish as many as five new honorary consulates in the united states in pittsburgh seattle phoenix cleveland and denver the city of pittsburgh has strongly protested the administration changed the foreign policy export controls in june 1981 to permit the sale of medical equipment to the south african military and to permit the sale of crime control devices to the south african government it should be noted that shortly after the completion of this sale a group of south africans were able to smuggle arms out of south african over land in an aborted attempt to overthrow the government of the sychelles the administration further amended the foreign policy export controls in february 1982 to permit the sale of items to the south african police military and security forces previously the carter administration had refused american companies permission to sell any items to the south african police military or security forces the new administration policy makes it easier for american companies to sell computers to those agencies and ministries in south africa responsible for enforcing apartheid the departments of state and commerce have agreed to gralit two american companiesbeechcraft and piperlicenses to export up to 22 air ambulances to the south afncan air force these will probably be used to ferry wounded troops from namibia to south africa the south african government wants to purchase at least six of these planes which can also be configured as troop carriers and intelligencegathering planes in 1981 the united states permitted approximately 20 south african nuclear technicians to come to this country to receive training at unitedstates government facilities the administration approved the travel of several american technicians from the department of energy to travel to south africa to investigate that countrys coal to gas conversion process previously such cooperation between unitedstates government agencies and south african government agencies had been denied in march 1982 the administration granted an export license to an american companycontrol datato sell a cyber 170 750 computer to south africas governmentcontrolled center for industrial and scientific research csir the cyber 750 is one of the most advanced computers made in the united states and can be used for advanced nuclear research to model nuclear explosions and for breaking sophisticated encripted codes csir is an agency of the south african gov ernment research operation which has broad responsibilities which overlap americas nuclear regulatory agency bureau of standards and national science foundation two unitedstates companiesedlow international and swucoacted as brokers in the sale of highly enriched uranium fuel for south africas koeburg nuclear reactors in order to circumvent unitedstates nonproliferation laws the department of state may have been aware of this transaction arguing that public statements are counterproductive the administration has backed away from the basic human rights principles of the carter administration and has ceased to make any public statements about south africas ongoing human rights violations the administration vetoed a u n resolution condemning south africas invasion of angola last fall and did not protest south africas earlier attack on the african national congress in mozambique the administration has not criticized south africas support or rebels attempting to overthrow the governrients of angola and mozambique more subtly the administrations fiscal year 1982 aid request recommended elimination of the unitedstates contribution to the u n trust fund for south africa the money from this fund was used to pay lawyers in south africa to defend black and white south africans arrested for political offenses or for violating south africas aparthied laws the administration also asked for reductions in unitedstates contributions to the u n trust fund for namibia which is used to help train and educate namibian refugees the administration refused to go along with a joint french british and german initiative to condemn the south africans for forcibly relocating thousands of blacks from the cape town area in the dead of winter to their socalled homelands 800 miles away in the transkei it refused to protest the unexplained death in detention of dr neil agaitt a white doctor who was arrested for his work advising black trade unionists the administration has not publicly condemned the impending execution of three black south africans for political offenses in addition to risking unitedstates relations with other nations and to committing the united states to a policy which is repugnant to our own institutions and to the overwhelming majority of the american people there is already ample evidence that the administrations new approach has not worked in fact it may have encouraged the south african government to take even harsher measures against both blacks and whites who oppose its apartheid policies there are indications that the administrations policies may be enco raging the repression of moderate elements within south africa and increasing the commitment of the people of south africa and of namibia to change at any price in the past 18 months the south african government has made no meaningful reforms instead its actions have been in the direction of greater repression in 1981 the south african government arrested and detained for political reasons over 300 black trade union members many of them leaders of some of south africas most moderate trade unions these arrests and detentions without trial continue dr neil aggit a white labor union official mysteriously died while in detention and at least two other black officials had to be taken to mental institutions following intensive questioning the south african government has banned two black newspapersthe post and the sunday post the gov ernment had previously banned the world and the weekend world the post was the largest circulation daily in south africa and the countrys principal black newspaper the government has refused to allow bishop desmond tutu to travel outside of south africa by revoking his passport bishop tutu is an opponent of apartheid he is the head of the anglican church in south africa and secretarygeneral of the south african council of churches bishop tutu was to be the keynote speaker at the allard lowenstein memorial lecture series at yale and to receive an honorary doctorate at columbia the government has forcibly removed thousands of blacks in cape town and relocated them hundreds of miles from their families in impoverished semiarid rural areas the government has stepped up its bannings and detentions of both white and black student leaders including the banning of alexander borraine the son of a progressive member of parliament the government has continued to establish bantustans and to revoke the citizenship of blacks relocated to these areas i urge all my col leagues to pay 4 closer attention to events in this region i urge

savings and investment by reducing the maximum federal tax rates on longterm capital gains from 49 to 28 percent as a result of this farsighted action there has been a significant increase in both the number of individual investors and in total equity values unfortunately however despite these positive developments current economic conditions demand that we enact additional tax measures to further stimulate capital format ion and to end the tax bias against savings and investment for this reason i am today introducing the comprehensive savings incentive act of 1981 a bill designed to significantly increase both our savings and productivity rate to expand the number of individual shareholders and to create millions of dollars of equity capital for our financially starving industries in brief the bill is comprised of three major provisions the first provision permanently increases the amount of money an individual may exclude from taxation on dividends and interest earned on savinus accounts from the current limit of 200 400 to 1 000 2 000 for individuals and married couples as my colleagues will recall the 200 400 provision was incorporated within the socalled windfall profits tax bill and is expected to significantly increase our gross national product the rate of private investment productivity and employment i believe that far greater benefits are to be gained by increasing the exclusion amount and by making it a permanent part of our tax code the second provision of this legislation modifies our tax code as it affects individual retirement accounts at present to qualify for an ira an individtual must be earning an income either as a salaried or selfemployed worker and must not be eligible for an organized pension or retirement plan iras are personal taxdeferred retirement plans which allow individuals to put 15 dercent of their yearly incomeup to 1 500into a special interestbearing account while i believe there is merit in reevaluating the eligibility requirements for an ira my bill simply recognizes that because of recurrent doubledigit inflation we must increase the amount of money people are ab le to setaside in an ira for this reason my bill increases the individual limit of 1 500 to 2 500 and correspondingly increases the spousal deduction from 1 750 to 3 000 the third and final provision of this legislation provides for a further rollback in the effective tax rates on capital gains from 28 to 21 percent for individuals and corporations i am convinced that a further reduction in the capital gains rate is overdue and that it can be financed in effect by higher realizations of gains and related tax receipts consisting largely of ordinary income earned by brokers executing sales commissions in fact this finding is consistent with the results of the 1978 reduction which has increased capital gains receipts to the treasury department by some 900 million additionally it is significant to note that a reduction in the capital gains tax from 28 to 21 percent received the enthusiastic support of the senate in its consideration of the revenue act of 1978 at that time the senate finance committee reported that the committee believes that lower capital gains tax will markedly increase sales of appreciated assets which will offset much of the revenue loss from the tax cut and potentially lead to an actual increase in revenues in addition the improved mobility of capital will stimulate investment thereby generating more economic activity and more tax revenue it is my firm belief that this type of antiinflationary individual tax cut compliments the presidents own tax proposal which i fully support and will help produce lasting jobs in the private sector minimize the risk of a new and worse recession result in lower interest rates increased capital investment and productivity and will strengthen the dollar abroad what i am proposing here today is an idea designed to benefit all americans for in this time of economic crisis we must do all thatwe can to increase the amount of available capital capital is the lifeblood of our economy and without it we will continue to experience high interest rates high unemployment astronomical trade imbalances and sagging levels of productivity i believe that if enacted this legislation will unlock important sources of capital and will allow american industries to expand their facilities to create thousands of jobs to more effectively compete abroad and to more efficiently produce those products we depend upon in our daily lives i urge my

or age differences between individuals however in the 1980s as the new administration begins to tackle the health care financing and delivery issues facing the unitedstates health care system concern will undoubtedly begin to focus on the relationship between federal health budget reductions and potential reduced access to medical care by the poor and elderly this may require the application of civil rights principles to the delivery of health services in the context of an ever changing political and economical environment consequently a new emphasis on civil rights as a mreans to protect health benefits may be needed to continue the public debate over equal access to medical care as a right for all americans even during a time of economic austerity the delivery of medical care in the united states through the use of expensive technology has fostered spiralling health care costs and the development of one of the largest service industries in the nation however access to medical care is limited for many americans with low incomes and who lack adequate health insurance protection during the past 15 years medical care for the poor and elderly has been subsidized primarily under the medicare and medicaid programs these programs help transfer a traditional welfare and charity arrangement of financing medical care into new attempts to mainstream medical care for the indigent populations this emphasis on making the availability of medical care more equitable has increased the purchasing power for the indigent and has helped to close the gap in health services and health status between black and white americans moreover recent attempts to expand the health care purchasing power of the poor along with removing discrimination barriers have been instrumental in assuring equity and accessibility in the delivery of medical care now this trend is being reexamined to reduce federal and state health expenditures and to develop more prudent methods of financing medical care for the poor the two major health care financing laws were created in 1965medicare and medicaid programsto help assure equal access to medical care for the elderly poor and disabled medicare established uniform hospitaland medical benefits which are administered as part of the social security program for all elderly persons regardless of income or place of residence now 16 years later despite the dramatic rise in public spending for health care the aged pay more out of pocket for health care than they did before medicare began the medicaid program was designed to aid and encourage the states to provide minimum health benefits for at least those individuals receiving federal income protection a ssistanceafce and ssi in 1975 many states began to liberalize entitlement and benefits for medicaid to individuals meeting specific categorical and income eligibility requirements the federal and state governments attempted to fulfill national expectations to make health cafe available to all even those unable to purchase private health insurance however runaway health care costs began to exceed public expenditures to meet this goal in 1978 states began to take measures to reduce expenditures under the medicaid program through lower fees to medical providers elimination of optional benefits and reducing the number of persons classified as medically needy for enrollment in the program the result of these policies was to reduced access to medical care for many of the poor as states began to restrict budget allocations for programs such as medicaid this required many indigent patients to rely on charity hospitals and other facilities that were funded by local government to obtain medical care thus many of the poor and elderly have been subjected to segregated facilities based upon inadequate purchasing power this time segregation was not on the basis of race but based upon low incomes and inadequate health insurance protection racial discrimination has been of fered as an explanation for racial differences in the utilization of nursing homes between blacks and whites many have concluded that racial dis crimination plays a major role in nursing home admission procedures this may also account for the low percentages and inadequacies of nursing home care used by blacks and other minor ities contrary to some reports these differences cannot be viewed based simply upon disparities in life expectancy between blacks and whites since recent mortality data identifies few differences between racial groups above the age 6f 70 1urthermore lower rates of nursing home usage among blacks cannot be attributable simply to more superior health status this stance is supported by recent data which suggest that therev is a higher incidence of disabilities amonir black elderly whicht may require institutionalization than among elderly whites for example the black elderly are more likely than elderly whites to reside as a part of an ex tended family living at home because they lack the resouirces tobe supported by nursing homes or other alterna tive living arrangements aside from racial discrimination economic limitations play a major rolein reduced nursing home utilization additionally nursing home beds are in short supply in many urban areas and blacks with limited and lower incomes have relatively fewer chances of obtaining admission consequently the black elderly are more likelyr thani white elderly to be institutionalized in settings other than nursing homes such as mental and chronic disease hospitals moreover reliance oni social security and medicaid for income and health insurance protection reduces their ability to receive quality nursing home and home health services a form of economic discrimination is thus created because many nursing homes are not willing to accept medicaid recipients it is well known that title vi of thel civil rights act prohibits discrimination violations on the basis of race color or national origin in any program or entity such as a hospital home health agency community health center and nursing home facility receiving federal assistance but relatively little is known about the application of this provision on eliminating access barriers to federal health benefit programs for the general population for example the de partment of health and human services office of civil rights ocr was involved in litigations during the l1970s over batterns of racial lsegregation among hospitals in new orleans la arid other urban areas similarly in 1978 ocr be came concerned about potential eases of discrimination against minorities die to reductions relocations l and closures of hospital facilities in urban communities currently we are not certain what position ocr will take under the new administrationto guarantee equal access to medical care for the poor elderly and handicapped citizens of this nation we can only hope that this office will continue its efforts to reduce barriers and practices of discrimination the primary cause of hospital closures facing many urban commnunities is the amount of care they provide to patients who cannot afford to pay for services and who lack adequate health insurance protection recent estimates in dicate that at least 200 hospitils closed during the 2month period between 1975 to 1977 this fact isl often related to the large numbers of individuals who lack medical insurance for example recent data has reported that over 23 million persons have no health insurance coverage in the united states and another 20 million have inadequate coverage many of these individuals are considered the working poor with incomes above state medicaid eligibility levels but are inadequate to purchase private health insurance or to pay directly for the medical care they need many of the poor and working poor would be eligible for medicaid if it were not for limited income eligibility requirements imposed by states these limitations on eligibility and scope of benefits contribute significantly to the gapq in coverage that exist among the medically indigent under the medicaid progran these gaps have become even wider in many states due to limited state expenditures to finance medicaid this requires many charity and public hospitals to provide expensive medical care free to individuals without health insurance in the past it was possible for private and voluntary hospitals to recoup a portion of their losses on services to uncovered patients by passing this lost on to privatepaying patients public general hospitals deficits for providing free care to a sizable number of their patients were usually subsidized by local governments now due to shrinking tax revenues for innercity areas many public general hospitals are in2 great financial distress since many local governments can no longer support them in a number of urban areas public hospitals which are the major sources of primary care and the only source of emergency and trauma services began to close moreover these closures have begun to be seen as a serious threat to reducing access to medical care for urban residents and viewed as a legittmate civil rights issue for example a recent study identified that the percentage of minority residents of the community around the hospital is directly related to the proportion of hospital closing or relocating from the area in neighborhoods 025 percent black in 1970 for example only 14 2 percent of the hospitals hadf closed or relocated between 1937 to 1977 but neighborhoods 70 to 100 percent black in 1970 fully 48 9 percent of hospitalsalmost half had disappeared other consequences of hospital closures include firstdeparture of the few remaining primary care physicians in private practice from the community surrounding the hospitals and second lost of health service employment opportunities for community residents these conditions have further reduced the effectiveness of the urban health care delivery system and to reduce assurance of equal access for many urban residents who have limited medical care purchasing power a number of cases now pending before ocr are designed to determine whether reductions in the availability of medical care due to hospital closures violate title vi since these actibns occur more readily in minority and poor communities many have viewed these closures as an act of racism cases involving homer 0 fhillips hospital in st louis mo and thenew york city health hospitals corp which have either closed or reduced health services in recent years are major litigation disputes for ocr the complaints allege that proposed reductions in medical services by hospital closures in predominantly black communities would reduce access to health care since few alternative health care resources were available contrary to earlier civil rights legal cases which involve hospitals and other health facilities practicing discrimination in the provision of medical care to minorities and handicapped individuals present cases have not gained national attention however as more hospitals and community health centers either close or reduce services due to recent federal health budget reductions we may expect future civil rights debates to be concerned with reduced access to federally funded health programs one major objective of title vi of the civil rights act in regard to the delivery of health services was to prevent minority patients who are seriously ill from being turned away from hospitals and community health centers legal disputes involving patients who were transferred from private to public hospitals or subjected to long delays for medical care are now being considered as a violation against federal civil rights statutes these problems of discrimination appear to be most frequent for blacks mexican americans asian immigrants a number of civil rights regulators have recently examined policies of proprietary hospitals that require patients to pay advance payments prior to receiving treatment and the diagnosis of illness in addition the failure of proprietary hospitals to inform patients of their free care obligations which they must assume in accepting hillburton funds can be considered an attempt to prevent poor patients from receiving equal access to medical care in private health facilities these examples of discrimination practices in the delivery of health care services may have to be rsolved within the context of civil rights protectionism civil rights in the delivery of medical care may gain prominence in the 1980s to assure equal access to medical care for the poor heightened public concerns about the relationship between federal budget cuts greater control by state governments and efforts to reduce access to medical care mpay be a concern of many black elderly yet the entrenched coalitions and ideological commitments to reduce inflation will continue to influence the debate on mainstream medical care for the poor and elderly we can only hope that concerns over whether blacks and other minorities are discriminated against by the private health system may be raised as a major public policy issue in this round of debate as in others that consider equal access to medical care the major issue will undoubtedly relate to an individuals ability to purchase medical care this argument is highly needed based upon recent attempts to reduce medicaid recipients freedom to choose health providers which may encourage the poor to receive substandard care in socalled medicaid mills ironically the governments new emphasis to convert categorical health programs into block grants to reduce medical care inflation has been opposed most vigorously by opponents that this will encourage states to reduce funding to urban health facilities that serve the minority poor conventional public opinion suggests that few solutions other than legal disputes are most likely to emerge during this period of federal budget reductions congressional leaders must understand the importance of federal health funds as a necessary ingredient to assure minorities and the poor equal access to medical care only in the event of strong and coordinated leadership committed to the ideas of civil rights and equal access to medical care can we expect that the poor and elderly will fare better during this decade"], [1.7642974853515625e-05, 0.9999823570251465, 1, "let the individual tax relief last year but me say to my distinguished colleagues they

relief package a vote for the fauntroy substitute will give them that chance under the congressional black caucus proposal your middle income constituents will fare far better in tax relief than under the kemprothreagan second and third year tax measures under our tax proposal the 96 percent of the people of this country who make 50 000 a year or less will have much more money in their pockets and in their pocketbooks gone in our proposal are last years windfall profits tax exemptions of 1 billion gone are the tax loopholes that gave excessive benefits to oil companies and to people who invested only in chinese and antiques and gold coins those features of the fauntroy substitute measured alone save us 10 billion in deficit spending a vote for the congressional black caucus is a vote to reduce taxes for 96 percent of the people of this country this is the peoples house and we ask you to give them a chance to receive what they want and what they need meaningful real tax relief the people of this country want relief from the enormous budget deficit that has resulted from last years tax giveaway to the rich and the gigantic increase in military spending of last year the people o this country now know that those large deficits mean continued high interest rates and thus continued small business and small farmer failures and continued high unemployment at record levels such as we have achieved in this past year the people of this countryand remember this is the peoples housewant a strong national defense but they do not want domination of the world they want an end to nuclear proliferation and your vote for the fauntroy substitute will give them that they know with former secretary of the defense ielvin laird thatand i quote him our true strategic military needs have little to do with military weapons except to deter their use against us he points out that we must be able to keep open the sea and air links that bind us to our allies and that we need to be able to hold ground on the borders of europe and elsewhere and to protect and sustain power at great distance none of these objectives as i continue to quote former secretary of defense melvin laird none of these objectives requires nuclear weapons your vote for the fauntroy substitute will acknowledge that fact ii12689 the caucus budget also anwers a number of concerns raised by amendments offered for consideration under the rule today for those of you who have offered amendments to raise the cola caps in the jones budget for federal employees and retirees and to all of my colleagues who intend to support those amendments i say that a vote for the caucus amendment does just what you want the fauntroy substitute does not require such amendments since it incorporates the cbo baseline levels which preserve current service costofliving adjustments for federal pay and pensions a number of members have offered amendments to increase funding for function 500 education above the level recommended by the house budget committee the fauntroy substitute also as proposed raises funding for education above the house budget committee level and indeed it includes funding to restore programs to the present fiscal year 1982 reductions as passed in grammlatta let me now briefly outline the details of the congressional black caucus substitute before concluding my remarks you first ought to understand that the cbc budget reduces the deficit substantially in fact the congressional budget office has estimated that our budget will produce a 92 8 billion deficit in fiscal year 1983 which is lower by at least 10 billion than the deficit estimated by cbo for any other substitute and half the 183 billion deficit that will exist if nothing is done to rectify the errors of last years budget moreover our budget will lead to steadily shrinking deficits of 60 billion in fiscal year 1984 and a 18 billion surplus in fiscal year 1985 bringing interest rates down and providing the basis for genuine economic recovery in our country second you ought to know that the fauntroy substitute is fair and humane we not only prevent that many additional cuts in human needs programs as proposed by the president we return funds to social programs that were lost by the enactment of the reagan fiscal year 1982 budget reductions these programs must remain federal priorities if we value human potential and care to meet human needs because of savings generated by our alternative tax and defense policies several education health housing and urban programs can be restored to fiscal year 1981 funding levels adjusted for inflation for example the fauntroy substitute adds 3 3 billion to title i 600 million to pell grants for disadvantaged college students increasing funding for health care programs it adds 600 million in social services funding including child welfare programs and 1 billion more tlan reagan for pollution control it retains eda and the legal services corporation and lowincome energy and other conservation programs the third thing that this budget does is that it stimulates and creates jobs a centerpiece of our budget proposal is the creation of a major 6 billion to 8 billion federal jobs vocational education and training package this is a response to both the nations unemployment rate generally and to the catastrophic unempioyment in the black community specifically the fauntroy substitute also includes a 4 billion urban infrastructure proposal which will create 50 000 to 80 000 jobs directly and more indirectly a 4 billion expansion in mass transit and highway construction programs which will create an equal number of jobs in this country it also includes home ownership assistance and rental housing construction programs that will stimulate employment in residential construction finally the budget insures adequate social security and other support for the nations poor both the elderly and the nonelderly this budget maintains the costofliving adjustment for elderly on fixed incomes and expands unemployment compensation benefits at a time when we have 10 3 million people out of work the program triggers in the caucus budget increase eligibility for the unemployed to 52 weeks in our view this restoration of benefits is necessary at a time when we are experiencing the levels of unemployment which have not been endured since the depression our budget also provides increased funding for other programs to assist the poor including 3 2 billion more than reagan for aid to families with dependent children 5 billion more for food stamps 3 billion more for medicaid and medicare 1 2 billion more for six health programs and 400 million more for supplemental social insurance as my colleagues in the congressional black caucus follow me they will give you more details about the caucus budget resolution i simply want to remind you again that this is the peoples house and we ought to give the people the life support programs that will cushion them through these difficult times we need to give 96 percent of the people of this country the kird of tax relief that we have pr45mised in the generalized language about tax relief for all of the people we need to give the people relief from the enormous deficits and the high interest rates that have robbed the people of this country of homes and farms small businesses and 2 5 million jobs just since july of last year a vote for the fauntroy substitute the economic recovery program of the congressional black caucus will do just that at this time i would like to add the congressional budget offices reestimate of our budget proposal and yield time to my distinguished colleague from new york the third ranking member of the ways and means committee to

united states the same trade concessions that we extend to them in our home market if equivalent trade concessions are not provided by our trading partners then this legislation directs the president within an 18month period to impose trade restrictions on that country until those trade restrictions are lifted against imports from the united states if the president determines that any unitedstates trading partner maintains quotas or employs licensing practices with respect to unitedstates agriculture imports or subsidizes exports from their country then that countrys agricultural products will not receive column one tariff treatment from the united states until the illegal trade barriers are removed this way a tariff penalty is attached to any country that fails to observe the established rules unitedstates customs law has a twocolumn tariff schedule column 1 is for the mostfavorednation mfn countries and includes most of the gatt parties and certain others column 2 is for the nonmfn

prohibit persons who have had authorized access to classified information from revealing the identity of certain covert intelligence agents i support the effort to punish those who would abuse their positions of trust to the detriment of the lives and safety of our intelligence agents overseas as well as unitedstates national security interests on the other hand the third category section 601 c of the bill however well intentioned in its effort to prevent exposure of our covert agents tramples on protected first amendment freedoms for the first time in american history the publication of information obtained lawfully from publicly available sources would be made criminal i recognize and applaud the efforts made by the intelligence committee to narrow the scope of section 601 c to keep it within constitutional bounds nevertheless it is my firm belief which is supported by many noted constitutional experts that no amount of tinkering can rehabilitate a law which crimianalizes constitutionally protected freedoms of speech press and political expression moreover the bill allows no exception where disclosures are aimed at revealing illegal activity oversight of our intelligence activities traditionally exercised by all the american people the press and the congress will instead be relegated solely to the two already overburdened intelligence committees recent events concerning the disturbing activities of the top echelons of the cia d6monstrate that greater accountability is necessary rather than less the best solution is to concentrate our efforts to improve the cover provided the cia and any other covert agents operating on our behalf overseas not to create criminal penalties which stem the flow of information only to our o~wn public and do little to protect our agents from hostile powers overseas i urge you to vote against this bill and i ask unanimous consent to revise and extend my remarks i firmly believe officers employees and sources that operate covertly on behalf of american foreign intelligence must be protected from harm and exposure i share the alarm of my colleagues arising from callous and irresponsible disclosure of names of covert agents however i believe that the goal of maintaining secrecy and minimizing risk of harm can be achieved by less onerous means the portion of h r 4 which i question is section 601 c this section is aimed primarily at private citizens and the press who gain knowledge of agent identities from either public or classified sources in both instances first amendment interests are compromised the intelligence committee attempted to alleviate the adverse impact on the first amendment by adopting language that narrows the intent requirement criminality hinges on a finding that the identification was made knowingly with an intent to impair or impede the foreign intelligence activities of the united states and in the course of an effort to identify and expose covert agents and by adding a requirement that the disclosure intend to impair or impede the foreign intelligence activities of the unitedstates by the fact of such identifileation and exposure while i applaud the committees efforts i remain convinced that no amount of tinkering can render this section constitutional as long as it seeks to criminalize publi cation of information already in the public domain these judgments all are highly subjective thereby leaving the door open for less cautious officials to level this provision at a broad class of individuals many acting within the constitution the requisite intent can be inferred whenever the publication exposes and thereby diminishes the effectiveness of an intelligence agent or activity further the intent requirement itself may have the effect of chilling legitimate critique and debate in addition it is clear that the name need not actually be revealed to constitute identifying information in some circumstances simply noting the agents title and location may be sufficient to reveal his identity thus the number of details that must be omitted and the consequent loss of credibility is also a vague expandable concept finally the concept of in the course of an effort offers no real protection as a society of professional journalists witness noted during the debate on this bill last year a journalist who is assigned to cover the intelligence community on a regular basis may indeed establish a pattern of reporting the names of agents or sources in the course of legitimate coverage of the cia furthermore even if the revelation was a single story or a single incident it is not clear that the act of investigating the story and preparing to publish it are insufficient to meet the governments concept of effort the department of justice repeatedly has emphasized that the effort need not consist of a pattern of disclosure but rather may be simply a pattern of acts with a purpose of disclosing i am not alone in this view distinguished constitutional scholars from around the country have also criticized section 601 c and its predecessors as being both unwise and unconstitutional consider this from stephen saltzberg of the university of virginia law school when it comes to punishing people who have figurcd out the identity of an agent on the basi1s of information available to the public i think there are enormous problems to overcome in fact they cannot be overcome when all is said and done i recognize that the intent element of section is it really permissible to prevent people from trying to get the government to change its ways by publicly disclosing what has been going on in order to criticize it i doubt it the line between an intention to impair the intelligence activities of the united states and an intention to seek a modification of the intelligence activities of the united states is one that is too fine for me to perceive of course the first amendment involves balancing of interests the need for the united states to protect its officers and agents is surely real and great but the first amendment is at its strongest when people are speaking out against the government criticizing what it and its agents are doing and i think the balance here will be in favor of speech section 601 c prohibits publication of identifying information even if the reporter or private individual derived the identity or identities wholly from public sources this includes disclosures based upon inferences drawn from the governments own nonclassifled documents it includes the publication of common knowledge as to who is a cia agent or source in a particular area it includes the revelation by an organizationt such as a missionary church newspaper or university based on its own internal lnve~tigation that some of its memberscontrary to the organizations policyhave acted as sources for the cia it includes republication of disclosures made by others the limit on how public this information must be before prosecution will is left to the discretion of political appointees moreover section 601 c criminalizes disclosures under a wide variety of circumstances try as the house intelligence committee did to limit the bill i still believe it will forbid both wanton and callous disclosures as well s those that serve a socially useful purpose it will create an unprecedented dilution of the notion of what constitutes freedom of speech and the press by eniminalizing the utterance of publicly available information without a showing that the national security is at stake indeed there is no requirement that any adverse impact be felt by reason of the disclosure in order to constitute a crime i am also concerned about the wide range of individuals covered by this legislation i believe this overinclusiveness adds to the constitutional problems of this bill a covert agent is defined to include not only intelligence officers or employees serving covertly outside the united states but also anyone who is a present or former agent of or a present or former informant or source of operational assistance to an intelligence agency informant is defined broadly as any individual who furnishes information to an intelligence agency in the course of a confidential relationship protecting the identity of such individual from public disclosure it is clear therefore that thousands of individuals fit this description and that the bill is primarily a source protection bill for the cia and the fbi regardless of the merits of their need for protection the breadth of the definition broadens the restraint of free speech furthermore it is not clear that protecting the identity of sources who may be in no greater peril than any other law enforcement informants weighs as heavily against the need for open discussion of american foreign affairs as does the protection of employee identities indeed the original position of the attorney general when this bills predecessor was under discussion last congress was solely to protect from harm the men and women who serve our nation as intelligence officers likewise the fbi director in seeking fbi coverage originally spoke only of employees this expanded purpose should alert us to the danger of future additions to the definition of disclosures that impair american intelligence activities congress could criminalize the disclosure of many other matters derived from public information such as the content of the covert activities themselves the methods used and so forth the fact that those activities may have been in clear violation of american law or policy would be no defense how will the line bedrawn when so much information relevant to public debate arguably could impair or impede intelligence activities or foreign relations or national defense for these reasons i believe this coverage is vastly overbroad and fundamentally at odds with a free society it is also unnecessary section 601 c simply misses the markit aims thearsenal of the criminal law at the entire populace but all the available evidence indicates that the true culprit is the combination of sloppy secrecy procedures and unauthorized disclosure of classified information in other words section 601 c of the intelligence committee bill attacks a phantom problemprivate citizens culling through public documents and sources it thereby diverts attention from the real heart of the problem which as the cia itself admitted is the disclosure of sensitive information based on privileged access by faithless government employees 0 this problem can be dealt with by punishing those employees and former employees who breach their trust by revealing identities or by providing assistance to others in identifying covert agents moreover if indeed it is possible to glean identities from public information or doeuments then it is the responsibility of the cia and the president to remove those indicators from the public domain and to improve the procedures for insuring effective cover criminalizing disclosures stemming from sloppy secrecy procedures on the other hand will only tend to lull the agency into inaction surely if private citizens have been able to infer identities from public sources so too has the kgb as the house permanent select committee on intelligence act 1coinplelled to note that provisions for the concealment of intelligence operative are not fully adequate the burden must be on the executive branch generally and the intelligence community in particular to remedy this situation accordingly the committee adopted a provision requiring the president to promulgate procedures that will help to rectify this situation i believe this course of action will be more productive and certainly less destructive of free speech inever before has a criminal sanction been attached to this kind of speech the cia insists that it is necessary but it is the responsibility of congress as well as the courts to determine whether such a measure is constitutional or whether a less onerous alternative will deal adequately with the problem in concluision i believe this bill is dangerous not only for what it forbids directly but also for the precedent it creates today we ban the disclosure of identities tomorrow there will be talk of banning disclosure of covert actions themselves why not the logic is the samethe preservation of effective foreign intelligence efforts if the american people are denied information they are denied the power that the constitution says resides with them preventing that is what the first amendment is all about ultimately it is the respect and protection we afford free speech that distinguishes this country from the nations within which the cia secretly september 93 1981 septcmber 23 1981 coi operates if a free society is sacrificed for a better intelligence system we have compromised our very goal"],

and technology supported the action in the committee but asked that his name be taken off this balanced r d bill which addresses concerns that are expressed by both sides of the aisle the reagan administration for instance made very drastic cuts in the solar and in the conservation programs but this substitute adds much of that money back for example nearly 90 million is added to solar seventy million dollars is added to conservation the substitute also includes funding for the clinch river breeder reactor the administration requested 254 million but it has been reduced to 230 million which is adequate for continued development this package also includes funding for the geothermal demonstration at heber calif it includes funding for magnetohydrodynamics mhd which was zeroed by the administration this is a very brief summary of the winn substitute in the interest of time i would like to provide for the record a more detailed discussion in general i think this is a good substitute which not only complies with the reagan budget and the reagan economic package but it maintains the technical integrity of the most promising energy technologies i rise in support of the grammlatta substitute to this reconciliation bill i have supported and will continue to strongly support the presidents economic recovery program which includes this grammlatta substitute i am happy to be a coauthor of this substitute specifically the winn substitute for title xii in the reconciliation bill the winn substitute changes the doe authorization contained in title xii to bring the program more in line with the presidents request the winn substitute is actually below the budget requested by the reagan administration for the department of energy like the reagan request the winn substitute redirects the department of energy research and development programs into more longterm research and development activities these longterm activities will be specifically those that will not be undertaken by private industry and therefore are more appropriate as part of the government role in addition this winn substitute containts funding and continuation of the liquid metal fast breeder reactor demonstration plant the clinch river breeder reactor crbr i am deeply disturbed by the creative accounting which was done by our committee in this reconciliation process the baseline which was chosen resulted in the committee on science and technology appearing to have come 1 8 billion under their as signed levels when in fact the committee was almost 100 million over the budget levels recommended by the reagan administration for all of the agencies which the science committee authorizes these false savings make a mockery of our hard work in trying to bring this federal budget back into line second i oppose title xii in the budget reconciliation package because of the fact that the strategic petroleum reserve is authorized at 3 8 billion this level of authorization is directly contrary to the assumptions made when the first concurrent budget resolution was passed at that time the decision was made to finance the strategic petroleum reserve offbudget both mr dingell and mr broyhill have proposed alternative ways of funding the strategic petroleum reserve offbudget and that issue should be resolved during the discussion on title vi even without the strategic petroleum reserve we feel that the winn substitute is preferable to the doe authorizations contained in title xii the winn substitute shifts funding into the solar and conservation r d programs at doe also a second geothermal demonstration plant for that promising resource is provided therefore providing a more balanced energy research and development budget than originally recommended by the administration the major difference between the two versions is that the jones substitute will provide for the termination of the clinch river breeder reactor project the decision to terminate the clinch river breeder reactor was make in committee by an effective twovote margin by contrast in the past the house has always opposed amendments to terminate crbr by margins of over 80 votes each time the crbr is essential to maintaining our countrys nuclear generating option in the next century without it we are left to rely on other more speculative generating options to supply the energy needs of consumers and industry in the next century we would also be departing from the energy path that the rest of the industrialized world is following for their future i want to reiterate that the administration strongly supports the continuation of the clinch river breeder rector project during our committees consideration of this budget the director of omb mr david stockman sent a letter to me in which he strongly endorsed the continuation of the crbr in that letter he said the commitment to such a goal is reinforced by this administration the reagan administration favors the economical and safe development of nuclear energy and in particular this administration supports construction and operation of the clinch river breeder reactor this administration intends to reinvigorate the effort on this project by joining the long struggle by the congress to complete this project in addition mr stockman has very recently june 23 reinforced his support for the clinch

on the floor by mr bnooks and mr horton this is an amendment that went through the ordinary process of congressional committee part of this bill was referred sequentially to the committee on government operations why because we have jurisdiction over procurement when it was referred sequentially it was referred to a subcommittee headed by the chairman congressman brooks and i serve on that subcommittee as the ranking minority member after we had hearingsthe general accounting office was heard 0mb deputy director ed harper was heard we heard representatives from the department of defense and after the hearings we had a markup we reported it it was reported from the subcommittee to the full committee the full committee met and we are a committee of this congress a respected committee of this congress we met and then as a result of our meeting full committee meeting attended by a quorum over a quorum we voted and reported out these amendments afi this is one of those amendments now this is an important amendment i am not just talking to the members about knocking out a provision of this bill that has been reported out of the armed services committee because i am antidefense i am not i have indicated that i support basically the provisions of this bill reported by the armed services committee but they got a little bit off base in some of these areas that relate to procurement my appeal now to the members of the armed services committee and to the members of the house is to take a hard look at this what we are doing if we permit the bill reported by the armed services committee to go through without this amendment what does this amendment do the amendment offered by the full government operations committee which mr brooks and i are supporting because he is the chairman and i am the ranking minority member of that committee is to strike section 901 section 901 would permit the department of defense to procure research by grants where contracts would be required under current law now what is wrong with that in 1978 the government operations committee reported and the congress enacted the federal grant and cooperative agreement act which established a governmentwide policy for the definition and use of contracts grants and cooperative agreements by all federal agencies under that act grants and cooperative agreements are to be used for assisting the private sector whereas procurement contracts are to be used where we acquire goods and services for the governments own use one of the purposes of the act is to minimize the potential for abuse in the use of grants the congress had found that grants were being used in lieu of contracts to avoid the laws and regulations governing the procurement with regard to the department of defense section 901 would undo all of the good that congress did in 1978 when it enacted the federal grant and cooperative agreement act it would permit the department of defense to evade procurement laws and regulations as they relate to contracts because now they can do that if this amendment is not adopted they could permit the defense department to procure research grants rather than by contract this would be clearly unwise it would violate that law that we passed in 1978 and which is on the books so i would urge the members to support that amendment but i am not here just urging on behalf of the committee on government operations we also had the testimony of mr harper the deputy director of 0mb and this apparently is the administration position this is what he said relative to title ix general provisions we do not concur with section 901 which would amend section 10 unitedstatesc 23581 to permit the defense department to use grants in lieu of contracts for research pro curements under public law 95224 grants and cooperative agreements are to be used for assisting the private se~ctor whereas p~rocurement contracts are to be used when we acquire goods and

problem that does not really need the attention they gave it the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee my good friend the gentleman from new york made the quote just a couple of minutes ago that new recruits are earning almost as much as oldtimers that statement is true compared to what the situation was before the allvolunteer force but it is not really true when we compare it with the civilian sector before the allvolunteer force there used to be a huge disparity in pay between the e9 and e1 perhaps as much as 9 to 1 there was a very steep pay grade differential but since the allvolunteer force we have had to offer the e1s more money to come into the service we have had to give them more pay so that we could attract them now the ratio is back to 3 to 1 which is about the way it is in the civilian sector for similar levels of responsibility after 2 years of service then the ratio resumes its rather sharp curve to what it used to be which is what the gentleman was referring to the gentleman also mentions that general meyer supports the senate version it is true that he does but he is almost all alone in his support of it as far as our defense experts are concerned let me read a list of those wvho support the house version the 14 3 percent acrosstheboard increase we have the secretary of defense mr weinberger and i assume the whole administration wve have the secretaries of each of the military services the chief of naval operations admiral hayward the personnel chief of the air force general osway and we have most of the military associations the fleet reserve the national association of uniformed services the air force sergeants the veterans of foreign wars the united states army warrant officers association all of them like the 14 3percent accesstheboard increase even though general meyer likes the senate version the trouble with the appropriations committee bill or the senate version is that there is a targeting provision and this is the keystone of their program this is the thrust of their bill but it tends to create chaos and confusion and inequities the sad part of it is that it is not even needed to address the problem of retention they are solving a problem thiat does not exist because our bill solves this problem but in spending so much money and targeting so much to solve the retention problem they create a very serious problem with recruitment that is the other side of the scales retention is on one side recruitment is on the other we do not need any additional targeting under the house bill we permit up to 25 percent of the 14 3percent acrosstheboard pay raise to be targeted if it is needed i seriously hope that the administration does not target 1 of it because it is not necessary but the flexibility is there in the event we do wani to do that then too we already target about 2 billion almost as much as this whole bill represents for many different areas of shortages we target for sub pay we target for sea pay and we target for flight pay hazardous duty pay and proficiency pay we pay extra money for health professionals nuclear qualified officers and enlisted men and we also pay enlistment and reenlistment bonuses we can expand this procedure if necessary if we have shortages in certain areas we can target further this is the preferred method to target to skills not target to grades as the senate version does let us take a look at retention both bills solve the retention easily with 50 000 or 80 000 people left over in a very short period of time it is true that the senate version does it a little faster maybe by 3 months 4 months or 5 months as one speaker suggested he was going to support the senate bill because it would provide us with 4 000 more senior enlisteds the first year that is true it does provide 4 000 more but it is 4 000 out of 790 000 it is less than 1 percent it is sixtenths of 1 percent to get a mere 4 000 additional out of almost 800 000 they would seriously hurt the recruitment effort when they allocate huge sums to the senior enlisted portion of the bill they have to take it from some place they have to rob peter to pay paul and who do they take it from they~ take it from the little guy the new guy the junior enlisted man in fact they are going to take 50 percent of what they would get under the 14 3percentpay increase that is 50

capital has developed national leadership by forming a board of directors of disabled and nondisabled representatives of the coroporate community and of public interest groups the board is chaired by david t kearns president of xerox corp the federal interagency committee the second organization involved in coordinating the international year of disabled persons was established by the direction of the white house domestic policy staff to coordinate unitedstates policies to maximize cooperation and minimize overlap in federal programs it seeks to promote awareness of the needs of disabled in identifying and developing all federal programs the council and the interagency committee hope to build on the progress that has already been made toward establishing americas leadership as a defender of human and civil rights and as a nation advanced in biomedical research accident and disease prevention and technologicial application during the 1970s disabled americans began to see physical barriers come down ramps and curb cuts are more common now transportation systems adapted for persons with disabilities are providing increased mobility and independence education and employment opportunities are expanding for both the physically and mentally handicapped medical and technological breakthroughs and improving the human condition the 1970s was a beginning that is by no means complete much more needs to be done we must each do our part to help bring the remaining barriers down i have hired two disabled persons in my washington officeone who is confined to a wheelchair from a sporting accident and one who lost a limb in the vietnam war for anyone who knows the crowded conditions that capitol hill staff serve under they know that there is not much room for those of us who can walk normally to maneuver and certainly much less for a person in a wheelchair there were some skeptics among my staff members who were not sure that it would be possible to accommodate disabled persons under those circumstances there were others however including me who felt that it was all simply a matter of attitudeif you want it done you do it the first barrier that we had to overcome was to find handicapped housinghousing that is accessible to a wheelchair i must say that i have been disappointed to find such a lack of handicapped housing in the nations capital in fact the young man who is confined to a wheelchair has been forced to begin work later than he wanted because it took him so long to find handicapped housing the second barrier we had to overcome was finding appropriate office furniture that would accommodate a wheelchair property supply said that they had no desks for a handicapped person we have also worked that out i must admit however that it has been the drive and perseverence of the young staffer who is disabled more than anything else that has enabled him to come work for me it is a shame that society as a whole has not done more to make way for disabled persons but at least progress is being made the second young man i have hired to coordinate my activities as chairman of the greater lansing council for the iydp is a vietnam veteran who lost his leg in the vietnam war i serve on the house veterans committee and i have worked closely with the disabled american veterans of america and the paralyzed veterans of america the veterarrs affairs committee daily addresses the needs of thousands of disabled veterans as a member of the subcommittee on hospitals and health care of the house veterans affairs committee i have asked for oversight hearings on prosthetic and spinal cord research congressman ron mottl chairman of the subcommittee has enthusiastical ly agreed to hold those hearings which will take piace sometime in november of this year on april 24 and 25 the planners of the iydp in the state of michigan are holding a conference i will be attending that meeting and chairing a meet ing of all handicapped groups in the greater lansing area to map out plans for our local promotion of the iydp i believe that each of us can do something to promote access for disabled persons to mainstream them into society but perhaps the most important contribution we can each make is to look at our own attitude toward disabled persons in our community at home or at work for ultimately the best any one of us can do and the most a disabled persons asks from us is to be treated as an equal fittingly the iydp logo represents two people in a position of equality joining hands in solidarity and support of each other this is what we hope to accomplish during this year of special recognition for disabled persons and we believe that the resolution before us today will help to foster that goal i urge passage of the resolution"],

is so much we can learn from past history we ought to live in the present yet we see so many people that live in memories you see some people that borrow too much money and overspend but what makes for success is to build for the future when i was in business we used to keep our expenses to the minimum we used to save all we could and as we built up reserves we plowed this back to buy land buildings machinery inventory for a better future for the business i think about my code as i lived my eight terms in congress the more i see of the american public the more i believe that they are mainly interested in the present too many people do not seem to learn from the past and many people today certainly do not want to wait for the future they want to know what is in it for them right now if we are going to build a great country if we are going to build a greater america we would do well to learn from past experiences in the first 5 years of this republic the country spent more money the continental dollar in the first 5 years of this republic dropped from a dollar to 1 penny we had an expression it is not worth a continental dollar today in congress we hear that america should borrow more money print more money and that will take care of the present as to the future experience proves the best way that you can build for the future is by saving we hear people constantly who say congress should spend and spend because as we spend we will make the country rich they do not realize that you can no more spend yourself rich than you can drink youself sober there is one answer for america and that is for congress to pass the balanced budget constitutional amendment when congress starts balancing our budget the american people will have some of their salary left to save this will provide a lower prime interest rate under 7 percent a balanced budget will provide the momentum on which this country can grow there is too much emphasis on what each person can get out of things today people want to know how short the work week would be they want to know how many days vacation there are how much cost of living can they get this is living in the present but we do not hear much about building for the future when you are working in a business do employees talk about quality control do they talk about putting out a good product so you will have repeat customers come back in 3 years do they talk about saving money so that the company can buy new machinery do they talk about reducing costs and making more profits for retained cash so the company will not need to borrow money at high interest rates america needs a return to religion we need to live by the golden rule read the good book every day and we will have more love and happiness it is a good code to live by learn from the past live in the present build for the future e"], [0.012731730937957764, 0.5127317309379578, 1, "as a cosponsor of this resolution i rise in strong support of house joint resolution 84 to designate the week of october 511 1981 as national diabetes week diabetes is a disease which afflicts nearly 10 million americans and ranks third behind cancer and cardiovascular disease as the leading killer disease in this nation of these 10 million americans nearly 1 5 million are juvenile diabetics or insulindependent of even greater concern is the fact that diabetes often leads to heart attack stroke kidney damage gangrene and nerve damage it has fearfully become the new leading cause of blindness with diabetics showing a rate of blindness 25 times higher than nondiabetics by proclaiming national diabetes week we can hope to encourage further efforts to find a cure for this malady which has nearly 300 000 lives annually our efforts to stimulate an end to this dreaded disease become all the more critical when one considers the economic impact of diabetes this disease drains the american economy of 7 billion annually through wages lost and costs for health care and disability payments i was proud to have cosponsored this legislation last year when one considers the achievements that have been made in the past 12 months researchers have developed new methods of providing insulin to diabetics and have even produced human insulin using recombinant dna techniques which may ultimately provide an unlimited supply of insulin which will be cheaper and possibly even more compatible recent research has also located possible genetic markers for diabetes which may make it possible to identify some highrisk candidates before they develop the disease in light of this dramatic and heartening activity in order to work toward a total elimination of this destructive and debilitating disease i urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this worthy resolution so that we may continue to work to help the millions of americans who suffer from diabetes and to eliminate its effects completely for the next generation e"]]}
