important subject as we enter into the debate on a social issue that will impact the lives of every american every man woman and child in this country what could be more important than taking time to discuss the pros and cons i was delighted as i am sure my colleagues were today to see that the bipartisan negotiations that have been going on for weeks now many many hours in length were rewarded were fruitful in coming out and announcing today a bipartisan health care proposal so we really have a debate now we have a clintongephardt we have a clintonmitchell bill and we have a health care reform bill with bipartisan support that deals with the health care crisis in this country from the standpoint of private sector reforms to expand coverage to more americans than ever before and to begin to control the spiraling costs in health care i think there are a number of things out there in the public sector right now to assist us as we look at this health care debate one of the books recently published written by dr jane orient she is an internist in tucson arizona and she heads the association of american physicians and surgeons with over 4 000 members nationwide the title of her book is a very timely book indeed your doctor is not in i think she provides us some important insights let me share a few of them she says first of all the proposed remedies for the health care crisis are snake oil and you shouldnt swallow them further the private doctor is an endangered species in the end we will have a herd a nice placid socialized tamed cudchewing herd readers should care about the plight of doctors for one and only one reasons some day they might need one you may think you know what the hippocratic oath says but you probably dont and you should learn about it before they do away with it entirely the hippocratic oath is built on physician autonomy it reads i will prescribe regimen for the good of my patients according to my ability and my judgment eurther do you want your doctor to place society or the department of health and human services ahead of his being independent she says further managed care is about preventing medical care in order to make money for thirdparty payers or to save money for the government behind the slick advertising managed care is little more than prepayment for rationed health care rationed care is one of the most disastrous things that can ever happen to the health care practice in this country then i conclude with her insight there is no utopia i will only maintain that a free market in medicine is the best of the avallfble alternatives and the one that does the least harm that is what doctors do the least harm that is what the hippocratic oath says the way we do the least harm although it is not perfect is to maintain a free market in the health care system another recent book a novel published entitled fatal cure by robin cook a bestselling novelist he as a physician as a doctor imagines what will happen to the health care service industry in this country should we resort should we go in these coming weeks to governmentrun health care system i only share with the listeners this evening and with my colleagues a couple of paragraphs of the dialog that he imagines might take place some day he says everyone knows that doctor patient relationships are the cornerstone of medical care one of the characters says maybe thats passe the current reality is determined by a new army of medical bureaucrats being created by government intervention all of a sudden economics and politics have reached the ascendancy in the medical arena i am afraid the major concern is the bottom line on the balance sheet not patient care the problem is washington every time the government gets seriously involved in medical care they seem to screw things up they try to please everybody and end up pleasing no one dr cook is absolutely right that would be the result of governmentrun health care in the washington post not exactly an advocate of freeenterprise health care certainly one that has espoused the governmentrun health care in its editorial policies dana priest in a frontpage story entitled health bill may have no substitute for bureaucracy he writes just recently president clinton and members of congress last week hailed the senate democratic leaderships health bill as a vast improvement over the bureaucracyladen 1 462page plan produced by the white house but the 1 410page bill proposed by senate majority leader george j mrrchell dmaine also would create dozens of new federal and state agencies they would have untested authority to centralize reorganize monitor and enforce the way medical care is bought sold and to a lesser extent practiced in this country and indeed the post is right they would have untested authority to centralize reorganize monitor and enforce i understand that the clintonmitchell bill in the senate has over 20 new federal bureaucracies that will be created now before i yield back to the gentleman i want to share a letteri am from the state of arkansas i have served 8 years in the arkansas legislature with nowpresident clinton our president was then my governor our chief executive in the state of arkansas many times during those 12 years that he was our governor the issue of abortion and more specifically the issue of public funding of abortion arose in various debates in arkansas as it has been throughout our country a major issue and it continues to be a major bone of contention and a major issue in the health care debate in every major governmentrun health care plan that has been presented to this congress the provision for reproductive services or abortion services if you will has been included that means that every american under a governmentrun health care system would be subsidizing the practice of abortion regardless of what their moral conscience or religious convictions would be september 26 1986 governor clinton then governor wrote in a letter to the arkansas righttolife people a letter in which he said in part because many of the questions do concern the issue of abortion i would like for your members to be informed of my position on the states responsibility in that area i am opposed to abortion and to government funding of abortions we should not spend state funds on abortions because so many people believe abortion is wrong that was governor clinton who is now president of the united states saying he not only opposed abortion but he opposed public funding of abortion and believed it was wrong to require people who believe it is wrong to pay for abortions and yet today he has included that insisted on including that in every governmentrun health care program that he has advocated and supported then i would concludeand i am indebted to our colleague from the other side of the aisle the gentleman from minnesota tim penny democrat for his dear colleague letter in which he points out something that i think is vital in this debate in the coming weeks he points out that major votes of the 20th century on large social policy changes have always been accorded overwhelming bipartisan support he enumerates some of those the social security act of 1935 96 percent of the democrats supported that 81 percent of the republicans supported that and it passed by a vote of 372 to 33 the development of the interstate highway system federalaid highway act of 1956 major policy change in our country 93 percent of the democrats supported it 98 percent of the republicans supported it passed by a vote of 388 to now the civil rights act of 1964 what more significant social change has this congress enacted than the civil rights act of 1964 sixtyone percent of the democrats supported the civil rights bill 80 percent of the republicans supported the civil rights act and it passed by a vote of 290 to i could go on the clean air act the medicare act the water pollution act all of these passed by overwhelming bipartisan majorities here we are told that we must in the coming weeks have a health care reform bill that is going to affect the lives of every american the biggest social change in 50years and we are going to do it with the barest of majorities it is going to be forced through in spite of overwhelming opposition not only by the republican party but the polls indicate by the american people when the buscapade came to town i saw the big banners on the side saying pass it now and i said to myself pass what now at that point we did not even have a bill no one had read a bill yet they say we have got to hurry it through we have got to do it now yet the polls say 65 percent of the american people say they want to wait they want to read it want to study it want to react to it and that is the way major social change ought to take place it ought to take place with the american people aware of it the american people supportive of it and with a large bipartisan majority supporting it in congress we do not have that and that is~why we ought to wait on health care reform i thank the gentleman"], [1.8417620594846085e-05, 1.8417620594846085e-05, 0, "i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time let me begin this process by first congratulating the gentleman from ohio and the members of the republican budget committee in the 8 years that i have been in congress and watched this budget process this is the most professional most dedicated and most real effort that i have seen by any budgeteering group they have got the right conceptual framework that we ought to grow down the size of the government and allow more freedom to grow up the freeenterprise sector of the american economy that only by growth in the private sector can we generate the revenues to support this enormous government spending program and only then can we decrease the deficit if we combine with that growth in revenues from a growing private sector a containment of growth in the public sector it takes courage it takes commitment it takes details a few weeks ago we were challenged on our side of the aisle to put up or shut up and the fact of the matter is the republicans on the committee on the budget put up details pain sacrifice not sacrifice by those of us who senator gramm says are pulling the wagon and paying higher taxes by heaping on more taxes but sacrifice by those who are in the wagon by reductions in government largesse and containment of the size of government what do we have from the democrats the democrat package can be broken down into three components the pain the payoff and the promise the pain is the massive tax increases which are immediate and certain on all of the american people and if in fact you happen to be earning 30 000 a year and suffering a tax increase by this clinton plan they will perform the magic of redefinition and give you by a redefinition of your income the status of being a wealthy american by imputing to you through the government alleged earnings of your children the rental value of your home the inside value buildup of your retirement programs the cheating on your taxes that this government under clinton is assuming that we all do by either unreported or underreported income they will make you wealthy this presidency is going to make us all wealthy by simply redefining income now in addition to that pain we have the payoff to all of the government agencies the supporters the communities in addition to all of that payoff in thisgovernment stimulate pork package we have then the promise the promise we have all heard before to the american citizens is once again the democrats have said take the pain of the higher taxes allow us to fulfill the payoff to our constituency groups allow us to provide the pork early and we promise you the cuts later ladies and gentlemen the cuts will not arrive the cuts will not get off the launching pad the cuts are the fiction of democratic budgetary policy the pain is real the suffering is optional vote for kasich vote against the democrats fiction the plan offered by president clinton and the democrat majority and the one developed by the budget committee republicans offer the american people a stark contrast in our respective parties approach to tax and budget policy the democrats want to tax the people and grow the government while republicaos want to grow the private sector and constrain the government the democrat package contains the largest tax increase in american history and tens of billions in new spending by contrast the republican alternative cuts spending and the deficit 430 billion without increasing taxes without slashing defense and without cutting social security the democrat package can be broken down into three components the pain the payoff and the promise the pain is massive tax increases which are immediate and certain the payoff is the stimulate government package which even the washington post notes is an effort to reward democrat constituencies with taxpayer money and the promiseone weve heard so many times befores that a few years from now well cut government spending in reality the democrat plan will grow the government and shrink the economy it will mean fewer jobs for ordinary americans particulariy when coupled with the new wave of regulations we are certain to see on behalf of big labor and other special interests the reason job growth has been stagnant is that the tax and regulatory burden on small business has increased 34 percent in the last few years and i remind my democrat friends that during the reagan boomthe longest peacetime expansion of the economy in history it was small business that created 75 percent of the new jobs in america what does the republican plan do it achieves more deficit reduction than the clinton plan by reducing federal spending less than 3 percent thats right 3 percent its appalling that my friends in the democrat majority and the new democrats in the white house would stick the american taxpayer with the largest tax increase in american history while refusing to reduce government by even 3 percent in fact the democrat plan adds tens of billions in new spending while the democrat plan asks all americans to pay higher taxes for more government the republican plan asks the beneficiaries of government largesse to contribute to deficit reduction the republican plan cuts federal overhead reduces congress bloated budget asks wealthy medicare recipients to pay a larger portion of their health care costs requires federal workers to work until age 62 like everyone else instead of retiring at 55 it reforms foreign aid puts medicaid patients in a managed care program and saves taxpayer dollars by empowering lowincome americans to use housing vouchers instead of building expensive crimeridden public housing and best of all the republican plan eliminates unnecessary programs and government agencies like the interstate commerce commission which was created in 1887 to regulate the railroads i would like to compliment my colleague mr kasich and the other republicans on the budget committee for putting together an honest fair and wellbalanced plan that reduces the deficit without raising taxes this plan attacks the root of our deficit problem runaway federal spending balancing the budget and encouraging a prosperous and growing economy requires a twopoint plan we must first limit government spending as this plan daes and we must pass a progrowth package which reduces the cost of capital and labor and encourages our people to save and invest i would say in closing that the clinton taxandspend plan will fail as i told another president 3 years ago durtng the 1990 budget summit higher tas and ~her spending will stifle growth in the private eoonomy kim jobs and not reduce the deficit the cinton plan is the 1990 budget deal pan ii in super 3d with twice the tax increase i urge my coieagues to reject the big government democrat agenda and support the kasich alternative which cuts 430 biliton from the deficit and gets america back on the path to prosperity by asking govemmem to

said at the beginning of this debate men and women who are reasonable can differ in their view of what has been done and what has not however we had a bad bill to begin with we have a slightly improved bill that got a little bit of a trim around the edges but not a haircut and we still have a bad bill it was 33 billion when it went into this conference report and it is 30 billion now that it is out of here wehave no business spending this kind of money particularly when we just trimmed a little bit off of the social welfare spending programs and brought them down from 9 billion to 7 billion in that arena this is still loaded with great society social welfare programs i know that the men and women who negotiated on my side of the aisle were doing it in good faith but that is still the truth of the matter we have not really strengthened prison bills the net amount of money in here for prison construction to help the states solve the problem of the revolving door and get truth in sentencing is actually less than it was in the previous report back out here for us if we want to talk about community policing it is a sham in this bill it always has been a sham it has not changed one penny because we are not going to get 100 000 cops we are only going to get somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 000 and the states are going to have to pay fourfifths of the money that will be paid for any new cop on the street the only way we can get a decent bill out of here one that is tougher and does not waste the taxpayers money is to vote for the motion to recommit that i am about to offer that is the brewsterhunter proposal that puts all of the money into prisons and into real cops on the street and not this phony thing that is in this bill and does what is necessary to put swiftness and certainty of punishment back into our system again to help the states to send a deterrent message to make sure that once again we as a nation can be proud that we have done something that the people really want instead of doing the kind of social welfare spending junk that is in the main bill i say that with all due respect to the work that went in it is improved but it is so marginal that we can hardly see it we have a bad bill and we need to vote that bill down however in preference to that i urge a vote on the motion to recommit that is the brewsterhunter proposal that

deliberate grassroots gag rule designed to kill precisely the pressure from back home that has been so effective in this congress let us be honest liberals hate grassroots voter pressure it was voter pressure in support of home schooling that forced the liberals to pull out a provision that would have killed home schooling it is the grassroots pressure of the righttolife movement that has sustained a fight that liberals would have crushed years ago it is the grassroots pressure of people who believe in the second amendment which has stopped the efforts by liberals to strip americans of the right to bear arms it has been the opposition to the clinton tax increase by the grassroots which reduced it to a onevote margin when the entire power structure of washington was going to raise taxes on the american people again and again whether it is school prayer opposition to prohomosexual education in first grade or a range of issues which are not politically correct here in washington

to me i want to once again use the chart to demonstrate how much we have gone in the last several congresses toward adopting mussolini rules in the house of representatives mussolini rules are those that follow the handbook of benito mussolini who wanted to make the trains run on time but resorted to fascism to do that mussolini rules in the house are those that want to make the house run on time but destroy democracy in order to do it let us see here during the 95th congress just a few short years ago about 85 percent of all the rules were open rules in other words allowed free and open debate allowed middleclass america to have their views heard on the house floor guess what as middleclass america has become more and more disgusted with the congress and has found what congress is doing undermining everything they believe in open rules have declined to tho point that in this congress they have plunged to nothing today we have another mussolini rule on the floor that gives us no chance for open debate whatsoever what has happened about closed rules as middle america has found that congress is not doing what they wish congress has more and more resorted to closed rules until we get to this congress when every rule brought to the floor is a closed rule what does that tell us it tells us that the american people are being shut out of this body it tels us that the democrats majority can no longer allow the american people to have their say i suggested that this was going to become a part of a pattern here in a colloquy a few minutes ago and i was told that no such thing was said in the rules committee about this becoming a pattern now i am not allowed to quote from the transcript of the rules committee but i can paraphrase it and everything that i said was absolutely true in that colloquy between the gentlewoman from new york and the gentleman from south carolina in which they talked about the fact that the only amendments that should be allowed on the floor under anything other than emergency conditions should be those that come up in the committee well what does that mean it means that we are not going to have a chance for members of congress representing 565 000 of their constituents to have their opportunity to offer amendments on the floor that means that middle class america is being shut out of the house floor and it is being done purposely and the rules committee has every intention of continuing the pattern the gentlewoman from new york referred to the fact that there was a long debate over the department of education some years ago and it went on for some days and what they do not tell you about that debatewhat they do not tell you about that debate that she refers tois the fact that they checked with their former republican colleague mr horton about this and mr horton was a proponent of the department of education he did not like that long debate and i will tell members why because when they went into that debate they had a 100vote margin and they were going to win the thing by 100 votes after the debate and after that bill was defined for the american people they only won by four votes because the debate did change minds the fact is that that is what often takes place when you allow free debate on the house floor when middleclass america has their opportunity to be heard on the house floor every once in a while minds are changed every once in a while we move ahead the democrats know that if we are able to expose their legislation and their programs to the light of day that middleclass america will not agree with them and they will have a chance we will have a chance of reversing some of that legislation on the floor they do not want that to happen and so the trend is clear mussolini rules are winning

this years agenda to consider this important piece of legislation the gallatin range consolidation and protection act my legislation consolidates checkerboard lands in montana the consolidation ii being presented because of the real public lands disaster that is looming in montana if this legislation is not adopted by this spring just north of yellowstone national park the gallatin range connects to the other mountains of the yellowstone ecosystem like a spoke in a wheel this range was not protected a century ago when the park was set aside because every other section of the area was granted to the railroads as payment for the transamerica construction this ranges importance to the integrity of yellowstone has never been questioned however and it has essentially remained wild ever since this range is the home of the largest elk herd in america along with countless other species including the endangered grizzly bear the range also is the headwaters of some of the most pristine streams and rivers anywhere in this country the first attempt to consolidate these lands happened in 1925 and since then there have been countless attempts to bring the gallatin range into federal ownership the federal government has already spent more than 12 million to acquire elk winter range and the house of representatives had held countless hours of testimony on the importance of these lands the house itself passed no fewer than three bills to complete these land trades and purchases but still the range remains chopped up in checkerboard land ownership not long ago the railroad sold its land to a private timber company to avoid a hostile takeover and the company has since again sold the lands to several new owners interested in timber and development part of the new sale arrangement requires that timber be provided off the private lands and so now we face a serious problem if we do not solve these intermingled land problems by the time the contractual harvest is necessary the days of the gracious corporate neighbor in and around the gallatin are over and increasingly important recreation lands will be subdivided posted off limits or sold for private hunting rights if this legislation is not signed into law i helped bring the various parties together last year and we hammered out this agreement without this agreement in the gallatin and because we face a june deadline the company will soon enter and log the nationally significant porcupine drainage with the public losing precious recreation opportunities and scarce public access i am committed to seeing this does not happen and i am hopeful that we can continue to move quickly to assure these lands are brought into public ownership the local landowners are in agreement conservation organizations and local environmentalists are in agreement the park service and forest service are in agreement and we need the congress and the president to act this opportunity dreamed of since 1925

a way of showing the broad cross section of support for this bill they include all three members of montanas congressional delegation the governor of montana the local county commissioners the mayor of bozeman the montana outfitters and guides association the wilderness society the greater yellowstone coalition the cottonwood canyon homeowners association local snowmobile and motorcycle groups employees at the belgrade mill i would like to particularly note a statement that i received from the montana wilderness association flathead chapter regarding the lands in its area which are involved in the trade this statement is important because of some who believed that the lands in the flathead which are exchanged were not reviewed by the local environmental community they were in fact suggested by local conservationists as suitable for trading as this body knows this type of legislation is difficult to negotiate and even more difficult to pass through congress as custodians of our federal land congress must be very careful that any trade we consider meet the most stringent requirements of fairness and value the trade must clearly be in the publics interest and must fulfill public policy goals i take this responsibility very seriously and have never considered any public land trade without clearly knowing that these goals be met montana has been aggressive in consolidating lands and we have never had a problem to date only because with the help of this body we have assured that any consideration had clear public policy goals these trades in the gallatin meet those policy requirements and the 15 years i have been involved in this discussion have shaped these trades to assure they are in the public interest any changes in these trades or consideration of other trades also should have to meet the conditions applied to the gallatin exchange this legislation does not represent the end of the federal governments interests in the gallatin this legislation is just the continuation of an historic concern and this legislation will set a clear process to identify and as sure the continued protection of our national treasures in the greater yellowstone ecosystem i also want to note that there were some concerns recently raised by a local landowner group in montana about several of the sections traded from federal ownership in an area known as north bridgers there have been discussions brokered by my office and involving both the private landowners and the forest service which continue to seek assurances on appropriate guidelines for private harvest on traded lands the north bridgers these efforts also involve the identification of new land combinations and alternatives that help us better achieve protection of the local landowners and still achieve our goals i have worked with our two senators on these issues raised by the folks north of bozeman and i believe accommodation is possible within the framework of the legislation we pass today i will continue working with the senators as the bill is considered in the senate and to share with them my work on behalf of the north bridgers homeowners association it is

the floor with something other than a substitute however when a republican goes to the committee on rules asks for a perfecting amendment asks for a procedural amendment republicans are told no you may only bring a substitute and if you are mr burton and bring a substitute you are told no you cant even have that now if my colleagues wonder why we think this place operates unfairly just consider how the budget has been debated thus far first of all on the budget resolution theygot 5 hours of debate on the democrat side we got 41 hours of debate that is pretty unfair they got their amendments

members factfinding mission in over one decade i would like to enter my full remarks into the record but this evening i wish to say that this was the first ever congressional women members delegation to mexico we were there for over 4 days and our focus was extensive investigations and discussions with individuals from the government as well as the ordinary people of mexico regarding the proposed north american freetrade agreement the bipartisan group of members titled our mission the human face of trade we wanted to open up this agreement and take a look at what it meant not just for the people of the united states and canada but for the people of mexico as well because of course the ordinary people of mexico will not have a chance to speak out on this agreement in that oneparty state our delegation began its journey in mexico city by first meeting with minister of commerce jaime jose serra puche the delegation also met in mexico city with a broad array of environmental humanrights religious and labor organizations comprised of ordinary citizens both in mexico city and in the border communities that we traveled to just south of brownsville tx and mcallen tx in matamoros and reynosa mexico while we were in mexico city our delegation conducted the first ever binational meeting with women legislators from all political parties from both the united states and mexico this event occurred at the home of united states ambassador to mexico john negroponte our delegation visitdd barrios in mexico city and colonias on the border in the matamoros and reynosa we spoke at length with the people who lived there under appalling conditions our delegation discussed border area issues with the residents there with the socalled maquiladora workers who work in the unitedstates companies located south of the border we met with local government officials industry leaders and others gov ann richards of texas made a special effortto fly down to mexico and join our group for an evening of very frank discussions i might say about the proposed nafta agreement our delegation returned from our mission to mexico with these major findings first it is absolutely necessary that the united states and mexico take the time necessary to shape a continental agreement that encompasses the full range of economic social and political issues attendant to such integration the current treaty does not even come close to what is needed the dislocation of jobs of people who have been thrown out of work in the united states and in canada already by unregulated trade confirms the dangers of continuing a handsoff approach to a narrowly cast trade and tariff agreement that does not address these broader issues this is especially true where wage disparities and living conditions are as divergent as they are in the united states and mexico the majority of our meetings were with mexican women who have been most affected by trade policy we have met thousands of united states workers who have lost their jobs to these companies that have located to mexico largely united states companies now over 2 000 of them south of our border with mexico but it is interesting that over 70 percent of the people that have been hired to work in these relocated plants are women mexican women women who live at a subsistence level in fact we met one woman who worked for zenith corp who after 10 years of seniority with our unitedstates company located south of the border takes home for 48 hours of work in a week 15 75 that is her net pay mexicos rising unemployment rate and falling real wages have severely jeopardized the ability of millions of mexicans to fe3d and house their families we met many of these people highwage manufacturing jobs have been drained from communities across our country to lowwage maquiladoras operating in mexico we visited many of these runaway plants along the border but in mexico these jobs have not resulted in rising standards of living for maquiladora workers in fact that was a misconception i had i went down there and i thought if i met the workers in mexico who are workers in these united states firms that have relocated their standard of living would be a little bit higher than people who would be working for mexicanowned companies i found that was not true in fact as you look at what has happened in mexico the rising unemployment rate and falling real wages have severely jeopardized the ability of millions of mexicans to feed and house their families we heard that between 35 and 40 percent of the people of mex ico are now part of what we call the informal sector of their economy that means they do not really get a paycheck that means that they are out there selling chiclets on the street their children are performing as little clowns on the corners to try to pick up little bits of money that they can take home to buy beans and rice for their families it is truly a lowwage economy highwage manufacturing jobs have been drained from communities across our country to these lowwage companies but in mexico these jobs have not resulted in rising standards of living for maquiladora workers but have resulted in a double tragedy because of the subsistence wages that workers are paid so not only do united states workers lose their jobs here but mexican workers earn so very little money that there is not any way for those wages to produce the great booming consumer market that we hear so much about from the proponents of this agreement and why because el pacto the wage agreement between the leaders of the government of mexico industries that have located there and official unions have held wages to onetenth of united states levels in fact even though the government claims there has been an 8 percent increase in wages in mexico over the last year inflation down there in fact is running at 15 percent and interest rates are 35 percent so there is no way for the average family down there to upgrade their standard of living in fact workers in mexico have seen their real wages decline over the last decade and all economists will agree on that we met with apparel workers in mexico city who earn 40 cents an hour we visited people in mexico city neighborhoods who asked us to help them in their efforts to gain the right to food as a part of mexicos constitution because so many of their friends are hungry and we met with them in their neighborhoods saw where they lived went to the neighborhood stores that they tried to set up in a kind of cooperative way trying to buy beans and rice so that they can subsist i asked them how do you define poverty thinking that they would give me a dollar or peso figure definition they said we define poverty as anyone in our country who has less than 60 percent of the calories needed on an average day to merely meet subsistence levels of food and nutrition further it became clear to us that united states companies operating in mexico along with mexicos own domestic firms have enjoyed the addltional advantages of extremely lax enforcement of environmental and labor regulations as well for anyone with a conscience it is disturbing to view the conditions under which the majority of mexican people live our delegation would like to highlight these specific findings and over the weeks we will be bringing more of this information forward to the american people first of all access for mexicans including all of its elected representatives even the fledging opposition party to information about the ongoing trade negotiations we were asked for copies of the proposed treaty the people of mexico have so little information about what is being proposed that the ordinary people including some of their own elected representatives do not have information from the ruling party that information is now tightly controlled by the mexican government inhibiting informed policy making we also were asked that we as members of congress pay more attention to the human impact of mexicos recent economic policies which has gone largely ignored in this country these impacts include unemployment that is approaching 40 percent changes in mexicos land ownership system for its farmers that will drive 10 million more people off the land these people are wandering through mexico flocking into some of the large cities they no longer are growing their own food this is not an inconsequential issue it has an impact on our own immigration policy and also has an impact on whether mexico will be able to become the stable economy as our closest neighbor we saw the inability of wage growth to keep pace with inflation we also noted that mexicos foreign debt has also climbed despite their efforts to try to lower it from s89 billion to 103 billion now the severe economic restraints that they have put on their own people have not resulted in mexico being able to pay off the debts that it owes to foreign banks that is a huge part of the problem they are facing we received a request from concerned mexican scholars that united states and the press investigate the structure of mexicos stock market which they claim is controlled by mexicos wealthiest families allowing them to manipulate it for their profit profit for a very few we received a comhplaint by border communities that the mexican government assesses a housing tax on the lowpaid workers in these maquiladora plants which amounts to over 62 5 million cumulatively last year but these funds were not returned to the border area where housing is desperately needed and where environmental cleanup is desperately needed we received a request that our congress give more attention to the mexican governments preparation of its environmental inspectors which may be inadequate to train them to recognize instances of environmental noncompliance in fact we were told that the average inspector most of them having just been hired because of this agreement being talked about they received about 45 hours of training the north american freetrade agreement as negotiated will not contribute to the promise of raising standards of living for the families of all three nations the negotiated agreements narrow focus on tariff and investment barriers overlooks issues which a true free trade agreement must address real enforcement of labor and environmental laws wage disparities in exportoriented industries accessible dispute resolution which provides justice to citizens and businesses of all three nations and implementation of the polluterpays principle to fund desperately needed environmental cleanup and infrastructure improvements we need more attention to the human rights issue and to the electoral process in mexico itself which even makes their presidential elections called into question because of the manner in which people are treated at the polls and the way votes are counted the gradual and successful integration of the countries of the european community should serve as a model for our own continent we invited the mexican women parliamentarians from all parties to continue discussions with us on these important questions we will reissue that invitation our delegation intends to continue meeting as a working group we are in the process of preparing a detailed report on our findings that we will use to share with our congressional leadership members of congress president clinton and other administration officials as well as the american people we also hope to work with the office of the trade representative to ensure that negotiations on naftas parallel agreements fully address our concerns currently they do not this factfinding mission to mexico was the first step on a journey that will not end until we forge an agreement with mexico that will truly benefit the families of both of our countries and all countries on our continent i thank the chair for its patience this

additional longterm contract would raise the same economic and environmental concerns all over again in 1989 i and 12 other members of congress submitted additional views to accompany h r 987 the tongass timber reform act in those remarks we expressed our concerns about longterm timber contracts in the tongass the contracts give the contract holders extraordinary power to interfere in normal forest service management decisions about where and how to cut federal timber they allow the contract holders to choose the areas they want to cut and refuse areas the forest service offers them they give the contract holders the right to profitable timber anl the right to refuse timber considered uneconomic to cut they have been used as the basis of antitrust violations that drove virtually every small timber operator out of business from 19601976 they ensure that the government will never get a fair monetary return for public timber on the tongass and they allow the pulp mills to high grade the forests by concentrating logging in the rare highvolume old growth most valuable for fish and wildlife habitat see h rept 10184 part 2 page 33 1989 additionally it is my hope that congressional

support of the legislation the ban on assault weapons in the united states of america and i know this is a very difficult issue for a lot of members here today and who are watching back in their offices and it probably should be but it is one i wrestled with quite a while ago as governor of a state and with the governors of new jersey and virginia among others i have called for a ban on assault weapons i have introduced legislation in delaware we have not achieved where i would like to go with that but it was a relatively simple issue working with our police officers and others who believe so strongly in this and i have looked at this legislation and a lot of people will look at this legislation and they will say well we can go beyond this because its going to give the ability to federal officials to ban other kinds of weapons and all variety of arguments come up with respect to that but i think this whole thing is relatively simple and there are just a few points perhaps we should look at as we try to reach our decisions as to whether we are going to vote for this or not first of all and i do not necessarily agree with this but this is a future bill this does not include weapons which people presently own and under which they have control that is a significant point i think in determining whether we should vote for it or not the question then becomes is this an appropriate piece of legislation what are these assault weapons or semiautomatic weapons how are they used well we hear they are used in target practice i do not know of a lot of target practice frankly in which these are used and quite frankly i do not know of a lot of hunting in which these kinds of weapons are used it just is not something which is very prevalent in the united states of america and i suggest we look very carefully at what these weapons are and exactly what their uses are in the united states of america some people have gotten up today and said they have not had any incidents in their districts i hope we do not have to have an incident in a majority of our districts involving an assault weapon before we can pass this legislation the bottom line is that there have been incidents across the united states of america more than incidents of the use of assault weapons there have been a lot of crimes committed with assault weapons in which they have not actually been used let us keep that in mind as well these are expanding in the united states of america our law enforcement officers are strongly for this piece of legislation and i think that is also very very significant they are the ones who are on the firing line and they are the ones who are saying do something to help protect us and then there is the whole issue of i say to my colleagues well if you are for this ban on assault weapons you are not tough on crime i would like to think i am as tough on crime as anyone else here as a matter of fact when i was governor we in delaware did a lot of things that include mandatory minimums for using weapons in crimes we have truth in sentencing in the state of delaware we have looked at all these issues and my belief is that we can still have those very strong measures i wish we perhaps could have amended this bill to put in some stronger measures with respect to what the penalties would be if one had assault weap ons but the bottom line is that we can be very tough on crime but we canalso be against assault weapons because they expand the crime that we see in the united states of america there was a young man who was caned today by our time in singapore that individual was caned in a city or a state which basically does not allow any weapons at all i tried to find out but i do not know what the penalties there may be but the bottom line is that they have stronger penalties but they also ban the use of these weapons i think we should start by supporting this legislation"], [0.007426321506500244, 0.49257367849349976, 0, "i rise today

maintain the integrity of the national park system through various improvements in the process of planning and establishing national park system units i am pleased that we have been able to come to the floor on a bipartisan basis with a compromise which takes the best elements of the h r 1508 introduced by representative hefley and h r 3709 which i introduced the national park service is charged with the management of many of the nations most precious natural cultural and historical resources the 367 areas which make up the national park system are known throughout the world for their natural wonders scenic beauty and historical significance considering the exceptional quality of our national parks it is our obligation to ensure that only outstanding resources are added to the national park system this is especially true in an era of fiscal constraint and large demands on the existing national park system in our national park system several important land forms and themes of american history are underrepresented or not represented at all the national park system needs the ability to expand in order to reflect the progression of history and to respond to a rapidly growing population in expanding the system however great caution must be exercised in order to make sure that only highquality resources are included this concern is bipartisan and it is shared by congress the administration and the american people h r 4476 addresses these concerns by providing for the following it directs the secretary of the interior to prepare a plan to guide the direction of the national park system into the next century the plan would be submitted to congress and would define the role of the national park system in preserving our national heritage relative to other efforts at the federal state local and private levels it would identify aspects of our american heritage which are adequately and inadequately represented in the national park system and would list priorities of the types of resources which should be added to the national park system there currently is no overall plan for the expansion of the national park system the only documents which can be considered plans are the thematic frameworks these documents are not strategies or plans instead they are documents which list major natural and historical themes of the united states and then describe how the themes are represented by existing nps units and landmarks these are not particularly helpful in telling congress or anyone else the short or longterm direction of the national park system this type of strategic planning is done by other federal agencies and large organizations the bill directs the secretary to conduct a management review of the existing national park system to determine if national park service management at any area should be modified or terminated this review would be conducted using the direction provided by the national park system plan in developing the list of areas where nps management would be proposed to be modified or terminated the national park service would consult with other federal agencies state and local officials resource management recreation and scholarly organizations and other interested parties the list would be transmitted to congress within 1 year after the completion of the national park system plan it would require the national park service to recommend alternative entities to manage sites which would be proposed to no longer be managed by the national park service the determination of what areas no longer deserve to be units of the national park system is a highly sensitive task which appropriately should be done by the national park service with advice and consultation from outside organizations i do not believe itis appropriate for this task to be undertaken by a commission which is accountable to no one this provision would allow us to take a hard look at the national park system and see if any corrections or changes are needed it will also allow us to improve management efficiency and costeffectiveness in certain areas where termination is not recommended but some modification such as increased use of cooperative agreements is utilized however in the event that the secretary does not submit the list of areas for termination or modification to congress in the specified 1year time period the bill calls for the establishment of a seven member commission to carry out this task the commission would use the plan and any preliminary work done by the national park service to prepare the list the list would be submitted to congress and the commission would expire the bill does not contain any automatic closure procedures as proposed in h r 1508 the authority to designate national park system units rests with congress and congress should retain that authority with regard to deauthorizing units as well the bill contains most of the provisions of my bill h r 3709 the national park system new area study reform act it would require all new area studies to be authorized by congress after receiving a list of new area study priorities from the national park service studies would have to be completed in 3 years and would have to contain the management alternative preferred by the national park service this provision does not cover technical assistance to state or local governments wild and scenic rivers national trails system units or wilderness areas the purpose of these reforms is to provide congress with the professional opinion of the national park service earlier on in the process of considering areas for addition to the national park system this provision would also eliminate the confusion surrounding the multiple sources of new area study requests which result in delays starts and stops and other problems finally the bill requires the secretary to submit annually a list of previously studied areas in order of priority for addition to the national park system in accordance with an amendment adopted in the subcommittee the national park service will submit two priority rankings one for areas which are primarily cultural in nature and one for areas which contain primarily natural resources the bill before us is a carefully crafted measure which will help to maintain a high level of integrity for the national park system i urge members to support it

fairness to the federal rules governing competing claims by states to abandon intangible personal property i am pleased to be joined in this legislation by congressman jim leach the ranking minority member of the committee on banking finance and urban affairs this is truly a bipartisan effort to establish an equitable rule of escheatment for these unclaimed funds by way of background i should explain this long established concept of eseheatment escheat at feudal law was the right of the lord of a fee more commonly thought of as an estate to reenter upon the fee when it became vacant by the extinction of the blood or descendants of the tenant this extinction might be either per defectum sanguinis or else per delictum tenentis where the course of descent was broken by the corruption of the blood of the tenant ordinarily this concept is applied to an estate in land but the term is applicable to any kind of inheritance corporeal or incorporeal the word escheat in this country merely indicates the right of a state as sovereign to take custody of or assume title to abandoned personal property this process is also known as bona vacantia the estates which are the subject of the equitable escheatment act of 1993 are the securities distributions held by banks and other financial intermediaries for the accounts of customers these distributions usually dividends and interest are unclaimed by their owners and the owner is unknown to the intermediary while only 02 percent of all distributions remain unclaimed the actual dollar amount subject to escheatment is very substantial the securities generating the distributions are either state or local government bonds or publicly traded debt and equity securities of private corporations such as ibm or general motors for years the state of new york has been seizing unclaimed securities distributions claiming that the funds should escheat to new york without regard to the owners last known address or the intermediarys state of incorporation from 1985 to 1991 alone the state of new york seized more than 630 million pf unclaimed dividend and interest payments delaware filed suit against new york in the unitedstates supreme court claiming that the funds were wrongfully escheated the other 47 states and the district of columbia were then granted permission to intervene as plaintiffs in the lawsuit the court appointed a special master to hear the case after determining the facts of the case and hearing all arguments the special master concluded that the unclaimed funds should escheat to the state in which the securities issuers principal executive offices are located the special master found that this would have resulted in the most equttable distribution of the escheated funds in other words the unclaimed funds would be returned to the state in which they originated with respect to state and local bonds the practice of taxpayer funds of one state escheating to the treasury of another state would end and with respect to private securities the fruits of one states efforts to generate local economic gain would no longer be usurped by another state however the wisdom of the special master was not shared by the unitedstates supreme court the court overruled the recommendation of the special master in this case of delaware versus new york and ruled that the unclaimed funds would escheat to the state of incorporation of the financial intermediary holding the funds this opinion would unfairly result in a large windfall for the states of delaware and new york since most financial intermediaries are incorporated in those states the supreme court stated that it felt constrained by a 1965 precedent and invited the aggrieved states to seek corrective legislation the court reminded the parties of a 1974 law overturning another of its escheat decisions the court stated that if the states are dissatisfied with the outcome of a particular case they may air their grievances before congress that body may reallocate abandoned property among the states without regard to this courts interstate escheat rules congress overrode pennsylvania versus new york by passing a specific statute concerning abandoned money orders and travelers checks and it may ultimately settle this dispute through similar legislation the court was referring to provisions contained in a 1974 banking law passed by the committee on banking finance and urban affairs those provisions were also adopted in order to establish a more equitable distribution of unclaimed funds the equitable escheatment act of 1993 would continue that tradition of maintaining fair and equitable treatment of competing state claims to abandoned funds fairness dictates that unclaimed funds be returned to the state in which they originated taxpayer funds of one state should not escheat to the treasury of another state and the fruits of one states efforts to generate local economic gain should not be usurped by another
