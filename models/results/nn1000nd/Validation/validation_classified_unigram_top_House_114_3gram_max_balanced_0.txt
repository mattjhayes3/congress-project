the congressional black caucus during the 113th congress thanks to her dedication and tireless work this caucus is better positioned to address the diverse challenges of the african american community i also want to thank the new cbc chair the honorable congressman g k butterfield of north carolina i am confident that he will do a great job leading this caucus with steadfast commitment to justice and to building an america that works for everyone let me also thank my counterpart the honorable congresswoman robin kelly for joining me in leading the cbc special orders this year i am truly honored to take on this new role and i look forward to working with her as we help carry out the critical mission of this caucus 50 years ago in the midst of the civil rights movement hundreds of brave men and women gathered in selma alabama to begin a long arduous march to montgomery in support of the fundamental truth that every american regardless of what they look like has the right to vote on march 7 1965 600 men and women set out from selma following the death of 26yearold jimmie lee jackson a deacon from marion alabama who died from gunshot wounds inflicted by a state trooper at a nonviolent demonstration theirs was a peaceful nonviolent march but it was met with fierce brutality it would take the marchers two more attempts to arrive at montgomery but on march 25 after a 12day journey they did arrive since that day our country has made significant strides in achieving equality and justice for all but significant challenges remain unmet tonight we will examine where we have come from where we are and where we would like to go as a society we must be ready to go in 1965 selma became the focal point of voter registration efforts in the south at the time only 2 percent of the citys eligible african american voters had been able to register the impact of selma to the montgomery march was profound as dr king said selma produced the voting rights legislation of 1965 the voting rights act of 1965 banned discriminatory voting requirements that disenfranchised african american voters throughout this country yet today the dream of full equality is still something many african americans can only dream of where we are nearly 6 years after the end of the recession people still struggle to find work and the gap between the rich and poor continues to grow for african americans this situation is severe given the disproportionate effect of unemployment on our communities at the same time there remains widespread poverty a defining challenge of our time this persistent economic inequality threatens to undercut the gains that african american communities have made and it undermines the idea of economic mobility the idea that if you work hard in this country and have ambition you can get ahead the economic crisis is not only facing african american communities where we are in education education is the most important economic investment we can make now and for future generations yet across the country we still have seen cuts to education at all levels and attacks on critical programs like head start and pell grants these attacks undermine the ability of african americans to get aheadthat is why i strongly support president obamas new bold initiative for free access to community collegesso too do efforts to dismantle social safety net programs which our communities depend on those efforts are irresponsible unjust and contrary to who we are as americans the congressional black caucus will make criminal justice reform a centerpiece of our agenda we will work to reduce the epidemic of poverty in this country we will work to create educational opportunities for african american children and we will support efforts to strengthen our 105 historically black colleges and universities the cbc also remains committed to fighting against efforts to dismantle the social safety net we are determined to restore section 5 of the voting rights act and to make sure everyone regardless of what they look like or where they come from has equal access to the polls and we resolve to ensure that increasing diversity in this nation is reflected in american corporations together these policies will bring us closer as a nation where we are empowering the communities of african americans and they will benefit from the full equality and live the american dream there is no doubt that we are in difficult times in this nation injustices are widespread and threaten some of our most fundamental rights but we will find no answers in apathy no comfort in complacency as we always have we will continue the march for progress for freedom for justice and for equality for all it is my honor and privilege now that i yield to the

judiciary committee it is there that we deal with the problems particularly on the crime subcommittee at the end of someones detour in life do you know what mr chairman those detours in life that wind up with 75 000 persons in the federal prison system on mandatory minimums has been because people cannot read do not have opportunities and do not have jobs i want to invest in a budget that lifts the boats of all people if you work hard you get a home if you work hard you can send your kids to school if you work hard you can retire that is the budget i want to support not this nosuccess budget that is being proposed by our republican friends i ask my colleagues to support the alternative budget along with the cpc and the cbc budget mr chair i rise in strong opposition to h con res 27 the house republicans budget resolution for fiscal year 2016 because it continues the reckless and irresponsible approach to fiscal policy that the house majority has championed for years with disastrous results mr chair the budgeteers on the majority side have a very poor track record when it comes to economic forecasts and projections for years they have based their entire legislative agenda and strategy on their belief that the affordable care act or obamacare would be a failure the wish was father to the thought but they were wrong because of obamacare more than 16 4 million americans now know the peace of mind that comes from affordable quality health insurance that is there when you need it house republicans oppose increasing the minimum wage claiming that it costs jobs wrong again every increase in the minimum wage has been accompanied by an expanding economy especially during the clinton administration house republicans opposing comprehensive immigration reform claim that it will lead to lower incomes and lost jobs wrong again studies conducted by groups as far apart as the chamber of commerce and the aflcio consistently show that comprehensive immigration reform will grow the gross domestic product by 1 5 trillion over 10 years given this sorry track record of economic forecasting i strongly oppose the republican budget because it favors the wealthy over middle class families and those struggling to enter or remain in the middle class i oppose this republican budget because it asks major sacrifices of seniors who can barely make ends meet and fundamentally alters the social contract by turning medicaid and snap programs into a block grant and medicare into a voucher i cannot and will not support a resolution that attempts to balance the budget on the backs of working families seniors children the poor or mortgages the future by failing to make the investments needed to sustain economic growth and opportunity for all americans mr chair the gop work harder get less budget squeezes hardworking americans by making it 1 harder to buy a home by keeping their paychecks stagnant 2 harder to send your kids to college by cutting student loans and 3 harder to enjoy a secure retirement by privatizing medicare if the house republicans work harder to get less budget were adopted here is a sample of the pain and misery that will be visited on middleclass and working families 1 an end to higher education tax credits 2 an end to needed increases in the child tax credit 3 the loss of access to tax credits for affordable health care for millions of americans and 4 a reduction in tax rates for the wealthy yielding an average tax cut of 200 000 for millionaires financed by a 2 000 tax increase on the typical middle class family mr chair this price is not right budget will make it harder to middle and working class parents to send their kids to college by 1 ending higher education tax credits and 2 cutting student loan programs and pell grants making college less affordable and adding to the already huge levels of student debt the damage caused by the republican budget is not limited to working families and students there are also lumps of coal for seniors who have earned and deserve a secure retirement 1 the medicare guarantee is turned into a voucher program with increased costs for seniors 2 seniors who have worked hard for a financially secure retirement will immediately have to pay new copays for preventive care and much higher costs for prescription drugs the republican budget also disinvests in americas future 1 slashes the part of the budget we use to invest in our childrens education and 2 devastates our investments in scientific research and innovation mr chair the republican budget exacerbates the drag on the economy resulting from a crumbling infrastructure by cutting 187 billion or more than 19 percent from transportation funding over the coming decade and provides no solution to address the current shortfall in the federal transportation fund which means we can expect construction slowdowns beginning this summer mr chair compared to the presidents budget the republican budget would result this fiscal year in 35 000 fewer children in head start and up to 6 000 fewer special education teachers paraprofessionals and other related staff the republican budget also shortchanges americas future by cutting investments in scientific research and innovation in real terms by failing to lift the draconian sequester on domestic priorities as a result under the republican budget there would be 1 300 fewer medical research grants at national institutes h and 950 fewer competitive science research awards at the nsf affecting 11 600 researchers technicians and students finally mr chair the republican budget mistreats the poorest and most vulnerable persons in our country the republican work harder get less budget takes aim at millions of families with children struggling to make ends meet and put food on the table by converting the supplemental nutrition assistance program snap into a block grant beginning in 2021 and cutting funding steeplyby 125 billion 34 percent between 2021 and by 2025 these dramatic cuts could mean in 2021 through 2025 either cutting off assistance to 11 to 12 million eligible people each year or cutting benefits by almost 55 per person per month in contrast the democratic budget works for american families by giving them the tools to buy a home send their kids to college and enjoy a secure retirement mr chair the democratic budget represents a better way we democrats understand that we are all in this together and that our current economic situation calls for a balanced approach between increased revenues and responsible reduction in expenditures our plan will protect and strengthen our recovering economy reduce the deficit in a responsible way while continuing to invest in the things that make our country strong like education health care innovation and clean energy mr chair this republican budget is bad for america but it is disastrous for the people from my home state of texas who sent me here to advocate for their interests let me highlight a few examples 1 if the republican budget resolution were to become the basis of federal fiscal policy 3 435 336 texas seniors would be forced out of traditional medicare and into a voucher program under the republican plan to end medicare as we know it texas seniors will receive a voucher instead of guaranteed benefits under traditional medicare 2 for the 3 435 336 texans aged 4554 the value of their vouchers would be capped at growth levels that are lower than the projected increases in health care costs previous analyses showed that this type of plan would cut future spending by 5 900 per senior forcing them to spend more out of pocket and diminishing their access to quality care 3 additionally private insurance plans will aggressively pursue the healthiest least expensive enrollees thereby allowing medicarecurrently the lifeline for 3 187 332 texas seniorsto wither on the vine 4 if the republican budget resolution were to be adopted by

hour today and throughout the second session of the 114th congress it has been an honor and a privilege to work closely with her she has done such a phenomenal job not just on behalf of the people she represents in the great city of columbus ohio but all throughout the nation in her various roles and certainly in her leadership in the congressional black caucus it is with a heavy heart that i stand on the floor of the house of representatives today and with great sadness acknowledge the pain and the suffering and extend my condolences to those who have suffered this great tragedy in orlando florida the worst mass shooting in the history of the united states of america it is a complicated shooting we understand that it most likely is an act of terror a hate crime of unspeakable proportions there are indications that the shooter may have some degree of mental illness and a history of domestic abuse the shooter appeared to have been in some measure on the fbis radar but you can add all those things up and there is still something that is missing that we here in congress have the capacity to deal with and that is the fact that one individual was able to purchase a weapon of mass destructionwhich should be reserved for war not the hunting of human beings in this great democratic republicand inflict death on 49 individuals and maim in ways that are inhumane to more than 50 others martin luther king jr once said in the end we will remember not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends during the 114th congress there have been more than 100 mass shootings we often come to the floor of the house of representatives and the speaker or one of his designees stands at the rostrum and asks us as members of the house to stand in a moment of silence and then we go on with business as usual having done nothing about the tremendous gun violence problem that we have in america the rest of the world is looking around and saying what are they doing in the united states of america five percent of the worlds population 50 percent of the worlds guns it is estimated that there are more than 300 million guns circulating throughout this great land the fbi and local law enforcement cant tell you where the overwhelming majority of them are because of legislative silence and malpractice this is an issue of course that has great impact on the african american community homicides are the leading cause of death through guns of younger african american men so we in the cbc view it as a public health crisis certainly for our community i think it is one that all americans should view as a health crisis for the entire country but the thing that is also troublingand we will have time to deal with this tragedyis hopefully we will be able to take some commonsense steps in the right direction including making sure that individuals who are on the terrorist watch list cant purchase weapons of mass destruction how complicated is that to do but the thing that is striking for many of us in the african american community is that when you look at some of the leading causes of deathheart disease being number one and then of course diabetes and childhood obesity being problematic certain forms of cancer hiv aids infectionmany of these illnesses these ailments that plague the neighborhoods that i represent in central brooklyn in bedfordstuyvesant in east new york in ocean hillbrownsville in canarsie and in the west end of coney island are preventable preventable by better exercise preventable by dealing with some of the environmental racism that many lowincome communities of color have been subjected to resulting in incredibly high rates of asthma and other forms of respiratory illness preventable by better diet senator booker recently said to many of usand this has stuck with methat more african americans in the united states of america die as a result of drivethroughs not drivebys that is because the diet the access to healthy food is limited the food deserts within which many african americans particularly at the lowest socioeconomic level are forced to reside in are scandalous so we in the congressional black caucus believe that we have to deal with these issues in a more meaningful comprehensive fashion i am thankful that back at home in the west end of coney island coney island cathedral one of the most important religious institutions in brooklyn is actively engaged in a public health campaign to deal with diabetes and heart disease and many of the other ailments that result from a poor diet that exists a lack of access to healthy food in the black community it is a campaign that we want to take across the nation we are thankful for the work that has been done by the congressional black caucus and by president obama through his leadership of the affordable care act we now know that over 20 million previously uninsured americans now have access to quality affordable health caredisproportionately african american that is a positive step in the right direction but instead of trying to dismantle this monumental step forward as house republicans have attempted to do more than 60 times over the last few years they have a clinical obsession with a law that has been declared constitutionalnot once but twiceby the united states supreme court lets figure out ways to come together as a nation despite our racial religious and ethnic differences to deal with the disparities that exist in the african american community and beyond and let us come

thoughtfully crafted words and messages to inspire and give us a road map he had these famous words why we cant wait which were found in the 1960s what a provocative statement is he trying to provoke people to violence absolutely not he was a committed dedicated servant and disciple of gandhis nonviolence and his own internal mechanism of nonviolence it was in his dna he would not provoke any form of violence we should know that because as the story looks back and things happened if you were part of the sclc they were driven they trained all of their foot soldiers in an absolute commitment to nonviolence and if you showed any sign that you could not adhere you would not be part of their efforts dr king had some famous words that i like i know and like many of his words but this one everybody can be great or anybody can serve you only need a heart full of grace and a soul generated by love let me also say it is important when you come up and talk about great people that you dont

services committee mr thornberry for yielding i am also grateful to ranking member smith for the opportunity to discuss the issue of mental health treatment for our military servicemembers i know we all care deeply about the health of our servicemembers for those who have borne the battle we share a commitment to come to their aid whether their wounds are a visible amputation or the invisible problems of posttraumatic stress disorder the statistics as you know are sobering 22 vets die by suicide each day and more than 600 000 vets are diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder delivering proper treatment for mental health is really a matter of life and death we can provide these warriors with treatment and medications they need or we can continue to provide their families with folded flags and our condolences to their widows but it is not enough to just provide a few limited medications because people react differently to medication some medications can work well with one person or result in adverse side effects to another with the same diagnosis side effects may include drugtodrug interactions allergic reactions excessive sedation and weight gain with increased risk of diabetes that is why doctors must be able to choose the medication that fits for the soldier but when dod or the va limits the choices that puts soldiers at risk the servicemember may stop taking the medication withdraw from treatment and may deteriorate we should not add to their risk i would ask the chairman and the ranking member to work with me to ensure that the full array of fdaapproved medications are accessible for our soldiers sailors airmen and marines who need these lifesaving drugs they fought for our country overseas they should not have to fight the department of defense and the va over here chairman thornberry i seek a commitment that we do not allow accountants to choose which medications are available for the psychiatric conditions of our servicemen and women let the physician working with the servicemember or veteran make those decisions"], [0.0003039240837097168, 0.4996960759162903, 0, "i thank the gentleman for yielding i would try to bring some clarity about the amendment and i stand in opposition to this amendment we have heard a lot of hyperbole here this evening but i want to try to set the record straight we cannot have it both ways we can either have an endangered species act and we can have the fish and wildlife service and their scientists manage it or we can get rid of it and just have the court do it so it appears that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle when things dont go the way they like by the fish and wildlife service they are fully supportive of the court system when things dont go right in the court system it appears that they are fully supportive of the fish and wildlife service what i would prefer is that we protect the endangered species act and the agency that was directed to manage it and to manage these rare populations or endangered species like the gray wolf in the 1990sand i am from wisconsinthere were only a handful of mating pairs of gray wolves in northern wisconsin throughout the great lakes region today there are 3 700 wolves in this area it is an economically and ecologically unsustainable number the fish and wildlife service rightly decided that the population had recovered and that their program to protect this species had been so completely successful that it was time to delist and turn the power back to the states to manage which in fact they were doing until a court decided that the fish and wildlife service and the experts there protecting the endangered species act just didnt get it right well we cannot have it both ways mr chair and it is time that this congress tells the courts what the laws are and how we want these things managed what we are doing here in this bill and in the underlying language is protecting both the endangered species act and the fish and wildlife

homeland security it is with great pride that i rise in support of h r 720 the gerardo hernandez airport security act of 2015 the passage of this bipartisan legislation demonstrates the importance with which the committee on homeland security considers the security of our nations airports and transit hubs moreover this legislation shows congress dedication to the men and women of the tsa who work diligently each day to keep the american people safe in order to mitigate threats from those with malicious intent seeking to wreak havoc on our critical transportation systems we must stand together our law enforcement and first responder community must communicate collaborate and coordinate so they are better prepared to execute emergency plans in response to all types of security incidents i believe the passage of this bill creates a roadmap that will provide our first responders and tsa with the proper level of coordination to respond to incidents like the senseless shooting that took place at los angeles international airport on november 1 2013 after the shooting i travelled with other members of the committee including ranking member thompson to los angeles to meet with first responders tsa officials airport personnel as well as the injured transportation security officers who bravely put themselves in harms way to help an elderly passenger i also had the somber opportunity to meet with the widow of officer hernandez before holding a field hearing to examine what could be done to mitigate such tragedies in the future today i am proud to see this committees efforts set to cross the finish line and i hope that the wife of officer hernandez can find some solace in the passage of this legislation which bears her husbands name the legislation will direct tsa to conduct necessary outreach to airports and transit hubs across the united states to ensure that there are adequate security incident response and communications plans in place moreover h r 720 establishes tsa as a clearinghouse of bestpractices for transportation sector preparedness and incident response which will streamline the proliferation of information and communication across transportation systems in the united states this bill also looks for ways to overcome interoperable communications challenges and increase funding for airport law enforcement while also ensuring that airport personnel are equipped with training on how to response to active shooters and other security incidents such as terrorism it is my pleasure to commend the chairman of the subcommittee on transportation security mr katko and former chairman of the subcommittee mr hudson for their efforts in addressing this issue as well as working to foster bipartisan cooperation i also wish to commend the bipartisan efforts of both the ranking member of the full committee mr thompson and the ranking member of the subcommittee ms rice whose support of this legislation is greatly appreciated

a different view there are over twohundredandsome groups that disagree with how the impacts of these bills were going to affect the markets including the chairman of the commodity futures trading commission who are the people who actually have to administer this law and we have a letter from the chairman that has a completely different point of view than mr scott has and others in terms of how this will impact the situation according to the chairman you know he is opposed to this he says i believe that many of the provisions in this bill before the committee are either unnecessary or impose requirements on the commission that would make it harder to fulfill their mission the bill limits the agencys ability to respond quickly to both market events and market participants it will make it more difficult for us to make adjustments to rules and achieve greater global harmonization of swaps rules with respect to the provisions pertaining to commercial end users concerns the agency has sufficient authority to address the goals outlined in the legislation and in most cases has already done so he also states i have concerns that title ii of the bill includes language that would complicate the agencys longstanding statutory requirements to consider costs and benefits in its rulemaking imposing additional unworkable standards and creating confusion that is likely to lead to more lawsuits instead of policy grounded in datadriven analysis had this language been in effect it would have been harder for the agency to positively respond over the past 10 months to market participants concerns title ii also imposes procedural requirements on the agency that to my knowledge are not followed by any other independent agency these changes would make it difficult to manage the agency and to ensure accountability and could weaken the commission for administrations to come so there is a disagreement of opinion about how this bill will actually impact the marketplace and how it will actually work and if as was claimed it wasnt going to have any effect i would be here supporting it in my opinion this is going to have significant impacts on the way the commission does
