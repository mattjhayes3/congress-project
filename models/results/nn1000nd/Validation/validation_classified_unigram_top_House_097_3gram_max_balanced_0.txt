legal assistance available to those unable to afford legal counsel on their own it is an attempt to reaffirm this nations belief that before the law all men stand equal it is a goal that this congress set for the corporation in 1974 in my estimation the corporation has been a remarkable success in past years as appropriations or reauthorization bills for the legal services corporation have been before this congress critics have come forth with what they consider horror stories about the operations of the legal services programs across the country attempts have been made to characterize as typical the highly controversial case or the occasional instance of bad judgment by the corporation or local program i do not pretend to agree with all that each of the over 320 local programs have done but i suggest to my colleagues that the horror stories we have heard during this debate as in previous debates are the rare exception and are in no way the norm last year legal services programs handled over 1 5 million legal matters for incomeeligible clientsclients who for some reason or another came to legal aid for help many of these clients may have even been referred to legal services by our own professional staffs before we decide whether as a congress and as a nation we should abandon a program to insure minimum access to justice for lowincome persons i suggest we look at what legal services really does this past winter on a 30degree day a mother and her 6weekold child had no heat in their apartment the landlord had turned it off a local legal services lawyer invoked the law the apartment had heat once again in ohio an 80yearold woman was abandoned by her family at a migrant rest center because her family could no longer support her she was referred to a local legal services program her attorney learned that the widow had never applied for social security survivors benefits despite her eligibility for them she had never heard of social security benefits she was reunited with her family and is assured of social security benefits for the rest of her life in new york state an elderly couple was referred to legal services after signing a contract to have their home insulated for more than 1 700 independent estimates placed the cost at 400 or less the legal services attorney claimed unconsclonability and truthinlending violations the insulating company canceled the contract and performed the job for 442 including finance charges in missouri a legal services progran recovered damages for a poor illiterate victim of a car dealer the car dealer had sold a 300 truck for 1 700 these are but four examples of the types of matters handled by legal services attorneys as they seek to protect the legal rights of their clients most of these legal services involve matters one might expect to confront lowincome persons roughly 30 percent of the cases involved family law problems 14 percent concurred problems of consumer finance 18 percent dealt with housing problems and 17 percent centered on problems of income maintenance these may appear to be mundane mattersbut to the individual client like the four i just mentioned they are extremely important these few examples real examples of how legal services affect the lives of this nations disadvantaged demonstrate the need for continuation of the legal services program i ask you can we now say to that mother and newborn baby in florida to the elderly couple in new york to the michigan family in an unheated apartment or to an 80yearold woman in ohio that they can no longer have legal assistance to enforce their rights if we discontinue the legal services corporation that is in effect what will happen for many persons in this nation legal services demonstrates that our system can work during his campaign and since he was elected president reagan has promised to make government work for the people the success of the 320 local legal aid programs in this country is a prime

austria bremen germany nice france turin italy goteburg sweden mandalay burma and brisbane australia despite overwhelming congressional support for this measure both the previous and the current administrations have blatantly ignored this directive in fact the current administration is planning to open three new consulates in communist china while at the same time refusing to reopen any of the previously named consulates due to socalled budgetary pressures this is not an inconsequential matter for example during a recent visit to australia we learned that the closing of the unitedstates consulate in brisbane has forced unitedstates business to turn to our consulate in sydney for any assistance they require this makes our sydney consulate responsible for serving the needs of americans in half of the land mass of australia an area equivalent to the distance between new york and los angeles yet sydney has insufficient travel funds for its personnel to visit other cities in the region it must now service unitedstates businessmen pointed out that over 20 billion in resource development projects are planned in the next decade for brisbanes state of queensland while no consular support is readily available to unitedstates companies seeking to bid for contracts on these projects the case of the other consulates which remain closed is equally compelling both on economic and

promulgated by my colleague mr green and i with the idea in mind that the american taxpayer is being asked to pay even higher taxes in exchange for dubious and questionable increases in our defense spending our amendment will cut defense outlays by 4 billion in each of the upcoming 3 fiscal years from the amount specified in the com mittee budget and will reduce budget authority in each of these years by 16 billion importantly however the amendment also permits us to cut 4 billion from the tax hike assumed in the committee budget for individuals and corporations it goes without saying that our weapons programs should be put together in a rational and thoughtful way and yet there is a perception out there a growing suspicion if you will that americans are not receiving a dollars worth of defense for each dollar spent years of haphazard defense policy and lack of a strong coordinated leadership have left this country with a defense department increasingly perceived as bloated bureaucratic and wasteful the gentleman from new york and i are concerned that the federal government is engineering a major shift of national resources to the military but without a fiscally prudent outline and course while most domestic programs face deep cuts major cost overruns on already expensive weapons systems are almost routinely accepted by congress and administration clearly to continue on this course will not serve the longterm interests of this country and indeed will needlessly drain scarce resources required by the rest of our recession ridden economy today more than ever we need to let our pentagon blanners know that we are watching them and that we expect them to carefully monitor and streamline weapons cost today a fighter plane cost 30 million a battle tank 2 5 million an attack submarine 580 million this is to hay nothing abut the 3 5 billion price tag for a new aircraft carrier even when adjusted for inflation the costs of these weapons are easily doubledigit multiples of their world war ii and korean war predecessors in all the pentagon is spending some 84 billion in the current year as their share of the defense budget for weapons procurement and military reserach and development left unchecked this figure could rise to 600 billion in the years 1983 through 1987 and yet despite the enormous price tag associated with our procurement programs there has been little debate on the committee bills effect on our economy right now faced with deep recession and unmet human needs at home i am concerned that the committee when discussing our strategic needs did not analyze defense spending in broad perspective i am not sure that my coileagues understood that a strong economy is needed for a strong defense and that largescale diversions of the nations economic resources into the military sector could result in a continued economic decline and an increasing inability to meet the basic needs of the american people i am concerned that the defense figure approved by the committee is indicative of a general lack of commitment toward stopping duplicative and unnecessary defense programs and policies particularly in the area of procurement where cost overruns spring up like dandelions a nation with a crumbling infrastructure increasing unemployment increasing poverty and a shakey economy can ill afford the costs of an unchecked 242 billion buildup the nations security and strength are not defined only through military powers but also through the vitality of our domestic economy and society and yet unless we force our m~ihtary planners to make real choices in our strategic programs the administrations defense plan and the largescale deficits it necessitates may serve to thwart any attempt we make to improve our defenses by blindly throwing money at them without thought to the fiscal consequences our amendment addresses itself to this problem it will allow us not to increase taxes as much in order to achieve the same deficit levels as the committees budget our amendment will permit us t6 preserve the contract we made with the american people last year to reduce their personal taxes by a full 10 percent by insuring the committee budget thus provides my colleague and i i think both agree that a significant reduction in the tax rates given individuals is necessary in order to revitalize the economy by producing noninflationary economic growth a 10percent cut is necessary in order to return confidence and encourage economic activity president kennedy once said that an economy hampered by restrictive tax rates will never produce enough revenue to balance the budget just as it will never produce enough jobs or enough profits truer words were never spoken and could not be more applicable today on this amendment to continue to allow our military leaders to plan and spend for every strategic weapons program unchecked and without real oversight in the pentagon is not responsible and is in conjunction with higher taxes the wrong formula for economic recovery our primary defense i urge my colleagues support for this important amendment should any of you have any doubts about how 16 billion in budget authority can be trimmed from our defenses without undermining our na tional security needs i submit the following suggestions for savingsthat can be achieved by trimming waste and by incorporating responsible changes in military procurement and management policies the general accounting office in over 100 reports in the last year has illustrated in irrefutable fashion the enormous savings that are possible billions could be spared for instance through the consolidation of support activities at bases close to each other so that administrative functions such as payroll transportation trash and sewage disposal could be streamlined still less costly ways to budget and provision spares for new weapon systemscould be used to make them more effective and less costly and save millions in the process in addition according to the gao work still needs to be done to improve the management of naval fleet supplies and spare parts and in the area of recouping administrative costs of foreign military sales millions of dollars are still written off in former service members debts and according to the gao future losses can easily be cut as recently as last month the agency reported that actions are still needed to reduce schedule slippages and cost overgrowth on contracts for naval ship overhauls and changes are urgently needed to improve the effectiveness and acquisition management of certain weapons systems a congressional republican study committee report in 1981 also cited several general accounting office reports which estimate that the pentagon could save several billion dollars annually savings of 1 billion could be realized for instance if the air force installed one rather than two computer systems at their bases to perform administrative and operating functions in addition according to the report over onehalf of a billion dollars is apparently being wasted by increased government costs due to fraud inadequate accounting and procedural control in the armys military district of washingtons finance and accounting office complementing these findings are the recommendations made by noted author william w kaufman a high level consultant to defense secretaries from robert mcnamara to harold brown that defense could be reduced safely by 32 billion in authority this year and 11 billion in outlays his latest study setting national priorities published by the brookings institution recommends among other suggestions canceling the pershing ii and groundlaunched cruise mis iles for deployment in europe in favor of the trident 2 submarine missiles among additional savings cited by mr kaufman are limiting the administrations planned expansion of the nations civil defense program and canceling the mx and b1 bombers many of you may also be acquainted with the april 25 washington post article by staff writer walter pincus in which he notes seven additional ways in which the defense budget could be cut by 10 billion in outlays according to pincus savings of several hundred million dollars are possible by halting the two questionable costly army antitank programsthe apache attack helicopter and the bradley fighting vehicles and 3 billion in outlays by cutting back on purchases of excessive munitions to be used in wartime and the rate at which nonessential defense equipment is overhauled mr green and i and the other members of a northeastmidwest coalition highlighted earlier this year the over 40 billion in budget authority that could be realized in fiscal year 1983 by substituting provem reliable less costly weapons for proposed weapons systems that were plagued by cost overruns and unreliable testing history some of our suggestions included a cutback in the purchase of m2 infantry fighting vehicles the substituting of some conventional submarines for new nuclear ones a restructuring of the proposed naval modernization of naval air defenses a less ambitious procurement schedule for the m1 tank and the elimination of the viper antitank rocket additional savings could easily be attainable by reducing service members overpayments and scaling back subsidies of alcohol and tobacco at commissaries other weapons with large cost overruns that could be targeted for reductions are the patriot air defense system and the copperhead laserguided 155mm artillery shell both are victims of the armys inability to manage dozens of new programs at the same time rather than having the time and resources to refine and adequately test fewer new weapons slowly over an extended period taken together all these recommendations could save billions and they illustrate how we can save billions of dollars in the defense budget while still funding necessary programs for a stronger defense it is important to make clear that i am by no means insinuating that these suggestions should be adopted in their entirety or that even anyone of them is necessarily preferable to other ideas to reduce outlays what should be apparent and i have emphasized this time and time again is that as we are asked to increase defense spending by over 1 trillion over the next 5 years it is even more important for the members of this body to examine closely these recommendations for properly allocating defense revenues our amendment provides the ideal opportunity for us to force the pentagon to begin to look at these ways to reduce outlays and in the process to manage more efficiently its fiscal resources i am supplying mr chairman a list of gao reports as referred to earlier and a list of suggested areas for examination to expand on and amplify my earlier remarks"]]}
