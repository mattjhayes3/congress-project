soon learned that these benefits were not achieved without a cost part of this cost was the modification and destruction of the habitats upon which many species of fish and wildlife depended for their survival the endangered species act was born out of this nations concern that the price of progress had been too highthat a greater effort must be made to conserve our fish wildlife and plant resources in considering the achievements of this act we often frame the issue in terms of the aesthetic value of these resources while this is important it is not the real issue i submit to you that the issue is the dependence of man on verse biological gene pool take one example medical chemis nearly 40 percent of all prescript written in the united states contai their chief ingredients compounds rived form plants including lower from plants it was through the ex ration of nature that these drugs w discoveredand such exploration a long history of paying off centu ago the incas

plant drugs suct the anticancer drugs used in the tr ment of hodgkins disease were c recently discovered there is no en the potential for discovery of this t in nature because we have only be the chemical exploration of nature is the preservation of biological di sity which i believe is the key is before us today the issue of biological divers however is one that needs to viewed on a broader scale the v fact that there are endangered spe in this world is symptomatic of the creasingly endangered status of nat itself we are encroaching u nature at an unprecedented ratethis nation and throughout the wo species are disappearing because t1 habitats are disappearing i recogi and agree that we cannot turn b the hands of time and dismantle industrial machine we have creal we cannot stop all further growth j because this growth consumes land and its resources what we m achieve is a balance between the dustrial needs of our society and biological need to prevent the exti tion of species which represent a source of equal value the ame ments before us attempt to achi such a balance we have all heard the cries that endangered species act is stopping dustrial progress in this nation i is not true the facts in no way s port this assertion in the last 3 fis years for example there have b 10 762 consultations conducted un the endangered species act of th 10 762 consultations only 192 1 8 p cent resulted in a finding that project in question would jeoparc the continued existence of an end gered species of these 192 proje modifications were made in 185 they went forward only seven pi ects in 3 years were stopped ani would point out that of those sever least five and perhaps all seven w stopped for reasons unrelated to endangered species act the facts do not s port the assertion that the end gered species act has blocked the velopment of american indus what the act has done is inject a r consciousness into the process real which industrial growth is achieved i di this consciousness is quite simply an just increased awareness of the economic try medical and aesthetic importance of ions endangered species these species are n as now clearly considered when a project de is planned and carried out projects life continue to go forward but the impact plo on the environment is more carefully vere considered now the purpose of the has endangered species act is conflict tries avoidance through this planning procma ess and i submit to you that the statistree tics i have cited prove that the act has ted been a great success in this regard dwn this is not to say however that the yet act is without weaknesses for examthe ple the conflict avoidance process las would be strengthened if consultations eat were conducted as early as possible in nly the planning process h r 6133 sped to cificaily allows this to occur further ype it is unreasonable to expect the congun sultation and biological assessment it processes contained in the act to be ver extended indefinitely without the sue permit applicant or the federal agency knowing the reasons for the ity extension h r 6133 remedies this by be establishing a specific procedure ery whereby consultations and biological dles assessments cannot be extended within out a clear statement of the reasons ure for and the lergth of the extension pon h r 6133 also seeks to remedy the in problem faced by many businessmen rld who receive n biological opinion that ieir their project will not jeopardize the iize continued existence of a species and ack yet it is known throughout the consulthe tation process that the project will ted result in the taking of a certain ust number of the species these businessthe men even though they have received ust a favorable report on their project and in are allowed to proceed are confronted the with possible prosecution under secinc tlon 9 of the act which says that the re taking of a single endangered species nd violates the act h r 6133 addresses eve this issue by providing a special procedure which will result in a section 9 the exemption for projects which have rein ceived a favorable biological opinion his other businessmen confront a difup ferent problem their projects occur cal on private lands and they are thereben fore unable to enter into the consultader tion and exemption process they are ose however still governed by the section er 9 prohibitions of the act for these the businessmen h r 6133 creates a spelize cial permit procedure whereby they an may be given a permit to take endancts gered species if the taking is incidental nd to and not the purpose of the project roj in question and if the taking is not i i likely to jeopardize the continued exat istence of the species ere the amendments we are considering the also make it clear that there is a difference between economic considerup ations under the act and biological an considerations whether a species has de declined sufficiently in numbers to try justify its listing under the endaniew gered species act is a biological not by an economic question to blend the jse june b 1982 two is to improperly confuse biology with economics what you do once the species is listed is a biological and an economic questiona question which requires a balancing of the biological needs of the resource with developmental needs unfortunately in the past few years biology and economics have been confused and inte cwined in the listing process h r 6133 remedies this by making the listing process solely biological and leaving to the exemption process the balancing of economics and biology finally h r 6133 addresses the socalled bobcat issue specifically h r 6133 provides relief from the unitedstates court of appeals decision which mandated the onerous requirement of reliable population estimates before nodetriment findings could be made under cites and before bobcat exports could be allowed in its stead h r 6133 permits nodetriment findings to be made without reliable population estimates however if population estimates are available they must be used as one part of the data considered in making a nodetriment determination thus h r 6133 clearly relieves the
