all of the people all of the time president bill clinton and the democraticcontrolled congress are out to prove honest able uncoln wrong president clinton through his false gimmick packaging is trying to sell the american people into believing that his huge tax hike the largest in american history will go towards reducing the federal deficit president clinton and the democrats are conning the american people and this is why i checked with my doctors yesterday to get their approval to cast my vote against president clintons budget this vote is the first i have made since i underwent triple bypass surgery on july 16 to remove arterial blockage i believe this vote is crucial to my constituents and the country and this is why i am here before you instead of at home recuperating the democratic leadership claim that the goal of the clintons tax package is to pare 500 billion from the federal debt over the next 5 years what president clinton and the democrats fall to say is that even if they pass the presidents budget the nations debt will still increase by a staggering 1 2 tillion if this doublespeak is not insulting enough to the intelligence of taxpayers clinton and the democrats are trying to pull a fast one on american families and businesses by frontloading 275 billion of gross tax increases without significant spending cuts the clinton tax package heaps taxes on americans already struggling to provide a decent standard of living for themselves and their families rather than making americans pay their fair share the clinton tax plan will ensure that americans will be sharing most of their income with the federal government maybe the president and the democratic leadership in congress have convinced themselves of this but my constituents are not persuaded history has demonstrated to us time and time again that increasing taxes does not reduce the deficit higher taxes means increased spending i ask you my colleagues the question my constituents have asked me how can these tax increases be justified with the knowledge that no mechanisms exist to cut spending in the budget three parts of this budget represent a particularly onerous tax burden that will affect the middle class seniors and anyone else in america who breathes the gas tax the social security tax and surprising new retroactive taxes first the gas tax this federal gasoline tax of 4 3 cents per gallon will be more burdensome to families living in the large states of the west and south california will not escape the affect of this tax this increase will tax gasoline diesel compressed natural gas and noncommercial aviation fuel california will be hit extremely hard since it has a large population that utilizes various forms of transportation transportation costs will inevitably increase the clinton energy tax is inflationary and will escalate the already spiralling tax burden passed on to american families the energy tax will stifle the economic recovery we see occurring right now according to the tax foundation it is estimated that 54 299 jobs will be lost in my state of california behind every number there is a human face a family someone who can blame their unemployment on clintons tax package next the tax on social security benefits or if you listen to the president a spending cut seniors will be penalized for working and saving for their retirement under the clinton tax plan even though in his manifest putting people first candidate clinton promised to protect the integrity of the social security trust fund he hag decided to balance the budget on backs of senors cintons proposal will affect seniors with incomes of over 32 000 or coups incomes over 44 000 by inrea the tax on 85 percent of their social secuty benefits in addition to this these taxes increase the elderly surtax on pensions ira withdrawals interest from municipal bonds and certifcates of deposit the tax revenues generated by these new taxes on seniors will then be used to fund other programs rather than going into the socal security trust fund the president should not wonder as he pillages senlors benefits to pay for other programs why in addition to te budget deficit he also must contend with the trust fund this elderly surtax is anything but fair the increase in the elderly surtax hits the prudent and frugel who live on ixed incomes accordlng to the heritage foundation it is estimated that in calilomia 566 328 households over 65 with incomes greater than 3 000 will be hit and more spedlically in my district 13 884 households affected the 29 billion clinton hope to rsm at the expense of our seniors could easily be achieved by implementing just a handful of seniors wastecuting recommendations that have been put before him seniors should be appalled that a president who was not even born while many of them were fighting in world wars to make the world safe for democracy and wordng to feed their families is now trying to pick their pockets to pay for his new spending programs ad speaking of new taxes id like to call my colleagues attention to language ticked away in the budget reconcillatlon bill the measure imposes an unfair

of small busineses who file as individuals will be hit by these taxes president clinton conceded that up to 1 25 million smal business men and women could be paying this jincreased tax this is a huge

roister of shame for letting this catastrophe unfold will be a long one it will include decisionmakers and opinlonmakers from both sides of the atlantic from across the political spectrum from

cowardice or so much energy expended in the hope of evading responsibility never have i seen something so immense so important get so little attention we are witnessing a disaster it is a human disaster now for the people of bosnia it is a moral disaster for the world community it is a longterm security and economic disaster for the american people but western governments have done so much to obfuscate these high stakes and to exhaust the psychic energy of western publics by their handwringing and posturing that we have to read about this disaster in the back pages of the daily press this should be a front page headline story every day here is the truth about bosnia and what it means to the west in bosnia the bosnian moslem people are being decimated by a systematic genocide run by the belgrade regime of slobodan milosevic the perpetrators of this genocide have killed some 200 000 men women and children they have maimed and wounded tens of thousands more they have systematically raped tens of thousands of women they have systematically targeted for extermination in death camps the leading strata of bosnian society they have systematically destroyed all signs of nonserb culture in some twothirds of bosnia by this genocide they mean not only to decimate the bosnian moslem people they also mean to destroy forever the multiethnic and multicultural civilization that was bosnia herzegovina to destroy the bosnian government and to dismantle the bosnian state milosevic and his thugs are getting away with this genocide not only that western governments are serving as his military and political accomplices we are accomplices because we continue to deny cover up and minimize the evidence of this genocide the unitedstates state department knows that milosevc is engaged in genocide but it wont say so because this would increase the pressures to do something we are accomplices because we have taken sides militarily with the perpetrators this is not a case where as edmund burke put it the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing this is a case where good men have actually done somethingbut on the side of evil mark this point well we are not simply bystanders as we were for the holocaust when we did not come to the aid of europes jews it is not just that we have declined to come to the aid of the bosnians through military intervention we have done worse we have denied the victims the means to defend themselves through application and enforcement on bosnia of the u n arms embargo on former yugoslavia we have intervened on the side of genocide the clinton administration has tried to distance itself from this complicity by adopting the position that it favors lifting the arms embargo from the bosnian government but this is not the administrations real position it is only the administrations posture for public relations purposes when it comes to real action to get the arms embargo lifted from the bosnian government the administration opts out i ask here what efforts did the president or secretary of state make to win support from our friends and allies for todays effort in the u n security council to lift the embargo from bosnia how many leaders did the president call to press his case in what way did we show that this is important to us the answer is that the administration did nothing as if the illusion of leadership could be preserved by passivity we are accomplices because we have taken sides with the perpetrators of the genocide in political terms as well we have exerted pressure on the bosnian government to accept the ethnic partition of bosnia we have legitimized the perpetrators of genocide as the rightful leaders and spokesmen for the serb people and as the legitimate subjects of negotiations with the bosnian governmentwhich both cyrus vance and david owen have tried mightily to reduce to the status of the moslem faction mark this point well too we have joined slobodan milosevic radovan karadzic and their murderous forces in pressing the bosnian government to surrender this is a far more disgraceful surrender than munich when war and genocide were still in the future and again the administration seeks to distance itself from complicity by adopting the position that we would have preferred a multiethnic bosniabut that if all parties quote genuinely and honestly agree unquote we will accept partition i ask here how can anyone talk of the bosnian government quote genuinely and honestly unquote agreeing to partition when that government is under relentless military assault and its people have been and continue to be decimated by genocide obviously one cannot doing so is just another way of disguising what we are up to which is to sell out a sovereign independent united nations member state to external aggression i made reference earlier to munich if czechoslovakia had fought back against hitler no doubt the united kingdom and france would have written this off a civil war just as secretary christopher has redefined bosnia as a civil war but there is another parallel with munich as well when the united kingdom and france sided with hitler against czechoslovakia in 1938 poland and hungary also opted to grab small chunks of that state they were later to become hitlers victims too now in 1993 western complicity in milosevics aggression against bosnia has encouraged croatiaalready one of milosevics victims to also take the low road and seek to grab part of bosnia the complicity of croatian president tudjman in milosevics attack on bosnia has made croatia an aggressor even as it remains a victim of milosevics aggression i have repeatedly condemned croatias complicity in the partition of bosnia directly to croatian president tudjman i believe he and his coterie of advisors from herzegovina are doing great harm to both bosnia and croatia how ironic that tudjman could plausibly respond that he was simply cooperating with the vanceowen plan or more recently the stoltenbergowen partition effort croatia was the first state to recognize the sovereignty and independence of bosnia it has made a greater effort to help bosnian refugees including bosnian moslems than any other country how tragic it is and how avoidable it could have been that croatia has now become part of the aggression against bosnia there is an unspoken assumption behind the wests appeasement policy toward slobodan milosevic and its support for the partition of bosnia that assumption is that milosevic can be bought off that if we let him grab and cleanse one third of croatia and twothirds of bosnia he will stop and the crisis will abate and be contained within the borders of what used to be yugoslavia in short the idea is that a greater serbia means a more stable balkans what a stupid notion first of all milosevics goal of an ethnically pure greater serbia promises unending conflict with its current victims in croatia bosnia kosovo sandzak and vojvodina and with its future victims in macedonia it promises millions more victims of ethnic cleansing in all those areas second the track record over the past 3 years is clear milosevic has no bottom line and the more he gets the further he pushes on his regime is growing more fascist not less third the gathering clouds of a new genocide in kosovo are ominously dark and near kosovo has been a slowmotion krystallnacht for 3 years now it is one vast concentration camp with the pilot light lit in the ovens the idea that it will be possible to deter milosevic and his thugs from genocide in kosovo after letting them get away with it in bosnia is simply preposterous what then does our betrayal of bosnia mean for the west in the balkans it means years of conflict in croatia and bosnia and the destruction of democracy in both those states it means the spread of milosevics genocidal aggression to kosovo sandzak and vojvodina and to macedonia and the triggering of the wider balkan war that western policy ostensibly aims to deter in the long run milosevics greater serbia is doomed to collapse but its rise and fall will traumatize southeastern europe for generations to come in europe our betrayal of bosnia makes a mockery of two principles which are crucial to peace and stability in particular in the area of the former soviet union that genocide will be suppressed and that crossborder aggression will not be tolerated it fatally undermines the credibility and authority of two institutions on which transatlantic peace and security are based nato and the csce in the wider world our betrayal of bosnia exposes the end of americas military commitment to european peace and security it reduces the power of the united nations and the u n security council to that of the league of nations in the 1930s it poisons relations between the west and the islamic world and strengthens fundamentalism in the latter it emboldens aggressors everywhere in short the idea that writing off bosnia will settle the balkan crisis is as misguided as it is immoral the bosnian people are paying a terrible price for this now we will all pay a heavy price for it down the road what is happening in bosnia is not something we can afford to treat as a distraction from pressing domestic issues as the president has suggested it is not something we can afford to sweep under the rug in embarrassment bosnia and the western policy response should be the subject of serious national debate it is the defining moment of the postcold war era and so far it is defining nothing but trouble ahead again i thank the distinguished majority whip"], [0.000782310962677002, 0.500782310962677, 0, "i thark the gentleman from north carolina for his support i yield 2 minutes to

thank you for giving me the opportunity to submit a statement on this very important bill i stand in strong support of h r 4554 agriculture appropriations for fiscal year 1995 with my colleagues i would like to express my appreciation for all the hard work and time that members and their staff of both house and senate subcomidttees have put in to crafting a comprehensive and well thought out bill as the bil progressed through both the house and senate my attention lay with the treatment of funding for the american samoa food stamp programslightly modified to provide nutritional assistance only to the elderly blind and disabled persons i was pleased to see that this program gathered a lot of support especially when there was the possibility of underfunding i support the conference report in that future appropriations for this program should be funded under the proper food stamp account and not the discretionary account of food donations because of the unique nature of this program we can not afford to play with nutritional assistance appropriations especially to the needy i ask my colleagues to work with me on this and ensure that american samoas food stamp program is propery authorized in the 1995 farm bill let us apply equal treatment to this program as we have done to other nutrition assistance programs once again the combined efforts of key members andstaffers ensured that american samoas program would not be left in the cold i especially would like to thank the following people for their assistance in this matter representatives richard durbin joe skeen and staffer carol murphy senators j bennett"]]}
