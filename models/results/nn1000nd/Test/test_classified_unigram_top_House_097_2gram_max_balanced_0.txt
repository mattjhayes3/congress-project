house joint reso lution 220 proclaiming raoul wallenberg to be an honorary citizen of the united states and requesting the president to ascertain from the soviet union the whereabouts of raoul wallenberg and to secure his return to freedom raoul wallenbergs extraordinary record of saving the lives of countless thousands of jews during the holocaust at great personal risk and sacrifice amply justifies this nation conferringupon him its highest honor by proclaiming him an honorary citizen of the united states mr wallenberg undertook his perilous mission at the behest of the united states and the american war ref ugee board the passage of house joint resolution 220 will represent a ringing affirmation of americas commitment to the survival of the jewish people and our tremendous esteem for someone who risked his own life to try to save so many jewish lives from nazi extermination a number of bills have been introduced over the years to confer honorary citizenship on various persons but the only successful effort to date related to sir winston churchill the conferral of honorary citizenship on raoul wallenberg however will not establish a precedent for similar action on behalf of a number of other heroic figures the fact that our action today will not serve as such a precedent is clear for a number of reasons raoul wallenbergs valiant efforts to save thousands of jews from the holocaust provide an appropriate basis for distinguishing this bill from bills introduced on behalf of others conferral of honorary citizenship on wallenberg unlike any other honorary citizenship bill congress has considered heretofore will symbolize our commitment as a nation to remember the holocaust and vigilantly guard against the possibility of any recurrence congressman lan~os who introduced this joint resolution testified before the subcommittee on immigration refugees and international law thatwe need to establish a clear record for posterity that america through wallenberg did act to prevent the holocaust in its final days during the subcommittee hearings i requested congressman lirrros to develop this idea further and place mr wallenbergs actions in the context of other actions or even inaction by the united states to prevent the holocaust congressman lairros answer i believe should be brought to the attention of the house and for that reason i will quote from it at some length it is important to underscore that wallenberg was not a diplomat wallenberg was a young man living in the comfort and safety and affluence of neutral stockholm during the brutal closing days of world war 11 he left behind a most promising career as the son of swedens most prominent family the safety the security the comfort of stockholm to voluntarily assume the task of saving human lives so raoul wallenberg did not think of this mission himself this was not an activity that stemmed from his own plans it was a mission that he tundertook at the specific request of the secretary of state of the united states the united states thtrefoe bears a very heavy responsibility for the untold numbers of years that this young swede spent under the nightmarish conditions of the gulag archipelago whether he died earlier or whether he is alive today it is we the united states who are responsible for his tragedy and for his lost life a great deal of criticism has emerged over the course of years concerning the failure of the western powers to act in decisive ways to stop the slaughter questions such as why werent the railroads bombed why wasnt there an attempt to liberate the camps earlier here is a tangible demonstration that the united states officially acted and successfully acted to save approximately 100 000 people our record for world war ii is a better record because of the actions of raoul wallenberg undertaken at our own behest honorary citizenship is singularly appropriate in the wallenberg case not only because of the place the holocaust occupies in the history of human depravity and our national commitment to the survival of the jewish people the fact that wallenberg acted at the behest of the united states and suffered untold misery as a result of it establishes our interest as a nation in giving this special recognition to him the soviet union in addition never satisfactorily has accounted for what happened to mr wallenberg the conferral of honorary citizenship on him may give the united states added leverage with the soviet union in determining whether he is still alive and possibly in securing his release honorary citizenship is exactly what its designation impliesnamely an honor that does not confer on either mr wallenberg or any members of his family any rights or privileges under the immigration and nationality act the concept of honorary citizenship must be distingished clearly from citizenship itself no member of mr wallenbergs family as a result of our action today can possibly claim any derivative rights under our laws even mr wallenberg himself will not be recognized as an american citizen under united states domestic law or under international law if he is found to be still alive conferral of honorary citizenship in no way can be described as giving away anything tangible the meaning and significance of our action today is entirely symbolicbut it is a critically important symbolic gesture in an age when many nations treat human life so cavalierly a few of the statements in the legislative record underscore the critical significance of the step we are about to take today secretary of state alexander m haig jr said that mr wallenbergs contribution during the dark days or world war ii in hungary stands out as a beacon to all those who respect human rights and dignity he expressed his full support for this legislation assistant secretary of state richard fairbanks informed the judiciary committee thatthe conferral of honorary unitedstates citizenship on wallenberg would serve to underscore the seriousness with which the american government and people view sovietbehavior in the wallenberg case conferral of honorary unitedstates citizenship on wallenberg would also serve to reaffirm to the government of sweden that the united states firmly supports the quest to resolve wallenbergs fate former secretary of state edmund muskie informed two subcommittees of the house committee on foreign affairs that the chronological record of state department and war refugee cables and conmnunications 0 documents the unitedstates governments position of responsibility for the selection of wallenberg the directive and funding for his activities the appreciation for his work and the deep distress over his disappearance mr muskie concluded that its isthe uniqueness the extraordinary link between a man raoul wallenberg and our nations conscience that makes this action appropriate mr muskie went on to say raoul wallenbergs mission on behalf of the united states behind nazi lines in world war ii was without precedent what hie accomplished on our behalf risking his own life to save the lives of tens of thousands of people is unparalleled in our history the cost to him the years of his life can never be repaid the action of bestowing honorary citizenship on wallenberg undertaken by the congress of the united states will recognize his humanitarian sacrifice under our direction this is an important part of american history this adoption of raoul wallenberg as our own citizen makes clear to our posterity that the american government did act to save lives threatened by the holocaust i can add nothing further to the eloquent statements submitted by numerous witnesses before subcommittees of both the committee on foreign affairs and the committee on the

before us how big should the federal government be in the years aheadand who should we listen toas we make the decisionsas we set the budgetthat establishes the size and the growth rate for the federal government in thp years ahead it appears that the budget committee does not want to listen to president reagan the leader our country chose last november he wants to hold the federal

expressed themselves in favor of limiting the growth of the federal government well perhaps i can persuade my colleagues to listen to the voice of the future generation 19 years ago the federal budget was scarcely 100 billion who then would have believed that today the house budget co~mmittee would be seeking a 715 billion budget who would have been elected in support of such a budget 19 years hence well who today wants the budget in the year 2000 19 years away to surpass 2 860 billion if we allow the current budget committee proposal to pass and continue its level of growth even at what it calls these conservative levela then thats thh budget for the year 2000 2 860 billion i but if we adopt the presidents budget and escalate thi ough the year 2000 it the level of the 1982 proposal then the budget in the year 2000 will be less than half the federal budget woud become less than half if we allow the budget committee level to pass the question is clearly what will be the size of the

amendments very critical amendments that will seriously impact upon the ability of this nation to meet the threat which it faces i would like to touch upon a few facts which i think are pertinent as we consider this defense bill first of all i call your attention to the comment of leonid brezhnev when he was addressing the warsaw pact heads of government back in 1973 the heads of those warsaw pact nations who were meeting with him were concerned about his feelings about detente and so they were putting him on the spot so to speak about his support of detente his answer to them was this trust us comrades for by 1985 as a consequence of what we are now achieving with detente we will have achieved most of our objectives in western europe and the shift in the correlation of forces will be such that come 1985 we will be able to exert our will wherever we need to that was back in 1973 i would like to call your attention now to some statistics that back up exactly what mr brezhnev was saying the soviets have set their goals they have achieved their schedules to their stated end thus far let us look at some of the statistics pertinent to the point turning first to the icbm and slbms strategic launchers in 1965 the soviets had 331 strategic launchers against our 1 100 today they have 2 426 and we have 1 710 strategic launchers let us look at the soviet ballistic missiles and on the same pattern in 1965 they had 107 while the united states had 496 today we have 656 and they have 1 028 let us look at the statistics with reference to the intercontinental ballistic missiles in 1965 the soviets had 224 while the united states had 654 today we have 1 028 while the soviets have 1 398 what i am saying to you is that we have not put a new ballistic missile on line since 1965 we have not put a new launcher on line since 1965 while the soviets have continued to increase their strength look at the soviet armed forces manpower with reference to ours today we have roughly 2 1 million men in our military the soviets have a military manpower of 3 6plus million what about total strategic warheads in 1965 the soviets had 530 while we had 2 716 but look how the imbalance has changed now we have a total of 6 282 while the soviets have 9 139 look at the trends see what has been happening over this period of time let us turn to soviet tanks in 1970 the soviets had 20 450 tanks today they have 26 768 we would be hard put to put 7 000 total in the field anywhere everywhere in the world what about the expernditures on defense as compared to social services we hear a lot of conversation about the fact that we are spending so much more on defense in comparison to our expenditures on social services let me review the statistics in 1960 we were spending roughly 30 percent on defense and roughly 31 percent on social services i am talking about all levels of government state and federal we are now spending 14 8 percent on defense and 49 1 on social services i just wanted to bring some of those statistics to bear because it shows that we are not spending for defense at the cost of social services now if we are not to invite disaster we dare do nothing less

hear stories about individuals who are capable of working but are actually better off remaining on afdc and receiving medicaid and other federal public assistance funds this letter documents one of these appalling situations as you can see both the businessman and the public assistance recipient are at a disadvantage in order to keep the employee on staff full time the employer would have to increase the employees pay by at least 1 22 per hour this would just cover the expenses of the employee should he she remain on public assistance it would not provide any additional compensation for working the incentives in our public assistance system are clearly wrong we can no longer approach this problem by raising the minimum wage or decreasing public assistance payments the time has come for us to seriously address the issue of what we are trying to accomplish with public assistance if this means adjusting the system to provide baic support for the working poor in order to make it profitable for them to work and earn a living then we should consider legislative alternatives that encompass this idea it occurs to me that we could save a great deal of money by just helping those who are working and contributing to our economyhelping them to stay in the work force and off the rolls of the totally welfaredependent for the past two congresses we have worked to encourage small businesses to expand these same small businesses provide the majority of all newly created jobs in our country however if the businesses are going to survive they must be able to afford to pay staff the environment must be good for both employment and work the letter from my constituent which i am sharing with you makes this point very clear i hope that you find it as enlightening as i have congressman tom tauke house office building washington d c dear tom i write this letter out of concem for our social system as well as anger about the system for welfare benefits that prevail at this time the system seems to discourage working and very detrimental to work ethics which has made our land free i wish to give you an example of a current situation in my business employee three children under 18 unmarried with no child support she has worked for duchess cleaners for about 3 years starting at 3 per hour and now is receiving 4 05 per hour she recently informed me that she is better off if she quits working and draws food stamps adc free medical care and utility subsidy the figures are food stamps 218 adc 419 free medical and dental 196 cost of blue cross family plan and utility subsidy 20 for a total of 853 also she doesnt pay any social security no income tax or any expenses to receive the money in comparison if she works for us at 4 05 per hour for 40 hours per week her gross pay is 160 20 per week or 694 20 per month after taking off social security her take home pay is 648 since she gets 648 20 she is not eligible for free medical no adc only 96 in food stamps and the utility subsidy the end result is she would be receiving 764 versus 853 from the welfare benefits in order for me to compete against the social program i would need to pay her 5 27 per hour she says why should i go to work even at 5 27 per hour when i can stay home no travel expenses and still receive the equivalent of 5 27 so the government says that the minimum is 3 35how about 5 27 i think that someone needs to review the minimum standards for each class such as individuals and each increase in number of eligible children it is difficult to believe that a person is better off to stay at home than work in summary it appears to me that for a family of 4 the minimum standard wage is 10 965 per year for the adult of the family plus any amount of wages a child under 18 can secure as in this case the total family income is about 14 000 as a result of welfare benefits and the income her children receive not bad income for a family of four people it is very difficult to compete

the able leadership of its chairman the gentleman from wisconsin whom we will all miss himself a distinguished economist i understand there were hearings with john kenneth galbraith walter heller former labor secretaries ray marshall and willard wirts federal reserve chairman paul volcker and others something happened to the reuss proposal the one that would have reduced deficits by 0 5 billion the first year rising to 7 billion the third year on the way to the forum the longawaited eagerly anticipated jobs bill you have before you is not the one drafted with the aid of renowned economists or former labor secretaries as i said in full committee last friday the jobs proposal you have before you was drafted with a magnet every program with a nut or bolt within 5 miles has been drawn into this bill the road to economic recovery in this proposal is in the tracks of a bulldozer we passed a 5 billion highway bill the other day and we have 250 million more in highway funds in this bill there is no rhyme nor reason we do not even know whether the states can afford to match the additional 250 million in highway funds let alone use it this is not a carefully planned billit is a christmas tree excepting defense the nine biggest appropriations subcommittees have gotten their plums in this proposal and the branches of the poor christmas tree are breaking there is 50 million in here for a program called the sba national resources development grants i hikve served on the small business committee for 24 years and i have never heard of that program do you know what it is supposed to do provide treeplanting services christmas trees i am sure our auto industry is in trouble no problem we will put in 100 million for the government to buy car whether it needs them or not well buy 15 000 cars and with the 100 million create 2 000 jobs at a cost of 50 000 per job this is a replay of the surplus milk situation right now we have warehouses overflowing with surplus milk and chcese with this bill we will have garages overflowing with surplus cars these programs are fantasies but things really take a serious turn when you look at the energy and water section that is where you really see the plums plums like an additional 145 million on top of the 236 mllion increase in corps of engineers funding already in the regular energy and water bill that additional money will speed construction of projects like the red river waterway a 1 7 billion barge canal on one of the most siltladen and unstable watercourses in the country a project faulted by both the gao and the army auditing agency a project that duplicates rail service already in existence and if you look at the corps 05 million in operation funds you will see it is going for projects that include the tennessee tombigbee a project you may have thought you would have a separate vote on today if you look ever further beyond the report buried in the bill tinder the heading other productive activities you will find a section providing as follows appropriations for the yatesville lake construction project shall be made available for obligation in the amount designated for that project in title ii of h r 7145 that is an 8 million earmark as far as i can deter mine for a project that would have reduced the 200 million damage from the twin 197778 flood of the big sandy river by 5 000 that would have reduced the worst flood in history by 2 5 inches and that according to the corps of engineers will operate in the red for its entire 100 year economic life as a recreational facility the total cost for that project by the way is estimated at 200 million in case you are wondering how many jobs per dollar you are creating take a look at bureau of reclamation operation and maintenance where you will be spending 21 million to create 434 jobsa cost of 49 000 per job at 49 000 a job the next thing you know those 434 workers will think they work for the house of representatives in case you are wondering what kind of jobs you will be funding let me point you to page 46 of the report which states that flood control funds will be used for increasing the stockpile of materials for revetment work which would include the ordering of additional reinforcement and other materials for any unemployed stock clerk out there take heart this jobs bill is coming to the rescue or look a little further down on page 46 where bureau of reclamation funds will be used for archeological studies and boundary fencing another major step in the rebuilding of amerlea somewhere on the way to the forum this jobs bill got hijacked and soaked in a pork barrela poik barrel that could not make it through the regular funding process i might add and in case you are taken by the notion that this bill is meant to create jobs to help the immediate problem of our 10 8 percent unemployment rate look closely at the bill language take the 489 million for military housing construction money for instance that money is to remain available for obligation through september 30 19875 years from now by supporting title ii of this bill you will be getting a foot up on unemployment all right unemployment in 1987 and that pattern is repeated through the bill 500 million in transportation programsto remain available until expended 1 billion in community development block grant moneyto remain available until september 30 198 5 20 million for construction in the forest serviceto remain available until expended 200 million for rural water and waste disposal grantsto remain available until expended 100 million for watershed and flood prevention operationsto remain available until expended do not let yoursel be kidded these programs are not designed to prime the pump to get us out of our current crisis these programs are not designed to put people to work today they are not even necessarily designed to put people to work tomorrow these are programs that will put people to work whenever the agencies get around to spending it whether the pump needs priming or not and that may be years from now this bill is being used as a vehicle a vehicle to provide extra funds to a number of programs that could not get those funds any other way and a vehicle to provide funds for a lot of projects that never would get funded any other way what is more it is doing it by using the guise of jobs creation as a free pass free from the scrutiny of hearings free from the scrutiny of individual examination and authorization and free from scrutiny as to cost effectiveness this bill is a grab bag pure and simple when i finally saw this eagerly anticipated jobs bill and took a look at the proposal list of 5 6 billion in appropriations and 1 1 billion in other obligations i could not believe my eyes i said to myself we owe the american people a lot more than this the problems of unemployment and business bankruptices are far too serious to insult the people with this grab bag of goodies we are throwing money around in this proposal like it was going out of style but just throwing money around will not make sure this 6 7 billion is used wisely to put as many people to work as possible and until we can be sure i think it would be very wise to refrain as much as any person in this room i am in favor of jobs and i am in favor of responsible action to assist those most in need at this time of 10 8 percent unemploymenit but we will not do anyone a favor by enacting this bill in its current form including ourselves for that reason at the proper time i intend to offer a motion to recommit with instructions the purpose of which will be to strike title ii we will do far better to pass a clean continuing resolution than to go forward with title ii as it is now i urge you to support that motion after two weeks behind closed doors the majority leadership offers those 12 million americans a three point program first borrow 5 4 billion second buy a barrel of ripe pork and third hang it out as veto bait this is not a jobs bill but the opening shot in the 1984 election those 12 million unemployed deserve something better title ii should be stricken and i will offer a motion to recommit to do just that the house has had its chance and failed and we should let the senate start with a clean slate"], [0.00021541118621826172, 0.49978458881378174, 0, "i thank the

a singlepurpose direct pipeline from the treatment site to the reservations thus reducing the estimated cost of the settlement bill considerably the period of time allowed the city of tucson the papago tribe and the secretary to arrive at an agreement regardw reclaimed water delivery is changed from december 31 1982 to a date 1 year from date of enactmelft to allow more time for the negotiation the statute of limitations for actions relating to water rights is extended for a period of two years to permit the other papago reservation districts to explore resolution of those claims without resort to litigation a new section provides that in the event a federal entity is established to undertake arid land renewable resource projects the papago tribe is given a priority to participate in such venture the measure of damages in the event the water to which the tribe is entitled under the settlement agreement is not delivered is clarified and a study to examine possible solar energy alternatives is included these changes do not in my opinion make any serious substantive changes in the housepassed bill and in fact many of them clear the bill up a little i am proposing three additional amendments two of which are technical and clarifying first a mistaken date reference is corrected second it is made clear that the extension of the statute of limitations in section 11 is not intended to permit rejuvenation of the suits which will be dismissed by the papago tribes as part of the settlement agreement third the third amendment puts back in the provision of the

good bill no it does not give the administration everything it wants but it is our job to judge and it is our job to decide just where this na tions limited resources should be applied you know what this bill represents this bill is americas investment in humanity this bill is where we express out interest and our concern for our fellow man this bill is where we show we still care about those that need a helping hand this bill is where we call forth that early american spirit of extending ourselves to help others help themselves new englanders certainly have not forgotten their heritage of extending a helping hand when a farmers barn was burned the community gathered together to build a new one when the harsh winters threatened the very life of our grandfathers every individual sacrified their own comforts to help everyone pull through not only is this bill americas investment inhumanity it represents stock in americas future this nations future is based on an investment in our individual and collective health it is based on an investment in the education of our citizens our government our nation has always functioned most effectively when our citizens have been educated well informed and involved in their government this nations future is also based on the labors of its citizens this bill represents all of these qualities anol principlles it is americas investment in humanity sure you could indiscriminately cut this bill further so long as you showed no regard for humanity for instance some here would slash all student aid without regard for the fact that by drastically reducing student financial assistance they are pricing all but the children of wealthy persons out of higher and professional education sure we could cut another 50 million or 100 million out of maternal and child health programs by doing so however we would severely undermine the provision of any effective services to children with birth defects to the mentally retarded and to mothers who are clearly at risk of lifethreatening birth complications yes we could take 40 million out of venereal disease prevention programs and watch the rampant cupread of sexually transmitted diseases race even faster through our schoolaged children and we could eliminate further funding of biomedical research or disease prevention activities but where would we be today if we had never developed the electron microscope which has made it possible for medical science to untangle secrets that save thousands of lives every year where would we be as a nation of healthy caring people if we had never developed vaccines and we could go further and eliminate the remaining federal support for employment and training activioctober 8 1 981 october 6 1981 co ties we <could virtually close out ceta title 11 by taking another 1 billion there and in the process we would put more discouraged unemployed persons back on our city streets arnd we could take all the youth employment and training money and put another 1 million youths out of work for next summer i do not believe any among us want to be that irresponsible this bill is americats investment in humanity and we must not sell out the american people we have made lots of cuts we have produced a good package here let us give it our support and protect americas investment in humanity recommitting the bill would not be merely pulling back that helping hand americans have always been willing and eaiger to extend it would be chopping it off at the elbow we cannot allow that to happen let me just reemphasize that less than 4 weeks ago today our subcommittee marked up this bill the human needs of the american people were real at that time they are still very real today if those needs have changed at all they have increased yet here we stand threateningwe the peoples elected representatives threatening to turn away from those needs to shirk our responsibilities i urge my colleages to support this bill and defeat this motion the cuts are deep enough in these human areas let me just remind you that we have already cut 4 billion from ceta we have already cut maternal and child health alcohol drugabuse and mental health

greatest presidentsfranklin delano roosevelt this man who overcame the crippling effects of polio went on to lead our nation through its gravest domestic crisis and most severe international challenge in this century in each case he weathered the test in meeting these challenges he left as his legacy programs that define our presentday social and economic system and a style of leadership that is the test against which we measure the performance of our presidents today as we face a time of economic trial today it is helpful to look back to see how f d r met the grave economic challenge of his time and to see what lessons we can draw for ourselves today the programs enacted during the roosevelt administration are now so much a part of the fabric of our society that we tend to take the benefits of these programs for granted we assume they have always been there one way to appreciate the roosevelt legacy is to remember what it was like before f d r s new deal before f d r no federal program provided the elderly with any degree of security in their retirement years after f d r there was social security before f d r no ones savings deposits were secure after f d r the federal government insured savings accounts before f d r adequate regulation of the securities market did not exist after f d r the stock market was regulated to protect investors and the larger economy before f d r workers could be fired for union activity after f d r the workers right to organize into free trade unions was secured as joe alsop reminds us in his recent book on f d r the roosevelt legacy may be summed up by saying he included the excluded until roosevelt many of the economic and political benefits of this land were denied to those who were not rich not white and not of an anglosaxon protestant background f d r began the process still incomplete of including the previously excluded groups of americans into our society economy and politics roosevelts greatness lies not only in the programs he left us but also in the way he exercised leadership for many of us today the way that f d r exercised leadership still provides the model against which we evaluate contemporary presidents what were some of the keys to f d r s effective leadership one key to his leadership was that he was a master communicator f d r was effective in all settingslarge audiences as well as small groups he was particularly effective in the use of radio which was the most important means of communication in his time f d r also had a gift of explaining some very complex ideas and proposals in a way that was understandable to everyone another important element in his leadership was his emphasis on experimentation f d r was not a prisoner of any ideology he wanted results in order to achieve results he was open to ideas from just about any source if something did not work he would reject it and try something else f d r was also very effective in conveying a sense of optimism about the future but it is not enough just to convey optimism such optimism has to be credible i i many presidents who try to convey optimism are unconvincing roosevelts optimism however was believable people believed that things would actually get better they felt this way because they saw he actually had a program that was workable and was fair to everyone wlat useful lessons for today can we draw from the roosevelt years first we must not stray from the inclusionary principle laid down by f d r it is the right path it is the fairest it has brought unequaled benefits to the people of our nation but in following the path of f d r we must also remember his emphasis on experimentation and results we should continue his work but do it as he would have done itwith an openndss to new ideas and an emphasis on what works just like roosevelt we should not be blindly attached to policies of the past that have become outmoded our test should be what works conditions change problems are solved we should be willing to reassess policies in the light of changing conditions and if we decide that a policy is no longer appropriate it is not an admission that the policy was always wrong it is only an admission that it is not appropriate or useful under todays conditions to continue the work begun by f d r of including the previously excluded and to do so in the manner of f d r with an openness to new ideas and a willingness to discard policies that dont workthis is how we can best honor the memory of f d r e"]]}
