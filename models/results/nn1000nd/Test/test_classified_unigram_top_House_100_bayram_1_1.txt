said isnt it terrible that it has taken a plague like aids to bring open discussion of condoms and sexual education out of the closet what of course she means is the license the bunny theory perpetuated by that magazine as a matter of fact todays wall street journal says the hefner years have run their course not exaetly because whatever titillation there was in his particularly clever formula of the scrubbed 18yearold girl next door presented naked in his centerfolds and up to some very graphic pictures as of the last 4 or 5 years what it has been replaced by is a videocassette section of hardcore pornography in most in my experience of the video rental places when some family sees a pussycat disgusting hardcore theater roll up its carpet and close the doors they think well have we awakened in america no it is only because they have lost box office and this is all available in the local rental place i stopped frequenting one in my neighborhood because i saw a parentguardian renting hardcore homosexual videotapes and you could tell because they have a large jacket and graphic pictures on the cover and he was renting it and lie had in tow a 10yearold boy and a 13yearold girl and after we left the store i was angry at myself that i did not go tip and inquire are you their parent is this the standard you raise them by but like most americans i kind of shrank back and said oh let him wreck his life but he is wrecking those kids lives we are more graphic in lustful sex exploitation material in 1988 than we were last year or the year before twenty years or so of the sexual revolution has not run its course and one of the ironies i would like to point out to my good friends is that they even tried to use the war in vietnam to push this sexual permissiveness the main battle cry of the war and you can ask any page who was an infant or not even born then what is the most memorable expression that comes out the war and i will help them a little bit and say was it ho ho ho chi minh or hey lbj how many kids have you killed today and they will eventually say i know what it was make love not war of course whether it was woodstock where the young girls were running around naked and young guys that was not just making love we are talking about lust just happenstance encounters like dogs in an alley that make lust just having sex for the celebration of recreational sex in and of itself and then they try to play off against it instead of going off to war as if our young soldiers were over there enjoying the battle that was going on and the irony is as i pointed out earlier we are now seeing more people die at least in the homosexual community because of casual multiple contacts from the public latrines down to the massage parlors and the hot tubs and the clubs that the people hang out in all of these deviant lifestyles and more people are going to die because of lust in the 1980s than died during the decade of the vietnam war by far it was not just a casual little expression thrown out make lust not war it is coming back to haunt us in the worst way i do not believe this member does not believe that we have turned the corner that is why it is so important"], [9.250572475139052e-05, 9.250572475139052e-05, 0, "mr speaker i am pleased that the other body has recently joined the house in voting

europe to revolt and we told them for months that under a 5star general and a pretty good president ike eisenhower everything cut loose that month the suez canal was going on britain and france and israel fighting the egyptians and eisenhower had a mild heart attack everything kind of went to heck eisenhowers vice president richard nixon was at the bridge watching the people come across as in

michigan our senior man on foreign affairs they were here mo udall missed being here by 13 days that is the cutoff point he won a special election 13 days later but those 21 must have sat here and the

us t33 jets which had been turned into p80 shooting star fighters because they put the 455caliber machine guns back in the nose our intelligence did not see that even with the best satellites you cannot see what is happening in hangars they were strafing the beach and they had tanks on the bluffs they were raking thesepeople in the crossfire so the beach commander the enrique bermudez of that operation who miraculously survives to this day to tell this horrible story is up to his knees in the surf and he is saying command that is the united states command this is pepe we are in the surf we are engaging in handtohand combat where is the promised air cover my men are being slaughtered do not let us die like dogs in the water give us the air cover where is the air cover and the dilettante

rifle that he and some friends had been dealing with in a wealthy home in the chicago area as young lads they were doing the manual of arms with it and a little 13yearold girl a family friend appeared in the doorway and he inexplicablynobody could figure out kids do strange thingshe picked up the rifle and fired at the young girl and struck her between the eyes killing her dead on the spot without being an amateur psychiatrist people have analyzed for years that that incident which haunted his life a few weeks later as though she were still alive the little girl as though she were still alive in the letters that were found with no mention that he had killed her accidentally a few weeks before some people say that is why he was never able to come to a decision but he was in the u n and called up president kennedy and said how can you embarrass me with this incident he had been clued in on the intelligence operation of trying to liberate the cubans from 30 years of horrors and aids the aids epidemic that they brought back from central africa the killing of black young men and women freedom fighters that they are doingengaged in right now with soviet officers in angola right now that summer offensive is still trailing off with the forces of freedom probably going to win that one or at least fight to a standstill until the next dry season when the soviets will put in more armor more migs and more commanders down to the company and battalion level but with this order of adlai stevenson telling kennedy call off the air cover or i will quit kennedy supposedly a naval officer and a man of action in the south pacific called off the air cover those men were slaughtered i guess the only answer was pepe swim for it baby i do not know how you say that in spanish they started to swim out some of our young coast guardsmen navy men who were driving those landing ships the oldfashioned open type like at tarawa iwo jima with the falp in the front where you hear the bullets hittling tile flap and you are on the other side right before it does down and worrying about whether a bullet is going to catch you in the face some of those men came into the beach and circled under firewe lost some of thoseand tile men that survived that sinking got out and made it to other landing barges and they went out to the coast now what was classified top secret until recently is the unitedstates aircraft carrieri asked tom moorer in our republican study committee hearings if this was all true because he was then commander of the joint chiefs of staff from 1972no he was in a naval assignment he was commander in the pacific later in the seventies he became the chairman of the joint chiefs i said was not the unitedstatess essex not off the coast with the promised air cover he said yes i said did they not have the navy version of the f86 sabres called the fk fury on the decks ready loaded with bombs and bullets to give help to those men on tile beaches yes he said and i said were those planes spraypainted with the american insignias off as though they would be part of this strange covert operation of these mysterious unmarked you know americanprofile jet fighters shooting down the two t33s and buzzing the beach and he said yes absolutely what is also not known by most people in this or the other body is that the alabama national guard played a role in that because they were then flying obsolete b26 dodglas invader bombers they took them off active duty you know you put the resignation down in the bottom drawer of the squadron commander they went to nicaragua and appeared hence this obsession of castro to crush nicaragua and make it communist someday out of nicaragua a long 6 7hour flight to the combat zone these men from the alabama guard flew these older b26s they were to hit and take out the cuban air force on the evening of april 16 to set up the invasion the next day on the 17th they were sharpthey pulled off that raid and they did not catch these t33s with the guns in them making them shooting star fighters then the next day they came back the t33s shot down the alabama guard b26s one of the commanders one of the pilots a colorful character known all through the guard squadrons of the united states at that time because he weighed over 250 pounds was named riley shamberger you could not miss his portly body his body his corpse laid there in the wreckage of his b26 castro went over and put his foot on captain riley shambergers corpse and bragged about his t33s had shot down the one little effort of our air power used on the eve of this bay of pigs tragedy in our history and kennedy said he will never again believe anybody in government he got his answer quickly the next year with the missile crisis of october when nucleartipped missiles were in cuba what is the lesson we ought to learn from that here is the advice and i solicit please your comments what i would have done had i been president kennedy was i would have said look the men are getting slaughtered and if we are not going to give them air cover to try and make a successful beachhead and see if the people will get rid of this communist castro who betrayed his revolution as did he and his brother and the ortega brothers have we must at least give air cover to the rescue operation lets startlets call it a failure and lets extract these cuban lads that we put on the beach the 2506 brigade i will never forget president kennedy in the orange bowl holding up the flag which the survivors begged for years and finally got back from senator ted kennedy and kennedy held up that flag and said someday this banner will fly again over a free cuba holding up the banner that they rescued off the beach in the last terrible moments when we deserted them if i had been president kennedy i would have said extract them give them cover and try to save as many lives as we can because i have decided not to give air cover to the military operation you and i mr burton flew in honduran jets last september september 5 we flew in those little casa 101s one of them had a c47 painted on the side where they had shot down a drug airplane we saw the morale of those pilots the commander navarro who i flew with you flew with one of the young squadron commanders what the gentleman did not see and what i saw on a subsequent trip up at la ceiba on the coast were the ones flying the israeli super mysteres the very planes that turned back the arab attempt to annihilate israel in the lighting war of 1967 those young pilots when i went and walked in if i squinted i would not have told them from americans or british or fighter pilots anywhere in the world those young guys are straining at the bit tonight as we speak to take the few viable super mysteres that are left and go down to that nicaraguan border never penetrate their airspace just defend the sovereign soil of honduras and shoot those an26s and mi17s out of the air and the only reason they are probably not going down there is because president azcona whom we met with the next night and told him of our flying with his great young pilots in the honduran air force is wondering if we are going to follow through are we going to do to honduras what we did to thailand and malaysia pull out of this whole mess and stare down the barrel of this hemisphere and watch the consolidation of another communist country and then duartes fragile democracy begin to unravel as the farabundo marti continue their newly returned urban terror what are we going to do i suggest the least the president can do and i am telling him this through tile television in front of the american people who track this house the very least we should do is unleash the honduran fighter pilots many of them trained in this country their planes reworked up here in texas to keep them flyable these 25yearold frenchbuilt mysteres if we will not unleash them and not get them involved but just back them up that we will protect for example their bases at palmerola and la ceiba if we will not do that much then i think we owe it to ricky bermudez who stood in that hallway when i asked george miller of california to conic out and at least meet the military commander and he says i am not going to meet with any of your thugs dornan we owe it to bcrmudez and his men to maybe violate their airspace not to prosecute with some military operation but to do the minimum that kennedy failed to do and that is to give cover even if it is with our navy airplanes introducing combat americans only in a rescue operation to tell these hondurans lets get out of it we are getting the men out we are getting the nicaraguan kids out of there we are going to give them cover and extract them in amnerciful rescue operation and there would not be ally shooting if we told ortega you win this round you commie you communist you but you had better back off and let us get these kids out of there that we put in there and we will bring them to the united states hopefully to settle them at fort worth in your district jim waights district now what do you think mr burton of at least a rescue

bipartisan centuries ago my friends there were people called alchemists who through incantations and formulas tried to change base metal into gold what you have here is an effort at political alchemy whereby with the magic formula of negotiation you are going to change base communists into golden liberal democrats what a glorious time this is may i say to hand over nicaragua to the communists with colombia near chaos being controlled by a cocaine cartel with panama overwhelmed by corruption and a 400mile trip from nicaragua to the canal and you hand over nicaragua to the communists chaos

but my friends you have got to understand that many of the most fervent advocates of the speakers plan before us are indiffernt to the takeover of nicaragua by the communists they do not see that as a problem at all all you have to do is to read the democratic study groups letter that they sent to the peace groups where it says and i quote like the refusal to provide more military aid these provisions send a strong message to the contras that our support for their war is over the sooner the contras understand that fact the sooner the fighting will end and the sooner we can begin addressing the real problems of central america of poverty maldistribution of wealth well poverty is a problem communism is not going to fix that maldistribution of wealth is a problem marxism has never fixed that anywhere in this globe but what about a soviet base on the land bridge between texas and the canal that is a matter of blithe indifference to the people pushing this plan at least they do not advert to it in their letter so i just ask them doesnt a soviet base in our hemisphere in addition to cuba bother you it bothers me now the speakers plan achieves the supreme goal of every communist government unilateral disarmament of the resistance meanwhile the sandino communists are arming to the teeth my friends we have had 70 years of experience with the communists with the soviet union do we not learn anything refusal to learn from history goes beyond invincible ignorance i think it approaches what is called congnitive dissonance the refusal to see reality when it bites you in the neck that is precisely what the speakers plan does it is a manipulative cellophane fig leaf it is a search for the lowest common denominator on the left to avoid responsibility for losing nicaragua my friends it takes away much more than it gives it gives a token of beans and bandages and blankets that are undeliverable you cannot deliver them there is no mule train going to carry them into nicaragua you have got to fly them in but if you fly them in you had better have antiradar jamming equipment because the sandinistas have soviet radar and they are not going to let you feed and

resolution i am particularly grateful for the excellent work of the distinguished chairperson or the military personnel and compensation subcommittee mrs byron for her leadership in shepherding legislalion i introduced earlier this year h r 3975 which directs the secretary of defense to establish a permanent rental housing program involving military personnel and their civilian landlords this program will remove perhaps the largest financial burden on our military families this legislation will make permanent the pilot program which has been in effect at fort ord over the last 15 months the program has been implemented with a high degree of success resulting in the solution of problems with military residents with respect to payment and landlords obtaining guarantees on security deposit payments although the senate defense authorization measure did not contain a similar provision h r 4264s housing lease indemnity program was adopted by the senate with two amendments i support both amendments the first amendment clarifies the due process provlsions of the program regarding each participating service members obligation before reducing that members pay for breach of the lease or damage to the rental unit and the other amendment outlines the extension of this program to our service members overseas i would like to take a few minutes to describe what this legislation will do first of all it authorizes the secretary of defense to make the program permanent each military service would then have the option of whether and at which inst llations to institute participation in this program in the united states second civilian landlords who rent to military personnel would agree to waive security deposits when renting housing units to military personnel for the guarantee of rental deposit security from the military in return the military post would agree that if for any reason the service member leaves without making final payments for rent or damage the post would make such final payments these payments could not exceed the amount of an ordinarily required security deposit any outlays of the military post would then be deducted from the service members paycheck for example a service member wants to rent an apartment for 500 per month under this legislation the landlord would agree to accept only a first months rent without any required security deposit or last months rent right away we are saving the service member up to 1 000 if the service member if transferred to another post or is assigned to onpost housing and leaves his apartment without paying his last months rent the post to which he is assigned would meet the last months rent payment of 500 this 500 would then be deducted from the service members paycheck all of my colleagues are aware of the tremendous financial and emotional pressures inflicted on our military personnel and their families this already tense situation is made even worse during a permanent change of station move travel and relocation expenses come out of the pockets of our servicemen and women reimbursement comes later although in the past only 1 out of 4 spent on a pcs move has been reimbursed according to an air force study and when the military families arrive in a new location they must meet the immediate costs of security deposits first and last months rent utility deposits and more before you can even blink a military family can be thousands of dollars in debt and 2 years later the entire process is repeated it is important to note that no appropriation of funds is necessary because the service member would be ultimately responsible for meeting the costs of any damage or breach of lease i know that the landlords on the monterey peninsula have benefited from the pilot program the favorable comments from the civilian landlords show that the vacancy rate has dropped considerably in their particular apartment complexes since participating in the program also a housing referral office representative available when requested during moveout inspections provided the verification necessary to resolve any disputes or misunderstandings that arose at that time they realize the hardships imposed on the military family and they understand the progam guarantees payment for damages and breach of lease up to the amount of the usual security deposit this program gives landlords one point of contact for all their military tenants and a source of information regarding military personnel who may soon be transferred thus enabling landlords to prepare for a change in the lease soldiers have been very happy with the program because without it they could not afford a place to live and would therefore be forced to live apart from their families until onpost housing became available the program has also kept soldiers from getting into serious financial difficulties which is often associated with a pcs move this program should solve one of the major problems facing our military personnel and do away with certainly one of their largest financial burdens what is more no one loses in this program everyone wins landlords are guaranteed payment our military personnel are able to use their hardearned dollars for necessities and the services are guaranteed reimbursement for any outlays to landlords when the house voted in the 99th congress to accept many proposals to ease the burdens on our military personnel servicemen and women all over the world breathed a sigh of relief now this legislation will resolve one of the most pressing and financially

the real dangers of the proposal to reflag kuwaiti oil tankersthe threat of iranian terrorism mines or other bloodletting that would not leave any persian fingerprints in the blood today i would like to continue this series of speeches on the persian gulf by talking about another dangerthe worst case scenario its easy to imagine what the worst case is its simply that we get sucked into the maelstrom of the iraniraq war and end up as a participant rather than an innocent bystander it may be a little harder however to conceive of how we would be sucked into that war let me outline just how that could come about but to begin we need a little background to understand how the worst could occur first one must understand that there are two facets to the irantlraq warthe ground war and the tanker war in the ground war the iranians are on top they are not winning in the sense that they have the iraqis on the ropes but they do have the iraqis on the defensiveand baghdad has no way of changing that because it is unwilling to risk the huge number of casualties that would result if it went onto the offensivean offensive that might take thousands of square miles of iranian territory but which still would not have any assurance of knocking iran out of the war in the tanker war on the other hand it is iraq that is on top and has iran on the defensive the point of the tanker war is economicpure and simple iran depends on oil exports for 95 percent of its foreign exchange earnings and 100 percent of its oil exports must go by tanker through the persian gulf if taq can shut dbwn alit or mosti ortbhrans oil iexports it can shut down irans economy and i make it impossible for iran to sustain the war i efforv indefinitely curiously baghdad has nor pressed its tanker blitz to that conclusion for years its soviettrained pilots made only sporadic strikes at kharg island the terminal for 90 percent of irans oil exports they would fly at altitudes measured in miles rather than feet and make ineffective strikes then about 2 years ago pilots trained in france began graduating and returning home to pilot newly bought mirage f1 jets they were a different breed last summer baghadad began a concerted campaign against tankers against kharg and against the temporary leading terminals that iran tried to paste together when kharg started taking a serious battering iran suffered a dramatic production drop from an average of almost 2 3 million barrels a day in the first half of 1986 iranian oil production fellto an average of 1 3 million barrels a day last august september and october since lranconsumes from 600 000 to 700 000 barrels a day of its own production that meant iranian oil exportsand hence iranian foreign exchange earningswere more than halved exports dropped from about 1 6 million barrels a day to about 0 6 million that was all as a result of the intense iraqi air campaign but that campaign ended in november iranian production rose again and it has now retumed to 2 3 million barrels a day why did baghdad halt what was a very successful air campaign no one knows for certain but there is a strong suspicion that baghdads alliesalong the south shore of the persian gulf greatly feared one thing that an iran battered badly by iraqs economic offensive would strike harshly at the handiestand weakesttargets which are baghdads allies along the south shore of the persian gulf the only realistic way for baghdad to bring this war to an end on anything approaching satisfactory conditions for itself is to cut irans oily umbilical cord tehrans response has been to vocalize one fundamental foreign policy repeatedly the persian gulf and the strait of hormuz will be open and available to all or to none in other words if you allow our throat to be cut we will cutyour throat baghdad will be free to prosecute the air war to a successful conclusion only if the arab states of the persian gulf dont have to worry about an interruption of their commerce that could happen if arab shipping in the gulf were for example protected by the superpowers if say the united states or the soviet union were to protect all that shipping the arab states might no longer feel a need to restrain baghdad and baghdad would feel free to push the air attacks on kharg island and iranian shipping to a crisis point at that point who knows what would happen all bets are off about iranianm rationality it could sue for peace it could strike out against us in the persian gulf it could suffer another revolution promoted by economic chaos from baghdads position none of those outcome is bad from our standpoint one of those outcomes is obviously very bad e15436 june 2 1 987 co so ft worst case scenario of our involvement in the persian gulf reflagging is that we serve as a shield for the gulf states behind which the iraqis are free to fight the war they can winand that as a result iran is pushed to the wall and responds by striking out at us repeatedly dragging us into the war this shield scenario is a possible outcome though by no means a certain outcome but american policymakers need to think through the foreign policy chess match to logical conclusions and not just play it one move at a time which is a proscription for being on the receiving end of a checkmate incidentally the analogy is appropriate checkmate is generally believed to be a corruption of a persian term shah mord meaning the king is dead the iranians would certainly love to checkmate us now let me emphasize that there is more than one way for the chess match to play out the shield gambit doesnt necessarily come into play if we protect only 11 of the tankers plying the gulf tehran can still strike at many other vesselspanamanian greek cypriot et ceterathat call at kuwaiti oil terminals tehran is also free to hit ships of many flags that call at the ports in the other arab states along the persian gulf however defense secretary caspar weinberger spoke to a news conference and later to the house armed services committee about the possibility of protecting all neutral shipping in the persian gulf which indicates that the administration failed to work through all the moves in the chess games before it approved the reflagging plan i have also been told that the adminsitration spoke to kuwait and offered to protect all kuwaiti shipping it was the kuwaitis who said they were only interested in reflagging 11 of their 22 tankers after considerable confusion and toingandfroing the administration finally appears to have recognized the shield problem the very first sentence of last weeks defense department report to congress on security arrangements in the persian gulf addresses that issue protecting 11 kuwati ships under the unitedstates flag is not part of an openended unilateral american commitment to defend all nonbelligerent shipping in the persian gulf the fact that this is the opening sentence of a 35page report indicates the importance the administration now realizes it must attach to limiting this program it also shows how the administration trapped intself in its own rhetoric officially the administration argues that the reflagging is part of an effort to a guarantee freedom of navigation in the persian gulf and b protect the flow of oil guarding 11 of the hundreds of vessels that ply the waters of the persian gulf helps those 11 tankers but does very little for the grander concepts of guaranteeing freedom of navigation and protecting the flow of oil those two arguments drive one logically to a policy of providing protection for all neutral shipping in the persian gulfwhich is how secretary weinberger found himself offering total protection which in turn meant providing a shield behind which iraq could beat iran into submission by changing tune as the administration has now done we avoid becoming a de facto ally of baghdad by providing that military shield but the fact that the administration had to change its tune also indicates that the administration had not thought through its policy before it started enunciating it mind you this is not a case where time pressures forced an administration to patch together a policy in days the administrations own chronology shows that kuwait formally informed the unitedstates embassy in kuwait of its interest in reflagging on december 23 1986 two months later in the first week of march the president approved an interagency recommendation to protect the kuwait tankers three months later secretary weinberger was speaking of protecting all neutral shipping in the gulf so the policy is not to confine all escort service to 11 kuwaiti tankers reflagged ameri can what happens next as i noted in the first speech in this series last wednesday the likelihood of a direct iranian attack on a ship flying the american flag is remote one thing the iranians might domight be doing is to drop mines in channels plied by unitedstates flag vessels since may 17 four ships have struck mines all have been in the channel leading to kuwaits main oil terminal mina alahmadi where our escort will have ended this raises the prospect that we will safely escort a ship for 600 miles wave it goodbye turn around and sail off only to hear a loud boom behind us we would look rather silly this highlights two points first we must consider not only the possibility of loss of life but also of getting egg all over our face and second the government of kuwait has a definite role here in providing at absolute minimum protection for shipping in its territorial waters kuwait is perfectly capable of doing that it has four dozen patrol craft in its navy plus six fast attack missile boats carryingof all thingsexocet missiles one of these 255ton ships bears the unfortunate name alboom miningor dropping the occasional mine in a shipping channelis one tactic the iranians may already be pursuing a second possibility is that they will simply attack ships flying flags other than the stars and stripes eleven tankers will be safe but hundreds of others will be subject to attackand may in fact have suddenly become more inviting targets what do we do if all around the gulf other shipping is being attacked by the iranians the opinion will quickly evolve that our reflagging of kuwati vessels has made the gulf much less safe for all but 11 ships what do we do has the administration thought through this chess gambit are we going to ignore this development if we really believe in freedom of navigation and the free flow of oil dont we have to do something to help out the other countries four of whichall but saudi arabiaare even smaller in population than kuwait if we do help we risk building a shield for iraq incrementally if we dont act we look a bit silty guarding 11 tankers while others burn around us in sum the administration didnt really think through this reflagging policy before adopting it it leaped before it looked the remarks of the defense secretary reflect a failure to understand the implications of providing a shield for baghdads war on iranian tankers and there is no indication that the administration has thought through what it will do if iran responds in a very logical fashion by turning its guns on ships other than the protected 11"], [0.9955251379869878, 0.004474862013012171,

congress the dairy industry got the whole herd buyout program when it accepted the prospect of a reduction in the support price level if purchases of surplus products remained high after the buyout the levels of surplus are still unacceptably high congress should not now turnaround and tell the cattle industry and others that a deal made last year is null and void now section 662 is a poorly conceived solution to whatever problem is perceived because of casein imports certainly decisions about agriculture price supports should be made in agriculture legislation not hidden behind the pretense of trade and with the uruguay gatt negotiation coming up shortly the relationship between casein and the ills of the dairy industry can certainly better be addressed at that time but trade is not at the heart of this issue the issue is the anxiety in the dairy industry about being weaned even slightly from their price supports i understand that anxiety but the evidence is clear the supports as constructed are insensitive to market constraints they are damaging to the consumer as well as related industries and they result in massive over supplies of dairy commodities the plan outlined in the farm bill was designed to reduce the dairy surplus in the most sensitive way possible but the problems are real and real solutions are what is needed not delays or evasions it may be a bitter pill for them to swallowbut sometimes whats good for us doesnt always taste so good it would be impossible to construct an argument to say that the 50cent reduction in price supports could do any serious harm to the industry if we dont stick with the farm bill agreement and lower price supports then its possible that another supply adjustment program will be needed that is the worst possible answer to surplus commodity problems the pain of price support cuts to industry pales in comparison to the pain experienced by other industries as a result of the buyout according to the farm bureau the supply and demand imbalance is improving as a result of the buyout program this is therefore the worst time for congress to send the false signal to dairy producers to increase production

lake tobesofkee recreation area the lake is about 1 700 acres in size there are approximately 345 private residences around the shoreline bibb county had two purposes in mind when it built the lake first as a soil conservation measure and flood control second for recreation bibb county has constructed beaches pavilions and has licensed a marina a restaurant a water slide camping areas and other facilities the total cost of the project was approximately 5 7 million 1luch of the funding for the project came from a grant from the soil conservation service and a loan from the farmers home administration on which there remains a considerable balance while intended as a selfliquidating project the lake has never lived up to fiscal expectations and bibb county has annually subsidized its operations out of general funds previously when a license application was filed for lake tobesofkce bibbs county took the defensive action of filing for its own license to retain control over any project constructed however the countys license has expired this turn of events has again left the lake and recreational area vulnerable to an application by a licensee now a private entity could obtain a license construct a hydroelectric facility and raise and lower the lake levels at its discretion such action would in all probability adversely affect the aesthetic properties of the lake the

would reverse the decision which was made in 1974 to transfer jurisdiction over civil aviation from the committee on energy and commerce to the committee on public works and transportation this proposal for a change in jurisdiction over airline advertising is based on the widespread public concern over the recent deterioration in airline service the committee on public works and

the air traffic control system and improve our airports with this increased capacity there should be reductions in the delays and missed connections which have plagued the airlines in recent years earlier this week the house passed by voice vote our committees consumer protection legislation for airline passengers this legislation takes a variety of steps to improve airline service including monthly reports on airline service a prohibition on the cancellation of scheduled flights for any reason other than safety compensation to passengers for lost or delayed baggage a requirement that the department of transportation establish and enforce capacity limits at the nations 41 largest airports a requirement that the department of transportation establish and enforce performance standards for connections at airline hubs and a requirement that the airlines and the department of transportation establish tollfree telephone lines for consumer complaints i strongly believe that these two

february 5 1986 that one of the saddest aspects of the washington scene in recent years has been the failure of federal agencies to enforce the law a good example of this is the backlash arising from the federal trade commissions relaxed approach to advertising abuses state and private litigants have moved into the enforcement void because the enforcement breakdown in washington cannot and will not quell the publics demand for action to restrict abuse since the ftc has not been fulfilling its responsibilities for other industries the agency cannot be expected to vigorously regulate airline advertising indeed a recent press release indicates that ftc has already made up its mind that there is no need for strong regulation of airline advertising in the release ftc is quoted as opposing airline advertising guidelines proposed by the national association of attorneys general on the grounds that the proposed guidelines would bury consumers in disclosure these comments suggest that ftc would be less than vigorous in regulating airline advertising even if ftc would regulate airline advertising effectively it would be impractical to give ftc this authority the department of transportation authoritys over consumer deception is only one part of a comprehensive regulatory scheme for aviation administered by the department this system cannot be divided without impairing its overall effectiveness for example when dot regulates airline advertising dot must be certain that the regulations do not adoctoblr 7 1987 versely affect safety for which dot is also responsible if dot establishes rules requiring airlines to meet their advertised schedule times dot must be certain that these regulations do not place undue pressure on the airlines to operate flights in unsafe conditions similarly dots regulation of advertising for airline charters is part of a comprehensive regulatory scheme under which dot also regulates the authority of charter operators to change itineraries the rights of passenagers to obtain refunds and the obligation of rcharter operators to maintain escrow accounts and performance bonds to ensure that sufficient funds are available for refunds advertising cannot be separated out of this regulatory system without creating confuson and less protection for consumers the need to have a single agency regulate all aspects of aviation has been fully recognized by the office of management and budget and the department of transportation fon october 5 omb issued a statement of policy that it would recommend a veto of h r 2897 unless it was amended to delete title ii in ombs words title li would inappropriately fragment regulation of air carriers advertising and consumer protection between the department of transportation and the ftc the department of transportation has taken a similar position in a letter of october 6 opposing h r 2897 the problem of fragmented responsibility was the main reason the fcongress decided in the civil aeronautics board sunset actof 1984 that authority over unfair and deceptive practices should be exercised by the department of transportation rather than a federal trade commission in conclusion the bill reported by the committee on energy and commerce would make major changes in a comprehensive regulatory system which congress specifically refused to change only 3 years ago because the energy and commerce committee bill would make major changes in the regulatory system governing civil aviation the bill was sequentially referred to the committee on public works and transportation we reported the bill with an amendment to delete title h the title transferring jurisdicition over airline advertising and deceptive practices from dot to ftc when the bill is open for amendment i will be offering an amendment 0to support the recommendations of the committee on public works and transportation to delete title ii from the bill"], [0.0043204426765441895, 0.5043204426765442, 1, "i am pleased to join my colleagues in this years freshman class in this special order to discuss the federal budget for fiscal year 1988 the most pressing domestic economic issue before this congress is how to deal with the federal budget deficit everyone agrees the deficit must be reduced but there is widespread disagreement over how much it should be reduced or how quickly or by what combination of spending cuts and revenue increases the magic words in the budget debate are still grammrudman the institutional crisis we face is the result of the rigid timetables and goals that were set in that legislation grammrudman specified that the budget for fiscal year 1988 contain a deficit of no more than 108 billion the target was questionable at the time it was adopted events since passage of the legislation have proved it totally unreasonable the premise of grammrudman was that the deficit for fiscal year 1986 would be in the range of 180 billion and that by annual reductions of 36 billion the budget could be balanced in 5 years unfortunately the actual deficit for 1986 turned out to be 221 billion or 41 billion higher than anticipated congress succeeded in 1987 in reducing the deficit considerably in fact from 1986 to 1987 the deficit declined by more than the 36 billion yearly installment required by the law the congressional budget office projects that the deficit for this year will be approximately 176 billion or 45 billion lower than the previous year while that represents progress it also falls well short of the deficit target for fiscal year 1987 we were supposed to be coming out of 1987 with a deficit of 144 billion if youre starting at 144 billion a deficit of 108 billion is achievable but if youre starting as we are from a deficit of 176 billion the spending cuts or tax increases needed to get to 108 billion could be devastating to our economy what should we do this year administration officials stand there in their glass houses throwing stones at the congress accusing us of contemplating a crime they have already committed the administrations budget claims to achieve the grammrudman target for 1988 in fact it misses by 26 8 billion the rest of the savings they claim are a hodgepodge of rosy economic forecasts and smokeandmirrors budgeting the challenge we face is not to prove that we can reach some arbitrary target deficit reduction is a good thing but you can have too much of a good thing congress this year must prove we can adhere to the underlying principles of grammrudman without committing ourselves to a course that could prove destructive for the economy i would favor an approach which would make grammrudman targets economically meaningful by tying deficit reduction targets to certain economic indicators we can avoid the mistake of adopting deep spending cuts or revenue increases in a weakened economy the 60 billion we would need to cut this year to hit the grammrudman target would represent a cut of 1 5 percent of gnp instead of blindly adhering to arbitrary deficit targets it would make more sense to tie deficit reduction requirements to the unemployment rate or the rate of growth in the gnp the deficit question is too important to put on automatic pilot it demands careful reasoned action by an informed responsible congress by holding this special order we are saying the freshman class is prepared to take that action we know the choices will be tough i thank the gentleman for yielding"], [0.005472362041473389, 0.4945276379585266, 0, "i do not know whether i can do any better than that when the sdi program

be agreed to in my estimation it is not controversial and i think many members of the congress will want to support it my amendment simply clarifies in statutory language our committee intent with respect to advocacy activities authorized by this legislation there is obviously a need for state and area agencies to conduct studies and to make reports to determine the effectiveness of many of the programs for older americans i support the expanded advocacy provisions in h r 1451 and i expect that they will result in more rational and helpful policies i am concerned however that the advocacy language is so broad that it may result in the public financing of political lobbying activities no restriction whatsoever is placed on state and area agencies as they represent the interests of older americans and recommend program changes there is nothing in the bill to prevent these agencies from attempting to influence the outcome of elections pay the expenses of political organizations or lobby or against specific pieces of legislation clearly this is not what we intend to use tax money for the committee has acknowledged these concerns in its report and my amendment will simply place a provision in the statute prohibiting funds in this act from being used for political purposes or for political lobbying i understand there will be some opposition to the amendment in part on the basis that there is in the committee report good language that speaks to this issue language that i agree with and language that i would like to codify with this amendment however there is a difference between having it in the law and having it in the committee report the fact is there are people in state and area agencies that will use if unbridled federal funds to advocate political purposes the election of candidates or political issues i would not want to bring somebody to court and suggest that they are guilty of having violated report language if we put this amendment in the law and then support it with the report language it will be clear to everyone what is legitimate necessary and responsible advocacy that we would hope to have for our older americans and what is blatant political

on haiti i joined my colleagues last week in strongly condemning the violence occurring over recent weeks in haiti and the government of haitis inability to control that violence as well as the governments decision to cancel the presidential elections called for in the march 1987 constitution i continue to believe it is essential that we demonstrate strong bipartisan support for promoting a peaceful orderly transition to democracy in haiti the administration responded promptly and appropriately in cutting off all but humanitarian assistance to the government of haiti and i believe that decision was appropriate the perfecting language in this amendment provides the president with a whole range of options where he already has authority or clarifies his authority in bringing pressure to bear on the government of haiti to fulfill its obligations to the haitian people it must be made clear to the government of general namphy that the united states is prepared to cooperate with our allies in the region and to consider all possible alternatives to encourage a prompt and peaceful reinstatement of the electoral process it is imperative that we give our president the backing and the flexibility to carry out the diplomatic initiatives necessary to influence positively events in the caribbean we must support the haitian people so that they can live without fear and can reach the goils of economic development and personal security under a democratic government the language of this amendment reflects appropriately the sentiment of the house and i believe it also reflects the attitude of the administration we should give it our strong bipartisan support i commend the gentleman from washington for his initiative in the first place and the gentleman from florida for his efforts to focus attention on this urgent issue i urge my colleagues to vote for this perfecting amendment i rise in support of my amendment a comprehensive program of economic policy recomnmendations

allotted time as a matter of fact under the rules and privileges of the house i could have arisen on a plea of personal privilege during this past week to address the subject matter that impels me to speak today since it has to do with an occurrence back home last december 4 which was widely publicized covered throughout the country through the wire services and even internationally it has to do with a fray as such if we want to call it that i call it a confrontation i call it a standing up for the honor of ones name and the office which i happen to be occupying at this moment as a result of the full universal manhood suffrage of theconstituency of the 20th congressional district from the state of texas i want to say that i have felt impelled to rise today because i believe that this matter now transcends the purely personal involvement in this matter and that it has to do with more important situations involving the privileges and immunities of the house of representatives only once before has that on my account been invoked and it was under somewhat similar circumstances though not identical at all i will refer to that later but all through my career as an elected public official a career which i had not planned intended or even dreamed of aspiring to until 1950 when i sought the office of state representative to the state legislature of texas and in the july primariesthen held in july in texas and when i did seek office even though that first time i was defeated in a manner of speaking it was a moral victory but an electoral defeat i had felt then that the integrity and the honor of an american citizen participating in these wonderful glorious free democratic processes of which we rightfully boast above all had the supreme duty and commitment to defending that integrity and that honor and after over 34 years of service in an elective public capacity i am no richer no poorer then when i started even though as i said and repeated i had never intended to enter the arena of public contest or activity the reason being that i grew up in the context of a world that has long disappeared and in the context of a world that required many of us to identify and seek selfidentification with the birthplace that was ours some of my brothers and some of my own playmates and some of those that grew up in the context and environment of that world 70 years ago did not fare well and became victim of the horrible social forces that have been loosed throughout that part of the country and even up to this day and time so that my identification came as a result of world war ii i was fortunate because i was able to struggleand when i say struggle i mean that literallyat a time when there was a bitter struggle for survival and i mean that literally when we talk of poverty today thank god there is nobody living in america today living at that time and having little memory of it that can evoke the definition of poverty as of that day it was cruel it was grinding it was a real hungrystriken poverty in my city which became known as the tuberculosis capital of the nation if not the world i saw pathetic instances of cousins and second cousins dying off day by day victims of this terrible disease which incidentally and by way of parentheses i have been keeping track of for the last 3 years as chairman of the subcommittee on housing and community development because of the growing density and overcrowdedness in our shelter situation in the country which i think dramatically has been illustrated particularly during the winter with this growing and disturbing number of homeless the incidents of social diseases such as tuberculosis with poverty and overcrowdedness particularly i want my colleagues to know that i have been checking on that and the developments are most alarming here in the district of columbia in what the atlanta centers for disease control calls the homeless area but which they mean the high density overcrowded area the incidents of tuberculosis within the last 2 years has gone up by over 18 percent in boston ma in the same years the incidents have increased by over 22 percent the reason is that these social diseases such as tuberculosis are identified with these two endemic problems of malnutrition proverty and overcrowdedness san antonio had that that is the reason i consecrated myself to fighting that forever and a day even though at that time the group i came from was considered wholly a conquered group literally an enslaved group the only difference between the group i came from and the fellow texans who happened to be of black descent was that fortunately or unfortunately no statute such as the jim crow laws or constitutional provisions had been directed against this group and the reason is simple the socalled hispanic group todaya word i do not like at allbut which we designate as the mexicanamerican group in my part of the country especially in the case of the darker complexioned brothers and sisters and in my family i might say by way of parentheses i am the lighter complexioned in my family so i can recall when i was just about 10 years old in 1927 going with my brother now a doctor 3 years younger and some friend from the neighborhood to the great san pedro swimming pool at that time which was really public open at all hours and at no charge and going in the middle of a hot summer afternoon having what seemed to me then a gigantic lifeguard come up and say we dont want mexicans swimming around here and my brother together with the neighbor who was also as i say swarthy or darker complexioned got up and was shivering and i said wait awhile the guard turned to me and said well not you you are spanish i said even then because i do not know what it has been ever since i have memory but i have never taken anything even from my own father who was a stern pater familia father if something did not seem right i said so even though that gave me many a thrashing the only thing that saved me as i grew up at 8 9 or 10 years old was that i could outrun my father but i stood up and always have and pray god i always shall i said mister you cant do that and he says i told you you are spanish it is all right in the meanwhile my brother started crying and shivering he was just about 71 2 8 years old so did his friend a neighborhood friend we called little george faz and they got to shivering and crying and did not want to come in so i went to the bathhouse where the lady in charge was a neighbor by the name of mrs vidaurri and i said mrs vidaurri i want to complain and i want to know what you are going to do about it well low and behold she closed the bathhouse went down with me in hand got ahold of the lifeguard chewed him out and he said well you know we dont want these mexicans around here she said it is not what you want i am going to report you but by that time i could not convince my brother or the neighbor to come back in so we went home the next day i had picked nine buddies of mine that lived across the creek san pedro creek my family was fortunate we lived in the inner in a nice neighborhood where we were the only mexicanamerican family but across the creek was predominantly 100percent mexicanamerican families i went over and i got the darkest complexioned friends i could find and we went to san pedro swimming pool and we went right in front of that redhaired lifeguardbecause i remember thatand jumpted right in the water and splashed as much as we could then he started to come at me and i said mister im going to get mrs vidaurri because youre just not going to do what you did yesterday and lo and behold he left us alone so i learned early that you do not take any guff of an unjust kind from anybody if you will just stand up i recognized that in our country some of our schoolmates demonstrated that and told me that and i learned that that is something that we in america respect that is the courage to stand up for ones convictions and being willing to fight for themnot to talk a fight but to fight a fight i say all of this because on december 4 i was presented with a situation that i think my colleagues will recognize as one that we all try to avoid the loud bullying type the loudmouthed insulting kind in a public place but on this particular morning the situation was such that it was the fifth morning in a row that i had met at this restaurant known as earl abels in san antonio it is a near 50yearold establishment and it is very popular the original owner earl abel was a personal friend of mine he died a few years ago and his brother is running the business outside of the house dining room here it is the best meeting place i have had for meetings back home preferably at breakfast time to clear the calendar thursday december 4 1986 happened to be the fifth morning in a row that i had met with constituents ranging from members of the city council to businessmen who had matters to discuss concerning the federal government so in the place the table that i had sat at became known by all and sundry as henry bs table on this particular morning i had as a guest a sergeant major who had retired from the army after 30 years and 7 months of honorable service heroic and patriotic service in both korea and vietnam he had retired at formal ceremonies at fort sam houston which is in the middle of my district on or about october 15 but being that we were in session right before closing out that congress last year i could not make the retirement ceremonies so i invited him to join me and finally we could get together so i could make a presentation of a small momento with a seal of the house of representatives to show and reveal my high respect for this patriotic man and give these things to him he happened to be the halfbrother of a young attorney who is working currently on my san antonio office staff we got to talking about his experiences and before i knew it it was 9 30 in the morning we had met there at 8 and at 9 30 in the morning we were the only ones in that entire dining room being that the table i would sit at had the only hatrack which was to my immediate right behind me i noticed that a group of three men came in from the outer door the outer entrance on the far side having at least 20 tables to pick from they decided to come in and sit right at the one next to us since two of the little waitresses had been coming in to talk to me about some personal problems they had one of them not being in my district i counseled her to get hold of my nextdoor colleague and i gave her his phone number and his office address her problem was serious she and her husband were hardworking people lower income middleclass people and they had just been presented with a 10 000 doctors bill on her mothers case and it developed that it had just been ascertained that she was suffering from alzheimers disease and the nursing home wanted to kick her out so i advised her that she should make sure she got hold of the congressman and that if she failed to do that or could not communicate with him to let us know i gave her my number and my card the other little lady came up this watress had worked longer at the place and she lived in my district i had been trying to help her with respect to a son of hers but even as i was talking to them i heard my name mentioned i heard the word communist and then i felt somebody brush my elbow behind me and out of the corner of my eye i realized he was hanging a cowboy hat on the hat rack but at that point the second waitress came back and said to the first one say some customers are waiting for you and then she said look congressman where would i be able to get you in case i miss you at the office so i gave her my residence number at that point i heard my staff member say mister youre wrong about that so i looked around but at that point the other waitress came back in then i looked at my watch and i said my goodness it is 10 minutes to 10 and at 10 i am supposed to have a taping session for a 30second spot on the bicentennial of the constitution to be aired next year i said ive got to go my two guests got up and walked around the table toward the exit nearest to that table which leads to the cash register along a narrow corridor then i got up and with my left hand picked up my car keys and the ticket as i was getting up and going around the table i heard loudly clearly and distinctly theres henry b gonzalez our no 1 leading damned communist around here in the meanwhile my guests had stopped about 1 foot across the threshold so i said hey just a minute and then my staff assistant said hey theyve been calling you a communist all morning long so i turned around came to the table and i said gentlemen have you been calling me a communist here the two men opposite me nodded their heads negatively vigorously saying no no the one nearest but facing them and with his right side facing me said i did then i said well can you tell me what brings this all up here at this time in this way he said well because you are the leading no 1 damn communist around here i noticed that he had a hunting knife in a scabbard on his belt the right side i thought in the back of my mind that these were hunters the hunting season was on and this establishment which remains open practically all 24 hours sometimes in the morning will host some of the hunters coming back or going out on a hunt so i thought perhaps this is what they were when this man talked the way he did i said well mister ill tell you what stand up like a man and tell me that to my face he pushed away from his table dropped his hand to the scabbard and i was not about to wait to have him pull the knife i hit him on the right cheekbone in order to turn him around and if he had made further moves to grab the knife picked him up and hit him with my knee in the groin and disable him and disarm him i have had experiences like that coming up through the jungle that i have i have had to face alley fights in which knives were pulled on me later when i was juvenile probation officer at 2 30 in the morning i had a man put a 45 what we call a hoglet against my midriff my belt pressed the hammer well i am here to tell you about it i do not know where that guy is all i know is that had it not been for his fatherinlaw maybe i would not be here today because i grabbed his arm so hysterically that i dug my fingernails in his flesh more than one quarter of an inch in the meanwhile being larger than i was and bigger because at that time my weight was about 134 pounds and even though i was always sinewy and could take on heavies this man undoubtedly with the pistol in his right hand could have pushed me his fatherinlaw came in hit us both threw us on the mud and gravel it was an october night after the war and it was drizzly wet cold and then the fatherinlaw proceeded to get his belt wrap it around this mans neck and compel him to loosen the pistol i was in such a hysterical state that i got the the pistol and threw it over the little shack across the alley it was the alley they call burnette alley the reason i was there was that the chief juvenile probation officer who was the only women in the history of the barcony juvenile office that they ever had as a women chief called me after supper and said ricky this june 4 1987 little fellow and i wont mention his name has run away from miss whittaker mrs whittaker was a caseworker you know how the police have been riding us you have got to go and retreive him before the morning she said knowing the ways i waited until midnight and decided i would go out and see what i could do which was a mistake because i had long held to the principle and was the first one in the barcony juvenile office not to carry a pistol that we were not police officers and we were not equipped to do police work but i went and i learned the lesson firsthand that is the reason i was there but what happened was that this brotherinlaw of this kid had come from camp polk la and had been drinking the family had been told about the young 15yearold facing a possible term in the training school and even though it was not my case since i was a male i was asked to try to pick him up if the chief had not been so defensive with that police department she probably would have called in as the facts remain i have faced these situations and i have faced others in the case on december 4 i felt that the attempt was to try to intimidate me into accepting an insult which i consider that an insult and i considered those words fighting words just like any attack on my honor and my integrity or my honesty as i said before i do not have anything in the way of worldly wealth that i did not have when i entered politics and that is not much but all i have is my name and my honor and that never is going to be smirched never and anybody ever having attempting it has had to fight and by golly that is the way i am when i hit this fellow the two guests that had been with me came behind me and then he stood still he was going to get up no question in my mind that he certainly was not moving his right hand to the scabbard just to play with it and i have never waited for anybody to get a chance to do that i have had at least four encounters with knives and i have never been scratched and i was able to take care of myself the whole venture into public office has been a constant confrontation with danger violence we live in a very violent society and violence is all around us and those of us or any one of us that has been around in the public arena long enough in all areas of society not just in select segments i think will accept the truth and valid ity of what i am saying that violence like the scriptures say a crouching lion at the door was imminent and you never know i have been in situations like in what we call llevate downtown san antonio beautiful reconstruction of the spanish community it was a beautiful dance being sponsored by one of the most respected and beautiful young ladies ever having a social club in san antonio they had asked me to be the master of ceremonies and i was sitting there when all of a sudden i heard a crack piece of glass hit our table where my wife was seated and a friend of mine a doctor was on the corner i looked up and saw an individual covered with beer foam with this head down and it seemed that and it was so fast that i cannot remember when instead of the neck of the broken beer bottle there was a revolver i did notice that the man was hold ing it very professionally just like jack ruby when he killed oswald that was no casual individual and i heard one shot and then the next thing another and a bullet singeing my coat and cutting my neck as if a saw had cut it off and hitting over where the orchestra was and the orchestra was in panic all trying to hide behind the piano i pushed my wife and the doctor then got up i heard four more shots and i saw this individual following a man that was just crawling down toward the gate finally almost at the gateway when i reached the man he turned around gave me the gun and said do you have a cigarette i said what is the matter with you i leaned over and i saw the fellow on the ground was expiring who would have suspected that kind of violence under those circumstances at that time yet it happened if the insult on december 4 had been unattended with an illegal weapon because under the ordinances of the city of san antonio that type of hunting knife is against the lawin a public place when this man saw the two guests come up he just sat there the sergeantmajor came and grabbed me by the shoulder and said congressman you dont need any of this come on he pulled me back and then i remembered that i still had the meal ticket and the car keys in my left hand and i said oh my god i got to pay the bill i went to the cash register when my staffer said congressman look out here comes this fellow and i saw this fellow approaching me in this narrow corridor so i got set thinking well he is going to come at me he did not he passed by and went outside my assistant said hes going to get a gun i said well look dont worry in the meanwhile the cashiermind you at the time of all this encounter there was not a soul in that dining room except us my two guests and the three individuals when i saw that he was approaching me in this narrow corridor there was no way that he could pass by without coming right next to me i looked to see if he was going to start anything and i was ready to kick him but he did not he passed by with a smirk on his face he went out to the car when my assistant said hes going to get a gun i said you dont know that just stay aside let me take care of it as we were going out he was coming back in and he deliberately had this shirt jacket and he was deliberately trying to get our attention to show that he did not have the knife in the scabbard so he obviously went to his pickup to leave the knife knowing full well it was illegal but he did not do anything so we left i went on to the office and taped the program when i received a call from a newspaper reporter who said there is a fellow here saying that you hit him at earl abels is that true i said well do you know him he said do you know what his name is i said no i didnt ask for his calling card well did you hit him i said well mister what is it that you want to know do you want to know the circumstances he said well i just want to know did you hit him now mind you all of the newspaper stories printed were as a result of his having gone to the newspapers i did not go to the press he did it was not until after the next day that i was interviewed in depth by then his version was out that i had hit him then he lied as he continued to he said that i had hit him on the left eye and had cut his face well i do not wear rings there was no way i could have hit him on the left eye unless i had gone around the table to do it so i knew he was lying it turns out that there is no bad or evil but for what some good comes out of it and with all this publicity spreading around that i had hit a man but he did admit but he did not say he said he had just said in a low voice that i was a communist but then he said what i have against him is that he is attacking my president ronald reagan this is the real animus and this is the real thrust of the situation today which i will sum up in just a few minutes the reason i am going into this detail is because i think i owe it to my colleagues just as i did 24 years ago when a colleague also from texas had called me a communist in the newspapers and then here and then had reported to another colleague who took personal privilege and reported on something he had not seen the first story he gave was that i had hit him well of course there was no way i could have hit him without leaving some telling marks on him the second story that came out and remember those stories also were his version actually not even his it was his colleague who had reported the incident and described me as having attacked this man well in the first place i did not pull a punch i did not throw~a punch the guy for some reason or other broke through those two doors there swinging doors almost knocked over representative bailey from west virginia so even if i had wanted to i was not about to come on the house floor and tackle him or hit him but the second story after the press went to him and said well where did he hit you and he could not say the story came out that he had not been hit at all but by then the first reports were out and i was pictured as a mad mexican who had lost his head or something well when they also had some quotes out of context which of course will be accessible to those who do not want to research the newspaper morgues in any event the incident grew out of the same attempt to besmirch and denigrate however as a result of the publicity within 24 hours i had two phone calls from down in south texas southeast in brazoria county and another one from the adjacent county from the former sheriff there who said say im calling you congressman because that nocount individual that i saw on these tv reports is the same guy that i arrested in 1972 here for enciting to a riot a sawed off shotgun in his possession and we intercepted an order he had just placed in atascosa county for some dynamite and we arrested him i said well sheriff im glad you called me but this is an ad hoe situation and it will stand on its own the individual hid out the press started calling me and saying hey have you seen or heard of him or have you made any contact i said no they said well we cant locate him for 2 weeks nobody saw him obviously because he knew that i had not hit him on the left eye i could not have given him a left eye black eye but he hid out for 2 solid weeks and then came and went to the police who at that time were on the defensive because of the murder of one policeman by another under very very unbelievable circumstances and in which my name became involved because the policeman killed had been involved in some kind of vigilante activity in fact he had killed some members of minority racial or ethnic minority black or brown and in fact was under suspension for the death of three and was reputed to be a member of the aryan brotherhood the fbi and other law enforcement agencies began to recall that a few years ago just about half a block from this restaurant earl abels an explosive device had been placed in this automobile with congressional license tags belonging to my colleague from houston bill archer it turns out that mr archers son had come to a wedding reception at the old san antonio country club which is another half a block away and while at this reception somebody had blown up his car i got tipped off by some of my former and since retired law enforcement agents when i was a juvenile officer and said congressman that was meant for you they thought that was your car i said well ill have to wait and see what comes out of it in 1976 the fbi reported and this was soon after the formation of the assassination committee that my resolution had brought into being and in which immediately we found ourselves involved in very very subversive speculation the fbi reported to be precise on october 26 1976 at near midnight to my wife i was attending a planning session for the coming visit of candidate jimmy carter to appear before the alamo on the 30th and when i came in my wife was very nervous and said the fbi had called and said they had a most urgent report when i called the number the night attendant said that they had been trying to get ahold of me to tell me that they had a report of a 35 000 contract on my life then after they gave me this report the fbi acted as if they were more interested in protecting the wouldbe assassin than they were me so it took 4 years before i get could the freedom of information act and a new fbi director mr webster the first fbi director kelley refused to give me that information i finally got the report and it was astounding not only had the fbi received that one they had received four other threats against my life and never once reported them to me the dossier went back to the time that i was in the state senate on the day after my election to the congress which was november 5 1961 the day after the election the local agentincharge had sent to j edgar hoover a memo saying state senator henry b gonzalez liberal democrat has just been elected to the congress with communist help now if anybody in san antonio has ever rubbed elbows with a live and kicking communist i have yet to know about it i was born in san antonio i have lived there all along i have never in my life been arrested for anything even a traffic violation there is no record even though i grew up at a time when everybody around me in the neighborhood had a record i had to resist them i had to fight them then in fact two of those four fights i referred to involved that because there was something that was said to me that is not for you i had to fight it the pressures were there they call it peer pressures today we did not know what the hell it was then so where do we stand today well the police were on the defensive the cbs had come to me and had interviewed me because the crew that had gone to san antonio stumbled across the fact that the special grand jury had information that tied in the dead policeman smith with the bombing of the congressmans car and that it was a mistaken identity that he thought it was mine at that time he was living in that area they also know that he had been guilty of attacking the former chief of polices house by blasting the house with shotgun fire he had also been accused of many other things some of them obviously corroborated some not when the cbs came to interview me i said this is a local matter what is it you want to know they said well you were down there and we find that the people are scared of the police department they still are scared i said well all i can testify to you is that i go back to my district every weekend i have been off and on intimately associated with the lawenforcement processes it used to be that it was taken for granted that if you were a minority you could get shot and killed and nobody would give a hoot that was my first fight as a juvenile officer i went to the grand jury protested it got to the point where i could not walk through the police station without being cursed until one day i confronted four detectives and said which one of you called me a name they all had guns they said well suppose we all did i said well then take off your doggone guns and ill proceed to knock you through the door they did not take me on but it got to where i could walk through the police corridors without being insulted and i won the case with the grand jury even though the juvenile court judge called me down and said that politically i was getting him in trouble blah blah blah i said well heres my resignation he said no he did not take it so it has been a constant fight it still is what i told the cbs reporter was look mister yes there are entire areas both on the east sidethat is predominantly black and on the west sidethat is predominantly brown where people do not look upon that policeman as a friend they look upon himin fact they have a word in spanish they call them perros that means dogs on the east side you had outandout coldblooded murders except that it was policemen doing it june 4 1987 who gave a hoot who gives a hoot now i then communicated with the special prosecutor who as of this week incidentally is prosecuting the case it has finally come to trial at that time he was a special prosecutor handling the special grand jury this grand jury issued its report just about the time that cbs was inter viewing me and they said we dont have the resources on the state level and we recommend that the federal grand jury be impaneled to look into this pattern of civil rights violations and the decomposition in the san antonio police department i then sat down and wrote a letter to the federal district attorney a woman one month went by and i received no acknowledgment i then wrote her another letter another 3 weeks went by and finally she acknowledged and said well i think what you ought to do is get ahold of the justice department in washington dc so i let it go but in the meanwhile cbs tells me that they are going to air the show 3 weeks later two nights before they were scheduled to air it they called and told my administrative assistant that they were very sorry but they were going to have to delete my portion of the interview then it turns out that the mayor of the city who is a friendone whom i have known since he was born known his family before they were marriedit seems that he had gotten nervous that the city was going to get a bad name and had intervened with cbs to censor that program now i do not care about that except that since it is my hide that isstill at stake i naturally am going to defend every right of mine then comes right immediately after that the fact that the new district attorneyand incidentally those who would want to make it a racial matter let me point out that he is a socalled hispanic and he just took office on january 1police officer summeysummeycalled me exactly 2 weeks after the incident and said congressman i really apologize for bothering you but we just took this complaint from this fellow allen and apologize but you know to tell you the truth we get about four or five of these a day and they either end up nowhere or they go to the police court the city court or the jp but you know this is henry b this is what makes this different i said what are you trying to tell me officer summey he said well what i am trying to tell you is that we are going to have to go out of here and investigate and maybe refer it but i do not see where it will go anyplace i said well thats not the point if you have waited 2 weeks he said i tried you know this guy waited 2 weeks i said did you take it he said yes did you see any marks on his face he said no i said ok then i want to file a complaint that he had a prohibited weapon on his person oh no i cant do that i cant do that i just cant do that i said why not well too much times gone by i said look good day and i hung up next thing on january 1 which was the day that the new district attorney the present district attorney assumed office he had a release in the newspaper saying that this case was being reviewed and that they were going to request more information from the police at that point i knew that this was a setup why because there is no case in history where a simple assault case goes anywhere on the county or the district attorneys level they have all gone to the police court or the jp court at the worst not getting involved in democratic primaries i had incurred the anger of this elected district attorney who had been considered an underdog but precisely because the former district attorney had been involved in this bizarre police killing of another policeman he had fallen into great disfavor at no time did that district attorney ever make any effort to contact any one of us three either my two guests or myself so that time went by i knew full well after all i had been in the county courthouse for 4 years as a juvenile officer that an obviously politically motivated frivolous case would at the least be sent to the municipal court police court when all of a sudden there was a big story in both newspapers quoting an assistant district attorney and of course putting my picture saying this case is serious and we are looking into it and we are trying to get more information the next 3 weeks went by nothing was said or done at no time were we contacted when another story comes up same vein same replay in the meantime there were and there are two radio talk shows that are conducted by very very right wing elements who had this assistant district attorney on their show they had also had the man whose name turned out to be allen on their show day after day demanding that i be prosecuted the district attorneys assistant appeared on the show not once several times to discuss the case in the meantime the district attorney then calls my oldest son who is an attorneyi have eight children in all four boys four girls and three of the boys are attorneysand he said listen you know you did help me and i can let you have the address and the name of this individual and i would suggest that maybe you could or some friend of your dads could talk to him and see if you could get some accommodation maybe you could have some kind of a mutual apology at that point my son called me and i said look forget about it and i am going to consult a friend of mine who had volunteered to help an attorney and i said let him i said i do not get my family involved in my fights i think it is very very questionable that the district attorney should call you and suggest that he would give you this mans name and address and phone number and you set up a meeting i said i do not authorize it i advise you to drop the matter tell the district attorney to either get hold of me or get hold of the guy i am going to tell him to get hold of the next thing the district attorney called a very long long time business friend of mine one of the leading businesses in the community there who calls me and says the district attorney called me and said you know it is strange because i did not support him i supported the incumbent a fellow by the name of sam hillsup but he says he wants me to talk with him meet with him and talk to him about this case of yours he seems nervous and he said that he really had a dilemma and he thought maybe i could suggest a peg he could hang his hat on and i said bill you have no authority to represent me the district attorney i think is violative of course of conduct that would be proscribed in such cases he said oh but he told me that he had an appointment with this other fellow in his office and i committed myself to meet with him so i said well just remember you do that on your own you are not speaking for me and you are in no way authorized to do so he said fine he called me back after the meeting and he said you know henry this fellow said that he had met with your adversary and that your adversary had said that well maybe if you made a public apology i said look bill i do not want to discuss it with you what i will ask you to do is to call this individual who is a lawyer in the meantime this individual had absented himself quite a bit from the city and was not aware of what was happening so it was a few days before my friend got hold of him then finally another bizarre thing the assistant to the district attorney never would the district attorney be quoted in the papers he always had these assistants some unknown assistant speaking came out with a story that they were going to do something by the following week that was on a thursday that same afternoon here in d c in my office i got a call from the lawyer and he said the district attorney got hold of me and he says that he has met with this fellow and that if you will publicly apologize they will drop all charges i said stop right there i said i will have nothing to do with a despicable deal with a despicable character arranged by a despicable moral and political coward in the person and shape of the district attorney well that was on friday i go home every weekend and that praticular sunday my wife had arranged a birthday celebration for me for all of the people that i have always wanted to have with me but could never afford a ticket to get into any kind of a fundraiser i do not have fundsraisers except in a contest and for instance this year is a nonelection year i would not think of having a fundraiger so i do not have one of these kitties and my wife thought it would be a good idea to open up to all who wanted to come and she did we ended up with about 10 000 people then i had to leave on monday morning at 5 as i do usually on monday mornings and later that morning the district attorney filed in the county court at law with a republican judge who is highly partisan who has political ambitions he has just taken over the county judgeship and is already planning a race for the district judgeship he is very bitterly partisan and has demonstrated that time and time again so then the attorney calls my wife at home and says listen if an officer or a deputy comes around to serve papers well just tell him the congressman is not around so then i get hold of him when my wife tells me that i told my wife i said look do not worry about anything and i called this lawyer and i said look you volunteered you wanted to help i told you one thing you just do not want to get sandbagged i know there are people in this town that want to do that they would like to embarrass they would like to sandbag for purely political reasons mostly because they cannot forgive me for being an inveterate opponent of president ronald reagans policies of having introduced the impeachment resolution that i did on march 5 and i certainly have not hidden my candle under a bushel everybody knows where i stand here and back home in fact i talk home first and then here anyway to make a long story short this judge was going to have a warrant served to drag me in except that the county clerk mind you not the lawyer but the county clerk bless his soul said wait awhile that is abnormal process we usually provide for an agent or a spokesman to come in and particularly in a case such as this sign the papers either for waiver or arraignment or for the equivalent of a bond of appearance and by golly i am issuing them this republican judge came down and chastised him and tried to intimidate him but since the county clerk knows his law he said you had better go back to your chambers dont try to come around here and intimidate me then the attorney that i find out later has in the last 2 months joined a republican law firm and is a former teacher of this republican judge calls and says tell you what congressman i have managed to arrange for you to come in on friday and we will go to the courthouse and sign the papers and i said i am sorry the county clerk has already taken care of that so then the proceedings intended for me are a kangaroo republican court and i want to advise everybody it will be a long day a long sunny day before that shall happen"], [0.007520109415054321, 0.4924798905849457, 0, "one of the problems of the democratic left in america is that it

we started out with yesterday now yesterday we were told that the right thing to do in our national interest was to cut off all covert aid to the contras fighting in nicaragua to recapture their own country let the indians go let commander zero fend for himself and let the fmn do the best they can but we are going to pour in 80 million for overt aid sea air and land overt interdiction of these subversive arms now today the unwisdom of that position has obviously been seen by the chief sponsor of that legislation because we have moved now a position of tolerating aid to the paramilitary forces inside nicaragua but first we have to stop for 30 days we tell the miskito indians hang in there we may be back keep fighting we just may come back if we can now if congress has adjourned the
