of the budget resolution both the bush and republican budgets suffer from the same infirmities fiscal irresponsibility and selfserving and outoftouch priorities both are wholly inadequate to meet the needs of our nation and will pass along mounting deficits and debts to generations yet unborn first the 5year republican budget will result in a deficit of 376 billion in 2006 44 million over the presidents projection the republicans budget proposal also has many cost omissions because they know that their deficit numbers explode after 5 years as such this budget does not take into account the cost of fixing the amt which will cost at least 642 billion it does not take into account the 774 billion needed to pay for the presidents muchtalked about but yet unveiled social security privatization plan i suppose the republican budget proposal deserves a little credit for hiking its deficit projection as it at least includes 50 million in 2006 for the wars in afghanistan and in iraq the presidents budget proposal contained zero dollars as a matter of fact it reported that the costs could not be known however both figures are fantasy the realistic figure over the next 10 years in addition to the 80 billion that we just passed in the supplemental is likely to be 384 billion to pay for its misguided policies the house budget resolution cuts nondefense discretionary spending by 12 billion below the amount needed in fiscal 2006 just to maintain current spending levels and it cuts spending on mandatory domestic programs by 8 billion to add insult to injury the republican budget provides 18 billion in additional tax cuts these misguided tax cuts will actually cost much more when the tax cuts actually expire in 2010 in fact 97 percent of these tax cuts will benefit taxpayers with incomes above 200 000 i think most reasonable people can agree that these priorities are not americas priorities while little good can be said about the bush administrations budget it at least provides detailed information on the programs it seeks to cut the house resolution shrouds its cuts in darkness leaving the american people to wonder what vital programs will find their way to the ch6ppinig block next both the republican and bush budget proposals are travesties when the bush administration took office the nation was experiencing record surpluses it has managed to turn a 521 billion surplus into a 367 billion deficit in contrast the spratt alternative budget as well as the congressional black caucus alternative budget that we will consider tomorrow focus national spending on priorities that benefit all americans and get us on the road to economic recovery they do this by funding key domestic priorities which address the needs of working families while fully supporting the national defense and protection of our homeland and preserving medicaid social security pension programs and student loans let me speak particularly about the budget developed by the congressional black caucus which corrects the irresponsible fiscal and economic policies contained in the house budget resolution by supporting existing programs that are essential to closing disparities creating opportunities and helping our citizens build their future it will get our country on the road to recovery while funding meaningful national priorities for our children for our seniors for our veterans and for our communities importantly the congressional black caucus budget supports these priorities while also meeting our obligation to our troops in iraq and in afghanistan the cbc budget funds community development programs including restoring funding to the community development block grant program and supporting increased funding for elderly and disabled housing programs the congressional black caucus budget will also restore funding for veterans health care rather than imposing new copayments on them for essential services and prescription drugs importantly the congressional black caucus budget will reduce the budget deficit by 167 billion during the next 5 years below the deficit that will be produced by the house budget resolution theirepublican budget cuts educational housing and health programs for our children while bequeathing to them a public debt that has increased by 1 268 trillion over the last 4 years and that will exceed 4 6 trillion even before we begin fiscal year these actions are not only irresponsible they are unconscionable in the end one can only conclude that the republican budget balances itself on the backs of americans who can least afford it i urge the administration to reconsider its illconceived economic policies the congressional black caucus budget is the ultimate expression of our national priorities and our priorities must be our children our families our elderly and our veterans and of course our soldiers"], [2.1338462829589844e-05, 0.9999786615371704, 1, "i want to thank the gentleman from washington for yielding me the customary 30 minutes i yield myself 5 minutes democrats have been saying again and again and again and again the american people want and deserve a clean upordown vote on raising the minimum wage and this rule does not provide for such a vote minimumwage workers want and deserve a clean upordown vote a clear bipartisan majority of this house wants and deserves a clean upordown vote not a cynical maneuver to provide political cover for certain vulnerable republican members a maneuver that the majority knows full well will kill any chance of an increase in the minimum wage this year let me say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle maybe you can fool your constituents in august but let me tell you the american people will not be fooled in november what the republican leadership is presenting is a bill that clutters up the minimumwage vote with surprise surprise tax cuts for the wealthy actually it isnt a surprise at all the republican answer to every problem is more tax cuts for the wealthy medicare prescription drugs tax cuts for the wealthy drug companies and hmos an energy bill tax cuts for the oil and gas industry despite their recordbreaking profits and now an increase in the minimum wage with estate tax cuts for the wealthiest few attached the republicans believe that lowwage workers dont deserve a raise unless paris hilton also gets a big tax cut no wonder the american people are so sick and tired of politics as usual in washington i would ask my republican colleagues why is it so impossible for you to do anything good for working families why does it cause you such pain and anguish and handwringing why cant you just do the right thing congress has not raised the minimum wage since 1997 that is 9 years during that same period of time congress has raised its own salary eight times now that is what i call out of touch the congressional pay raise just the amount of the pay raise in the last 9 years has been 30 000 almost triple what a minimumwage worker earns in an entire year the average corporate ceo who will benefit of course from the estate tax cut earns more before lunchtime than a minimumwage worker earns all year a republican staffer told the columbus ohio dispatcher not too many people work at minimum wage anymore i dont think it gets you anywhere politically politics arent the point the point is to make sure that people who work hard every day in this country have enough money to feed their families and pay their rent and fill up their gas tanks nearly 15 million americans will benefit from a minimumwage increase 6 6 million directly and 8 3 million indirectly almost 60 percent of those workers are women 40 percent are people of color 35 percent of them are their familys sole wage earners you want to talk about family values about helping children just raise the minimum wage even worse the massive estate tax cut being tacked onto this bill will actually harm those hardworking families by adding millions of dollars to the national debt the children of todays minimumwage worker will have to pay that debt they will have to deal with increased interest rates they will have to deal with china and other countries controlling the debt of this country they will have to deal with the cuts in education and health care it is outrageous in additionthis rule makes in order a pefision bill that not only misses an important opportunity to deal with this countrys retirement security crisis it also will lead to benefit cuts for millions of american workers and let me again clarify it for the record so there is no mistake this is not a conference report that we are voting on here tonight i want to make it clear because there is some misunderstanding this is not the result of the conference negotiations that we have this bill before us tonight the pension bill fails to encourage companies to keep offering traditional pensions to their workers it fails companies from using bankrdptcy to dump worker pension plans and it fails to stop companies from awarding lavish retirement compensation packages to executives at the same time they cut workers benefits i cant say it any more plainly the priorities of this republican leadership are not the priorities of the american people what the american people want and what they deserve isa clean upordown vote on increasing the minimum wage we have voted on this issue in various procedural votes over and over and over and over we want a clean vote we want this to become the law of the land we want to make sure that lowincome wage earners get the raise that they deserve so they can get out of poverty and what the american people also want and eserve is a pension bill that protects them they wont be getting any of that

understand what is happening in the present wedo not even have to go as far back as what happened 4 or 5 years ago or what happened 2 years ago we just have to talk about what is happening right now once again this president could not do it by himself needed the partisan vote in this chamber on the republican side to accomplish 1 05 trillion in borrowing from foreign na tions knocking on the door of china saying can you help us because we are fiscally irresponsible that is what the debt ceiling letter comes from we did not write this letter democrats did not set this letter into motion it was the republican policies in this republican house that set this policy into motion raising the debt ceiling not paying as we go this is not the responsibility of the minority on the democratic side it is the majority i want to make sure because we need to break this thing down in 1 2 3 a b c so that no one can go back home and tell their constituents well you know you have got a point there but i did not quite catch that and i did not know that we have borrowed 1 05 trillion more than 42 presidents before this president 42 other administrators before this president 1 05 trillion that other presidents and administrations and congresses have borrowed from foreign nations in 224 years folks say well you all act like you are alarmed by this we are alarmed the american people should be alarmed republicans and democrats it is almost like saying if you had your daughter or son that you gave a credit card to and they went out and they just charged that credit card up as a matter of fact they charged it to the point that it is at the limit let us say they had a 2 500 limit on it what the republican congress is doing now is that they are going even though they are maxed out they are calling the credit card company that happens to be china that happens to be saudi arabia that happens to be other countries of interest as it relates to the defense of this country saying we have maxed out right now we need your help to pay our bills and then at the same time as i continue to go to c here through the abcs they are saying this on one side but on the other side they are saying hey make the tax cuts permanent make them permanent for the most wellfinanced americans for the top tier of the individuals that are making 2 and 3 million a year on this side of the debate they are saying it is okay togive not only royalties but other benefits and tax breaks to the oil industry while they are making record profits they are saying that it is okay but then here in the middle are the american people and the american people are having to suck it up mr ryan the american people who want to educate themselves parents who want to see their children educated if you have a prepaid college program you better revisit that program because it will not assist your child or your son or your daughter in paying for their college because we will just yank the carpet out from under young people and the republican majority did we voted against it the democrats voted against it so if we are going to have a paradigm shift and i am hoping that we put the pressure on the republican majority that we are here to play we mean business we are very serious about having the opportunity to give this country what it deserves and that means representation representation for them and not the special interests i speak all of the time abotlt i do not have a picture of the special interests in my office saying i really dislike the special interests i really dislike individuals that are paid lobbyists i really dislike them no no it is not them it is the individuals that allow the raw needs of those special interests to make it into statutory language it is those individuals that appropriate in those areas where it gets into the appropriations act and into the budget just the way they wrote it without saying you know i know you have a concern i know you have an issue and you have needs but we have to make sure that the american people are represented in this budget we have to make sure that the american people are represented in this bill we have to make sure that the future of this country as it relates to innovation plays a major role in what we do here and that is where we are lacking so you know mr ryan as we go on and many members will return back to their districts and speak to individuals that live there we challenge those americans to challenge your member of congress it is almost too late for us to wait until election day for you to speak the way you want to speak but you have the opportunity i tell you give the republican majority the benefit of the doubt that they are going to take a paradigm shift but i am going to let you know right now the evidence does not speak to a paradigm shift or a change in thinking or their ways so i say mr ryan that yes we do have a couple of friends over here on this side of the aisle that believe what we believe and it will be those individuals those very few that will join in with a democratic leadership if the american people see fit to have it so that will allow us to move in a bipartisan way and it will not be like it is now and it will not be business as usual and it will not be well i dont care if you do not like it"], [5.9723854064941406e-05, 0.9999402761459351, 1, "let me start by thanking the gentleman from alabama for organizing this series of 5minute statements and for his leadership on this issue two weeks short of the end of the fiscal year of 2006 and with no budget in place for fiscal 2007 i commend my distinguished democratic colleagues on the budget committee for takingthis time to call americas attention to the fiscal challenges resulting from the republicans misguided policies and the wrong choices they have made for our economy misplaced spending priorities and bad decisions have consequences they are leading us further down the path to fiscal ruin and expanding the wedge between middleclass families and the superwealthy i am proud to join my colleagues to highlight the hypocrisy of the overriding republican economic philosophy that extending dividends capital gains and other tax cuts for millionaires and corporations create a rising tide that lifts all boats five years after the presidents 1 5 trillion tax cut our national debt now approaches 10trillion if our tax cuts performed as promised by those across the aisle an exploding economy would have wiped out this debt we have already proven that more needs to be done than just hope that sooner or later tax cuts will reach americans who need help the most but those who do need help must get in line and hope that the benefits of tax cuts for millionaires and corporations will ultimately trickle down to them perhaps the expanding gulf between the haves and the almosthaves is best illustrated by the fact that wages and salaries now make up the lowest share of gross domestic product since the government began keeping records on that in 1947 while corporate profits continue to break alltime records meanwhile the buying power of the minimum wage has sunk to its lowest level in 50 years what is missing are policies that ensure that the benefits of higher corporate earnings productivity and globalization are widely shared such as real government support for higher education a progressive tax code and affordable health care when choices are made at the expense of our safety net choices that benefit the top 1 percent who will never struggle to pay a mortgage never struggle to keep up with gas prices never struggle to put their children through school it is clear that a new direction for our economy is long overdue how can the republicans argue that this economy is bound in the right direction when our nation is saddled with recordbreaking deficits over 4 consecutive years combined with deep and painful cuts to hospitals to schools and to security at least the republicans budget outlook since 2001 has been consistent americans could bank on the american budgets to slash funding for proven homeland security programs veterans benefits education and health care priorities all the while cutting taxes for millionaires who need the break the least as reallife indicators of poor federal spending choices such as stagnant wages soaring crime rates and rising health care premiums and drug prices begin to take their toll on americans it is our responsibility to react instead inaction reigns under the direction of the current leadership in some cases this inaction has yielded to halfhearted solutions such as an energy bill that does more for oil aild gas companies than lower gas prices a medicare bill that does more for drug companies and hmos than make lifesaving drugs affordable a pension bill that takes it easy on corporate boards while ignoring the decline of traditional defined benefit plans eleven days away from the start of the fiscal year the record of this republican congress on the economy shows that we have not completed a budget or a single appropriations bill fiscal irresponsibility has reached unprecedented new lows depending on how you look at it the debt limit has been raised for the fifth time in as many years to almost 10 trillion perhaps we shouldnt be worried after all the presidents budget director said last month that 200 billion annual deficits are sustainable indefinitely apparently normal budget rules dont apply to this administration but they do apply to a middleclass family of four living on long island whose monthly costofliving expenses due mostly to rising gas prices and health care costs are rapidly exceeding wage increases perhaps their creditors and collection agents will understand that outstanding debts owed by families sinking deeper into red ink are sustainable indefinitely we can fix this mess we have the blueprint a new direction for america and we only need to look to past and proven methods like the payasyougo budget rules that were enforced in the previous administration and produced surpluses that helped us start buying down our national debt indeed we democrats resolve to restore what should be the goals of our federal budget to reflect the priority of our nation to build a strong economy and to set policies that reflect the values and priorities of the mainstream of americans i look forward to working with all of my colleagues who recognize that it is long past time to reverse course on this economy and support a new direction for america 1 2045

respond to the harsh economic realities facing our nation and our people but when we examineit objectively we cant avoid seeing the reality behind the pretense the bill is designed to do everything it can to protect the record tax cuts for the richest of americans for the majority that is more important than educating our children or providing health care to the veterans or helping americans raise themselves out of poverty or even protecting our country from the consequences of either national disasters or mounting national debt the authors and supporters of the legislation will tell us that if we wish to avoid increasing our national deficit which they have already driven to unprecedented heights we have no choice but to spend on the programs that americans rely on the most while they are busily cutting out the revenues that come into the government but once again they are offering a false choice for 5 years they have forced the massive tax cuts through the congress last week they made the most recent down payment on the cuts one was 70 billion while president bush signs that bill into law today republicans are asking us to pass this bill which adds another 158 billion to those cuts so in 2 weeks we have made those massive cuts and any justification melts away when we realize who is benefiting from it they are not for the poor they are not for the working class they are not for the middle class they are for the oil companies they wont spur our economy or help the average person afford their morning drive to work they are instead the cuts for billionaires and millionaires pure and simple they are not going to help the economy but they will indeed help people who dont need it and that assistance will come at the expense of everyone else but as always the case despite objections not just from democrats but much of the american public reducing or extending these cuts isnt even on the table here it never is they are considered too sacred to touch and just tonight in the rules committee once again we turned down an opportunity to pay for more by taking away part of their tax cut what do we get in exchange for this giveaway well the majority offered us a budget that will cut domestic spending between 1 and 2 percent every year as a result the party that tells us to support the troops is cutting veterans health care by 6 billion and we worry and fear for the over 20 000 young soldiers in iraq and afghanistan who have been grievously lifealtering wounded will not be able to get the care they need when they come back republicans who promised to leave no child behind will be cutting education funding by 45 3 billion and the budget of the department of education by 2 2 billion now not content to make education less rewarding in the present they apparently want to make our students worry more about loan payments in the future the bill eliminates all mandatory spending on student loans leaving congressional appropriators to somehow find 600 million to meet the students needs the majority wants to cut environmental protection efforts by 25 billion and take over 1 billion from community development and social service initiatives which we desperately need the poorest of the poor wont find any relief at all in this legislation in fact they will find the opposite the budget will underfund housing and child care assistance by 447 million over the next year and over 5 years the funding for them will fall almost 15 billion short what will the results be well consider the fate of the commodity supplemental food program which provides nutritious meals to 420 000 lowincome elderly and 50 000 mothers and children at a cost of 111 million a year the budget eliminates it entirely it may make sense that they are forcing the cuts through congress so they can afford the handouts to the rich but perhaps that really is what todays republican party stands for but apparently they also stand for something new contrary to their rhetoric irresponsible government spending the legislation before us will increase our deficit without a vote by 410 billion over the next 5 years at the same time it increases the debt limit by over 650 billion by 2011 the limit will stand at 9 6 trillion when the clinton administration left office the debt limit was about 4 5 trillion and they left us the greatest surplus we have ever had the majority claims the bill will make us more fis cally secure but what they really do is sow the seeds of greater insecurity both now and for years to come when we realize that it isnt necessity driving this bill but rather a world view that puts the richest americans ahead of everybody else we are not left with much else to say but shame we dont share these values democrats believe instead as did that great republican president theodore roosevelt and countless other americans that investing in the middle class which is disappearing quickly and guaranteeing broad prosperity is the surest way to ensure sustained economic growth"], [0.00010573863983154297, 0.9998942613601685, 1, "first i want to take this opportunity to thank house democratic leader nancy pelosi for the opportunity for the 30something working group to talk for an hour about the things that we know are important to our generation and also to explain and discuss our views on our generations perspective on a lot of the

we can see that those women join our ranks here as policymakers i want them to understand that from title ix to the equal pay act that they are standing on the shoulders as we do here of the courageous women who went before them e 2000 none of the three of us would have had the opportunity that we did at our stage in life without our colleagues who came before us in this body without their shoulders to stand on and i want them and other young women and girls to have the same opportunities that we have been given unfortunately the president apparently does not share those same views because in his 2007 budget proposal he slashes programs established to give young working mothers a leg up like medicare medicaid housing food stamps and child care he cuts programs aimed at preventing domestic violence and programs that provide domestic violence victims with housing and legal assistance i am saddened to say that domestic violence affects far too many women and an even growing number of young women forty percent of teenage girls ages 14 to 17 report knowing someone their age that has been hit or beaten by a boyfriend and 26 percent of girls in grades 9 through 12 have bedn the victim of abuse so tonight we are here because training education and employment statistics clearly indicate that women still face barriers in pursuing traditionally maledominated fields for instance while the number of women pursuing degrees in higher education has increased dramatically the rates of women pursuing engineering degrees lags far behind recent data shows that women account for only small percentages of students earning engineering degrees including only 20 percent of bachelors degrees 21 percent of masters degrees and only 17 percent of ph ds we are here because the republicans prescription drug plan is a particularly bad deal for americas women women are frustrated and confused and if you think government health and prescription drug care is only for the

regular basis those are not senior citizen statistics we are here tonight because 36 percent of the 9 4 million women in executive administrative and managerial occupations are under 44 years old and on average women are still making about 76 cents for every dollar that a man makes we are here because opponents of the family and medical leave act are working to hamstring that program even though

several we are here because if we do not stay late on this floor if we do not stand up and try to make a difference on behalf of young women and young families and bring these issues that are

woman and child including those born this 1ast hour every citizen of americas share of the national debt is 28 000 and some change where i come from very few of my constituents can afford to write a check for 28 000 and yet it is this kind of debt this kind ofdeficit that we are saddling on our children and grandchildren and expectingther someday to pay back and i believe it is morally wrong i raise these issues because you see my grandparents left this country better than they found it for my parents and my parents left this country better than they found it for my generation and i believe we have a duty and an obligation to try and leave this country just a little bit better than we found it for the next generation but instead for the sixth year in a row we have the largest budget deficit ever inour nations history this administration this republican congress continues to pass tax cuts for those earning over 400 000 a year just in the last few months this congress passed the socalled budget deficit reduction act here is~what it did it cut medicaid the only health insurance plan for the poor disabled and elderly it cut student loans and a program for orphans to the tune of 40 billion and then they passed another tax cut to the tune of about 90 billion i was not real good in math in high school or college but you can do the math on that some 90 billion in tax cuts for those earning over 400 000 a year 40 billion in cuts to medicaid to orphan programs and to student loans that amounts to 50 billion in additional debt and yet the republican leadership in this body had the nerve to call it the deficit reduction act i believe it is time for those of us in the fiscally conservative blue dog coalition to rise up and hold this administration this congress responsible for these kinds of reckless spending habits that destroy future generations the budget the president has submitted for fiscal year 2007 some 2 8 trillion you have to givelit to him he has managed to cut all of the programs that matter to people health care education infrastructure economic development and yet give us the largest budget deficit ever in our nations history all at the same time how does he do that because he continues to propose to borrow money from foreign lenders foreign central banks foreign investors to fund tax cuts for those earning over 400 000 a year what has it given us it has given us a debt of 8 365 525 832 151 by the time we complete this hour the national debt will have risen more than 41 million every tuesday night those of us in the blue dog coalition we are 37 members strong we come here to talk about the debt and the deficit and what it means not only to todays generation but to future generations because you see these are big numbers they are big numbers but let me put it in perspective not only is our nation borrowing about a billion dollars a day we are sending 279 million every day to iraq but do not dare ask the president how he is spending it or if he has a plan for how it is to be spent because he will tell you that you are unpatriotic some 57 million is going every day to afghanistan and on top of that our nation is spending the first half a billion we collect in your tax money each and every day simply to pay interest not principal just interest on the national debt we need 149 in my congressional district i need 1 5 billion to complete it give me 3 days interest on the national debt i can build 149 on the eastern side we are waiting on 169 give me 3 days interest on the national debt and i can complete

voted for and the legislation certainly was not perfect but the system that it supplanted was even worse ten years on instead of having a pep rally for tanf i think what we ought to be doing is having a serious conversation about whether the program is being implemented in a way that effectively and realistically moves everyone who can work into a job so that they might support their family with bill clinton the tanf program rightly demanded that ablebodied people do everything possible to find and keep a job but it also recognized the fact that single moms needed help with child care and transportation in order to successfully and permanently transition out of public assistance so the clinton budgets provided that traditional assistance the clinton budgets also made enforcement of child support payments a top priority which gleaned billions of dollars that pulled thousands of women and children out of poverty bill clinton insisted on an increase in the minimum wage and an expanded earned income tax credit which helped people earning the lowest wages support themselves and the results spoke for themselves even as welfare caseloads dropped poverty rates fell for every year that bill clinton was in office so what has happened in the last 5 years child care cut food stamps cut medicaid cut child support enforcement cut so it is a disappointment but not a surprise that poverty rates are once again on the rise according to the census bureau in 2004 there were 13 million children living under the poverty line almost one american child in five grows up in a family that cannot pay for the bare essentials of life like food shelter and clothing how can we let this happen today i want people to listen to this today a minimum wage worker in america who puts in 40 hours a week and never takes a vacation day listen to this they earn at minimum wage 10 700 a year before taxes that is not enough for a single mother with one child to clear the poverty line but i think it is the new face of compassionate conservatism that is a fulltime working mom who cannot possibly make ends meet for herself and her child one in five kids in this country grows up in poverty the welfare bill was supposed to counteract these trends and when bill clinton was in office it was doing a good job but the programs that helped welfare reform demonstrate progress like child support

point out what appears to be a trend toward obfuscation in the language of earmarks in drafting a limitation amendment to prevent funding to the jari regional business incubator we used the earmark language exactly as it appears in the bill l 1445 we then asked the parliamentarians to review it to make sure it would be in order we were informed that the region business incubator verbiage was too vague to be considered in order so in drafting this amendment we had no choice but to limit funding to jari period the effect of this amendment would be to prohibit any funding from the bill going to the organization whereas our initial intention was to limit the funding to the business incubator that is part of the problem we have here all we have is the language in a report that is so vague or

administration has already had the ability tq extend the application deadline and has done so three times so if they have the ability to do it and they have done it and they have done it three times and your authorizing chairman would oppose it why would you want to do it in fact the deadline was just extended for another 30 days to april 10 for hurricanes katrina and rita so if there was a need the administration would do it again if the gentlewoman wants to change the parameters of the disaster loans she should work within her position and with the ranking member and come up with something that everyodhe could agree on in the interest of time i would just say that i oppose the amendment it can lead to a lot of problems i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.0032039284706115723,

of new london the supreme court held in a 5 to 4 decision that the citys use of eminent domain to implement its areas redevelopment plan aimed at invigorating a depressed economy wag a public use satisfying the unitedstates constitution even though the property would be turned over from private homeowners and businesses to private developers never in my wildest imagination did i think there would be a supreme court ruling that would take private property and give it to private individuals for private use this decigion was born out of what took place with the giant pharmaceutical company pfizer pfizer built a plant next to an area called fort trumbull and the city determined that someone else could make better use of the land than the people who actually lived there the fort trumbull residents the city handed over its power of eminent domain that is the ability to take private property for public use to the new london development corporation a private body and that private body then exercised eminent domain to take the entire neighborhood for private development the supreme court decision is wrong and i cannot see how any member of the house of representatives could support the taking of private property for private use someone spoke of this as being a pillar of democracy it is a strong american value that we hold dear and i do not think that we should not do something exercise our power in this house to deny the supreme court decision to be used by all of these cities and redevelopment agencies and other entities i believe that we have to protect the american people as a matter of fact one member came and said well you know this is an isolated case it is not i have over 125 cases throughout the united states where cities and other entities community redevelopment agencies in those cities where they can give the eminent domain rights to private developers such as they did in this kelo decision are taking peoples private property what is more many of these entities are trying to take private property take homes and businesses to give over to the bigbox developers who need a lot of land to pu down these bigbox shops i do not believe we can stand by and not do something there are those who would argue that the federal government should not be involved if not us who will protect people we know that you are getting lobbied members are getting lobbied by members of city councils even by mayors but many of them are lying with these developers they have relationships money is changing hands they are in bed with the very developers who want to take the private property for private development again we cannot afford to let this happen what we do here today will help to slow down this taking of private property for private use as far as i am concerned the bill could have even been stronger because we have got a few exciptions in the bill that i question i wanted a pure bill with no exceptions my chairman who worked so hard on this bill made a case for some takings for certain kinds of very very important public use of private lands and even though i am supporting the bill i could support an even stronger bill because i think there should be no exceptions none zilch zero no exceptions i do not believe in taking private property to give to someone else for private use to make money off of you will hear this described in any number of ways the taking of private property to get rid of blight whose blight by whose definition the taking of private property by economic development what kind of economic development who is going to make the money who is going to suffer your home is your castle and for those people who save their money and invest in their homes raise their children that home should be their castle in

lived through hurricane katrina four years ago on september 11th 700 of our friends and neighbors from my state of new jersey never retumed home from work and never returned to their families the smoking ruins of the twin towers were visible for my entire district to see and many of the police and emergency response people that responded so heroically to the attacks were from new jersey i cant tell you how many memorial services i attended for people in my own district nor describe in words the sympathy and sorrow i felt for family members who lost loved ones from all over the country that is why i committed that very day to taking every action to make sure that our nation and her citizens never have to go through what we did on that terrible day four years ago and since we know the

and i would like to thank the gentleman from new york for his extraordinary leadership on this issue americans have high hopes for the future of the space program but if we are to explore the boundaries of our final frontier through the presidents vision for space exploration nasa and its manned space flight program must be adequately supported this legislation does just that and it also gives nasa administrator mike griffin the tools he needs to work towards the completion of the international space station in the 1960s president kennedy helped us begin the race to the moon and the united states reached that lofty goal six times with the nation watching and listening to every mission we won that race then and now we must adopt again the same spirit of enthusiasm for space exploration accordingly president bush has laid out a plan that sets a goal of returning americans to the moon within 15 years however the success of the vision or space exploration is predicated on these goals being in the heart of tomorrows scientists and engineers to meet this need the presidents plan will again make space exploration an exciting and educational priority for america he has made it clear within the next half century america will be the world leader in space exploration with missions to the moon mars and beyond we must keep in mind that we are not the only ones pursuing this goal and america is once again in a space race european countries are peacefully competing against us in a race to be the first country to land a man on mars and to win this race nasa must work with the private sector universities around the nation and possibly other countries to overcome the most challenging technological obstacles nasa has yet to face the successes that are surely to come from the vision will benefit not only america and its manned space flight program but humanity and our planet will be direct benefactors of this historic undertaking in a world tattered by war and terrorism the nasa space exploration program brings the hope and promise of a brighter tomorrow for our children and for future generations our goals to explore the endless boundaries of our universe
