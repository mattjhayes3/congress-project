of chicago the south suburbs and cook and will counties a lot of industrial as well as farm communities and even though this district that i represent is so very very diverse i find there is a common message and that is the folks back home want us to come here republicans and democrats and work together to find solutions to the challenges that we face that is why i am so proud that over the last 5 years we have done so many things we were told we could not do we balanced the budget for the first time in 28 years we gave a middleclass tax cut for the first time in 16 years we reformed our welfare system for the first time in a generation and a great accomplishment just this past year was we stopped the raid on social security for the first time in 30 years that is progress on our agenda and we are continuing to move forward to find better ways to help find solutions our agenda is pretty simple paying down the public national debt saving social security and medicare helping our local schools and we also want to bring fairness to the tax code that is one of the issues i want to talk about today because i believe that as we work to bring fairness to the tax code particularly to middleclass working families that we should focus first on the most unfair consequence of our current complicated tax code and that is the marriage tax penalty which is suffered by almost 21 million married working couples let me explain what the marriage tax penalty is under our current tax code if they are married both husband and wife are working they pay more in taxes than they do if they stay single let me give this example a marriage tax penalty example a machinist and a schoolteacher middleclass working folks in joliet illinois with a combined income of 63 000 paymore and here is how they do it if they have a machinist making 31 500 he is in the 15 percent tax bracket if he marries a schoolteacher with an identical income of 31 500 under our tax code they file jointly their combined income of 63 000 pushes them into the 28 percent tax bracket and for this machinist and schoolteacher they pay the average marriage tax penalty of almost 1 400 more just because they are married under our tax code now if they chose to live together instead of getting married they would have saved that 1 400 our tax code punishes them if they choose to get married that is just wrong it is a pretty fair question is it right is it fair that under our tax code this machinist and schoolteacher in joliet illinois pay more in higher taxes let me give my colleagues another example here of two schoolteachers also of joliet illinois michelle and shad hallihan they were just married in the last couple of years a wonderful young couple i have had a chance to sit down and talk with them and of course i have a nice wedding photo the point is that shad has taught a little longer than michelle and he makes 38 000 a year his wife michelle makes 23 500 because they chose to get married to live together in holy matrimony they suffer the marriage tax penalty because their combined income when they file jointly pushes them into the 28 percent tax bracket for them for michelle and shad hallihan in joliet illinois two schoolteachers they pay almost a thousand dollars more michelle has pointed out to me since they have just had a baby that is almost 3 000 diapers that 1 000 of marriage tax penalty would pay for in that family if they were allowed to keep it now the republicans in this congress believe that eliminating the marriage tax penalty should be a priority and we believe that in this era of budget surpluses when the federal government is taking in more than we have been spending that we should give some of it back we want to focus that on bringing fairness to the tax code this past year we sent to the president legislation that would have wiped out the marriage tax penalty for people like michelle and shad hallihan unfortunately the president and vice president gore chose to veto that legislation because they wanted to spend the money on new government programs my colleagues should it not be a priority to help people like michelle and shad hallihan married working couples who work hard and who are unfairly treated by our tax code we have legislation today which now has 230 cosponsors a bipartisan majority of this house that is cosponsoring the marriage tax elimination act h r 6 cosponsored by myself and the gentleman from missouri and the gentleman from indiana as well as 230 members of the house that is why it is so important we want to bring fairness to the tax code that is why i am so pleased that the leadership of this house led by the gentleman from illinois the speaker of the house has made a decision to move a standalone piece of legislation a standalone bill which wipes out the marriage tax penalty for the vast majority of those who suffer in the next few weeks the speaker intends to bring that legislation to the floor that is good news as we work to bring fairness to the tax code by eliminating the marriage tax penalty i was just informed earlier today that the president in his state of the union speech tonight is going to discuss eliminating the marriage tax penalty that is good news because it is time to make it a bipartisan effort and while the president and vice president gore vetoed the legislation last year he is now coming our way i am very pleased let us make it a bipartisan effort let us wipe out the marriage tax penalty and let us send the president a standalone bill and let us bring fairness to the tax code"], [0.01736772060394287, 0.01736772060394287, 0, "i thank the gentlewoman from ohio my good friend and the gentleman from massachusetts for the opportunity to address this house i rise in strong support of eliminating the marriage tax penalty i rise in strong support of the house and senate going to conference and sending to the president this week legislation that wipes out what i consider to be the most unfair tax of all we have often asked from the well of the house a pretty simple basic question that is is it right is it fair that under our tax code 25 million married working couples pay higher taxes just because they are married is it right is it fair that 25 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 in higher taxes just because they are married and today the only way to avoid that marriage tax penalty when both the man and the women that are in the workforce is either not get married or get divorced it is wrong that under our tax code one pays higher taxes just because they are married i was so proud of this house just this past week when we passed and sent to the senate legislation which wiped out the american tax penalty for 25 million couples this afternoon the senate by a vote of 61 to 38 an overwhelming vote including democrats joining with republicans voted to eliminate the marriage tax penalty of course the bills are a little bit different we have to work out the differences the bottom line is we want to eliminate the marriage tax penalty let me give an example of a couple from the district that i represent in the south side of chicago in the south suburbs who suffer the marriage tax penalty this is michelle and shad hallihan they are two public school teachers they live just outside joliet illinois shad teaches at joliet high school michelle teaches at manhattan junior high they suffer about 1 000 in marriage tax penalty their combined income is about 62 000 they are homeowners and i would point out that since we introduced the bill to eliminate the marriage tax penalty a year and a half ago shad and michelle have since had a little baby if the democrats have their way this child will probably be out of college before we eliminate the marriage tax penalty because there is always an excuse not to do it today the bottom line is for michelle and shad hallihan and for their new little baby ben 1 400 the average marriage tax penalty is real money in the joliet area 1 400 is 3 months of day care at a local child care center for little ben 1 400 is 3 000 diapers for little ben 1 400 is one years tuition at a community college called joliet junior college in joliet illinois it is a washer and dryer for their home our legislation that passed the house of representatives will help people like michelle and shad hallihan the democrats talk about their alternative it would leave michelle and shad hallihan out they would still be stuck with the marriage tax penalty under our legislation which passed the house of representatives with the vote of every republican and also 48 democrats who broke with their leadership to support the elimination of the marriage tax penalty we helped couples two public school teachers like shad and michelle hallihan as i pointed out earlier shad and michelle are homeowners they also have a baby and of course they give money to church and charity so that means they itemize their taxes under our proposal we double the standard deduction to twice that for single people under our proposal that helps those who do not itemize but if we are going to help people like michelle and shad hallihan we have to help itemizers that means we need to widen the tax bracket so in the 15 percent bracket two joint filers a couple with two incomes have to be able to earn twice as much as what a single person can earn in that tax bracket under our proposal in the 15 percent tax bracket we widen it so that twoearner households can earn twice as much that will help shad and michelle hallihan i would point out that the proposal that the gentleman from massachusetts talked about would not help those who itemize and think about it most middleclass families who itemize their taxes itemize because they own a home or they give money to church and charity we as members of congress can all think of our neighbors back home middleclass working families who pursue the american dream they buy a home and because of their mortgage interest costs and because of their property taxes they itemize their taxes the democrats say if one itemizes their taxes they are rich so they should continue to suffer the marriage tax penalty now michelle and shad make 62 000 a year back in the south suburbs of chicago that is kind of a middleclass working family under the democrat definition of rich they are rich making 62 000 a year our goal is to make the tax code more fair when i am in the south side of chicago at a steel workers hall in the tenth ward or a legion post in joliet or at a local iron workers hall in la salle or a chamber of commerce function or coffee shop people tell me theirs taxes are too high but they also point out that the tax code is unfair that is why we should help people like michelle and shad hallihan let us eliminate the marriage tax penalty let us go to conference"], [0.018142223358154297, 0.9818577766418457, 1, "i stand in strong

new teachers and to reduce class sizes i am concerned by the fact that this bill would eliminate head start for some 53 000 children and cut 1 3 billion for urgent repairs to schools across the country these are critical issues for my district and for many districts across the country this bill will also eliminate school counselors serving 100 000 children this action will deprive schools of the professionals they need to identify and help troubled children this bill also does considerable injustice to bilingual and immigrant education the amount included in the bill for programs addressing these issues is 54 million below the budget request the professional development of our bilingual education teachers is critically important the labor hhs and education bill in its current form provides an amount that is 28 5 million below the budget request for the important programs of bilingual education professional development the grants that are provided for the development of our teachers in bilingual education are needed to increase the pool of trained teachers and strengthen the skills of teachers who provide instruction to students who have limited english proficiency these

dislocated worker program by 207 million below the 2000 level these cuts will make it more difficult for these workers to find jobs this bill also cuts adult job training for almost 40 000 adults the

workers our homeless veterans there are over a quarter million homeless veterans in this country and the provisions in this bill will deny employment assistance to thousands of these americans who have faithfully served their country this is unacceptable the root of these problems is that in order to pay for the proposed republican trilliondollar tax breaks for the wealthiest americans we are

of billions of dollars is hard to comprehend let me explain how that translates to our constituents in my congressional district over 140 000 taxpayers are penalized by the tax code simply because they are married in illinois 1 1 million couples or 2 2 million taxpayers are hit with a marriage penalty nationwide there are some 50 million individuals paying a marriage penalty on average these

the tax code is immoral because it penalizes those values we pass along to our children we encourage our children to get married and start a family and to save their money for the proverbial rainy day unfortunately once they marry theyre immediately punished by the tax code that charges them more than when they were single and dont get me started on capital gains taxes and estate taxes punishing

alone made the decision the constitutional requirement that only congress shall declare war is obviously a dead letter yet the administrations embarrassing bungling in kosovo illustrates just why the framers intended that the decision to go be nested in the legislative according to mr bandow he also quoted abraham lincoln who said kings had always been involving and impoverishing their people in wars pretending that the good of the people was the object lincoln added that the constitutional requirement that only congress could declare war came about because war was the most oppressive of kingly oppressions and the framers naturally resolved to so frame the constitution that no one man should hold the power of bringing this suppression on us james madison wrote that the constitution supposes what the history of all governments demonstrates that the executive is the branch of power most interested in war and most prone to it it has accordingly with studied care vested the question of war in the legislature of course very few people seem to care that we so routinely violate our constitution today the christian science monitor had a special section last year showing that there

again criminalizing abortion this optimism and current effort must be seriously challenged as a prolife obstetriciangynecologist i strongly condemn the events of the last third of the 20th century in which we have seen the casual acceptance of abortion on demand the laws failure to protect the weakest smallest and most innocent of all the whole human race has undermined our respect for all life and therefore for all liberty as we have seen once life is no longer unequivocally protected the loss of personal liberty quickly follows the roe v wade ruling will in time prove to be the most significantly flawed supreme court ruling of the 20th century not only for its codification through an unconstitutional court action of a social consensus that glorified promiscuity and abortion of convenience and for birth control but for flaunting as well the constitutional system that requires laws of this sort be left to the prerogative of the states alone a single roe v wade ruling by one state would be far less harmful than a supreme court ruling that nullifies all state laws protecting the unborn achieving the goal of dehumanizing all human life by permitting the casting aside all preborn life any time prior to birth including partially born human beings roe v wade represents a huge change in attitudes toward all life and liberty now prolife members are engaged in a similar process of writing more national laws in hopes of balancing the courts error this current legislative effort is just as flawed traditionally throughout our history except for the three constitutional provisions all crimes of violence have beenand should remainstate matters yet this legislation only further undermines the principle of state jurisdiction and our system of law enforcement which has served us well for most of our history getting rid of roe v wade through a new court ruling or by limiting federal jurisdiction would return this complex issue to the states making the killing of an unborn infant a federal crime as this bill does further institutionalizes the process of allowing federal courts to destroy the constitutional jurisdiction of the states but more importantly the measure continues the practice of only protecting some life by allowirg unborn children to be killed by anyone with an m d after his name by protecting the abortionist this legislation carves out a niche in the law that further ingrains in the system the notion that the willful killing of an innocent human bzing is not deserving of our attention with more than a million children a year dying at the hands of abortionists it is unwise that we ignore these acts for the sake of political expediency proabortion opponents of this legislation are needlessly concerned regarding its longterm meaning and supporters are naively hoping that unintended consequences will not occur state laws have already established clearly that a fetus is a human being deserving protection for example inheritance laws acknowledge that the unborn child does enjoy the estate of his father numerous states already have laws that correctly punishes those committing acts of murder against a fetus although this legislation is motivated by the best of intentions of those who strongly defend the inalienable rights of the unborn it is seriously flawed and will not achieve its intended purpose for that reason i shall vote against the bill and for the sanctity of life and the rights of the states and against the selected protection of abortionists today congress will vote to further instill and codify the illadvised roe versus wade decision while it is the independent duty of each branch of the federal government to act constitutionally congress will likely ignore not only its constitutional limits but earlier criticisms from chief justice william h rehnquist as well the unborn victims of violence act of 1999 h r 2436 would amend title 18 united states code for the laudable goal of protecting unborn children from assault and murder however by expanding the class of victims to which unconstitutional but alreadyexisting federal murder and assault statutes apply the federal government moves yet another step closer to a national police state of course it is much easier to ride the current wave of federalizing every human misdeed in the name of saving the world from some evil than to uphold a constitutional oath which prescribes a procedural structure by which the nation is protected from what is perhaps the worst evil totalitarianism who after all wants to be amongst those members of congress who are portrayed as soft on violent crimes initiated against the unborn nevertheless our federal government is constitutionally a govemment of limited powers article one section eight enumerates the legislative areas for which the unitedstates congress is allowed to act or enact legislation for every other issue the federal government lacks any authority or consent of the governed and only the state governments their designees or the people in their private market actions enjoy such rights to governance the tenth amendment is brutally clear in stating the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states respectively or to the people our nations history makes clear that the unitedstates constitution is a document intended to limit the power of central government no serious reading of historical events surrounding the creation of the constitution could reasonably portray it differently however congress does more damage than just expanding the class to whom federal murder and assault statutes apply it further entrenches and seemingly concurs with the roe versus wade decision the courts intrusion into rights of states and their previous attempts to protect by criminal statute the unborns right not to be aggressed against by specifically exenipting from prosecution both abortionists and the mothers of the unborn as is the case with this legislation congress appears to say that protection of the unborn child is not a federal matter but conditioned upon motive in fact the judiciary committee in marking up the bill took an odd legal turn by making the assault on the unborn a strict liability offense insofar as the bill does not even require knowledge on the part of the aggressor that the unborn child exists murder statutes and common law murder require intent to kill which implies knowledge on the part of the aggressor here however we have the odd legal philosophy that an abortionist with full knowledge of his terminal act is not subject to prosecution while an aggressor acting without knowledge of the childs existence is subject to nearly the full penalty of the law the bill exempts the murderer from the death sentenceyet another diminution of the unborns personhood status it is becoming more and more difficult for congress and the courts to pass the smell test as government simultaneously treats the unborn as a person in some instances and as a nonperson in others in this first formal complaint to congress on behalf of the federal judiciary chief justice william h rehnquist said the trend to federalize crimes that have traditionally been handled in state courts threatens to change entirely the nature of our federal system rehnquist further criticized congress for yielding to the political pressure to appear responsive to every highly publicized societal ill or sensational crime perhaps equally dangerous is the loss of another constitutional protection which comes with the passage of more and more federal criminal legislation constitutionally there are only three federal crimes these are treason against the united states piracy on the high seas and counterfeiting and because the constitution was amended to allow it for a short period of history the manufacture sale or transport of alcohol was concurrently a federal and state crime concurrent jurisdiction crimes such as alcohol prohibition in the past and federalization of murder today erode the right of citizens to be free of double jeopardy the fifth amendment to the unitedstates constitution specifies that no person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb in other words no person shall be tried twice for the same offense however in united states v lanza the high court in 1922 sustained a ruling that being tried by both the federal government and a state government for the same offense did not offend the doctrine of double jeopardy one danger of unconstitutionally expanding the federal criminal justice code is that it seriously increases the danger that one will be subject to being tried twice for the same offense despite the various pleas for federal correction of societal wrongs a national police force is neither prudent nor constitutional occasionally the argument is put forth that states may be less effective than a centralized federal government in dealing with those who leave one state jurisdiction for another fortunately the constitution provides for the procedural means for preserving the integrity of state sovereignty over those issues delegated to it via the tenth amendment the privilege and immunities clause as well as full faith and credit clause allow states to exact judgments from those who violate their state laws the constitution even allows the federal government to legislatively preserve the procedural mechanisms which allow states to enforce their substantive laws without the federal government imposing its substantive edicts on the states article iv section 2 clause 2 makes provision for the rendition of fugitives from one state to another while not selfenacting in 1783 congress passed an act which did exactly this there is of course a cost imposed upon states in working with one another rather than relying on a national unified police force at the same time there is a greater cost to centralization of a police power it is important to be reminded f the benefits of federalism as well as the costs there are sound reasons to maintain a system of smaller independent jurisdictionsit is called competition and yes governments must for the sake of the citizenry be allowed to compete we have obsessed so much over the notion of competition in this country we harangue someone like bill gates when by offering superior products to every other similarlysituated entity he becomes the dominant provider of certain computer products rather than allow someone who serves to provide value as made obvious by their voluntary exchanges in the free market we lambaste efficiency and economies of scale in the private marketplace curiously at the same time we further centralize government the ultimate monopoly and one empowered by force rather than voluntary exchange when small governments become too oppressive with their criminal laws citizens can vote with their feet to a competing jurisdiction if for example one does not want to be forced to pay taxes to prevent a cancer patient from using medicinal marijuana to provide relief from pain and nausea that person can move to arizona if one wants to bet on a football game without the threat of government intervention that person can live in nevada as government becomes more and more centralized it becomes much more difficult to vote with ones feet to escape the relatively more oppressive governments governmental units must remain small with ample opportunity for citizen mobility both to efficient governments and away from those which tend to be oppressive centralization of criminal law makes such mobility less and less practical protection of life born or unborn against initiations of violence is of vital importance so vitally important in fact it must be left to the states criminal justice systems we have seen what a legal constitutional and philosophical mess results from attempts to federalize such an issue numerous states have adequately protected the unborn against assault and murder and done so prior to the federal governments unconstitutional sanctioning of violence in the roe v wade decision unfortunately h r 2436 ignores the danger of further federalizing that which is properly reserved to state governments and in so doing throws legal philosophy the constitution the bill of rights and the insights of chief justice rehnquist out with the baby and the bathwater for these reasons i must oppose h r 2436 the unborn victims of violence

arisen since fdrs first administration judging by the comments of the white house we have even more reason to be concerned mr podesta the presidents chief of staff has outlined the presidents plan to issue a series of executive orders and other directives that will become the force and effect of law thus if unchallenged the president has taken legislative power without first getting the okay from congress congress should be outraged by the presidents staff as they look for ways to bypass the legislative branch we have seen this before when the president issued his executive order on striker replacement he attempted to do what had been denied him by the regular legislative process in addition when the president issued his proclamation establishing a national monument in utah he again tried to do what he had been unable to do in congress i am deeply concerned with executive lawmaking and if congress does not openly challenge the president we are surely surrendering our liberty it seems clear that the president plans on using executive orders and other presidential directives to implement his agenda without the consent of congress executive lawmaking is a violation of the constitution and the doctrine of separation of powers as article i states all legislative powers shall be vested in the congress in the legislative veto decision of 1983 the supreme court insisted that congressional power be exercised in accord with a single finely wrought and exhaustively considered procedure the court said that the records of the philadelphia convention and the state ratification debates provide unmistakable expression of a determination that the legislation by the national congress be a stepbystep deliberate and deliberative process if congress is required to follow this rigorous process how absurd it is to argue that a president can accomplish the same result by unilaterally issuing executive orders or presidential proclamations we must not be lulled into complacency it is time to clarify the scope of executive authority vested in the presidency by article ii of the constitution the supreme court has failed to address this issue and it is time for congress to invoke the powerful weapons at its command through its ability to authorize programs and appropriate funds congress can define and limit presidential power as members we must participate in our fundamental duty of overseeing executive policies passing judgment on them and behaving as the legislative branch should eternal vigilance is still the price of liberty mr speaker"]],

identified expenditures for the conservation and recovery of threatened and endangered species under the esa this report includes an accounting of expenditures from all federal agencies and from all states that receive section 6 grant funding for conservation activities over the years this report has been a valuable tool to discern priorities and trends in how and where esa funds are spent unfortunately the section 18 report was included in the list of unnecessary report requirements when congress passed the federal reports elimination and sunset act of 1995 consequently this report requirement was scheduled to sunset on december 21 1999 provided that congress does not act to reauthorize it this bill would correct the initial oversight and simply reauthorize this valuable report

mention one issue where the chair and i disagree he is on the winning side i am on the losing side but in the context of our federal system in this country there are certain things that the federal government has responsibilities for there are other things that state government has responsibility clearly one area where the states have preeminence is creating and enforcing the traffic laws of our country one of the most difficult issues for states to deal with is to establish the framework for dealing with drunk drivers that involves their responsibility not only for creating law but creating a court system to deal with it creating the enforcement mechanisms creating and spending the money for penalties and creating and spending the money for treatment there are many components that go into a state having a rational and strong drunk driving law in my judgment it is a serious mistake for the federal government to move in on one component of a complex and difficult problem and say to the states you do what we think is right or we will take your highway money away or a portion of your highway money away it is the type of thing we do too frequently in this institution not with careful thought but simply because somebody at some point thinks it is a good idea we add it as a rider to a bill and the states have to comply it may or may not be the right thing to do it may vary from state to state what i am certain of however is that setting the blood alcohol content level is only one small part of establishing a comprehensive drunk driving policy for a state and for us to insert our judgment on simply this one issue and leaving the states with all the complexity of other things to deal with to me represents the arrogance at times that we carry in the federal government

that children think differently than we do those certificates will last those children until they die they will go with them that is something that they can look back on and say that i was recognized

world our current statutory framework has remained stuck in the 30s because of congresss reluctance to act hampering the ability of our financial institutions to compete in the absence of congressional action federal agencies the courts and the industry have been forced to find loopholes and novel interpretations of the law to allow financial institutions to adapt to an everchanging marketplace unfortunately this has resulted in piecemeal regulatory reform that may not be in the best interest of the unitedstates financial services industry as a whole as elected representatives of congress it is our constitutional duty to make the important policy decisions that determine the structure and legal authority under which our financial institutions will operate for congress to not act today would be a serious abdication of our responsibility throughout this process i have based my support for this bill on some very fundamental principles it must 1 preserve the safety and soundness of the financial system including the federal deposit system and the rest of the federal safety net 2 provide for fair and equal competition and 3 protect consumers and enhance their choices h r 10 maintains these fundamental principles much like the bill we passed last year h r 10 creates a new holding company structure under which entities that are financial in nature can directly affiliate this new holding company will be overseen by the federal reserve board but each affiliate will be regulated by its own functional regulator h r 10 includes important new consumer privacy provisions requiring banking institutions to tell customers their policies for sharing customers financial information with bird parties for marketing purposes it would also makes pretext calling illegal in addition the bill prohibits all insurance companies including companies not affiliated under a financial holding company from disclosing medical information to third partieswithout prior consent in addition to these important privacy provisions my colleagues and i will later be offering an amendment that further enhances privacy protection finally we have included legislation that i introduced which provides important consumer atm disclosures these provisions mandate clear atm fee disclosures and guarantees the consumers rights to opt out of a transaction before a fee is charged this legislation also includes language i proposed to allow new financial holding companies to retain or acquire commercial entities that are complimentary to their current or future financial activities while i do not support full mixing of banking and commerce this amendment accepts the reality that the lines between financial and commerce are blurring at a time when we are allowing various financial to affiliate and create new financial holding companies it is prudent to provide flexibility for companies to engaged in activities which may not meet the definition of financial but are complimentary to the financial activities this provision stipulates that the investment in the complimentary activity must remain small and will be subject to federal reserve review for those of us that serve on the banking committee we are painfully aware of how controversial the issues surrounding the financial services industry can be to say the least various sectors of the financial services industry have had different and often conflicting views on how best to go about modernization but h r 10 includes many compromises between all of the interested parties andit deserves our support did everyone get everything they wanted no they did not in fact i strongly oppose the operating subsidiary provisions included in this bill we must work to improve this regulatory structure in conference in addition while i support the provisions in the bill that would close the unitary thrift loophole i do not support permitting the transferability of unitary thrift holding companies to commercial entities the unitary thrift provisions included in this bill today do not prohibit transfers to commercial entities in short allowing the transferability of unitary thrifts to commercial entities in the same as allowing full banking and commerce i do not support full banking and commerce and believe it could pose serious safety and soundness risks to the deposit insurance fund we respect to the operating subsidiary i am concerned that losses in an operating subsidiary could ultimately affect the parent bank a case in point is the first options continental illinois problems in the late 1980scontinental illinois lost considerable more than its investment in first options while there are firewalls in place that limit the amount of bank investment in times of stress firewalls melt such was the case with first options continental illinois where continental illinois injected millions of dollars to prevent the failure of first options furthermore the likely result of allowing bank operating subsidiaries is that an independent securities industry will become a thing of thepast the advantage that the unitedstates economy has enjoyed is that the credit and capital markets have grown up separately and are strong with each having a great deal of depth not having an independent securities industry will seriously undermine these vitally important markets innovation will be stifled and these markets will become less competitive and importantly it will make it much harder on the unitedstates economy to address economic downturns because the securities system will become

reasons i will continue to work to change the operating subsidiary and unitary thrift provisions included in h r 10 as this bill moves through conference however despite the problems i have with these specific provisions i believe that we must act today to pass this landmark legislation there is far too much in this bill that warrants our support we have come too far to turn back now if we fail to act today we will lose the opportunity to reform our financial system in a meaningful rational way its now or never years of good faith negotiation and compromise have gone into this bill support the

these transactions in 1997 opic financed the building for levi strauss of a garmentmaking factory in turkey a 29million guarantee because they did not want to finance it themselves and private insurers would not do it well what happened when levi strauss built that factory they laid off 6 400 workers at unitedstates garmentmaking factories in 11 locations in the united states now do my colleagues think that those 6 400 employees if any of them are listening today that they will buy this argument that we are creating jobs we lost those jobs and not only did we lose those jobs but the

beautiful boys i am personally and professionally invested toward excellent public schools for all americans like most of my colleagues i support flexibility in the administration of federal education programs i do not support flexibility in the administration of these programs if this flexibility results in inadequate accountability of taxpayers dollars or an erosion of our fiscal commitment to our nations poorest students and school districts h r 800 in its current form provides inadequate accountability to ensure that there is accurate valid and reliable reporting it would also allow states to abandon the mission of title i of the elementary and secondary education act esea which is to serve our poorest schools and children first this waste of taxpayer dollars and the abandonment of our poorest children is something that i and most thinking americans should not tolerate i oppose this bill for the following reasons while h r 800 is being touted as a bipartisan education initiative this bill lacks protections for how title i funds are allocated within school districts when the elementary and secondary education act esea was originally written in 1965 it was clear that the performance of students at high poverty schools was relatively low regrettably this is still true that is why title i was created to help improve the gap between low and high income students as evidenced by a recent assessment of the title i program that gap still exists and students in high poverty schools continue to be in need of targeted assistance this bill removes that targeted aid this bill does not target funding for the poorest school districts or the poorest students school wide programs under esea allow the use of title i funds to be used for services to schools with a 50 or higher poverty rate in the past these programs in esea have been used to institute reform initiatives and reduce the pupil to teacher ratio at high poverty schools under h r 800 edflex states are given the authority to allow all schools to participate in school wide programs under title i regardless of their lowincome child percentages giving school districts the authority to use title i funds for school wide programs at any school regardless of the number children who are lowincome dilutes the purpose of the title i this legislation does not monitor how its funds are being used to improve education as a member of the house appropriations committee i am directed to ensure and guard over the purse of the american people if we as elected officials are going to make a financial investment of 50 billion or more in federal education funds over the next several years for the programs included in this bill it should not be too much to ask two simple requirements one is that there is a viable plan in place to serve the students who are the intended beneficiaries of the programs the second would be that states and school districts show progress in meeting their goals this bill provides neither jse huu1 the citizens of our nation want and deserve a decent education for all of our children we need 100 000 more qualified instructors in our schools we need to repair refurbish

of the committee on the judiciary and this congress and this nation lived with for many days and many months this morning i had the privilege of listening to the new speaker of the house and he asked that we get down to the peoples business so i rise to oppose the appointment of managers because i believe that i want to ask or answer the question affirmatively to the american people who have asked me repeatedly as i have traveled about this nation when will we this congress listen to the will of the american people and what i want to say to the american people is that you have not only good sense but good judgment for the constitution of the united states does not prohibit does not prohibit the censuring of the president of the united states it does not provide for but it does not prohibit but yet on this floor this lame duck congress forbade some 200plus members of this house as well the american people to have fully debated a censure resolution that would heal this nation i recollect what the constitutional framers had in mind when they offered the provision that said treason bribery and other high crimes and misdemeanors would be the grounds for impeachment what they meant was what george mason stated so eloquently these are offenses that would undermine the constitution and destroy the government what we have here are private indiscretions we have the politics of undermining of the individual yes we recognize the wrongness of the acts of the president we recognize that they are unacceptable but we also understand that if this country is to survive if we are not to lower the bar of impeachment for the year 2020 or 2030 if we are not to accuse someone who is president because of your religious beliefs or because you are divorced you want to impeach if we are not to give credence to the partisanship of this impeachment we must now vote against the appointment of these managers i would simply say i speak really to the new members who have come i speak in all humility and respect for each of you who have been elected to this great body you now hate a very historic opportunity to stop these divisive and unfair and partisan accusations on the grounds that this president should be impeached because there is no substance to it you can now vote to censure this president and heal this nation a legitimate constitutionally founded censure resolution

we face the prospect of adopting a budget and the possibility that we will have a concurrent resolution with the senate that actually is the type of budget resolution that we have held to passing in 1998 it turned out that the leadership of the institution was not capable of bringing up and passing a budget resolution i think that was a tragic flaw that existed in the leadership of speaker gingrich in 1998 and i am pleased to see that we are moving past that stage here in 1999 at least i hope we are the question really then is what type of a budget will we end up with here in 1999 the thing that i would like to emphasize in our discussions this evening is that there are a variety of views as to how we should handle the possible abundance the opportunity to make prudent decisions in a time of a possible budget surplus essentially we have three different choices that we will face tomorrow the majority will be proposing that we take the entire surplus that is generated from various federal operations from revenue collection to the operation of agencies but excluding social security and the post office that we take that surplus and we return it to the taxpayers now this sounds good i think all of us would like to do that but then some of us ask what about this national debt that we have what about priorities that we have as a country for some the priorities are education for others it is veterans for others it is the environment for some it is the defense of our nation for others it is agriculture for others it is health care and the list goes on we are spending here in 1999 substantially more money by some counts 35 billion more than what people are promising we can live by in the year 2000 and yet from what i can tell the republicans and the democrats in this h1682 co body alike that are on the committee on appropriations feel this is an unrealistic position so the question is is it realistic to try to return all of this money or are we going to leave ourselves severely strapped i daresay that there is not a person in this body that does not expect we would leave ourselves severely strapped another approach is to invest the money in priority programs and a third approach is to try to find a mix the blue dog coalition of which i am a member it is a group of moderate to conservative democrats will propose a budget tomorrow that has a mix in that sense it is similar to the budget proposed by the gentleman from south carolina we propose taking 50 percent of the money that is in surplus and using it to reduce the 5 6 trillion debt 25 percent of the money to be used as a tax reduction measure or for tax reductions and 25 percent for program priorities we feel that this is a responsible division of how the budget surplus ought to be used it recognizes the needs that we face here in america health care education defense veterans agriculture environment and others at the same time it recognizes the responsibility that we have in a time of prosperity and affluence to pay down our national debt to the maximum extent possible while at the same time trying to give a dividend to the taxpayers and meet the needs of our great

strengthen the legislation that we had in committee it does provide for increases in accountability and improvements in teacher quality items within the legislation i think it is a very important amendment because it embodies what all of us have been saying on both sides of the aisle that questions of simple class size are not enough that it is not enough that students spend either more hours with or there is fewer students with an unqualified teacher what we must put in the front of the classroom are qualified teachers this legislation with the goodling amendments for the first time de mands that local school districts put qualified teachers into the classroom it demands for the first time that we hold school districts accountable which is the basic purpose of this legislation and efca and that is in fact that we close the gap between rich and poor between minority and majority in this country and that we hold districts accountable for doing that up until the time that this amendment is offered and up until the time that this legislation is passed we have put 120 billion into this program as the gentleman from pennsylvania has reminded us time and time again that money has been sent out and we never asked we never asked that the teachers in the classroom be qualified we said one of the purposes was to close the gap between majority and minority students but nobody was ever held accountable for it what we now know and what we have witnessed now over many many years is that poor and the minorities continue to be held back in this educational system because they do not have qualified teachers and the majority races ahead we also know from years of research and understanding of how children learn that all of those poor children and all of those minority children can in fact learn at the same rate and with the same degree as children in suburban schools middle class schools or upper income schools if we do two things if we reduce class sizes and we put wellqualified teachers and a first class curriculum in front of those children they will learn and they will learn at the same rate we need not accept those losses the goodling amendment is the first step to doing this and every member of this house ought to support this amendment i will be supporting the martinez substitute because of the targeting provisions but we will talk about that

industry as well as its beneficiaries and supporters here in the congress indeed big tobacco is three for three with this congress first this particular bill grants it a new type of trademark protection that our federal law does not provide to any other industry in the entire world this special protection will cost federal taxpayers millions of dollars to provide this special cuddly treatment to the tobacco industry second the house has already approved from the committee on ways and means a very nice gift of about 100 million a year in federal tax subsidies to the tobacco industry to promote sales of tobacco abroad third the same friends of tobacco over in the senate who tucked this provision in are restricting through the appropriations process our ability to maintain a lawsuit in federal court to allow federal taxpayers to recoup all the losses we have had as a result of the tobacco industry and its misdeeds americans can look at what has happened indeed not only with this bill but over the last 6 years in this house and rightly say that the tobacco industry has a stranglehold on the united states house of representatives sometimes those of us who care about public health can prevent some of the wrongdoing but we are totally unable to overcome the power of the tobacco industry to get largely what it wants from this congress as a result 3 000 children every day will get addicted to tobacco and tobacco will remain a world pandemic affecting millions of people and causing millions of deaths so while big tobacco has plenty to celebrate this evening with the special treatment that congress is according it we who are concerned with this plague have hope for a better congress next year that will be more sensitive to public health needs this particular measure prohibits socalled gray market cigarettes for example marlboros that are made in mexico and imported into the united states and sold at discounted rates by discounters around the country reasonable measures to address these gray market cigarettes are not unreasonable the state attorneys general have rightly complained that these tobacco products are sold and the revenues though they pay federal and state excise taxes fall outside the master settlement account that they negotiated but philip morris and the other tobacco companies have hidden behind the state attorneys general who will really only see for their states pennies while the tobacco industry earns millions of dollars as a direct benefit of this piece of legislation as matt myers the president of the campaign for tobaccofree kids has said we should not be going forward with a gray market bill without addressing the real black market problem that exists in this country these blackmarket smuggled cigarettes are costing our states hundreds of millions of dollars and they are leading to problems not only here but around the world far from hurting business tobacco companies have found that they can move their lethal products around the world by assisting smugglers big tobacco profits from selling cigarettes to smugglers who reduce the price for the black market and increase consumption and sales helping them to build a global market a good example of this right off the pages of the washington post is tobacco affiliate pleads guilty to role in smuggling scheme this was a major smuggling operation through rj reynolds to move cigarettes into canada and avoid the taxes in canada my colleagues will remember that this was the same argument that the tobacco industry used to thwart reform in 1998 saying we were not doing enough about smuggling well this bill provided an excellent opportunity to do just that the gentleman from illinois mentioned that this bill was approved by the committee on ways and means when it was approved by the committee on ways and means it did not have this benefit for the tobacco industry when it was approved by the house of representatives originally it did not have this benefit for the tobacco industry but to avoid real reform they waited until the senate to add it back in knowing how compliant the house would be on this matter it is estimated that about a third of the cigarettes in international commerce are smuggled cigarettes through the black market recent documents in the litigation that has occurred here in the united states shows that unitedstates tobacco companies were well aware of such smuggling and considered it an important advantage to them i believe that we need to do more than just provide special protection for this industry can my colleagues imagine every other industry in america whether it is ralph lauren or nike if they need a trademark protected they do not turn to the customs services or to the alcohol tobacco and firearm divisions of the treasury department they go to court but instead of turning to court what philip morris and the other tobacco companies will do as a result of this bill is that they can turn to the american taxpayer and ask the taxpayer through the treasury department to enforce their trademarks in a way that no other company no other industry is entitled to that is one of the reasons that enact a coalition of 55 major national medical and public health organizations including the american cancer society and the american heart association have urged that we address the black market issue we need to stop the real smuggling problem that affects children in this country and children around the world that will lead to a pandemic in which 10 million unique human beings die every year as a result of addiction we ought to stop the smuggling we ought to stop the mugging of the worlds children through nicotine addiction instead this bill this bill provides more help to
