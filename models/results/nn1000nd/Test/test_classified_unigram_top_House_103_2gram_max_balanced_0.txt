it will lower economic growth by 35 to 50 billion the energy tax will raise the cost of practically every good and service that americans produce resulting in higher prices for consumers and making american workers and companies less competitive in the world market the average american family of four will pay an additional 500 per year in energy costs as a result of the energy tax according to a study by the american petroleum institute this is in addition to the 2 150 that the average household already pays each year in energy costs a study by the affordable energy alliance shows that a large number of the states highpaying industries mining manufacturing construction and agricultureuse a lot of energy and will be the ones hardest hit by the tax if the clinton tax had been in effect in 1990 north carolina residents and industries would have paid 714 8 million in additional energy taxes the alliance notes that a tax burden this large will slow the economy of the state cost jobs and make goods and services produced in north carolina less competitive in world markets consider for example the case of a company in my district called the timken co the timken co is a leading international manufacturer of highly engineered bearings and alloy steels if the proposed energy tax becomes effective the direct cost impact on the company resulting from higher energy needs will be 5 6 million to put that in perspective the companys net income from worldwide operations amounted to only 4 5 milion in 1992 the energy tax will cost manufacturing jobs and diminish the ability of energyintensive industries like the timken co to compete in the international market clintons plan will also raise taxes on social security recipients under current law older americans with a modest income 25 000 for singles and 32 000 for couples pay income taxes on up to 50 percent of their social security benefits but under the clinton proposal seniors will pay taxes on up to 85 percent of

will have a devastating effect on small businesses according to information from the national federation of independent business 80 percent of businesses in america pay taxes as individuals not as corporate entities the tax code also taxes the profits of a business not what the owner takes home this means that business owners are taxed on the money they reinvest back into their business as a

then we discovered the actual total to be only 362 billionwith a health care bill still pending at first the clinton administration wanted to have a spendingcuttotax increase ratio of 2 to 1 but when

of course now we find that the only problem with mr bushs figure was that it was too highactually those making as little as 30 000 will be hit why all these changes because not since a connecticut yankee walked king arthurs court in mark twains tale has someone so unashamedly tried to claim credit for something beyond his control as did mr clinton during the 1992 presidential campaign as you may recall mark twains character claimed credit for a solar eclipse mr clinton intended to make use of expected economic growth when mr clinton began his odyssey from hope cbo was projecting a deficit of only 178 billion in 1996 mr clinton felt any promises he made about reducing the deficit would be kept for him by a rebounding economy for mr clinton this fortuitous event presented itself just as twain wrote concerning his connecticut yankees good fortune but all of a sudden i stumbled on the very thing just by luck i now shoved this whole problem clear out of my mind till its appointed day and hour should come in order that i might turn al my attention to the circumstances of the present moment and be alert and ready to make the most out of them that could be made without the automatic narrowing of the deficit they expected we have had to watch the clinton administration scramble to catch up to their rhetoric unfortunately we have also seen that for all mr clintons vaunted promises of an economic plan all he really had to offer the american people was a tax increasewhich in his plan now amounts to 338 billion the largest in this nations history so large is the gap between the clinton plans promise and reality that my democratic colleagues on the budget committee were forced to try and cover it with 60 billion in unspecified spending cuts the problem with all this backpedaling is that it wont work the administrations taxyounow wellcutlater budget will go the way of the 1990 budget deal when that deal was made the deficit was supposed to be 236 billion this year and 102 billion next year of course that did not happen instead we are back here again as the congressional budget office estimates this years deficit to be 352 billion and next years to be 343 billion why didnt the 1990 deal work because it was a cheshire cat budget deal the spendingcut body of the deal disappeared leaving behind only the toothy grin of the tax increases it is no wonder why the deficit did not go down congress spends all it gets its hands on and then some if this were not the case we would not be in the mess we are in the first place it is no wonder why the economy did go down instead of the deficit when you tax something you discourage the activity when you tax it a lot as was done in 1990 you discourage the activity a lot what is a wonder is that we are again supposed to believe that the deficit and not the economy will be reduced this time by a massive tax increase and massive new spending regrettably mr clinton has joined mark twain as a master of english fiction his budget will not reduce the deficit and it will not produce economic growth it will instead do just the opposite a vote for the clinton plan is a guarantee that we come back to this

now today american inventors are protected from 17 years from the time they are issued a patent the changes in the gatt language say they will be protected now 20 years from the time they file for their patent that would make you think they have 20 years of protection american inventors are not fooled because they know that patent pending means nothing this provision in gatt will basically for americas inventors cut their protection half maybe to a third and maybe wipe it out altogether billions of dollars worth of royalties that would have been going to americas inventors will now be in

have passed a very strong a tough but smart crime bill and under that bill and under all of our understandings i say to my colleagues if you kill somebody you are committing murder and if you kill 10 people youre a serial killer but at least over there in international terms if you kill 200 000 people which is what has happened by the serb nationalists in that attack on 2 united nations members croatia first and then bosnia and i mentioned earlier that the attack on vukovar was at least as vicious as brutal as the kind of result that is happening in gorazde the whole world watching day after day after day did absolutely nothing but that attack 200 000 killed and what were suggesting is please be nice please stop you know something along those lines where every agreement previously has been broken every ceasefire has been violated every imaginable atrocity has been committed and then instantly denied along the way one wonders whether if they kill a hundred thousand more people we will dismantle nato and whether if they kill another 200 000 there will be a ticker tape parade in london or whatever as my colleagues know it really boggles the mind to try to imagine what it is that the worldand the other irony here this is the very anniversary of the 79th year of the genocide committed by the ottoman empire against the armenian minority in eastern turkey and when we talk about never again as it relates to a statement that we will not allow that kind of thing to happen here we are within the western context and there are other contexts around the world where this sort of genocide has occurred and maybe we have just become inured to it but appeasement as the gentleman has so clearly pointed out simply never pays appeasement leads to small worse things later and the ultimate tragedy here in the former yugoslavia comes in several points one of which is that now at least as things stand milosevic in belgrade knows perfectly well that he can do anything he wants in kosovo because no one is going to do anything he thinks if you cant do anything in bosnia clearly you cant do anything in kosovo there is an area where 90 percent of the population is albanian and that group of people has been reduced essentially to servitude their schools have been closed they are not allowed to learn through schools the albanian language albanians have been driven out of their jobs every imaginable kind of atrocity is occurring in the nighttime in an effort to drive those people out and the only time that there seems to have been a credible force a threat of credible force was when the president issued the ultimatum withdraw from sarajevo or youre going to get hit they apparently thought that was the case i think that probably the serb nationalists are fairly convinced now that that is not the case the credible threat of force has now been lost and so we are going into a situation where the tragedy leads on by the other things that that lack of doing

reporting this important rtc funding bill as a battlescarred veteran of previous rtc funding bills i know the pressure many in this house are under when it comes to rtc funding i hope we will all summon the courage to do the right thing and pass this legislation bring to an end this sad chapter in the history of our financial institutions h r 1340 would lift an april 1 1992 cutoff date which ended the rtcs ability to spend previously appropriated funds to finish the cleanup of the thrift mess and permit the rtc to use those remaining 18 billion to continue the process of closing down remaining insolvent s ls and to pay off those depositors which the government insurance program guarantees h r 1340 contains no new funds for the rtc it merely removes an arbitrarily set date for cutting off the use of the funds and permits the rtc to spend the money the congress has already authorized and appropriated for the benefit of my colleagues i want to emphasize this point we are not providing any new funds for the rtc congress was simply wrong and very shortsighted last year in failing to pass similar legislation since april 1 1992 the inability of the rtc to close down insolvent thrifts has cost the american taxpayer up to 3 million each and every day this i say to my colleagues is the real banking scandal of the year this is costing your constituents real money out of their taxpayers pockets our lack of political will up to now has now cost the american taxpayer over s1 billion this is real money this is the real banking scandal 1 billion this unwillingness to fund the rtc is almost as big a scandal and a more complete waste of taxpayer money as even the original s l debacle this lack of political courage also represents the worst example of gridlock which the american voter demanded we end when they went to the polls last november i believe we are simply kidding ourselves and shirking our responsibilities to the thrift depositor and the american taxpayer by refusing to proceed with this funding request i do not need to remind my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that it was a republican administration which went full steam ahead to clean up the s l debacle and it was a republican administration which signed the firrea bill into law creating the rtc and it was a republican administration which first requested this last increment of funds for the rtc and it was many of us republicans in the congress who led the effort on behalf of president bush to explain the need for completing this task last year i believe it is totally irresponsible for all members to decide that innocent depositors and taxpayers no longer matter and that we will not support the final resolution of the s l mess which we demanded be cleaned up i want to urge my colleagues to do the right thingvote for rtc funding we must understand the basic essential delay equates into added and unnecessary costs the failure to pass h r 1340 is costing the american taxpayer money 1 billion more so far how fiscally responsible is that just by way of example many members argued during the budget debate for more cuts in federal spending many used the honey mohair and wool subsidies as examples of how we could cut unnecessary federal spending do you realize that the projected 6year budget savings associated with eliminating those subsidies 72 million has all but been spent since the beginning of the august recess simply by failing to fund the rtc let me repeat to all the members who want to save money by cutting honey and mohair subsidies failure to fund the rtc and close out the s l bailout has already cost 1 billion must we subject our hardworking taxpaying citizens to this irresponsible loss of money to pretend this issue will simply go away is the most irresponsible position we can take i would say to the members wait until their constituents understand the costs they will react yes the s l debacle was an indictment of a deregulation frenzy that went awry and yes it was a sorry commentary on our regulatory process and even on our role as congressional overseers however this is history there simply is no alternative these billions of dollars are buying fairness without the funds the cost of the s l failures would fall on innocent depositors this is the kind of gridlock that causes such cynicism among the american people and loss of faith in the congress people will lose their savings we must face the reality of our commitment to our depositors our citizens our taxpayers and to the very law we created h r 1340 also requires the rtc to make various and important management reforms to its operation these include first revision of the rtcs procedures for reviewing and qualifying applicants for contracts this is an attempt to strengthen contractor systems and oversight and to ensure uniform procurement guidelines second the bill requires the oversight board to establish and audit committee for the rtc and to maintain effecttve internal controls to prevent identify and correct fraud waste and abuse third the bill requires the rtc to appoint an assistant general counsel for professional liability fourth the bill also requires the rtc to maintain effective management information systems to appoint a chief financial officer and requires the gao to report biannually on the progress the rtc is making to implement these management reforms if we are not prepared to accept this course of action what is the answer i urge my colleagues to act as the responsible custodians of the public trust that we are i urge

agreement nafta though their arguments varied the question for me has remained constant what is in the best interest of my country after careful study and consideration i have concluded that nafta is in our best interest and i will vote for it today arriving at this decision has not been easy because people who i have always respected and on whose judgment i have often relied have directly opposing views on this issue particularly painful for me is the criticism my vote will draw from labor and environmental leadersallies of mine over the years in the causes of social justice and environmental protection no issue has been more central to the nafta debate than jobs while the extent of job loss or gain is disputed the anxiety i sense from so many american workers who feel threatened is real ours is an economy in transition and such rapid change is scary and often painful the lingering recession of the past several years combined with defense conversion increased foreign competition increased american labor productivity and the increased demand of american consumers for foreign goods have cost hundreds of thousands of americans their jobs but protectionism is not the answer a no vote on nafta will not bring back the jobs of my nearly 8 000 hudson valley neighbors laid off by ibm last spring or any of the other 500 000 jobs which have left new york state in the past 5 years a no vote will not stop any others from leaving but nafta by phasing out high mexican tariffs removes the incentive to move production to mexico united states companies enjoying highly productive american workers and superior infrastructure need not incur the expense of relocating to sell to the mexican market i am encouraged by a number of reports from the business community about actions they will take if nafta is approved more than 90 textile mills accounting for the majority of textile production in the united states have signed a pledge not to move jobs plants or facilities to mexico if nafta is approved philips electronics will close plants in mexico and move them back to the united states and will be able to continue production in manlius ny instead of moving that plant to mexico at least seven other companies including at t and gm have announced plans to relocate plants from mexico back to the united states in addition numerous companies have plans to vastly expand their work forces in the united states if nafta is approved large corporations are not the only beneficiaries of this agreement smallto mediumsized businesses all over the country including two in westchester county nyeagle export trading co and servialimentoshave told me how nafta will greatly increase their ability to compete for market share in mexico and expand their operation in the united states i am convinced that a no vote on nafta threatens unitedstates leadership in promoting world trade and the chance to position ourselves for a dynamic future of economic growth a no vote puts at risk the gat negotiations with their promise of vastly increased trade and jobs at home a no vote on nafta denies united states products preferential treatment in the growing mexican economy and corresponding jobs at home and a no vote does nothing to promote cleanup of the toxic pollution in our border areas the increasingly high productivity of the american work force producing as much as our country needs or wants demands a larger market for the goods we produce the only way to create and maintain additional jobs particularly in manufacturing is to gain increased access to foreign markets our best hope for the future is an expanding export market to latin america the prospect of markets in a western hemisphere freetrade zone lies ahead and approval of nafta is the first step toward that goal nafta would create the worlds largest trading alliance with 370 million consumers in canada the united states and mexico new york state would be a major beneficiary of its approval mexico is already one of new yorks fastest growing export markets with our states exports to that country having increased by more than 82 percent between 1987 and 1992 since 1987 8 300 jobs have been created in new york because of increased trade with mexico and it is estimated that another 15 000 could be created by 1997 if exports continue at current rates but should nafta cause one job loss or 100 000 job losses in the near term our response must be compassionate and immediate because every job in important and every day makes a difference to someone who is unemployed the federal government must swiftly aid those who are negatively impacted by providing training and retraining job search assistance and counseling secretary of labor robert reich has personally assured me that retraining of dislocated workers is his top priority and he has committed himself and his staff to a comprehensive overhaul of this countrys workeradjustment programs until this new program is in place the implementing legislation before us establishes a program to provide financial assistance and training to workers facing economic dislocations associated with nafta it also requires that a comprehensive study of the operations and effects of nafta be conducted 3 years after its entry into force and this is something i will be carefully monitoring from day one although the creation of new jobs in the united states is the most important single reason for americans to support nafta we must not lose eightof the fact that this agreement will also reduce push factors leading to illegal immigration by spurring economic growth in mexico greater employment opportunities for mexican citizens in their own country mean not only greater consumer demand for american products but also incentives for mexicans to remain at home and participate in mexicos development in judiciary committee testimony earlier this month immigration and naturalization service commissioner doris meissner described nafta as americas best opportunity to reduce illegal immigration from mexico nafta has also been heralded by unitedstates negotiators and private sector advisory reports as the strongest multilateral agreement on intellectual property rights ever negotiated this is critical for unitedstates industry especially hightechnology companies such as biotechnology computer pharmaceutical and others which depend heavily on such protections for their products these innovative and creative industries make tremendous commitments to research and development and are major providers of the hightechnology jobs that we need in this country but their products are subject to piracy abroad ibm for example invests over 36 billion annually in research and development but estimates their losses worldwide to software piracy at about 1 billion annually clearly the need for strong intellectual property protection such as that embodied in nafta for unitedstates companies operating in the global marketplace cannot be overemphasized it is important to put to rest the notion that our national sovereignty is surrendered by nafta provisions creating binational panels to resolve disputes there is nothing in nafta that requires we change our laws as a result of a ruling by a binational panel we are still in control of our laws also we can disregard any ruling of a binational panel and not be any worse off all that can happen is that the complaining country can raise their tariffs which they are at liberty to do without nafta to those who have heard that nafta will sacrifice american sovereignty jack kemp ronald reagan william f buckley and other staunch defenders of unitedstates sovereignty respond that under nafta no international body has any legal authority over american domestic affairs and no private individual or party would be allowed to bring suit against a sovereign nation finally environmental groups are split on the merits of nafta nafta prohibits weak enforcement of environmental laws as an incentive for luring investment mexico already has environmental protection laws comparable to the united states but it is their enforcement of these laws which is a problem nafta provides a mechanism for investigating allegations of weak enforcement consultations and ultimately penalties for an offending country to be penalized for failing to correct a problem the national wildlife federation world wildlife fund nature conservancy audubon society environmental defense fund natural resources defense council and defenders of wildlife agree that nafta is a step forward in environmental protection and that the cleanup of the polluted border area between the united states and mexico will only occur with the 4 billion included in this legislation i commit myself to working with all environmental organizations to ensure that environmental protection laws are strengthened and that those already on the books are fully enforced madam chairman for decades the united states has encouraged mexico and other nations of latin america to move toward development of freemarket economies in the past 5 years under the leadership of president salinas mexicos economy has undergone dramatic change many barriers to investment have been brought down many public sector enterprises successfully privatized foreign private investment encouraged and the gdp growth rate strengthened inflation is down and consumer disposable income is up this has resulted in a tripling of united states exports to mexico over the last 5 years making mexico the second largest market in the world for united states manufactured goods nafta will lock in these gains end the maquiladora program and provide a stable foundation for continued progress the idea cf free trade among nations is not new the united states has had a longstanding commitment to fair and open trade in the world market from the beginning of our republic the free flow of goods and services back and forth between nations has defined growing prosperity we now have the opportunity to put our words into action with our two closest neighbors in 1979 president ronald reagan said we can dare to dream that at some future date a map of thep world might show the north american continent as one in which the peoples and commerce of its three strong countries flow more freely across their present borders than they do today madam chairman that day is today and this significant window of opportunity will close tonight if this house does not approve this legislation to implement the north american freetrade agreement not this nafta is a catchy slogan but it is not reality no person involved in these difficult negotiations over the past 6 years believes there is any possibility of renegotiation this includes president salinas who has stated emphatically and repeatedly that mexico will not accept renegotiation so the time is now for us to embrace the future with characteristic american confidence or we will lose this historic opportunity to regenerate and strengthen our economy with the promise of border markets for our goods and a robust economy for this generation and the

and the state will have to find other ways to supplement repair costs its a safe bet that ordinary citizens and commuters will now have to shoulder this extra burden i also dont believe this

all safety costs money cutthroat competition can spread like a cancer before you know it a lowest common denominator syndrome will grip the industry and everyone will hedge on safety to stay
