thencongressman ryan who in 2012 stated that failing to enact a budget has serious consequences for american families there are at least three current health crises that we are trying to deal with in america and throughout the world but republicans have abdicated their responsibility the zika virus the flint water crisis and the opioid addiction that is ravaging communities in the inner cities in suburban america and all throughout the rural parts of this country yet house republicans have failed not just to put forth a budget that would provide a roadmap to deal with these issues but they have chosen to simply ignore these crises in a manner that represents such a stunning departure of what responsible members of congress should be doing at this particular point in time i am thankful

course and making sure that we are here really speaking truth to power each and every week on behalf of the black caucus also to you congressman don payne thank you very much for your leadership and for really rising to the occasion on so many issues in the very short time that you have been here you have hit the ground running and really have made a tremendous difference i want to just speak for a few minutes as it relates to the review of the congressional black caucus for the last year or 2 years i have to just say that our leader mr butterfield has been a very bold and tremendous leader we have accomplished quite a bit and we have a lot more to do while 2015 has been very challenging i believe that the congressional black caucus has really stepped up and made a huge difference not only for the african american community and communities of color but for the entire country it has also been an inspiring year we have seen the birth and growth of the vital black lives matter movement we have also witnessed powerful and moving protests across the country in places like missouri new york and even in my district in oakland and in berkeley california with people of all backgrounds and ages coming together to demand justice to petition their government to exercise their democratic rights i am so proud of the young activists who are standing up and demanding an end to racism and injustice in many of our communities they are truly bringing the civil rights movement into the 21st century i want them to know that they have allies here in the peoples house for too long congress has ignored or brushed aside issues affecting the african american community and other communities of color it is past time that everyone steps up and does the good work that we were sent to washington to do that the congressional black caucus has done for many many decades we need to start by talking about and looking at what has happened with the voting rights act as you know this year marks the 50th anniversary of this landmark legislation the voting rights act was gutted by the supreme court in its shelby v holder decision and of course republican state legislators have fallen all over to restrict voting rights across the country everywhere these dangerous restrictions come in the form of voter id requirements elimination of sameday voter registration and really severe reduction in early voting efforts we must call these efforts for what they are republican attempts to take away one of our most fundamental rights but we will not let this happen i am so proud of the congressional black caucuscongresswoman terri sewell and john lewis and mr clyburn the entire congressional black caucus our bill h r 2867 the voting rights advancement act sponsored by congresswoman sewell who represents selma alabama would restore the preclearance provisions of the voting rights act for any state that has had 15 or more voting rights violations in the last 25 years in the preclearance process as dr king once said give us the ballot and we will fill our legislative halls with menand of course womenwith goodwill we can fill this body with those who really want to see democracy fulfilled so we need our young people to keep up the street heat and demand that congress act it is past time that we get serious about restoring the voting rights act and ensuring that all americansand that means all americanshave free and unobstructed access to the ballot box also the serious economic disparities that persist in the african american community are very very evident according to a report released earlier this year by the joint economic committee led by ranking member congresswoman carolyn maloney and the congressional black caucus we learned and it is very glaring that more than one in three black children are born into poverty and the african american poverty rate is three times that of white americans the cycle of poverty and inequality starts in our school systems where black students account for 42 percent of preschool student expulsions despite accounting for only 18 percent of enrollment now that is preschool expulsion every time i remember this and say this it really makes me very terrified about what is taking place with young black kids especially with young black boys because there is no way anybody no kids should be expelled from preschool that is ages 1 to 4 that is outrageous i am the mother yes of two fabulous great black men and i am the grandmother of two black boys and i find statistics like that very very troubling for african americans we have allowed our school system to be turned into a pipeline to prison we must act now to address systemic issues facing our education and our criminal justice systems i want to applaud congressman bobby scott and congressman conyers because they have worked for decades on criminal justice reform and we are beginning to see some progress as a result of their very diligent work our criminal justice system is broken it needs to be rebuilt from the ground up so alongside of our cbc colleagues once again we are calling for comprehensive criminal justice reform also i want to mention our effort which i cochair with chairman butterfield our tech 2020 initiative silicon valley is right next to my district in california there are great opportunities there for everyone however the tech industry has not been inclusive of hiring and contracting with and working with communities of color especially the african american community so i am very pleased that the tech 2020 of the congressional black caucus has been initiated we are working with our great leader reverend jesse jackson with an insideoutside strategy many of the tech companies understand what is taking place and that they need to be an industry that is inclusive of everyone so the black caucus along with rainbow push along with the tech industry are working on a variety of strategies to make sure that this industry which provides goodpaying jobs and opportunities is an industry that is inclusive that does not discriminate and that includes the diversity of this great country so i have to just say to congresswoman kelly and congressman payne thank you for giving us a chance to talk about so many of the issues that we have been working on when you look at the issue of poverty cutting poverty in half in 10 years we know how to do it we have legislation the half in ten act h r 258 to do that and the pathways out of poverty act h r 2721 we know how to provide opportunities the congressional

congressman dan kildee who are fighting every day to bring justice to these families their work is essential to ensuring the people of flint have the resources that they need to recover the situation in flint is nothing short of a tragedy and a tragedy that could have been prevented michigan state officials sacrificed the health and futures of flints children in order to save a few dollars in water costs this really is a shame and a disgrace i have to ask would this have happened in a city where the residents had the advantage of wealth or do these gross breaches of public trust only happen in cities where politicians believe the residents are expendable sadly i think we all know the answer to that question after the incredible harm that has already been done to these families our elected officials are once again turning their backs on the people of flint these families deserve better the people of flint were already hurting before the water crisis the average family income in the city is just 24 834 a year no one can raise a family on that many of these courageous and resilient families struggle to find highquality child care access healthcare services and afford healthy food and now the costs of this crisis are mounting for families the schools and the entire community we can and we must do more for our fellow americans in their time of need two years since this tragedy began families are still relying on bottled water for daily life imagine using bottled water for everything from brushing your teeth to making a bottle for a hungry baby we can do better by these families they need support including health care nutrition specialized education and developmental care and we need to fix the root of the problem the degraded dangerous pipes and infrastructure that caused this tragedy the shortsighted dangerous actions of michigan officials have already caused unimaginable pain for these families we cannot allow congress to betray these families as well let me just say that i was part of a congressional delegation that traveled to flint michigan to listen to the residents regarding the horrendous impact of these government decisions that led to the poisoning of those children and families the environmental injustice in flint is an example of how many lowincome communities of color throughout our country not just in flint throughout the united states an example of how they are treated differently than affluent communities congressman dan kildee and members of the michigan delegation have introduced legislation that would help these families rebuild their lives and get the care they need for their children the families of flint act h r 4479 is a comprehensive plan to address their most urgent needs it would provide for critical investment in flints water system to replace the lead pipes that poisoned these families this legislation would also provide essential support services to the families of flint to help these children mitigate and overcome lead exposure these are simple commonsense measures for the people of flint addressing this tragedy really shouldnt be a partisan issue every member of this chamber should understand the need for urgent action it could happen in any of our communities yet congressional republicans have not held one single vote or even a hearing on this bill that is just simply outrageous and let me just say that flint is not the only public health crisis that congressional republicans have ignored there are 17 000 americansincluding almost 1 600 pregnant womenwho have contracted the zika virus the president submitted an emergency request of 1 9 billion for zika funding more than 6 months ago and the republicans have failed to act on it now if we dont act soon the cdc will be out of money to combat zika in a matter of weeks congressional republicans also failed to do their job on gun violence every day more than 90 million people die from gun violence this too is a public health crisis but congressional republicans once again have refused to take up any commonsense gun legislation even though 91 percent of americans support background checks to keep guns out of the hands of terrorists and criminals it is clear that the american people need congress to do its job the women in florida who cant leave their homes for fear of a mosquito bite need congress to do its job the

awareness month this year is particularly significant as we mark 30 years since the groundbreaking health and human services task force on black and minority health report this report sparked the first serious discussion in washington on addressing the deep racial health disparities that exist in this country this year also marks 50 years since the creation of medicare and medicaidprograms that have kept and continue to keep americans healthy we are also celebrating the fifth year anniversary of the passage of the affordable care actthe most significant legislation to improve the health of all americans in more than a generation these legislative achievements continue moving us closer to health equity for allhowever major health disparities still exist the zip code in which you are born still determines your likely life expectancy gross disparities exist from zip code to zip codeeven within the same city or county so today i rise to join my colleagues in the congressional black caucus to bring to light the state of black health in america and call for more action to address persistent and lingering disparities in health access treatment and care since the passage of the affordable care act access to care has dramatically expanded in communities of color the uninsured rate has declined 7 3 percent in the african american community and more people have access to affordable quality healthcareall thanks to the affordable care act when we were crafting the affordable care act i had the privilege of serving as chair of the congressional black caucus and let me tell you we worked day and night with our colleagues in the congressional hispanic caucus and congressional asian pacific american caucus to push congress and the administration to craft the best possible bill since its passage the affordable care act has improved the american health care system healthcare is now more affordable and accessible than ever women can no longer be discriminated against because they are a woman have a preexisting conditionsuch as hiv aidsor have been the victim of domestic violence young people can stay on their parents health insurance until they are 26 and people with serious conditions like cancer no longer face the real fear of hitting their lifetime cap and being denied lifesaving treatment the aca also expands the capacity of the healthcare delivery system to better serve those at risk for and living with hiv aids these are the facts the affordable care act has dramatically increased access to preventative care for women lowincome communities and people of color despite rabblerousing and grandstanding from the right this law is saving livesevery day in communities across americafrom maine to my district in the east bay during the last enrollment period 16 4 million americans obtained health insurance and more than half a million came from my home state of california make no mistakethe affordable care act is working african americans and latinos historically underinsured or uninsured groups have seen the greatest declines in their uninsured rates this is especially good news for african americans who are living with hiv where the key to halting the epidemic is access to affordable and quality care with this increase in coverage we are beginning to close the gap in racial and ethnic health disparities and access to care however much work remains to truly realize health equity in america right nowin america the richest and most powerful country in the worldafrican americans still suffer from disproportionately high numbers of preventable deaths disparities in access to quality health care and underrepresentation within the medical community african americans have the highest mortality rate of any racial and ethnic group from cancer furthermore africanamericans are 40 more likely to die from a stroke than whites and 30 more likely to die from heart disease than whites and while african americans are only 13 of the unitedstates population they account for nearly half of all new hiv infections african americans also account for the highest hivrelated deaths and hiv death rates madam speakerthis is unacceptable in an age where technology and innovation are paving the way to new medical breakthroughs these persistent disparities in healthcare cannot be allowed to continue that is why today i urge my colleagues lets work together and commit ourselves to passing legislation that will end racial and ethnic disparities and achieve health equity the affordable care act was a good start but more is needed for years the congressional tricaucus has championed this effort by introducing the health equity and accountability act heaa congresswoman robin kelly will have the honor in introducing this important legislation this congress and i am proud to colead this effort as cochair of the capac health task force this important legislation builds on the affordable care act and puts us on track to eliminate health disparities in our country the health equity and accountability act would address incidences of terminal and chronic diseases that disproportionally affect communities of color including cancer diabetes heart disease and hiv aids so in recognition of national minority health awareness month i urge my colleagues to support this important bill in order to truly achieve health equity for all the state of black health in america is improving but much work remains before us as our drum major for justice dr king told us of all the forms of inequality injustice in health care

federal inaction that now miamidade county will be spending 10 million of our own budget to cover for some of the expenses in the fight against zika back in february i cosponsored four bills to help start comprehensive preparations for the virus arrival including opening up funding sources for mosquito control freeing the administration to reprogram unspent ebola funds for fighting zika and incentivizing pharmaceutical companies to begin developing treatments and vaccines for zika in march i requested that 177 million be made available specifically for aid to local mosquito control programs extra funding for the cdcs division of vectorborne diseases and new dollars for innovative mosquito control tool development in april i voted in favor of using the fdas priority review voucher program to incentivize zika virus treatment development in may i voted to give state and local authorities a temporary waiver providing more flexibility in using epaapproved insecticides for mosquito control i also voted against an inadequate 600 million zika supplemental funding bill joining 183 other members because public health experts contended that it would not be enough to deal with the expected impact of zika in the unitedstates in june i voted in favor of a 1 1 billion zika funding bill that passed the house but did not pass the senate yesterday the senate again stopped
