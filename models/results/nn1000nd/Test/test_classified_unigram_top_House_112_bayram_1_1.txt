however will cost the economy more than 1 billion each at the current pace the current regulatory burden for 2011 alone will exceed 105 billion and the federal government has created more than 81 9 million hours worth of paperwork this year alone costing employers 80 billion just in compliance its no wonder a recent gallup poll found small business owners citing complying with government regulations as the most important problem they face nebraskans have not been immune to the reams of red tape being handed down by federal regulators just yesterday it was reported the city of grand island nebraska population 51 000 will be saddled with a 3 2 million compliance cost due to a new federal emissions regulation this epa crossstate air pollution rule was finalized june 1 and will be enforced but this is only one example there are additional even more costly rules and unworkable timelines coming down the pike all of which mean a much longer winter for americans struggling with high energy costs but it doesnt stop there recently the department of labor proposed a misguided rule which would restrict youth involvement in agriculture work yes anything from milking cows and feeding calves to hauling and detassling corn would come under fire under the departments current rule everyone agrees the safety of these young people and workers everywhere is of the utmost importance but by allowing such heavyhanded thoughtless regulation were greatly restricting opportunities for rural youth these jobs often seasonal teach young people responsibility and the value of hard work and theyre able to earn a little spending money in the process im also a proud cosponsor of the farm dust regulation prevention act of 2011 h r 1633 which the house is slated to consider later this week this bill would prevent the epa from regulating farm dust or the type of dust which naturally occurs in rural areas farmers and ranchers already are subject to strict federal and state regulations to control dust it makes no sense for the epa to impose costlier requirements on top of the existing standards while the epa has backed off without legislative action nothing certainly prohibits the agency from regulating farm dust in the future during a time of economic hardship keeping the door open for additional regulatory overreach is not the answer actually im often reminded of a meeting i had in southeastern nebraska with representatives from a federal agency good people they are one of them said it had been more than 20 years since hed ridden on a gravel road for me this meeting certainly emphasized the disconnect between washington and rural america these are only a few examples of the regulatory burden and uncertainty facing nebraskans who recognize economic growth ultimately depends on job creators not regulators i encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support commonsense regulatory reforms like the reins act this is yet another step towards increased accountability improving the regulatory process and providing certainty for job creators in my home state of nebraska and in states all across this country"], [0.0016162358224391937,

and we are pleased to be a cosponsor of your bill thank you for joining us as youve heard the congressional black caucus is here this evening were still waiting for the first jobs bill to pass this congress and as youve heard from my colleagues we need to begin with the american jobs act which was proposed by our president barack obama and just to be clear while were advocates for the african american community we are advocates for everyone and this bill is good for everyone everyone who lives in this country and it is a good bill for our country we happen to feel that putting people back to work in this country now is more important than fighting over an election that is more than a year away the american jobs act provides tax cuts that will help businesses grow and create jobs it will help provide incentives to hire the longterm unemployed and it will keep teachers and other essential workers like police and firefighters in their jobs where we need them to be and it will strengthen repair and build needed and faulty infrastructure and in doing so will create even more jobs and it will give people a decent job which will allow them to take care of their families to buy what we make here in america and it will stimulate economic growth it would give every american worker and their family a tax cut through extending the tax payroll tax holiday and do more to fix the mortgage crisis that got us here in the first place by allowing more refinancing of mortgages it would help our fellow americans take better care of their families putting their children in better schools supporting small businesses building consumer confidence and spurring the spending that our economy needs to get back on track this is what this congress ought to be doing not focusing on the solitary goal of making president obama a oneterm president that is a losing proposition anyway no one should be willing to let our fellow americans suffer fall into and become mired in poverty remain unemployed lose homes and to cause our economy to crumble further just because they have political and whatever other differences with our president the republican leadership led by the tea party extremists are taking this country in the absolute wrong direction by insisting on cutting and cutting and cutting important programs and services like the women infants and children program maternal and child health and supplemental nutrition assistance programs at a time when there are more people and more children in poverty by working to deny the opportunity for health care to the over 30 million people who we worked so hard to get insured including sick children and people who would otherwise go bankrupt because of catastrophic illnesses over which they had no control people who are already getting care because of the affordable care act that is being so wrongly maligned i agree with some of the posters i saw in the newspaper this weekend calling for jobs not cuts jobs not cuts that is what we have been saying all year including here on the floor of the house every monday that weve been in session if our leadership listened instead of talk talk talk i believe that is what they will hear the american people at large are saying jobs not cuts and we have a golden opportunity to listen to them for over the last 2 weeks there has been an occupation of wall street because while homeowners and pensioners and many people have suffered because of their meltdown we have not seen the kind of remedies for the folks on main street the side streets or the rural roads that would make them whole they are speaking loudly and effectively on their and on our behalf and then right here in washington d c today and for the next 3 days the take back the american dream conference is here they will be on the hill on wednesday calling on us to end the nightmare that the dream is turning into for far too many people and to restore the american dream access which has been the hallmark and the pride of this country what is happening at this conference and the one in new york is that americans are saying enough is enough and they are fighting back against the cuts that are making it hard for far too many people in this country to survive theyre fighting back against attempts to repeal health care reform fighting back against proposals that would weaken social security medicare and medicaid and fighting back against voter suppression laws theyre fighting for jobs for a future for our children and theyre fighting for our democracy it is so very interesting this talk about president obama and democrats waging class warfare all because we want everyone in this country to do their part to help this country recover from a deep recession all because we want to let tax cuts that were only supposed to be around for 10 years that have now been extended to 12 years finally expire like they were supposed to come on colleagues lets be honest they were never meant to be permanent and how many jobs have these tax cuts created as was loudly touted they would do in 2001 at the end of the clinton administration he handed over this government with an over 2 trillion surplus now after those tax cuts enacted in 2001 after almost 12 years of them we are in record deficits and the worst recession since the great depression and president obama did not create that he inherited it the poverty rate is at the second highest in 45 years and it is hitting as youve heard african americans and latino americans hardest the share of americans in deep poverty with incomes below half of the poverty line is at the highest level ever recorded and african americans are more likely to be in extreme poverty while we hear a lot about how much of a share of taxes the richest 1 percent or the richest 10 percent pay let me remind everyone that white americans wealth is 20 timesand you heard it earlier but it bears repeating20 times that of african americans and 18 times that of latinos and that between 2000 and 2007 not 10 percent not 20 percent not 40 percent but 100 percent all of the increase in wealth went to the top 10 percent in this countryall the top 10 percent the gap between rich and poor got wider the rich got richer the poor got poorer thats a very dangerous trend for the future of this country and then unemployment has reached record highs as well you dont hear about it much you hear it from us but in far too many places our rural and our urban areas communities of color unemployment remains in double digits african american unemployment nationally is over 16 percent but as youve heard we know that it is higher than that in many parts of our country so if we want to talk honestly about class warfare class warfare is what too many people in this country have been experiencing since 2001 and now that we have a president who wants to end it he is being accused of class warfare if we really want to end class warfare my colleagues my colleagues on the other side of the aisle should be supporting rather than opposing him lets get real in all of our 40 years the congressional black caucus has always been a caucus of action our agenda has been consistent and weve pushed every congress and every president and so we resent anyone trying to put a wedge between us and our president to further their own agenda one which is clearly not ours but we continue to be the conscience of the congress as maxine waters coined when she was chair the fairness cops of our nation that is why when we could see none of our 40 jobcreating bills come to the floor under the leadership of our chairman emanuel cleaver and the jobs task force chair and former cbc chair maxine waters we called on the private sector as well as government agencies to come with us across the country to get people working again and that is why we worked so hard with our hispanic and asian colleagues to get the affordable care act passed and we will work just as hard to see that it gets implemented we are not going to sit quietly and let a vital door that is just opening for many to be slammed shut in our communities and communities like ours who need it most many scholarly reports have shown that just eliminating health disparities could save 1 24 trillion in just over 4 years in indirect and direct costs in addition to saving lives so if we really wanted a deficit reduction eliminating health disparities and achieving health equity is deficit reduction at its best and thats why we will continue to work relentlessly as a caucus to save homes to build and equip better schools to support regulations that protect our families and all families from the health and other effects of pollution we have also worked together on budgets and because we know that our country can invest where needed in health care education green energy and job creation and reduce the deficit at the same time we are preparing to send our recommendation to the joint select committee on deficit reduction it will likely be based on our proposed 2012 budget and it will end class warfare by allowing the highend bush tax cuts to expire while strengthening the middle class continuing to create pathways out of poverty for our fellow americans and protecting social security medicare and medicaid this country is fortunate to have a congressional black caucus fighting on its behalf and it is not only our duty but its our honor and privilege to do so with that i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.001754026161506772, 0.001754026161506772, 0, "i

must ensure that the passage of time does not allow us to forget that the cyprus issue is the result of an illegal invasion and ongoing occupation it is long overdue for turkey to withdraw its troops from cyprus so that the island can move forward as one nation turkey continues to forcibly occupy more than onethird of cyprus with more than 48 000 troops in addition to date turkey has repeatedly ignored many of the united nations resolutions pertaining to cyprus and has continued to occupy the island in complete violation of international law the destruction of religious and cultural sites

and to exploit its energy resources without illegal interference by turkey in 2011 they discovered gas in the cypriot area the noble energy company a private energy company from texas discovered that a field off the coast of cyprus may hold as much as 8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas the first discovery off the divided island nation this is tremendously important for energy independence and

perfect freedom to farm it was passed in 96 it got us into some of these problems i opposed it saved a little bit of money and then we ended up spending 10 times as much money bailing people out when it collapsed so you have got to be careful what you are doing but the problem here is were arguing about something that no longer exists this program that they sued us under no longer exists we have fixed it two or three times we tried to address this it was never good enough for the brazilians but we made some changes and we made some more changes and then we made some more changes in the 2008 farm bill its still not good enough for them cotton went through some very difficult times i dont have any cotton in my district this is not a parochial issue for me but if they wouldnt have had that safety net we would have been out of the cotton business but what was going on at the same time we had brazil using government money to increase cotton production in brazil and this is something that isnt considered in the wto because we are such geniuses that we agreed to this agreement that tied our hands and gave our competitors the ability to eat our lunch and thats whats going on you know jbs which just took over a big part of the livestock industry in this country is financed by the brazilian government they own 30 percent of jbs nobody complains about that the brazilian government created most of this competition that collapsed the cotton prices worldwide and then we agreed to let china into the wto and they promised that they werent going to go into cotton production we shipped our textile market to china and collapsed all of our textile industry and what happened they increased production like crazy india increased production like crazy our cotton prices went down below the cost of production because of these trade agreements that we got involved in but the way theyre structured theres nothing we can do about it but theyre going to sue us over a little step two program that we now got rid of trying to keep our people in business now if you want to ship the whole cotton industry to brazil and china and india you are on a good start to doing that and if you keep on this road youre going to ship the rest of agriculture to these socalled developing nations that are not developing nations if youve been to brazil in agriculture they are anything but a developing nation but theyre protected under the rules that we agreed to in this wto deal so is this a perfect solution no but we couldnt get the brazilians to honestly sit down and work this out because they dont want to theyre trying to use this for other reasons for other advantages in these trade negotiations and so forth and i dont think we can ever do anything to satisfy them so theres more to this than people are talking about here this is not about saving money this is about making sure that we can have a safety net in this country so we can maintain production of agriculture in the united states and not ship it all to other countries and not get dependent on foreign countries for our food like weve become dependent on foreign countries for our energy that would be the worst

learning about another culture and at the same time youre learning about your own country and your own experiences because of the points of contrast what a wonderful thing it is that america has now tens of thousands of people who have served in the peace corps who have returned and who now are working in every walk of lifeworking in international organizations working in business organizations knowing different cultures knowing different languagesthereby providing a dimension to our own national life that we would otherwise not have if we did not have people who had had the experience of serving in the peace corps there is one other thing i still can remember the quizzical but interested reaction that so many people in somalia or im sure anywhere in the world had who are you why are you doing it explain that to me again the spirit was kind of catching and they would participate in all kinds of little volunteer activities and things that they hadnt necessarily thought of doing themselves of course the peace corps volunteers are not representatives of the american government they are representatives of the american people that was always emphasized very very strongly to all of us as part of our peace corps training the way we were living was among the people not behind these diplomatic bunkers that we sometimes see in the world today youre experiencing life in the country in which youre serving one thing just as an example is that peace corps volunteers of course do their assignments but theyre also people who do volunteer work of one kind or another one of the big hits was when i was in mogadishu in the peace corps i was with two other people who were peace corps lawyers at that time and there were about 50 60 people who were teachers some were community health workers and some were community school construction workers they would come to mogadishu for a couple days off for vacation time when school was down that kind of thing and five or six of them

command similarly large supermajorities in the senate comprised of both democrats many of whom sponsored these bills and republicans who may be opposed to certain elements but hopefully in the name of moving the country forward will pass this jobs act heres what this bill will do first of all its not a jobs act per se the jobs name is an acronym it actually is called jumpstart our business startups act or jobsa but i guess jobs sounds better but what it really affects is capital markets it is really a capital market bill it is a good bill it has several components that have already passed the house my colleague from texas outlined several of them i want to explain why they are so important first and foremost it makes it easier for many small companies to go public it rolls back some of the sarbanesoxley regulations that were put in place in 2002 for small and mediumcap companies again when youre looking at the compliance cost of sarbanesoxley they dont scale with the business so its de minimis for a 10 billion business but its substantial and in fact a deterrent to accessing the capital markets for a 100 million or a 300 million business so this in fact rolls them back in a very thoughtful way and i would further call for reexamination of course of the requirements for businesses of all sizes but this will allow many small and midcap businesses to access the public capital markets in addition it allows people to invest in startups a concept thats called crowdfunding which is very exciting of course heretofore essentially investing in startups has been restricted to what are called accredited investors now an accredited investor is not just some investor that goes through some process of getting accredited its basically somebody whos wealthy they have to be worth several million dollars and then all of a sudden theyre accredited now we all know that some wealthy people are poor investors and some are good investors ones wealth has nothing to do with how accredited or how good an investor one is and families who are worth 100 000 or families that are worth 300 000 are perfectly within their rights under current law to go to las vegas or atlantic city and bet their entire lifesavings on one roll of the dice and yet theyre not allowed under current law to invest in startups so we with this bill would allow families of all means to invest in startup companies some of which will work out and some of which will not american families will enter this being aware of the risks but again it is their money they earned it theyve paid taxes on it and they should be able to invest it and or gamble it as they see fit another thing we do under this bill is increase the number of shareholders that is required for mandatory registration with the fcc from 500 to 1 000 this is very important because many companies use stock options which is a good practice it gets the employees to own part of the company to own part of the fruits of their labor and to have some of the upside on the equity but companies have effectively been limited on this because once they have 500 shareholders theyre forced to file as public so were allowing them to stay private longer as the need fits them and not have to scale back on their option policy with their employees inevitably some of those options get exercised and employees become outright owners over time this would prevent them from being forced into a backdoor ipo in addition we again allow community banks to raise additional capital we remove some of the requirements around that community banks are important lenders in our community and thats an important step as well towards allowing capital to flow more freely so in sum the several bills most of which have already passed this house that we are packaging in the jobs act this act that were doing here today are good bills that will free up the capital markets and yes in the medium and long term there will likely be some jobs created because where will that capital go it will flow to businesses that will encourage job growth this is not something that happens overnight but this is something that happens as a fruit of the investment some of these startups that are funded through crowdfunding might in fact be employers of 1 000 people in 5 years or 10 years and thats whats so exciting about the potential of these mechanisms to create value in the economy but what are we not doing and what would be a real jobs bill in my opinion theres really several things that are holding back our private sector recovery first and foremost is our budget deficit and the questions about the fiscal integrity of this country this congress continues to avoid taking action on a default scenario under which debt as a percentage of gdp would rise from about 70 percent where it is now to about 200 percent of our gdp by 2040 a far worse situation than many of the fiscally beleaguered nations in europe that are currently undertaking bailouts this is widely known on both sides of the aisle and in fact the solution is widely known as well there are several that have been presented theres a bipartisan group that emerged from the senate including democrats and republicans that proposed a plan to reduce the deficit as a percentage of gdp down to 1 9 percent by 2021 theres been a similar effort on behalf of the bowlessimpson commission again to rein in fiscal spending so that debt as a percentage of gdp would be 35 percent instead of 200 percent by this congress has not advanced either and in fact quite to the contrary has passed an operational budget that only serves to continue these deficits through the next 10 years again giving fiscal certainty around the integrity of our nation would do a lot more to free up capital and improve the flow of capital and credit markets and create jobs than these relatively minor but still important bills that were considering here today the other reform that would create a lot more jobs in this bill and i think would better be called a jobs act if they could come up with a fancy acronym for it is business tax reform id like to submit to the record a recent report from the white house and the department of the treasury on a framework for business tax reform"], [0.011230051517486572, 0.4887699484825134, 1, "nearly 10 years later we continue to reauthorize these provisions without a blink of the eye the idea of these measures always was that they would be temporary and yet to see the process under which we deliberate them it seems they would last forever seeking no input or deliberation of any point in this bills consideration and instead choosing to blindly move forward is a rather sad testament to the majoritys view of an open process ultimately this is no way to consider a piece of legislation that has such farreaching and profound implications for our civil liberties as this does yet the majority seeks to simply kick the can down the road all the while stifling the rigorous debate with which these deserve and need to be scrutinized we would do well to remember that these provisions were passed into law in the frantic weeks after september 11 2001 without our understanding of their potential impact and benefit and that is why we created a sunset review in the first place and why we need thorough review as long as we keep these incredible powers in place make no mistake they are incredible powers were not patching a runofthemill program here these are powers that will allow the government to continue to access business records conduct roving wiretaps and monitor american citizens the intrusive nature of these provisions that the majority seeks to whisk through would leave our founding fathers aghast at the willful erosion of the civil liberties they enshrined for us our swearing into office is an oath to protect and defend the constitution however many members of the house voted against the constitution when this came on the floor last week this process lacking a serious review of farreaching and invasive provisions does not live up to that standard i urge my colleagues to vote no on the rule and against the underlying measure"]]}
