budget deficit the president and the democrats raise new taxes without eliminating a single federal program in the first few years of the plan the plan includes a 71billion energytax and 32 billion in taxes on senior citizens according to several studies the energy tax will cost the unitedstates economy almost 600 000 jobs by 1998 and it will lower economic growth by 35 to 50 billion the energy tax will raise the cost of practically every good and service that americans produce resulting in higher prices for consumers and making american workers and companies less competitive in the world market the average american family of four will pay an additional 500 per year in energy costs as a result of the energy tax according to a study by the american petroleum institute this is in addition to the 2 150 that the average household already pays each year in energy costs a study by the affordable energy alliance shows that a large number of the states highpaying industries mining manufacturing construction and agricultureuse a lot of energy and will be the ones hardest hit by the tax if the clinton tax had been in effect in 1990 north carolina residents and industries would have paid 714 8 million in additional energy taxes the alliance notes that a tax burden this large will slow the economy of the state cost jobs and make goods and services produced in north carolina less competitive in world markets consider for example the case of a company in my district called the timken co the timken co is a leading international manufacturer of highly engineered bearings and alloy steels if the proposed energy tax becomes effective the direct cost impact on the company resulting from higher energy needs will be 5 6 million to put that in perspective the companys net income from worldwide operations amounted to only 4 5 milion in 1992 the energy tax will cost manufacturing jobs and diminish the ability of energyintensive industries like the timken co to compete in the international market clintons plan will also raise taxes on social security recipients under current law older americans with a modest income 25 000 for singles and 32 000 for couples pay income taxes on up to 50 percent of their social security benefits but under the clinton proposal seniors will pay taxes on up to 85 percent of their benefits this increase will raise 32 billion over 5 years a study by a senior advocacy group shows that the average senior citizen will pay 483 a year in new taxes finally the presidents plan will have a devastating effect on small businesses according to information from the national federation of independent business 80 percent of businesses in america pay taxes as individuals not as corporate entities the tax code also taxes the profits of a business not what

particularly on the russian aid portion of the bill that will come up in the foreign operations bill that i think is noteworthy but i would like to address today the middle east part of the bill as members know the 10th round of the peace talks started today and israel has made some unilateral concessions at the peace talks so far the palestinians have not given too much in return but what allows israel to make the kinds of concessions that it has is the kind of strong and secure support that our nation has given to the state of israel over the course of the last 40 years everyone knows that there is still a state of war that terrorism strikes there is a boycott of every israeli company this bill in real terms lets israel know that it is not alone and has our support there is a danger of iran in the middle east again israel is the best state to contain that danger iran is only several years away from nuclear weapons they seem to be buying longrange ballistic missiles and strategic bombers enabling it to reach targets in israel for the first time this would be an awful time to send both a substantive and a political message to the state of israel that we are cutting back fortunately this bill does not do that despite the fact that inflation everything else new needs come up at least the bill holds its own in terms of support of israel to me and many others in the house this is very very very important the bill also contains important language that lays out very clearly what syria must do if it wishes to improve its relationship with the united states including allowing syrian jews to emigrate ending the support of terrorist groups ending its drug trafficking withdrawing from lebanon and assisting with efforts to find israeli pows again this language was put into the report and i think it is extremely important finally i would say that it is easy to get up and demagog against this kind of bill but in terms of our domestic wellbeing as we have seen throughout the reagan and bush years and even the early clinton months foreign affairs can unfortunately intrude on our domestic wellbeing a smart policy that does not just throw money at a problem
