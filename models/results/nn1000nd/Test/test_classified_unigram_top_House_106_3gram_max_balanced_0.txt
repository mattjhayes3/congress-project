from south carolina for this motion i rise to endorse it and ask my colleagues to accept it my district showed a definitive difference in the amount of monies paid by senior citizens for prescription drugs it was higher in the 18th congressional district in houston than in canada and in mexico we find that those who are 85 years old 40 percent of them do not even have the ability to pay for any drugs they have no benefit whatsoever and we must realize that seniors are living longer we also find that seniors are paying twice as much for their prescription drugs if they are medicare beneficiaries and they do not have that provision and so they are buying onethird less drugs what does that mean it means sicker seniors that is what it means these are individuals who have worked hard in our communities then we find the cost of our prescription drugs the amount of money our seniors pay is far more than any other health need that they have and this i would say to my colleagues begs for us to have a prescription drug benefit under the medicare provisions i do not know why it is so difficult this is something we should support i cannot go home and tell my seniors in the 18th congressional district that in the united states of america they cannot have a drug benefit but yet in mexico and canada prescription drugs are cheaper i would say it is time now to support this motion to instruct today i rise in support of the spratt motion to instruct the conferees on the budget resolution the spraft motion sets the stage for enacting a medicare prescription drug benefit or other legislation to improve medicare before the reporting date for a tax cut reconciliation bill by setting september 22 as the date for reporting a tax cut bill protected by reconciliation furthermore the spratt motion recedes to the senates slightly smaller tax cut and also recede to the senate by dropping the reserve fund language in the housepassed resolution that provides for an additional 50 billion in tax cuts while the republicans propose large tax cuts over the next 5 years and reconcile the finance and ways and means committees to report legislation republicans do not show the 10year cost of this tax cut which could be as large as the 792 billion that the republicans proposed and the american people rejected in 1999 moreover the republicans do not intend to strengthen or support medicare due to the fact that there are no reconciliation instructions to require legislation that would actually use the 40 billion reserve earmarked in the budget resolution in addition the republicans have cut nondefense appropriations while defense significantly increased for the third consecutive year republicans have chosen to provide large tax breaks for the wealthy this budget resolution provides at least 200 billion in tax breaks over the next 5 years for the financial elite of america furthermore this resolution is a major down payment for george w bushs proposed trilliondollar tax scheme i will not stand by while our childrens future is bankrupted to fund this irresponsible budget resolution this budget contains deep cuts in domestic spending by 114 billion over the next 5 years fails to provide anything to strengthen social security or medicare cuts nondefense discretionary spending by 19 7 billion in 2001 and 138 billion over the next 5 years below the level needed to maintain purchasing power after adjusting for inflation and pretends to reserve 40 billion for a medicare prescription drug benefit contingent upon essentially turning medicare into a voucher program republicans have used slight of hand to hide the facts of their irresponsible budget by showing the effects of proposed tax cuts for only the first 5 years and not the full 10year projections commonly used during the last 4 years i am disappointed in the budget resolution because i do not believe that it provides adequate investment in our nations future americas

resolution also calls for unitedstates support and facilitation of croatias goals for membership in natos partnership for peace program and its accession to the world trade organization i firmly believe that by supporting croatias membership in pfp and its accession to the wto we will not only be making a sound investment in the future security of southeast europe but we will also be sending a clear message to other countries in the region of the benefits that come from choosing a democratic path croatia was a tremendous ally to us last year during the kosovo conflict and as far as i am concerned they have more than demonstrated their loyalty to the united states in my opinion their membership in the partnership for peace program has already been earned and is long overdue there is no question that we need a trustworthy ally in southeast europe where we have spent an exorbitant amount of time and money croatia is that trustworthy ally and i want to honor this country its leaders and its people here today i believe this is a very important resolution and i urge my colleagues to vote favorably"], [9.042024612426758e-05, 0.5000904202461243, 0, "i want to congratulate the gentlewoman from new york she is certainly sincere i just am concerned that expectations are so high thatpassing this sort of legislation is somehow going to fill the hearts and the souls of our young people that now somehow are empty and consumed with violence with sweetness and light there is much more to the problem of the culture that encourages antisocial conduct much more profound than simply restricting the availability of the weapons that cause all the problems i do not mean to demean the fact that we need legislation to narrow the access to these weapons of destruction but to think that that is going to solve the problem i think misses the mark there were some 17 federal laws and some 14 state laws that were violated at columbine adding more laws i still think it is worth the effort i do not denigrate that it is worth the effort we have to keep the focus on these things but let us not end our quest for a solution to the wanton destruction of life especially among our young people thinking if we remove the instruments of death somehow we will remove the incentives for treating life as a thing and as a throwaway item as i have said before and i welcome this opportunity to say it again we have a bill we want your support we have had it for many months and the only contentious part is the gun show part and the gun show part that we propose is a middle ground between the dingell amendment and the lautenberg amendment let us get on this and let us confront the senate with it which is another galaxy as we all know but let us confront them with it and say here it is we need your support if we can do that as i say the problem the immediate problem of getting a decent common sense response to the high schdol killings can be solved i believe we can do it i hate to be cynical i hate to think that some people want the issue and not a bill not a solution i do not believe that i refuse to believe that i will not believe that but right now we need cooperation and consultation

are grave concerns because we really do not deal with true emergencies emergencies happen all over the country they do not just happen in north carolina right now we are referring to one that is in north carolina hurricane floyd which tremendously devastated our state there are still thousands and thousands of people who are not in their homes or do not have homes because of this hurricane it is really disturbing to me because when we do emergency supplemental bills we end up with a lot put in there that is not emergency this bill is no different disasters happen all over the country there was a tornado yesterday in downtown fort worth it is another example of it does not matter what state one is from one is probably going to face the same situation it is time we set up some type of emergency rainy day fund or insurance fund or something that is going to get us out of this box of continually coming to the floor with emergency spending bills with threefourths of the spending in the bill not being emergency i am very disturbed by this one as well i will end up voting for the bill because i do not have any choice i cannot vote against the money for the people who do not even have a home to live in that is not a choice in my situation but i am very disturbed by the fact that there are a lot of other things in here that are not emergencies the amendment offered by the gentleman from south carolina also does not touch defense spending it is not cutting defense spending i believe that is very important and we have some dramatic needs there too that are critical right now my concern is that the monies that come forward for emergency bills do go toward emergencies in this case of course the emergency is the hurricane floyd money i would hope my colleagues would join me in that and really look toward a positive solution to this so we can come up with a way that we do not end up in this box all the time and come back and say well everything is in there but the

difficult choices i am in no way unsympathetic to the difficult choices the subcommittee and the full committee on appropriations have had to make i think they have made choices that were not in the nations interest and which they would prefer not to have made but we do have to make choices one choice that i find not too difficult is to take from the epa budget 1 55 percent of what is appropriated under the bill leaving them with 99 9 percent of the full entire presidential request for epa and transfer it to the nasa science aeronautics and technology accounts which have been desparately hit through an era where we have moved from a nasa budget that started at the end of the bush administration at something like 14 55 billion and which under the committee version of the bill will have shrunk to 12 65 billion much of that has been taken out of the nasa aeronautics budget which has declined by 400 nillion in the past 2 years today we are faced with a situation where aeronautical research in the united states is being starved to death and we cannot permit it to continue our military aircraft are the best of the world because of the research performed by nasa the air force f15 f16 b2 f22 cl7 and c130 j would not be as effective as they are today except for the research at nasa the same can be said of the navy and marine corps f14 f a18 the av8 and the ea6b if the nasa budget is allowed to decline further the nation will lose a decisive edge in military might it will lose its edge in commercial aviation it will lose its edge in the export of the largest producer toward a balance of payments in our favor in the country next to if not including agriculture these are things we should not permit to happen and the way to prevent doing it is to support the roganbateman amendment allowing epa to get 99 9 percent of its budget request while nasa is not reduced by the 1 billion or more dollars that this would contemplate i ask my colleagues support for the

continue to work together on as the bill moves through conference the administration requested funding for a pacific salmon recovery fund which would assist the four west coast states of alaska washington oregon and california and help them respond to the recent endangered species act listings of 13 salmon and steelhead populations our region has been extremely hard hit by these listings and is responding with both local and state money but the federal money requested by the administration is imperative given the complexity of this species and the densely populated areas they impact related to the coastal initiative the national marine fisheries service has requested an increase for expanded workload on the west coast for endangered species act requirements without the necessary consultation and permitting routine growth in our region will come to a standstill lastly the united states and canada recently reached agreement on the pacific salmon treaty which sets harvest restrictions and conservation measures between the two countries to implement this agreement the administration has requested appropriations for two endowment funds to assist with resource

opportunity to provide critically needed protections for consumers and businesses to ensure that y2k computer problems are addressed quickly and that precious resources are not squandered on needless litigation to minimize the impact of the y2k bug american businesses are currently investing 600 billion and working diligently towards reprogramming and replacing their affected computer systems unfortunately there is no easy technological fix for this problem each computer must be meticulously fixed tested and retested opportunistic individuals are only adding to an already almost insurmountable task by diverting attention and needed resources away from fixing the problem with litigation to date over 80 y2k lawsuits have been filed and there are 790 letters demanding new y2k litigation it is estimated that unrestrained litigation could cost 1 4 trillion that would only serve to line the pockets of greedy opportunists at the expense of american jobs h r 775 is a very reasonable approach to preventing an explosion of y2k litigation this bill favors remediation over litigation by encouraging parties to resolve their differences outside of the expensive court system through alternative dispute resolution it also places the focus of y2k problem solvers on a solution rather than fighting in court at the same time h r 775 does not eliminate the normal legal options americans who suffer economic or physical injuries as a result of y2k can still recover 100 percent of their actual damages many y2k computer failures could occur weeks and months before january 1
