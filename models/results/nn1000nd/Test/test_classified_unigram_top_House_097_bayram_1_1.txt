committee made in order h r 6696 an amendment in the nature of a substitute to the armed services committee bill back on january 29 of this year as i have indicated earlier on the floor i sent the chairperson of the armed services committee a communication suggesting that we expand the parameters of the discussion in the debate in the armed services committee in light of the fact that this administration has proposed a military budget in excess of 1 6 trillion in the first 5 years of the decade of the 1980s and with the fact that millions of american people and millions of people around the world are raising significant questions with respect to our lockedstep effort toward thermal nuclear war i felt that we had a profound obligation to go beyond the parameters of the armed services connittee to hear from other witnesses who had a positive and constructive alternative to our present military policies in this country and around the world the chair sent back a polite letter indicating that for a number of bureaucratic reasons they had an obligation to go forward with the military budget i understood that and responded to the chair by indicating that it was my belief that it is a moral imperative that we establish a platform to provide an opportunity for brilliant minds to come together to pose an alternative to americas present military and nuclear policy therefore in april of this year we held 6 days of hearings to look at the full implications of the military budget we looked at the national security and foreign policy implications of the military budget the tactical and strategic implications of the military budget and arms escalation versus arms control we looked at the economic implications and the moral implications of the military budget we looked at the economic implications of americas global arms sales and finally we looked at citizen responsibility in ending the absurdity and the insanity of our nuclear arms race and our rapidly escalating military budget a number of brilliant witnesses came to washington from all around the country to testify at these hearings i would like briefly to give a few highlights that a number of the witnesses presented during those hearings in april the first witness was former senator j william fulbright of arkansas former chairperson of the senate foreign relations committee from 1959 to 1975 senator fulbright led off the hearings he stated as follows and i quote this budget together with the propaganda to sell it to the public and the congress has the effect of shifting the focus of our policy from that of deterrence of nuclear war to the waging and the winning of a nuclear war further quoting he said this military budget is so large and the emphasis upon nuclear weapons so strong and the rhetoric about the soviet threat is so extreme that one cannot resist the feeling that we are preparing to fight and win a nuclear war i believe if this is the case that it is a dangerous game and could easily get out of control and lead to a disaster it is not only dangerous it is costly and it threatens the stability and the soundness of our domestic economy mr paul warnke former director of the arms control and disarmament agency testified as follows there is no basis in fact for the assertion that the soviet union has strategic nuclear superiority we lead in strategic warheads again it really doesnt matter but we have a lead we also lead when it comes to survivable forces mr paul warnke former director of the arms control and dis irmament agency there is no credible scenario in which we and the soviet unioh could fviht a nuclear war and have either one of us be declared the winner either one of us might come out somewhat better than the other but we would be worse off than uganda or bangladesh we would no longer be recognized as superpowers in fact the question is would we be recognizable as a national entity ms randy forsberg president and executive director of the institute for defense and disarmanent studies pulling the nuclear tripwire ever tighter by improving first strike capabilities is extremely risky and dangerous if we continue to make nuclear escalation in a first strike format easier and more likely then in a crisis it will become inevitable clearly the stakes in the third world are not worth the risk to the whole of humanity what in the extraordinary is the hubris the arrogance the almost criminal carelessness of the men who pursue this policy in their confidence of the men who pursue this policy in their confidence that they can play nuclear chicken forever without ever losing control of the situation once dr paul p walker charter member of the boston study group and coauthor of the price of defense the defense department states boldly that this naval plan is based on the determi nation to restore and maintain maritime superiority over the soviets in order to wage severa wars worldwide against the soviet military

have come to the conclusion that nuclear weapons are not military weapons because nuclear weapons cannot be used and the danger that imperils humankind on the face of this earth is the perception the illusion that nuclear weapons can be used to me this was an eloquent and powerful statement that nuclear weapons are never to be used but only for deterrence but the supporting documents for this

respect is psychotic every analyst i have seen indicates that no one wins in a nuclear war there is no such as a limited war a surgical strike where 20 to 100 million human beings are dead what is limited and surgical about that i would quote dr geiger the executive director of the physicians for social responsibility who said as i look at the united states and the soviet union and their

there with 10 matches and the other standing there with 7 matches and they are both arguing over whether they need 15 matches apiece before they can agree not to strike 1 match in that room that is where we are that is precisely where this arms race is millions of the american people are beginning to awaken to the reality that nuclear war is insanity bloated wasteful and unnecessary military budgets are not in our best interests finally my colleagues are talking about a 5percent addon for fiscal year 1983 military budget as if these numbers make some sense the point is that fiscal year 1982 was an incredibly high base in fiscal year 1981 the military budget in budget authority terms was 173 billion in fiscal year 1982 it went up to 226 billion 25 percent over and above that is incredible we must remember that ronald reagan stomped us in 1982 and put the military budget at an incredible level so let me give the members these figures because it also includes the black caucus budget when you go back to 1981 as a base 1982 which was terribly out of line the jones budget if we use 1981 figures calls for 32 9percent increase in 2 years the aspin budget in 2 years calls for a 31 3percent increase the latta budget 33 4percent increase in the military budget in 2 years the obey budget 30 6 percent and even this socalled radical document known as the congressional black caucus that budget is still 25 percent over and above fiscal year 1981 a 12 5 average increase in 2 years so yoticannot tell me or any other rational human being that we are not pouring an incredible amount of money in our military budget in conclusion i would simply say think analyze evaluate and debate let us not reduce ourselves to some hucksters and hustlers and auctioneers here we are

that of the various current power centers in poland only the catholic church speaks for the vast majority of the polish people given what has transpired in postworld war ii poland that is a remarkable turn of events on a number of occasions during this period poland was rocked by domestic political troubles in each instance cardinal wyszynski played a pivotal role in the resolution of those problems primarily because he possessed the uncanny ability of knowing just when and how much to resist totalitarian rule and when to compromise without repudiating his principles adhering to those principles i might add cost him time in prison throughout that ordeal his paramount concern was that the church would never reject the will of its people for the better part of the last year the

we would not be able to obtain that type of equality under the law that this gentleman believed was so very necessary the argument that we do not need the era because there are no longer any discriminatory laws is completely wrong genderbased laws can be as picayune as the north carolina statute that requires a husband but not a wife to go to court for a legal name change if the couple wants to use a combined or hyphenated name or the laws can be reflective of deeprooted stereotypes such as the georgia law that states that the husband is the head of the family and the wife i subject ot him married women are the big losers property rights marital regulations provisions for separation and divorce and statutes concerning wills and intestate succession combine to discriminate against womenwhether they are homemakers work in a familyowned business work outside the home are widowed are divorced or getting a divorce so despite the many rights that women have won over the past decade equal opportunity and equal treatment under the law are incomplete and impermanent the rights we have gained could be revoked by changes in the political balance of congress administrative action or a realinement of the supreme court without the era in the constitution the shift of a few votes could wipe out equal employment opportunity equal access to credit and equal education many womens rights were enacted by small margins for example the law that gives a woman the right to sue an employer who discriminates against her would not be on the books if three senators had changed their minds the reason the era has not yet been ratified is because a few state legislators who ignored the wishes of their constituents and a vast majority of citizens throughout the country these legislators bottled the era up in committee tied it up by parliamentary maneuver and used backroom political pressure to defeat it but those days are past i expect the new erawith the same simple straightforward languageto win approval in congress and then be ratified by the required 38 states state elections will make all the differencewith legislators who oppose era held accountable i believe the era drive will be looked upon as the turning point in the womens movement women will move from being spectators to the inside political track i firmly believe that era more than anything else is a bread and butter issue for women 70 percent of the nations poor are women according to the national advisory council on economic opportunity this figure could rise to 100 percent before 2000 thp irony of this decade of advancement for women is that it has also been the decade of the feminization of poverty while this is most prevalent among elderly black and hispanic women the fastest growing segment of poor women are single white and ralsing children with no or little support jobs alone are not the answer while mens poverty is a consequence of unemployment womens is the result of occupational segregation in spite of the fact that more women are employed now than ever before 80 percent of these women are concentrated in traditional womens work service and cler cal jobs which are not only low paying but have declined in real earnings for years the great strides made by women into traditionally male occupations chiefly reflects their very low starting point and even in these areas equal

disapprove the sale of awacs to saudi arabia this debate is not just aboutsaudi arabia or awacs planes what we are debating is something far more profound and far reaching the decisions we make today combined with those to be made in the other body will have a deep and his tonec effect on our future as a power for peace in the mideast the heart of this issue is not awacs technology but foreign policy not the security of one type of aircraft but thb security of our nation the western alliance and our friends in the mideast let us look at some of the questions before us some say we should not give the saudi the awacs unless there are americans to man them others question the alleged insecurity of the awacs technology in saudi hands i recall a story i heard the other day a highranking administration of ficial was being questioned by a distinguished member of the other body about the awacs deal the administration official said to the senator if the saudi dont buy awacs from us theyll simply turn around and buy a similar plane from the british and the senator replied let them buy it from the british if thats what they want and so the administration official said if you have no objection to the saudi pos jessing the technology as such why not let the united states make the sale instead of great britain and the senators reply to that was my time is up and i have no further questions ~ a vote against this sale is not going to deprive the saudi arabians of sophisticated flying radar technology is there anyone who doubts the capacity of the british nimrod to eventually perform awacs tasks does anyone doubt the saudis will buy the nimrod it is only a matter of money and the saudis have plenty of that if the saudis buy nimrods there will be no joint control of the plane so what are we gaining by forcing the saudis into a situation which deprives usof any chance of influencing the use of this technology is awacs a threat to israeli security of course not the israelis know perfectly well the saudis and other arab nations cannot mesh technologles in such a way that the saudi awacs could direct arab aircraft in a war against israel may i add one more point concerning the security question for over 30 years the united states of america has been sending our most sophisticated weapjons systems to the state of israel but since the creation of the state of israel there has not been a single day when anyone could guarantee the survival or security of israel they have always lived on the brink of destruction for over 30 years we have been told we must give israel every new weapon system it wants because it is in constant danger of disaster but suppose we had replied we cannot give israel high technology equipment because israels security is threatened we risk capture of our stateoftheart weapons technology israels security from invasion is too unstable to trust them with sophisticated weaponry which might fall into the wrong hands would not such an argument be missing the point in giving threatened israel sophisticated weaponry for over 30 years we have not taken counsel of our fears we have instead followed our commonsense that israels possession of high technology equipment is in our interests despite the risks it could possibly fall into enemy hands the same argument should hold true when it comes to saudi arabia the united states should not base its policy on fear but on selfinterest we are told that the fate of the shah of iran is a warning to us all do not sell sophisticated equipment to an autocratic ruler in the mideast because it will fall into the hands of our enemies the only thing wrong with such an argument is that it is based on a totally false analogy the iranians and the arabs are different people with different histories different customs different forms of government and different geopolitical roles the shah tried to force feed irans military modernization process thereby alienating many iranians the sadidis have used 72 to 90en of its military agreements with the united states to buy construction services infrastructures training and other elements the shah was opposed by irans religious leaders the saudi family faces no such opposition and is in fact closely tied to the religious leaders the shah changed leadership in his armed forces so often there was complete chaos the saudis have had great stability and continuity in its command structure and ministerial leadership since the 1060s so the analogies with iran are simply false we have an entirely different situation in saudi arabia what about the alleged threat to internal security from the millions of foreign workers who are in saudi arabia that threat cannot be dismissed lightly but it also cannot logically stand in the way of the sale if an internal threat to the saudi kingdom is so great that our awacs will be threatened the disaster will go beyond the mere capture or destruction of awacs it will engulf all of saudi arabia itself the loss of awacs will be the least of our worries besides if such a massive and imminent threat exists it wtll occur before we sell the awacs and if the danger is not immediate how can we predict what is going to happen in 1985 or 1090 the united states is irrevocably tied to saudi arabia for the foreseeable future economically and geopolitically our two nations hay mutual interests we may not like it some of our constituents may not like it mr begin certainly does not like it but like it or lump it the saudis need us and we need them i am not one of those who say we should be nice to the saudis because they allegedly hold down the price of oil we all know they charge exactly what is in their longrange interests no we should act only in our selfinterest and yes i am as irritated as anyone over the saudi reluctance to cooperate with american strategic initiatives in the mideast they have been uncooperative when it comes to the question of american forward bases and our role in regional security but it stands to reason that not selling them awacs will not make them any more cooperative it will only make matters worse what about the concerns of many americans over the effect this sale will have on the state of israel as one who believes that israel is vital to the national security interests of the united states i am convinced i 7ils figure comes from saudi arabia awacs and americas search for strategic stability in the near east a publication of the international security studio program of the wilson center smithsonian institute building washington d c by all the available evidence this sale will not endanger the security of israel nobody is asking israel and saudi arabia to like each other we are not running a computer dating service for mideast lonely hearts all wve are saying is that despite mutual dislike those nations have common enemies that can destroy either or both helping the saudis will not harm israelunless israel decides to perceive such help as harmful and we should not make policy based on the perceptions of other countries saudi arabia will not go away the geopolitical problems of the mideast will not vanish the hard strategic decisions will not suddenly be solved by denying awacs to the saudis our two nations are bound together like contestants in a thrceeegged race at a picnic we may be uncomfortable together we may stumble and find fault with each other but we have to learn to move together or else we both will lose summing up we find that every argument presented against this sale has no foundation in fact the awacs will not be a threat to israel but the nimrod might be a threat according to findings of the senate foreign relations committee joint control of the awacs does not guit the saudis but if they buy nimrod there wvill be no joint control and americans will have absolutely no voice in how the information is used we are told that awacs cannot help the saudis against soviet attack that is absolutely correct but it can help the saudis against air attacks from soviet client states you cannot logically argue that awacs is good enough to threaten israel and then argue it is not good enough to help defend the saudis from attack but that is exactly what opponents of this sale have argued voting against awacs will not stop the saudis from gaining awacstype technology all it will do is insure that we do not have a part in selling the technology training the crews and monitoring the information on a xetltime basis is this what those opposed to the sale want i do not think so but it is exactly what they are going to get let history judge which side of this debate best served the cause of freedom peace and security"], [0.9999504089355469,

1982 and fiscal year 1983 without changing the total from the presidents budget the reductions in fiscal year 1982 would be taken by relatively minor reductions less than 1 percent 20 million from space shuttle and operations 7 million from space science and applications and 3 million for tracking and data acquisiton in fiscal year 1983 the administration would make a similar set of reductions in amounts of 14 million from shuttle operations 2 million from spacelab development and procurement 7 million from science andapplications 2 million from space research and technology and 5 million from tracking and data acquisition in light of the present status of the programs we believe these reductions can be made without serious program impacts the additional aeronautics money would be

qulnault valley in the park this plan would also insure future public ownership of the entire north bank of the river upstream from the lake these private lands are the remnants of the homesteads of the original nonindian settlers of the quinault valley ancestors of these people still live in the valley and their ties with the land and desires to preserve their way of life are very strong residents of the area are also justifiably concerned about maintaining an adequate property base to accommodate community growth and to support adequate community services the presence in the area of the national park the olympic national forest the quinault indian reservation and extensive state holdings make this a very real concern that the bill will help address since this land has been within the park the national park service has been responsible for law enforcement road maintenance and other government services that are traditionally local concerns the agency is not well suited for such tasks and residents dislike having to rely on nonelected officials of a large federal agency for such services the people clearly prefer to work with local officials on these matters and finally the bill settles the four decades of uncertainty that valley residents say has gone with living under what they feel is a nearconstant threat of federal condemnation of their property a 1976 olympic national park boundary adjustment which i also sponsored established a procedure for studying the quinault situation and developing recommendations designed to expedite resolution of these longstanding issues this process unfortunately did not do the job for which it was intended and the bill i am introducing today also cleans up federal statutes by simply deleting all references to it i have seen no other proposal which does a better more balanced job of settling the future of the private lands in the quinault valley my bill resolves the situation for most of the private landowners and does so in a way that retains witbin the park the most environmentally important lands and wildlife habitat"]]}
