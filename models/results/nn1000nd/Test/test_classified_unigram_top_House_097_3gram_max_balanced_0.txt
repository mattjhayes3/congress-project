united states and requesting the president to ascertain from the soviet union the whereabouts of raoul wallenberg and to secure his return to freedom raoul wallenbergs extraordinary record of saving the lives of countless thousands of jews during the holocaust at great personal risk and sacrifice amply justifies this nation conferringupon him its highest honor by proclaiming him an honorary citizen of the united states mr wallenberg undertook his perilous mission at the behest of the united states and the american war ref ugee board the passage of house joint resolution 220 will represent a ringing affirmation of americas commitment to the survival of the jewish people and our tremendous esteem for someone who risked his own life to try to save so many jewish lives from nazi extermination a number of bills have been introduced over the years to confer honorary citizenship on various persons but the only successful effort to date related to sir winston churchill the conferral of honorary citizenship on raoul wallenberg however will not establish a precedent for similar action on behalf of a number of other heroic figures the fact that our action today will not serve as such a precedent is clear for a number of reasons raoul wallenbergs valiant efforts to save thousands of jews from the holocaust provide an appropriate basis for distinguishing this bill from bills introduced on behalf of others conferral of honorary citizenship on wallenberg unlike any other honorary citizenship bill congress has considered heretofore will symbolize our commitment as a nation to remember the holocaust and vigilantly guard against the possibility of any recurrence congressman lan~os who introduced this joint resolution testified before the subcommittee on immigration refugees and international law thatwe need to establish a clear record for posterity that america through wallenberg did act to prevent the holocaust in its final days during the subcommittee hearings i requested congressman lirrros to develop this idea further and place mr wallenbergs actions in the context of other actions or even inaction by the united states to prevent the holocaust congressman lairros answer i believe should be brought to the attention of the house and for that reason i will quote from it at some length it is important to underscore that wallenberg was not a diplomat wallenberg was a young man living in the comfort and safety and affluence of neutral stockholm during the brutal closing days of world war 11 he left behind a most promising career as the son of swedens most prominent family the safety the security the comfort of stockholm to voluntarily assume the task of saving human lives so raoul wallenberg did not think of this mission himself this was not an activity that stemmed from his own plans it was a mission that he tundertook at the specific request of the secretary of state of the united states the united states thtrefoe bears a very heavy responsibility for the untold numbers of years that this young swede spent under the nightmarish conditions of the gulag archipelago whether he died earlier or whether he is alive today it is we the united states who are responsible for his tragedy and for his lost life a great deal of criticism has emerged over the course of years concerning the failure of the western powers to act in decisive ways to stop the slaughter questions such as why werent the railroads bombed why wasnt there an attempt to liberate the camps earlier here is a tangible demonstration that the united states officially acted and successfully acted to save approximately 100 000 people our record for world war ii is a better record because of the actions of raoul wallenberg undertaken at our own behest honorary citizenship is singularly appropriate in the wallenberg case not only because of the place the holocaust occupies in the history of human depravity and our national commitment to the survival of the jewish people the fact that wallenberg acted at the behest of the united states and suffered untold misery as a result of it establishes our interest as a nation in giving this special recognition to him the soviet union in addition never satisfactorily has accounted for what happened to mr wallenberg the conferral of honorary citizenship on him may give the united states added leverage with the soviet union in determining whether he is still alive and possibly in securing his release honorary citizenship is exactly what its designation impliesnamely an honor that does not confer on either mr wallenberg or any members of his family any rights or privileges under the immigration and nationality act the concept of honorary citizenship must be distingished clearly from citizenship itself no member of mr wallenbergs family as a result of our action today can possibly claim any derivative rights under our laws even mr wallenberg himself will not be recognized as an american citizen under united states domestic law or under international law if he is found to be still alive conferral of honorary citizenship in no way can be described as giving away anything tangible the meaning and significance of our action today is entirely symbolicbut it is a critically important symbolic gesture in an age when many nations treat human life so cavalierly a few of the statements in the legislative record underscore the critical significance of the step we are about to take today secretary of state alexander m haig jr said that mr wallenbergs contribution during the dark days or world war ii in hungary stands out as a beacon to all those who respect human rights and dignity he expressed his full support for this legislation assistant secretary of state richard fairbanks informed the judiciary committee thatthe conferral of honorary unitedstates citizenship on wallenberg would serve to underscore the seriousness with which the american government and people view sovietbehavior in the wallenberg case conferral of honorary unitedstates citizenship on wallenberg would also serve to reaffirm to the government of sweden that the united states firmly supports the quest to resolve wallenbergs fate former secretary of state edmund muskie informed two subcommittees of the house committee on foreign affairs that the chronological record of state department and war refugee cables and conmnunications 0 documents the unitedstates governments position of responsibility for the selection of wallenberg the directive and funding for his activities the appreciation for his work and the deep distress over his disappearance mr muskie concluded that its isthe uniqueness the extraordinary link between a man raoul wallenberg and our nations conscience that makes this action appropriate mr muskie went on to say raoul wallenbergs mission on behalf of the united states behind nazi lines in world war ii was without precedent what hie accomplished on our behalf risking his own life to save the lives of tens of thousands of people is unparalleled in our history the cost to him the years of his life can never be repaid the action of bestowing honorary citizenship on wallenberg undertaken by the congress of the united states will recognize his humanitarian sacrifice under our direction this is an important part of american history this adoption of raoul wallenberg as our own citizen makes clear to our posterity that the american government did act to save lives threatened by the holocaust i can add nothing further to the eloquent statements submitted by numerous witnesses before subcommittees of both the committee on foreign affairs and the committee on the judiciarywvitnesses who underscored the critical importance from both a national and

house will sustain the bill you are going to have a couple of amendments very critical amendments that will seriously impact upon the ability of this nation to meet the threat which it faces i would like to touch upon a few facts which i think are pertinent as we consider this defense bill first of all i call your attention to the comment of leonid brezhnev when he was addressing the warsaw pact heads of government back in 1973 the heads of those warsaw pact nations who were meeting with him were concerned about his feelings about detente and so they were putting him on the spot so to speak about his support of detente his answer to them was this trust us comrades for by 1985 as a consequence of what we are now achieving with detente we will have achieved most of our objectives in western europe and the shift in the correlation of forces will be such that come 1985 we will be able to exert our will wherever we need to that was back in 1973 i would like to call your attention now to some statistics that back up exactly what mr brezhnev was saying the soviets have set their goals they have achieved their schedules to their stated end thus far let us look at some of the statistics pertinent to the point turning first to the icbm and slbms strategic launchers in 1965 the soviets had 331 strategic launchers against our 1 100 today they have 2 426 and we have 1 710 strategic launchers let us look at the soviet ballistic missiles and on the same pattern in 1965 they had 107 while the united states had 496 today we have 656 and they have 1 028 let us look at the statistics with reference to the intercontinental ballistic missiles in 1965 the soviets had 224 while the united states had 654 today we have 1 028 while the soviets have 1 398 what i am saying to you is that we have not put a new ballistic missile on line since 1965 we have not put a new launcher on line since 1965 while the soviets have continued to increase their strength look at the soviet armed forces manpower with reference to ours today we have roughly 2 1 million men in our military the soviets have a military manpower of 3 6plus million what about total strategic warheads in 1965 the soviets had 530 while we had 2 716 but look how the imbalance has changed now we have a total of 6 282 while the soviets have 9 139 look at the trends see what has been happening over this period of time let us turn to soviet tanks in 1970 the soviets had 20 450 tanks today they have 26 768 we would be hard put to put 7 000 total in the field anywhere everywhere in the world what about the expernditures on defense as compared to social services we hear a lot of conversation about the fact that we are spending so much more on defense in comparison to our expenditures on social services let me review the statistics in 1960 we were spending roughly 30 percent on defense and roughly 31 percent on social services i am talking about all levels of government state and federal we are now spending 14 8 percent on defense and 49 1 on social services i just wanted to bring some of those statistics to bear because it shows that we are not spending for defense at the cost of social services now if we are not to invite disaster we dare do nothing less than what has been provided in this bill i hope the members of this house will sustain the bill at least to the maximum it provides i hope this spending level will prove in years to come to be a reasonable effort"], [0.8874452859163284, 0.11255471408367157, 1, "i thank the gentle to reaching this goal is to voteacross

that the economy is improving moderatelyif you can believe the economic indicators issued this weekwe can now somehow miraculously allow our federal government to grow to the astronomical level of 715 billion it appears that the budget committee only listens to those that tell it what it wants to hearlistening to any faint voice that somehow will continue to justify the runaway growth of the federal government that in a nutshell is the issue before us how big should the federal government be in the years aheadand who should we listen toas we make the decisionsas we set the budgetthat establishes the size and the growth rate for the federal government in thp years ahead it appears that the budget committee does not want to listen to president reagan the leader our country chose last november he wants to hold the federal government downlimit its growth with a budget of less than 689 billion it appears that the committee does not want to listen to the american peopleour constituents who have time and time again expressed themselves in favor of limiting the growth of the federal government well perhaps i can persuade my colleagues to listen to the voice of the future generation 19 years ago the federal budget was scarcely 100 billion who then would have believed that today the house budget co~mmittee would be seeking a 715 billion budget who would have been elected in support of such a budget 19 years hence well who today wants the budget in the year 2000 19 years away to surpass 2 860 billion if we allow the current budget committee proposal to pass and continue its level of growth even at what it calls these conservative levela then thats thh budget for the year 2000 2 860 billion i but if we adopt the presidents budget and escalate thi ough the year 2000 it the level of the 1982 proposal then the budget in the year 2000 will be less than half the federal budget woud become less than half if we allow the budget committee level to pass the

welcomed rapidly growing interest in the potential of this new opportunity and i have been gratified by the active support for trading company legislation over 130 of my colleagues have cosponsored my bill h r 1648 and i am sure they all share my enthusiastic support for h r 6016 the legislation we consider today when i first introduced my original bill during the 96th congress i was motivated in large part by concern about our deteriorating balance of trade unitedstates trade balances had been in deficit since 1975 with participating large deficits in 1977 and 1978 it seemed clear at that time that poor export performance was contributing july 2 7 1982 substantially to the deficits and that increased exports offered one of the more effective ways to remedy the problem those of us who looked closely at the structure of unitedstates trade and the structural impediments to increased exports were struck by the success of our competitors most notably the huge japanese trading companies operating in virtually every country in the world financed in part through strong ties to japanese banks and experienced in alternative trade mechanisms such as barter and threeway trading the japanese trading companies had grown enormously in fact they were becoming increasingly important as export agents for unitedstatesproduced goods from the beginning we used the japanese trading companies as a partial model for etc legislation but maintained careful attention to the different business and legal framework within which our own inst it utions must operate i reintroduced export trading company legislation during the early days of this congress with immediate bipartisan support it was clear that the need for stimulating exports had if anything increased the economic downturn had constricted domestic markets and a stronger dollar had made our exports more expensiveand thus less competitiveon world markets unfortunately those same forces remain today while it cannot fully compensate for them export trading legislation has become an important response to the pressures for new protectionist measures in this country the new administration accepted the need for export trading company legislation and endorsed my bill h r 1648 the senate moved swiftly on almost identical legislation s 734 and on april 8 1981 passed it unanimously by a vote of 93 to 0 in the house h r 1648 and similar bills had been referred to three separate committees and each proceeded independently but none could ignore the growing consensus both in congress and within the business community that export trading company legislation was an idea whose time had come our cause was bolstered by independent studies such as the one undertaken by the new england congressional institute it showed widespread support for the legislation within the business and banking communities and suggested that we would see immediate response to the new opportunities provided by the legislation other studies forecasted that the legislation might provide even more new jobs than originally anticipated an important consideration during this period of escalating unemployment growing awareness of the legislation was immediately translated into appeals for prompt congressional action on march 31 of this year the chairman of the house banking committee submitted his own proposal for the banking related elements of export trading company legislation i was among the original cosponsors of his bill h r 6016 the chairmans approach differed little from the banking title of my own bill and his bill included an additional export stimulus in a provision increasing the limits on bankers acceptances which provide a means of guaranteeing payment for goods being shipped during extensive hearings this spring the committee considered additional changes and refinements suggested by a broad crosssection of interested parties we heard from exporters potential exporters existing trading companies banks and bank regulators almost every witness suggested improvements designed to make the legislation more attractive to his own organization and it was left to the committee to sift through proposed changes in its final form h r 6016 represents careful study cooperation and compromise each element of the bill was subject to the same two tests will it make export trading companics more effective at meeting our export goals and will it be workable within the legal and regulatory structures of unitedstates banking the goal of this legislation has been clear from the beginning increasing exports during the hearings i restated my own conviction that export success not bank profits should be our objective certainly that will be the standard by which the legislation will be judged by a public eager for both the new jobs and the economic boost that exports can provide export trading companies have existed in this country for years but their growth and expansion have been severely limited by inadequate capital although several large corporations including sears and general electric have announced the formation of new trading company subsidiaries their impact at least initially will be limited formation of corporate sponsored etcs has given new impetus to our efforts to open the door to banking investments in trading companies but i doubt we will ever see an american replica of the japanese trading giants it would be too inconsistent with our own business and legal traditions i am convinced that bank investment in trading companies can contribute substantially by helping more unitedstates firms to become exporters in addition to new capital bank participation has the potential to improve the efficiency of trading company operations by making available the existing expertise and infrastructure possessed by large international banks contacts with potential customers familiarity with export financing and currency transactions and better means of evaluating the creditworthiness of foreign customers will all be facilitated by their worldwide networks of offices and affiliates because we felt that exploiting the recognition and goodwill associated with existing banking activities would stimulate exports the committee chose to permit holding companies to use their own names for trading company affiliates in other cases regional banks may choose to build upon their relationships with local business in order to encourage new export activities risk uncertainty and lack of familiarity with export procedures have all discouraged many small and medium sized firms from developing export markets but a wei3 run trading compa ny could substantially reduce those hurdles by linking with existing trading companies regional banks can provide the necessary expertise and financing to make exporting attractive to many more firms in addition because of their familiarity with the financial and management resources of local firms regional banks are uniquely equipped to help small companies meet the challenges of exportrelated growth in addressing the direct objective of increasing unitedstates exports ii r 6016 also represents an important step in the modernization of banking law authorization for bank investment in trading companies constitutes a significant relaxation of the historic legal separation of banking and commerce and the committee carefully reviewed the terms and conditions of such investments this legislation is designed to preserve necessary safeguards for the safety and soundness of our nations banking institutions while permitting bank holding companies to make better use of their substantial resources on a casebycase basis the committee relies on the substantial supervisory and regulatory resources of the federal reserve system to protect banks against the effects of unsound practices by their parent holding companies at the same time the committee also wished to insure that those resources not be applied to blocking legitimate investments a possibility introduced by the feds open scepticism about the legislation accordingly h r 6016 directs that the fed must be advised in writing at least 60 days in advance of a bank holding companys proposed investment in an etc and provides for an additional 30 days review period under defined circumstances absent a formal notice of disapproval from the fed the holding company is authorized to go ahead with the investment specific grounds for disapproval are outlined in the legislation and it was the committees intention that fed review be confined to legitimate questions of bank safety not unrelated activities of either the holding company or its other subsidiaries the legislation itself protects against excessive risk by limiting direct investment to 5 percent of the holding companys consolidated capital and surplus further loans from the holding company and all its other subsidiaries may not total more than 10 percent of the holding companys consolidated capital and surplus the bill approved by the banking committee defines export trading companies as organizations operated exclusively for the purpose of exporting or facilitating the export of goods and services made in the united stateo our choice of the word exclusively reflects a deliberate intention to focus the activities of etcs on exports rather than imports but h r 6016 clearly authorizes such importing activities as are necessary to facilitate exports and promote etc operations in foreign countries etcs are also authorized to make product modifications necessary to prepare unitedstates made goods for foreign markets and to take title to goods being exported an important element of trading company legislation is the explicit recognition of services as a distinct class of exports in fact a growing proportion of our export revenues comes from the services sector in its final form h r 6016 represents the culmination of a long evolutionary process a process marked by long discussion and careful study we have finetuned my original proposal and the resulting legislation will be an important stimulus to our economy thousands of unitedstates companies will now have access to a complete range of export assistance and many will find new prosperity in foreign markets my own involvement with this legislation has been very satisfying and i am

tribute of november 22 1981 to the 24 superbowl xvi victory only serves to underscore how prophetic our earlier words were the tribute to edward j debartolo jr follows as one of san franciscos members of the house of representati ves i am pleased to join with my colleague lyle williams of youngstown ohio in offering this tribute to our friend edward debartolo jr who among other things is owner and chief executive officer of the san fran cisco 49ers at the invitation of my old buddy ken flower i was going to spend the evening with a person described by the san francisco media as a rich young kid from youngstown ohio i was stunned to find instead of the rich outoftowner with a silver spoon a warm outgoing person who could have hung out with me george moscone and the rest of the gang at polk gulch and north beach when i met eddie he was in town for the 49ersredskin game with his close friend carmen policy they were watching boom boom mancini fight alex arguello on television afterward we talked and i was amazed that he could keep up with the chatter of an old north beach lean and tender bartenderwith the same ease that allows him to deal in the world of corporate board rooms i knew we were kindred souls when eddies only criteria for a restaurant was that they serve good baccala and require no neckties by the end of the evening i felt as if i had known him all my life when eddie first took over the 49ers he was the victim of bum raps in the media a rich kid with a new toy lie aint even from the bay area and an outsider although his family home is in youngstown ohio i know eddie debartolo loves our city and the people when he became owner of the 49ers he made only one promise that within 5 years they would be competitive in the league this promise has been more than kept and along with coach bill walsh he has given us exciting gutsy team play every week he has provided 49ers fafis with the finest team in the history of the franchise to see eddie in the locker room hugging slapping hands joking with the players stopping to say a kind word to each team member shows lie recognizes his players as people rather than beef on the hoof to have seen the tears of joy after the pittsburgh game as lie hugged his dad and family then thanked each player was proof of his emotional and personal feelings about our 49ers the team is not a toy but part of his very being far from being a spoiled kid with a new toy eddie debartolo is a beautifiul human being who possess the unique combination of his fathers business acumen and innerstrengh the emotional warmth and commonsense of his mother marie as well as the street smarts of the common person these traits are what makes edward debartolo jr a cut above most of his nfl peers nineteen eightyone marks a significant year significant because this is edward jr s fifth season as the teams owner and chief executive officer five years have passed since the national football leagues san francisco franchise became a vital acquisition of the nationwide debartolo corp and for the teams president stability now has fully arrived on his football club debartolo points with pride to the settling effect that has permeated the organization since 1979 when he hired bill walsh a leading football tactician and a great human being with the ability to bring individuals together as a team on and off the field as head coach and general manager the 49ers were a team in transition during 1977 and 1978 but that transition began to diminish with the arrival of walsh and his staff debartolo says the turnaround came because all of us have a singleness of purpose where the 49ers are concerned he adds the people presently guiding the team under bills direction are the people who will be operating the team for a long time i have pledged my total support to their efforts the 49ers 35yearold president serves the debartolo corp as president and chief administrative officer a role that demands nearly all of his attention and time the corporations home offices are located in youngstown ohio the debartolo family hometown founded in 1948 by edward j debartolo who is the father of the 49ers president the debartolo corp has become one of americas great business success stories it is the leading planner builder owner and operator of enclosed regional shopping malls in the world malls that total more than 74 million square feet of retail space in addition the corporation owns thoroughbred racetracks including luxurious louisiana downs hotels industrial and executive office parks the pittsburgh penguins hockey franchise the pittsburgh civic arena and holds many commercial bank interests including its role as majority stockholder in three banks ed junior not only is one of americas fastest rising young executives for a major corporation but he also is the youngest owner in the 28team national football league his rise began upon graduation from notre dame in 1968 when he joined the company full time moving from depart ment to department learning the many facets of the company which by then had grown into a national corporation and had become recognized as the largest shopping center firm in the united states in 1971 he was appointed a vice president five years later he was named executive vice president while taking over the inhouse debartolo staff of some 300 engineers architects designers financiers leasing agents lawyers management and operations teams along with advertising public relations and marketing personnel he was appointed president and chief administrative officer in july of 1979 working a demanding 7dayaweek schedule that he has continued to today ed junior found little time for those pursuits he still lists as hobblesgolf and footballor returning my phone calls football the dominant interest in his life would become more than just a hobby when he became the 49ers president and general partner in that capacity he controls 90 percent of the club with limited partners jane morabito and franklin mieuli who each own 5 percent e edward junior gives generously of his time and influence when it comes to charitable endeavors he is highly

administration everything it wants but it is our job to judge and it is our job to decide just where this na tions limited resources should be applied you know what this bill represents this bill is americas investment in humanity this bill is where we express out interest and our concern for our fellow man this bill is where we show we still care about those that need a helping hand this bill is where we call forth that early american spirit of extending ourselves to help others help themselves new englanders certainly have not forgotten their heritage of extending a helping hand when a farmers barn was burned the community gathered together to build a new one when the harsh winters threatened the very life of our grandfathers every individual sacrified their own comforts to help everyone pull through not only is this bill americas investment inhumanity it represents stock in americas future this nations future is based on an investment in our individual and collective health it is based on an investment in the education of our citizens our government our nation has always functioned most effectively when our citizens have been educated well informed and involved in their government this nations future is also based on the labors of its citizens this bill represents all of these qualities anol principlles it is americas investment in humanity sure you could indiscriminately cut this bill further so long as you showed no regard for humanity for instance some here would slash all student aid without regard for the fact that by drastically reducing student financial assistance they are pricing all but the children of wealthy persons out of higher and professional education sure we could cut another 50 million or 100 million out of maternal and child health programs by doing so however we would severely undermine the provision of any effective services to children with birth defects to the mentally retarded and to mothers who are clearly at risk of lifethreatening birth complications yes we could take 40 million out of venereal disease prevention programs and watch the rampant cupread of sexually transmitted diseases race even faster through our schoolaged children and we could eliminate further funding of biomedical research or disease prevention activities but where would we be today if we had never developed the electron microscope which has made it possible for medical science to untangle secrets that save thousands of lives every year where would we be as a nation of healthy caring people if we had never developed vaccines and we could go further and eliminate the remaining federal support for employment and training activioctober 8 1 981 october 6 1981 co ties we <could virtually close out ceta title 11 by taking another 1 billion there and in the process we would put more discouraged unemployed persons back on our city streets arnd we could take all the youth employment and training money and put another 1 million youths out of work for next summer i do not believe any among us want to be that irresponsible this bill is americats investment in humanity and we must not sell out the american people we have made lots of cuts we have produced a good package here let us give it our support and protect americas investment in humanity recommitting the bill would not be merely pulling back that helping hand americans have always been willing and eaiger to extend it would be chopping it off at the elbow we cannot allow that to happen let me just reemphasize that less than 4 weeks ago today our subcommittee marked up this bill the human needs of the american people were real at that time they are still very real today if those needs have changed at all they have increased yet here we stand threateningwe the peoples elected representatives threatening to turn away from those needs to shirk our responsibilities i urge my colleages to support this bill and defeat this motion the cuts are deep enough in these human areas let me just remind you that we have already cut 4 billion from ceta we have already cut maternal and child health alcohol drugabuse and mental health activities

seen the steady erosion of that right by congressional efforts blocking access to abortion services for poor women in need of medicaid assistance the fight has now expanded once again to threaten the right of all women to a safe abortion and indeed the socalled prolife forces are now widening their campaign to attack many of the most effective and widely used methods of contraception today on
