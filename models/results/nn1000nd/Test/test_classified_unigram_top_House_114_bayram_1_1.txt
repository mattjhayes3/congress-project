congress take meaningful action to prevent gun violence we all know the statistics whether it is through mass shootings that make the headlines or the unseen violence that happens daily on our streets gun violence takes the lives of more than 30 000 of our nations citizens each year a number that far exceeds other industrial countries now all these countries have their share of violent extremists and madmen but only our country gives easy access to weapons of mass killing and that makes all the difference for america rather than seeking out commonsense solutions to address this crisis the republican majority continues to cower to the gun lobby and the firearms manufacturers now they plead the second amendment but constitutional law 101 would tell us that all of our rights including the precious freedoms of religion and speech must be balanced to protect innocent third parties and to protect the safety of the wider community one commonsense measure we should all agree on is background checks to keep guns out of the hands of criminals domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill you cant shout fire in a crowded theater because of your freedom of speech and neither should you be able to buy a weapon if you have a history of violence and criminality in fact almost 90 percent of americans including the majority of gun owners support universal background checks for all gun purchases the problem is that our present background check system is rife with loopholes background checks are not required for private sales at gun shows they are also not required for internet sales bipartisan legislation has been introduced by representatives peter king and mike thompson that would finally close this egregious loophole it is an entirely sensible reform that would have a measurable impact on the safety of our schools homes and neighborhoods without preventing lawabiding citizens from using guns for selfdefense or recreational purposes despite attracting 186 cosponsors including several republicans the background check legislation has never been brought to the floor or even received a hearing in committee it has been languishing for more than 15 months meanwhile the shootings and the suicides and the massacres continue to accumulate my colleagues we must do better our fellow citizens are totally fed up both with the unspeakable killing and suffering and with a feckless congress that hasnt lifted a finger to prevent it now this week after intense public criticism and a historic protest by democrats on the house floor republicans seemed for a while to be willing to hold a vote on legislation they claim would prevent suspected terrorists from purchasing firearms after all nearly 2 500 individuals on the terrorist watch list have successfully purchased weapons in this country but rather than embrace existing bipartisan legislation to actually fix the problem republicans put forth a woefully inadequate proposal that would require law enforcement and courts to grapple with unworkable processes unreachable standards to be completed in an unreasonably short period of time their bill would allow suspected terrorists to receive firearms by default after only 3 days if the court is unable to work through a complicated process that is the same flaw that allowed the white supremacist charleston shooter to obtain the weapon that he used to murder nine people at emanuel ame church in other words the bill is totally inadequate now under pressure from their most extreme members republican leaders refuse to even put this bill on the floor what should be on the floor is bipartisan legislation h r 1076 that would permit the attorney general to block gun sales to suspected terrorists this legislation based on a proposal from the bush justice department would still allow individuals to challenge the government in court to restore their gun ownership rights we dont have to choose between protecting our communities and respecting due process and so we ask our colleagues how much longer must we wait how many more people have to die to move us to act how many more american towns and cities must be added to the

discussion on the state of black health in america every april we observe national minority health awareness month this year is particularly significant as we mark 30 years since the groundbreaking health and human services task force on black and minority health report this report sparked the first serious discussion in washington on addressing the deep racial health disparities that exist in this country this year also marks 50 years since the creation of medicare and medicaidprograms that have kept and continue to keep americans healthy we are also celebrating the fifth year anniversary of the passage of the affordable care actthe most significant legislation to improve the health of all americans in more than a generation these legislative achievements continue moving us closer to health equity for allhowever major health disparities still exist the zip code in which you are born still determines your likely life expectancy gross disparities exist from zip code to zip codeeven within the same city or county so today i rise to join my colleagues in the congressional black caucus to bring to light the state of black health in america and call for more action to address persistent and lingering disparities in health access treatment and care since the passage of the affordable care act access to care has dramatically expanded in communities of color the uninsured rate has declined 7 3 percent in the african american community and more people have access to affordable quality healthcareall thanks to the affordable care act when we were crafting the affordable care act i had the privilege of serving as chair of the congressional black caucus and let me tell you we worked day and night with our colleagues in the congressional hispanic caucus and congressional asian pacific american caucus to push congress and the administration to craft the best possible bill since its passage the affordable care act has improved the american health care system healthcare is now more affordable and accessible than ever women can no longer be discriminated against because they are a woman have a preexisting conditionsuch as hiv aidsor have been the victim of domestic violence young people can stay on their parents health insurance until they are 26 and people with serious conditions like cancer no longer face the real fear of hitting their lifetime cap and being denied lifesaving treatment the aca also expands the capacity of the healthcare delivery system to better serve those at risk for and living with hiv aids these are the facts the affordable care act has dramatically increased access to preventative care for women lowincome communities and people of color despite rabblerousing and grandstanding from the right this law is saving livesevery day in communities across americafrom maine to my district in the east bay during the last enrollment period 16 4 million americans obtained health insurance and more than half a million came from my home state of california make no mistakethe affordable care act is working african americans and latinos historically underinsured or uninsured groups have seen the greatest declines in their uninsured rates this is especially good news for african americans who are living with hiv where the key to halting the epidemic is access to affordable and quality care with this increase in coverage we are beginning to close the gap in racial and ethnic health disparities and access to care however much work remains to truly realize health equity in america right nowin america the richest and most powerful country in the worldafrican americans still suffer from disproportionately high numbers of preventable deaths disparities in access to quality health care and underrepresentation within the medical community african americans have the highest mortality rate of any racial and ethnic group from cancer furthermore africanamericans are 40 more likely to die from a stroke than whites and 30 more likely to die from heart disease than whites and while african americans are only 13 of the unitedstates population they account for nearly half of all new hiv infections african americans also account for the highest hivrelated deaths and hiv death rates madam speakerthis is unacceptable in an age where technology and innovation are paving the way to new medical breakthroughs these persistent disparities in healthcare cannot be allowed to continue that is why today i urge my colleagues lets work together and commit ourselves to passing legislation that will end racial and ethnic disparities and achieve health equity the affordable care act was a good start but more is needed for years the congressional tricaucus has championed this effort by introducing the health equity and accountability act heaa congresswoman robin kelly will have the honor in introducing this important legislation this congress and i am proud to colead this effort as

believe that museums likewise are that form of beauty my amendment specifically says none of the funds made available in this act may be used to limit outreach programs administered by the smithsonian institution in order to fulfill the smithsonians mission the increase and diffusion of knowledge the smithsonian seeks to serve an even greater audience by bringing the smithsonian to enclaves of communities who otherwise would be deprived of the vast amounts of cultural history offered by the smithsonian our museums of the nation are in trouble the smithsonian has a beautiful array of museums that are here that millions of americans have the opportunity to visit but the outreach program serves millions of americans thousands of communities and hundreds of institutions in all 50 states

district the holocaust museum unique in its presentation of a horrible time in history but it also serves as a very unifying entity in our community the childrens museum as one of the original board members and founders now the childrens museum is one of the major childrens museums in the nation but again it needs the impact of the outreach of the smithsonian and then of course the museum of african american culture headed by a dear friend but also a champion of holding this museum together and that is john guess he needs a fuller embrace by the smithsonian including its expertise its experts its ph d s traveling efforts and again its encouragement of corporate communities to recognize the value of participating in museums the smithsonians outreach activities include the smithsonian institution traveling exhibition the smithsonian center for education and museum studies national science resources center the smithsonian institution press the office of fellowships and the smithsonian associates who are we if we do not value preserving those items that tell the varied and diverse history of america the good history of america the history that is unifying and purposeful in citing us as a country that recognizes our wonderful diversity so i ask my colleagues to support this amendment that deals specifically with allowing the outreach to the kinds of museums that really need the help of the smithsonian the smithsonian in concluding is very important to urban areas and rural areas alike and its ability or its affiliation is to build a strong national network of museums and educational organizations in order to establish active and engaging relationships with communities throughout the country again allow me to salute in particular john guess with the museum of african american culture in houston he has literally put that museum together along with his board members the smithsoniani hope they are hearing me as i am talking on the floor of the housewe need your help in houston texas we probably need your help in washington state in california minnesota new york and beyond to preserve and help these small museums throughout the nation i ask

going forward dealing with the preservation of our museums let me thank mr calvert mr simpson and ms mccollum i yield back the balance of my time mr chair thank you for this opportunity to speak in

life family quilts prairie schoolhouse furnishings historical lunch boxes multilingual store front and street signs etc has been a longstanding organizational priority of the smithsonian sites mobile museum is the only traveling exhibit format able to guarantee audience growth and expanded geographic distribution during sustained periods of economic retrenchment but also because it is imperative for the many exhibitors nationwide who are struggling financially yet eager to participate in smithsonian outreach for communities still struggling to fully recover from the economic downturn the ability of museums to present temporary exhibitions the mobile museum promises to answer an evergrowing demand for smithsonian shows in the field a single conventional sites exhibit can reach a maximum of 12 locations over a twoto threeyear period in contrast a mobile museum exhibit can visit up to three venues per week in the course of only one year at no cost to the host institution or community the net result is an increase by 150 in the number of outreach locations to which sites shows can travel annually and in addition to its flexibility in making shortterm stops in cities and towns from coasttocoast a mobile museum has the advantage of being able to frequent the very locations where people live work and take part in leisure time activities by establishing an exhibit presence in settings like these sites will not only increase its annual visitor participation by 1 million but also advance a key smithsonian performance objective to develop exhibit approaches that

in the house foreign affairs committee which considered the bill on february 24 and voted it out by voice unanimously with no opposition it is also my understanding that the bill also passed unanimously in the committee on homeland security as the chairman of our committee explained this legislation authorizes the state department and the department of homeland security to develop opensource versions of software that vets travelers against terrorist watch lists and law enforcement databases once the software is developed we will be able to share it with our allies and multilateral organizations involved in police work such as interpol that means that we will have better software in the hands of worldwide law enforcement sooner and it will be interoperable as things stand now we do not have a comprehensive global database for identifying and tracking terrorists as the bipartisan task force on combating terrorist and foreign fighter travel which was established by chairman mccaul and the committee on homeland security highlighted in its september 2015 report countries including the united states rely on a patchwork system for swapping extremist identities increasing the odds foreign fighters will slip through the cracks the paris and brussels terrorist attacks demonstrate the need for a global system since those tragedies there has been finger pointing about missed intelligence and criticism over the lack of information sharing across borders just in february europol warned that more than 5 000 europeans with european passports had traveled to isis and syria to become isis fighters in late march european security officials told the associated press that the islamic state group had trained at least 400 attackers and sent them to europe to carry out specific attacks of course we have a visa waiver relationship with most of europe and that means these european passport holders will be able to visit the united states without special vetting by our officials there is an exception to that for those european passports that have been stamped indicating they visited syria or iraq this should not give us a whole lot of false security because typically foreign fighters who want to join isis travel to turkey where their passport is stamped with a turkish stamp and then they sneak into isiscontrolled areas isis does not stamp their passport entry into the islamic state so the passports of these europeans that have gone to fight for isis in iraq and syria do not bear a syrian or iraqi stamp in addition if for some reason they did bear such a stamp any european can simply go and ask for a replacement passport and in most cases there will be no record available to the united states that this person had ever visited syria or iraq so we need a system that gives us the best possible opportunity to identify foreign fighters but especially those who hold european passports if we are going to fight and prevent global terrorism in

i have listened to the entire debate here tonight on the floor starting with votes after 6 30 i was struck by the amount of amendments having to do with the endangered species act number one and number two having to deal with the lists whether threatened or endangered lists of endangered species act clearlyand i would agree with the gentlewoman on the other side of the aisle on thisreform and major reform of the endangered species act is needed that will take some time that discussion has been ongoing it is nothing that hasnt already started in this congress or in previous congresses i look forward to being a part of that solution in a very constructive way what about the near term we have people human constituents who are really suffering and that is what my amendment is about tonight summer is a big time for any industry that depends on tourism to survive i offer this amendment out of concern for two lake communities in my district just last year during the height of the summers busy tourist season the united states fish and wildlife service required that the northern indiana public service company locally known as nipsco release more water into the tippecanoe river from lake freeman to protect a bed of endangered freshwater mussels that live further down the tippecanoe river all under the guise of the endangered species act as a result in a matter of days water levels on lake freeman dropped dramatically i have visited with local residents near lake freeman multiple times and have seen the lake in person growing up during the summers i spent my time on the sister lake lake shafer many who live and work near the lake discovered to their surprise their boats were stuck businesses were in jeopardy and home values were going down but more than that stumps were rising out of the water and personal health and safety were also in jeopardy as a result now i immediately contacted fish and wildlife and i want to applaud them for their responsiveness and nipsco for working together we created a technical assistance letter otherwise known as a tal it is my estimation that that is going to have some effect again i appreciate the reasonableness of all involved the current plan there is a temporary fix and really we ought to be able to do more now currently fish and wildlife receives funding to enforce the endangered species act which protects six species of mussels that live in the river as the clerk mentioned as he read the amendment the endangered species act gives the highest priority to protected and listed species and there is little anyone can do in terms of exceptions or exemptions or even any kind of balancing test to make sure that there is not a solution that could be a winwin it is a very draconian lawstrict compliance no balancing test no room for discretion or creative solution that is where this reform is needed the statute like i said provides no balancing test for weighing the economic harms and the supreme court of this land has refused to allow us or even lower courts to construct their own test us as citizens compliance with this law as currently written requires diverting water from lake freeman to the tippecanoe river to balance water levels despite consideration of the economic impact and human safety in essence my amendment limits the funding mechanism fish and wildlife would be able to use to enforce the endangered species act with respect to these six types of mussels and eliminates the financial repercussions for failing to enforce the law speaking firsthand with residents lowering these water levels in lake freeman negatively affects the community and small businesses that rely on the tourists who enjoy the lake and the steady water level lower water levels also pose dangerous swimming conditions to both boaters and swimmers as formerly underwater tree stumps breach the water this is unnecessary and a preventable hazard to those who use the lake and again in a winwin way it is all because of this draconian law that although well intended is badly in need of reform so that its practical effect can be overhauled and any of its misguided applications halted hoosiers like myself are just as concerned for the environment as they are for their incomes and family recreation it is not about antienvironmentalism but they believe like i said there is a winwin solution here if only the law would allow such a solution to exist in the meantime we ought to defund fish and wildlifes ability to enforce this law as it is written while i value nature and seek to protect endangered animals the reward of protecting the mussel does not outweigh the economic damage done to this community or the personal safety or health of my human constituents"], [0.9949887990951538,

off with some sobering news i call it the body count last year 2015 in the united states there were 41 000 suicide deaths in this country there were 45 000 deaths from drug overdoses many of those folks suffered from depression there were an estimated 1 200 homicides by people who are seriously mentally ill about half of all deadly police encounters occurred with someone who is mentally ill there is an unknown number of mentally ill who died 25 years sooner because they tend to die of chronic illnesses there is about one homeless person per day in los angeles who dies we know about 200 000 homeless people in this country are mentally ill it is a sad case in any numbers but if you add those numbers up even the most conservative version is that there were some 85 000 deaths last year related to mental illnessand it is probably much higherand more have died from mental illnessrelated problems than the total united states combat deaths of the entire korean war and vietnam wars combined that is sobering but it is worse it is worse because we could prevent a large number of these mental illness problems we could save many of those with mental illness from their early demise we could save their families from suffering but unfortunately the federal government is the problem let me lay out this evening in this special order some of the particular problems that we have in particular for those who are low income medicaid itself is one of the biggest discriminators against people with mental illness getting treatment first consider this fifteen percent of medicaid recipients have serious mental illness that is far more than the general population serious mental illness is things like schizophrenia bipolar illness schizoaffective disorder and severe depression thirtyone percent of those on ssi have serious mental illness twentysix percent of those with social security disability have serious mental illness in the general population by the way there is only about 1 percent with schizophrenia about 2 6 of the general population have been diagnosed as bipolar so look at how much higher those numbers are among the poor that makes sense because mentally ill people are three times more likely to have low income as a result of their mental illness lowincome individuals are three times more likely to have mental illness many as a result of being poor poverty and homelessness are both associated with serious mental illness both are associated with inadequate primary care and preventative care but here are some ways that medicaid makes it harder for people with mental illness to get care first of all there is a rule called the sameday doctor rule if you take someone to the doctor and the internist or family physician is very concerned that person has a mental illness they are told they have to come back another day before they can see the psychiatrist that is a serious problem because when you have the warm handoff in the doctors office you have 95 percent that will return versus less than half if they have to come back another day and treatment is the key to getting better there is a 16bed rule from the institute of mental diseases which says that if the hospital has more than 16 beds and you are between ages 22 and 64 we are not paying for it the problem with that is that serious mental illness tends to emerge in 50 percent of the cases by age 14 and in 75 percent of the cases by age 24 so at the very time when problems are emerging the very time when someone may have their first serious crisis that may require some inpatient care they are told there will be no room only 45 percent of medicaid recipients with schizophrenia actually get evidencebased care only 35 percent of those with a bipolar diagnosis who are on medicaid get evidencebased care listen to this statistic ninetytwo percent of lowincome children and foster children are prescribed drugs off labelthose are drugs that are not approved by fdaaccording to an hhs inspector generals report and many of those prescriptions according to the report are done without clinical justification the homeless with schizophrenia have a rate of hospitalization for complications of hypertension almost twice as high as others fifty percent of individuals with schizophrenia are noncompliant with treatment regimens during their illness and dont adhere to medications they need assistance in doing so also half of those with serious mental illness have at least two chronic physical health conditions such as chronic pulmonary disease infectious disease cardiovascular disease gastrointestinal problems and these people are generally in poorer health so what happens is that those with serious mental illness and a number of other clinical aspects have compromised physical symptoms and we dont have a place to treat them we used to have 550 000 psychiatric hospital beds in the 1950s now we have less than 40 000 during that same time the population of the united states climbed from 150 million to over 300 million today so where do people who have an acute mental health crisis go sadly whether it is acute or chronic about 200 000 of our homeless are mentally ill twentyeight percent of them get some of their food out of a garbage can we also have a large portion of those with mental illness filling our prisons when we closed down those psychiatric hospitals some got better but basically we traded the hospital bed for the prison cot a blanket over a subway grate an emergency room or a gurney or a slab in some morgue the incarceration rate among the seriously mentally ill is 16 percent of the population some 60 percent of the incarcerated may have some level of mental illness and then what happens in the area of violence well in general people with mental illness are no more violent than the rest of the population but when untreated serious mental illness occurs they are 16 times more likely to be perpetrators of violence as i said before there are over 1 000 homicides a year and we have no idea how many are victims of crime estimates are it is 6 to 10 times greater what happens if a person with mental illness is not treated the longer a person waits for treatment for a psychotic episode the longer it takes a persons illness to come into remission that means it costs more for bipolar illness the sooner a person starts lithium the greater their improvement it means it would cost less if we treated them delusions hallucinations and other severe symptoms increase the longer treatment is withheld as far as the costs go the cost of schizophrenia alone far exceeds that of coronary artery disease the mortality rates of schizophrenia are far more than breast cancer the costs of serious mental illness in this country are about 55 billion in direct costs and 70 billion in indirect costs but there is also the added cost of emergency room care added cost of primary care and the cost of treating their other medical problems the deinstitutionalization move in this country is associated with much higher suicide rates such that while our country has made great strides in reducing mortality rates over the last couple of decades in heart disease auto accidents hiv aids stroke and cancer we have seen huge increases in suicide rates and drug overdose deaths as a nation we should be ashamed of that as a congress we should be ashamed if we do nothing about this that requires a great deal of change on our part that means we are going to have to do something to help people with mental illness get treatment half are simply not compliant and dont adhere to their medication they get worse their medical problems get worse the medicaid bills get higher half of those with serious mental illness as i said have two or more chronic physical health conditions and it gets worse for them there are several things we must do to treat this tonight we are going to hear from a number of

this is one of the few areas of disagreement between the chairman and myself when we look at how we are progressing or the lack of more progress in our struggle against isis and al qaeda in places like syria and iraq we are often tempted to consider those that we take off the battlefield as a metric of our successwe have eliminated so many combatants from the battlefield but of course that number in isolation means very little and the challenge is that with every one we take off the battlefield there are new foreign fighters coming onto the battlefield the recruitment of those additional fighters uses a variety of images and issues to attract people to join the jihad one of the issues that is continually used as recruiting propaganda is the presence of the detention center at guantanamo bay this is a recruitment vehicle for the jihadis it is a rallying cry for the jihadis the closure of this prison will not end the threat from isis or al qaeda there will be other efforts to recruit but why give them this recruitment tool when there are other better ways that these people can be incarcerated why give them this recruitment vehicle when there are ways that we can secure the people at guantanamo bay prosecute the people at guantanamo bay uphold our highest standards and the rule of law and remove at least one part the jihadi social media and other propaganda campaign i think it is in our national security interest to do so i would urge support for the amendment i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.00954669713973999, 0.49045330286026, 0, "i rise today to acknowledge what is happening in america i think it is important that all of us every single citizen take stock of what is going on in our country there are a lot of people hurting there are a lot of people upset high anxiety a lot of confusion i think this is a time for us to take stock as citizens and to think about how we can be better listeners to each others concerns i think this is a time for us to calm down and think deliberatively how do we open our heart open our ears and see if we can understand the perspective that other people share i think there is one thing that we must all reflect on the most as citizens i think about chief brown in dallas and that press conference he gave a week ago where he said most days we dont feel appreciated lets not make this most days when a member of our law enforcement wakes up gets out of bed has breakfast with their family kisses their loved ones goodbye puts that badge on and walks out the door they go out there to keep us safe they go out there to protect the streets they go out there and risk their lives to preserve our lives we throw a lot of big words around in this chamber duty honor sacrifice they do it every single day so i think it is so important that as americans we take stock and we thank the men and women serving in our law enforcement all around this country for what they do for us i think it is really important that we thank their families for enduring the stress and the hardship that comes with such a job as we try to make most days different than most days in the past and as we try to make sure that we give our law enforcement community the respect and the thankfulness that they deserve lets make sure that we listen to each other in this country so we can better understand so that we can make most days in the future better days than we have had in the past our country is hurting and it needs to start healing i urge all americans to do their best to make this country better"]]}
