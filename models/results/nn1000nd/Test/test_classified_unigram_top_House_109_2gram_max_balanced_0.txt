policies of the budget resolution both the bush and republican budgets suffer from the same infirmities fiscal irresponsibility and selfserving and outoftouch priorities both are wholly inadequate to meet the needs of our nation and will pass along mounting deficits and debts to generations yet unborn first the 5year republican budget will result in a deficit of 376 billion in 2006 44 million over the presidents projection the republicans budget proposal also has many cost omissions because they know that their deficit numbers explode after 5 years as such this budget does not take into account the cost of fixing the amt which will cost at least 642 billion it does not take into account the 774 billion needed to pay for the presidents muchtalked about but yet unveiled social security privatization plan i suppose the republican budget proposal deserves a little credit for hiking its deficit projection as it at least includes 50 million in 2006 for the wars in afghanistan and in iraq the presidents budget proposal contained zero dollars as a matter of fact it reported that the costs could not be known however both figures are fantasy the realistic figure over the next 10 years in addition to the 80 billion that we just passed in the supplemental is likely to be 384 billion to pay for its misguided policies the house budget resolution cuts nondefense discretionary spending by 12 billion below the amount needed in fiscal 2006 just to maintain current spending levels and it cuts spending on mandatory domestic programs by 8 billion to add insult to injury the republican budget provides 18 billion in additional tax cuts these misguided tax cuts will actually cost much more when the tax cuts actually expire in 2010 in fact 97 percent of these tax cuts will benefit taxpayers with incomes above 200 000 i think most reasonable people can agree that these priorities are not americas priorities while little good can be said about the bush administrations budget it at least provides detailed information on the programs it seeks to cut the house resolution shrouds its cuts in darkness leaving the american people to wonder what vital programs will find their way to the ch6ppinig block next both the republican and bush budget proposals are travesties when the bush administration took office the nation was experiencing record surpluses it has managed to turn a 521 billion surplus into a 367 billion deficit in contrast the spratt alternative budget as well as the congressional black caucus alternative budget that we will consider tomorrow focus national spending on priorities that benefit all americans and get us on the road to economic recovery they do this by funding key domestic priorities which address the needs of working families while fully supporting the national defense and protection of our homeland and preserving medicaid social security pension programs and student loans let me speak particularly about the budget developed by the congressional black caucus which corrects the irresponsible fiscal and economic policies contained in the house budget resolution by supporting existing programs that are essential to closing disparities creating opportunities and helping our citizens build their future it will get our country on the road to recovery while funding meaningful national priorities for our children for our seniors for our veterans and for our communities importantly the congressional black caucus budget supports these priorities while also meeting our obligation to our troops in iraq and in afghanistan the cbc budget funds community development programs including restoring funding to the community development block grant program and supporting increased funding for elderly and disabled housing programs the congressional black caucus budget will also restore funding for veterans health care rather than imposing new copayments on them for essential services and prescription drugs importantly the congressional black caucus budget will reduce the budget deficit by 167 billion during the next 5 years below the deficit that will be produced by the house budget resolution theirepublican budget cuts educational housing and health programs for our children while bequeathing to them a public debt that has increased by 1 268 trillion over the last 4 years and that will exceed 4 6 trillion even before we begin fiscal year these actions are not only irresponsible they are unconscionable in the end one can only conclude that the republican budget balances itself on the backs of americans who can least afford it i urge the administration to reconsider its illconceived economic policies the congressional black caucus budget is the ultimate expression of our national priorities and our priorities must be our children our families our elderly and our veterans and of course our soldiers"], [0.0001462697982788086, 0.9998537302017212, 1, "this congress is set to vote on a budget that

an important hearing on the dubai ports issue he will be able to join us as well the 2007 budget takes america down a wrong and unsustainable path the decisions the president made in this budget favor the wealthy over the working class these decisions reward those who live off what th6 irs considers to be unearned income while making those who have to work long hours every day to support themselves and their families pay far more in taxes in fact i think you would have found bipartisan agreement if we could have worked out tax cuts that were more in the interest of the working class and those hardworking families but in fact when you combine the focug of the tax cuts on those who live primarily off unearned income and the spending cuts that purportedly are necessary to offset the cost of these tax cuts the majority of young people in this country will find it harder to go to college it will be harder for lowincome elderly to get the nutrition and health care they need and it will be much harder for our grandchildren to pay for the future needs that their generation will face the decisions made in the presidents 2007 budget like his budgets since 2002 define a nation a community if you will that is not the america that we know in fact his priorities are just the opposite of what makes america great we heard from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle they call it a socalled republican truth squad it boggles your mind but the fact is that the bush administration has raised spending while they have cut taxes you cant fight two wars on four tax cuts ladies and gentlemen the gentlewoman from north carolina suggested that the government never invests it only spends well what does she think is the purpose of the interstate highway system that enabled our economy to fulfill its potential during the eisenhower administration and subsequent administrations or the money that we have put into the public schools systems to empower our working class and that is what we are talking about investment that will give us sustainable benefits versus tax cuts that are immediately lost most of which seem to be invested overseas and cuts in the real safety net that can make america achieve its greatness the conscious choices made in this budget reflect the flawed policies of an administration that has taken this country down a terribly wrong path one that consists of waging an unnecessary and extraordinarily costly war delivering huge tax cuts to the very wealthiest of this nation and taking the federal debt to depths never before experienced while reducing services to working americans first the 2007 budget is heavily impacted by the consequences of a reckless foreign venture namely the war in iraq the presidents 2007 budget sets aside another 120 billion supplemental to cover the cost of waging this war in fiscal 2007 of course this is on top of a regular defense budget of over 450 billion and in fact we have now allotted over 400 billion when you look through fiscal 2007 primarily for this war in iraq and very little for the war in afghanistan that was referred to by our colleague from maryland the money that is requested in these iraq war supplementals is 40 billion more than we request for transportation 33 billion more than we request for education and training more than 40 billion more than we request for the care of our military veterans inbre than 90 billion more than we will set aside to protect our environment and natural resources and more than 80 billion for what is considered diplomacy but is spent on dealing with the aids crisis on dealing with the ethnic cleansing the genocide in sudan and throughout the world places where we could have such a constructive positive effect the arhount of money that is being requested in fiscal 2007 for this war iii iraq will bring the total amount requested by the bush administration to 490 billion an enormous sum the american people have to ask has this been worth it given the results to date but we know the results are more than 2 300 americans who have lost their lives in iraq more than 16 700 who have been wounded tens if not hundreds of thousands of iraqi casualties andyet osama bin laden is still on the run iraq now appears to be descending into an allout civil war and al qaeda recruitment levels are reportedly stronger than ever but while our men and women are risking their lives overseas at the instruction of this administration and of course we have great regard for their courage and sacrifice we are not being asked to sacrifice at home and in fact the people who have been the most rewarded by this great economythat was built on the investments that have been made in prior generationsthey are being asked to sacrifice the least in fact they are actually being rewarded the same time that these men and women are going to war we are continuing trillions of dollars of tax cuts that primarily benefit the very wealthiest in our society and yet these tax proposals are going to cost the american people about 3 trillion 3 trillion over the next decade the benefits from these tax cuts are heavily skewed toward the wealthy if they were to fix the alternative minimum tax for the middle class that would be one thing if they were to help workingclass families deal with the vulnerabilities they face in providing for their families that would be one thing but that is not where most of it goes more than half of these benefits go to the 4 percent of americans who make over 200 000 annually four years from now in 2010 taxpayers with incomes of more than 1 million a year will receive average tax cuts worth 155 000 100 times the tax cut that the average taxpayer will receive is that fair is that smart i dont think it is appropriate and i dont think it reflects americas priorities and they come at a huge cost to the fiscal security of this nation causing massive amounts of annual federal deficits over the last 4 years we have seen the largest deficits in the history of our nation mr scott is going to show you what has happened over the last 5 years on a chart i hope you will pay close attention it is unbelievable the current fiscal year 2006 is expected to produce the largest deficit ever in the history of our country at 423 billion and this doesnt even take into account the supplemental spending requests that the president will send up to the hill any day now which will increase the 2006 deficit to well over half a trillion dollars and fiscal 2007 will be another year of historic deficits predicted to be 354 billion in fact since president bush took office we have had the largest annual deficits in the history of this country and those numbers are net numbers after you take the social security surplus and offset it against general fund deficits so you can add another 200 billion annually to each of those numbers so we are creating debt of over 500 billion a year these deficits and the 8 trillion in debt we now have as a result of prior deficits will place on our children anti grandchildren an unprecedented level of debt burden because of these policies every child born today automatically inherits 28 000 as their share of the federal debt and under the presidents budget proposals a child born just 5 years from now will inherit a much larger share in fact they will be paying taxes for nearly the first 5 months of every year just to pay the interest on the debt that their parents generation incurred the presidents massive budget deficits also require us to borrow from foreign governments foreign investors now hold half of the countrys publicly held debt china alone holds 250 billion of the public debt which is more than 300 percent the amount that chinaheld only 5 years ago they have a fiscal guillotine over our necks if they chose to use it we are so dependent upon chinas being willing to borrow all this debt that we generate year after year let me just show you a chart in fact of this foreign debt mr kahn our very able staff director on the house budget committee has put this together this is the aggregate unitedstates national debt held by foreign countries now the debt was climbing during the reagan years in the 1980s continued to climb during the bush years during the beginning of the clinton years it started to top oft and then with president clinton having adopted the payasyougo policy of the first president bush having to pay for tax cuts as well as additional spending we got the budget under control we had an estimated 5 6 trillion surplus predicted for the succeeding decade go foreign debt would have gone down just like this and as our foreign debt went down our national security would have gone up but this administration decided they did not want to adopt the policies of the father they did not want any payasyougo they just wanted to cut taxes the heck with paying it we will send a credit card to the next generation they can pay off our debt that is their problem not ours we are going to live high off the hog we are going to reward our contributors and the fact is that that is exactly what has happened and we have driven this nation into debt but even more seriously look at what has happened to foreign debt foreign debt has gone up like this to here we are now at 1 5 trillion here we are at 1 175 trillion and here we are over 2 trillion in 2005 a substantial share being purchased by china as i just said a 300 percent increase in chinas share of the foreign debt but imagine what has happened to foreign debt since 2001 when this president took office talk about endangering national security now who pays for all of this well what happens is that the american people obviously pay our children will pay most of it but even today the sick and the elderly who need care that cannot be provided by their families will pay we will have our college students pay in reductions in student loans and basically the dignity and the upward mobility of the american working class is going to suffer for these policies this is a situation that is not sustainable that has to be reversed now everyone is entitled to their own ideological opinions i do not think they ought to be entitled to their own set of facts this is factual information you can check in any of these budget documents put out by the government you can find that the amount of debt has skyrocketed the amount of debt held by foreign nations has skyrocketed to an even greater degree we are dependent on countries like china to keep us afloat and in fact the working class has suffered our children are going to pay the bill and we are involved in a war that we are only paying for by borrowing from the future we have not paid one dime of the cost of the iraq war nor have we paid for the tax cuts that we have so blithely passed with this i would like to yield to mr scott who has been on the budget committee for several years and he is going to show you some shocking charts as well"], [0.00025707483291625977, 0.9997429251670837, 1, "let me just say this i will not say the republican study committee i will say the republican conference i mean the bottom line is we would not have the philosophy of a few come to the floor pass the budget committee and possibly a threat for it to come to the floor by the end of the week if it was not for the help of the republican conference now they are our friends we are coffee together we ride the elevator together we walk down the hall together we talk about raising our children and all of the things that people do who work together we all work together but we have a difference in philosophy and priorities and i will tell my colleagues right now and i just want to make sure that members if you have a family member that is a veteran i want you to go grab them because i am about to say something i want to make sure that we understand that these cuts and we are talking about 60 million americans 60 million th are jon medicaid right now enrolled in medicaid 60 million americans not 60 million iraqis not 60 million somalians 60 million americans who pay their taxes every day that know what it means to punch in and punch out at work every day know what it means to have a 15minute lunch break or a break in the morning if they get it 15 minutes in the afternoon and a 30minute lunch break if they get it these are the people that we are talking about also children are enrolled in this too so it is very very important i am looking here at the families usa which is a voice for health care consumers i mean basically they are saying these cuts this proposal will force lowincome people to pay like you said higher premiums that they cannot afford and copayments so let us just call it what it is it looks good when you look at the numbers and oh these are the cuts that we are making but let us translate what those cuts mean it means that for the premiums and copayments that people are making under the medicaid plan now which is not the greatest because this republican congress has increased it time after time now we are about to do it again they are not going to be able to afford health care so we might as well say that we do not have it we have companies now that are telling people to go and enroll in medicaid because they we do not have a national health care plan they cannot participate in that program so when folks start talking about weaning people off let us talk about this i have also said we talk about the difference between democrats and republicans now here is one for the veterans that allowed us to be here under the lights in this chamber fought for this country still fighting for this country and also i want to call special attention to our members who come to the floor and give great floor speeches about how we love the troops well i have not seen a member come to the floor yet and say hey listen i do not like the troops so to say that i care about the troops we all care about the troops we all want to make sure the troops are okay but what happens when they come home what happens what happens when after the parade what happens what happens after they turn their uniform in what happens to those individuals let me tell you what is going to happen under this budget the bottom line is that the republican budget cuts that are being made in health care are 14 million below current service over the next 5 years now i am going to tell my colleagues something maybe i represent too many veterans maybe i have heard too many stories about when someone who wants to see an ophthalmologist or a podiatrist or some sort of specialty at the va and they have to wait 6 months for an appointment 6 months for an appointment and in rural areas 1 9 6 it is even worse there are areas where they have va facilities and clinics that are only open once or twice a month and under this budget with a straight face they are going to come to the floor and that is the reason why periodical after periodical is saying that it is hard for the republican conference to even vote for their own budget now folks come to the floor well we want our friends on the dertocratic side if they could support us yes we want to balance the budget but we do not want the veterans who have been waiting 6 months now to have to wait a year because the majority side has made a 5year cut of 14 billion that is not chicken feed that is a lot of money and then it goes further because facts hurt facts hurt reality hurts we are here to make sure that we give voice to those americans that sent us here some folks use it very loosely this is the peoples house well guess what we believe it wedo not use it as a punch line we are here because people have elected us furthermore it goes on to require the veterans affairs committee to make 798 million in additiqnal cuts over the next 5 years also it imposes new fees for veterans for health care by reducing veterans benefits such as disability payments pension benefits and educational benefits now let me tell my colleagues something like we say sometimes let us put the cookie on the bottom shelf the bottom line is that folks are sugarcoating a number we are making these cuts and we have to do this one says we have to do it on behalf of the katrina commission another person says well we want the katrina commission but because of hurricane katrina we have to respond to those individuals some say well we have to make sure that we reduce the national debt and that is the reason we are making these cuts and we all know that even in the senate there is a lot of chestbeating because there is a 6 billion tax break mainly for the top bracket and mainly for the special interests that they are going to push through this chamber why because if there is going to be a tax cut there should be a tax cut that is going to help every day americans but how can we with a straight face when we have veterans waiting 6 months for basic health care when we have folks in devastated areas with the three natural disasters that we have had that cannot even get a housing voucher that were made homeless because of the natural disaster when we have a government that is trying to figure out how we are going to continue to pay for the war in iraq how we are going to be able to pay for incompetence incompetence in the government how we are going to continue to condone cronyism a culture of cronyism at the same time the bottom line is ladies and gentlemen i believe the ma jority side really needs to have a meeting they need to have a meeting and talk about the true priorities of america and then one of those points in that meeting should be you know we really need to move in a bipartisan way oh wow that is a great idea hey let us work with the democrats and republicans and let us save the country now i am coming in f or a landing now i am going to tell you something people are saying why are you all on the floor every night why why are you on the floor every night some people are saying it is a great thing democrats and republicans we are glad the people are breaking this thing down so that we can all understand because we can use cbo and all the acronyms and folks can come to the floor and say we want to make america stronger what i am describing here is making a country weaker not because of the country and the people that live in it but the leadership that is supposed to govern it on behalf of making this country stronger these are the facts thirdparty validators these are the facts like it or not one other fact and ms wasserman schultz i am getting ready to yield to you i am going to take this chart out you know if i could mr ryan i would put this chart on the front of my truck so that people can see it if i had the resources i would get a billboard so that people understand what is going on this is not a woof speech this is a reality speech the bottom line is that the majority that is in control now need it be the house or senate or need it be the white iouse the policies that they are putting forth are not helping and strengthening our country period dot i do not want to make it seem like it is some sort of extreme statement it is not an extreme statement what i just described was happening to veterans the last 15 minutes we talked about what is happening to medicaid and medicare is on the table mr delahunt the bottom lineis 42 presidents 1776 we were not even thought of you know as members in this house here to the year 2000 42 presidents 1 01 trillion that we borrowed from foreign nations president bush not by himself with the republican majority not by himself i just want to make sure that everyone understands that the president does not have the ability to do this all by himself trust me 1 05 trillion from foreign nations mr ryan including china and so i think it is important that people understand this is not democratic talk this is not independent talk this is not even republican talk this is reality and unless we rise up i just want to make sure that we let the members know we know exactly on a majority side you can have a study group you can have a caucus within the caucus you can have subcommittees the bottom line is the policy will never see the light of day if it was not for the republican majority here in this house pushing it to the floor and that is the reason why that is the reason why you have republican conference members that have big problems they are you know they are even looking at their calendar saying well goodness it is my sons birthday on saturday maybe i can tell leadership we are going to celebrate it on thursday because i do not want to be here for this vote because how can i explain back home how we are increasing the wait list for veterans how we are cutting benefits for your children to go to college and we are going to put the responsibility on your back to take up the slack because we want to give tax cuts to special interests to billionaires i mean that is a hard thing to explain especially when you are by yourself back in your district and you are not hiding behind the press release from the majority office of this house of representatives and that ig the fact jack and the bottom line is we are going to man up and woman up and leader up and say no and that is the reason why it has not been to the floor and i hope that is the reason why it will not come to the floor in its present form and that we go into if we had rule xxi which we do have rule xxi here in the house but if we had a rule xxi like the senate we should go into closed session folks grab the mike the leadership and the bottom line is work out a plan that we can all work together take from the democratic budget the republican budget and do what americans want us to do they do not want us here talking about one another back and forth but the bottom line is that is the road map that has been laid out by the majority ms"], [0.0002830624580383301, 0.9997169375419617, 1, "i rise this evening to talk about the federal debt now president bush was going to be a fiscal conservative and we were going to have smaller government we actually have larger government he has in his 5 short years in office in concert with the republican congress raised the entire debt of the united states of america by 45 percent in 5 short years that is some accomplishment that figures out to 27 730 per person in the united states but that is not enough because actually with a debt limit of about 8 3 trillion we bumped up against it yet again because of the profligate borrowing by this president and the republican congress so secretary snow has requested a fourth increase in 5 years in the national debt limit by another 781 million which he says will tide us over for about a year now what is extraordinary is that right now the government of the united states is teetering on the edge of default in fact the government has cashed in the retirement fund the 401 k of federal employees the g fund in order to not exceed the debt limit set by congress because the leadership here doesnt want to admit to their profligacy they will not allow a vote an upordown vote here in the house on raising the debt limit so they are waiting for the senate to sneak it into a really big bill on the senate side and then they can bring it back over here and pretend that they had nothing to do with it i mean who could have known the debt has gone up 45 percent in 5 years well it is time that they fessed up to what they are doing here the fastest growing part of the federal budget is not the entitlements which we hear so much about we hear about those darned student loans that we cut last month so we could finance tax cuts for rich people and those darned poor people who need health care that we cut last month to help finance tax cuts for rich people actually the fastest part of the federal deficit and budget is interest on the debt that is true interest on the debt which will be 247 billion next year one quarter of 1 trillion now that interest on the debt will not feed a single child it will not help one young person get an education it will not help one senior get a medicare prescription drug benefit it will not give one soldier help with needed equipment in the field no that 250 billion a quarter of 1 trillion will be paid out for profligacy and waste and debt what is even worse is guess what a lot of that money is not even flowing to investors here in the united states of america this president has yet another record he has in 5 short years created more foreign debt than the 42 presidents that preceded him in office now that is something that is really something one president george bush has created more foreign debt than the 42 presidents in more than 200 years that preceded him in office this fiscal conservative this smallgovernment guy how has he do done it well he has done it with a combination of increases in spending a lot of corporate welfare and tax cuts for rich people and major corporations and subsidies to big corporations like in the energy bill because there is not enough incentive at 60 a barrel to drill for oil we have to borrow money the taxpayers do give it to the oil companies and ask them to go out and look for oil that was sort of the core of the bush energy bill 48 percent of our public debt is now held overseas japan holds 687 billion china is second and coming up fast at 300 billion and on down the list this is something that plits the future of our country in jeopardy huge amounts of our debt washing around overseas in countries that might or might not have our best interests in mind long term and might or might not want to continue to lend us money to help finance this profligacy so now the president is saying that he is really serious this time around he is really serious about it he says we are going to address this we are going to cut the debt in half in the next 4 years what he does not tell people is that most of that socalled reduction of the debt is by borrowing all of the surplus that is supposed to flow into the social security trust fund and spending it and not counting it as part of the debt so as the social security surplus grows he says that he is moving us toward a balanced budget of course someday we are going to have to honor those bonds to pay future social security benefits it is time for fiscal sanity here in washington d c we need a change in the congress and the white house to get it e0 1645"],

twohundredandtwentysome billion dollars out of this budget now when you look and you compare what we have to pay in interest on the debt compared to what we are paying for education or homeland security or veterans it is totally and utterly disproportionate to the kind of investments we need to be making because this money and on the chart here we are borrowing this money from the japanese government we are borrowing the money from the chinese government we are borrowing the money from opec countries we are ceding our country away to these other foreign interests and at the same time we are asking japan and cliina to borrow money because we do not have enough because we are giving out corporate subsidies to the oil companies and corporate welfare to the pharmaceutical companies while

wealthy drug companies and hmos an energy bill tax cuts for the oil and gas industry despite their recordbreaking profits and now an increase in the minimum wage with estate tax cuts for the wealthiest few attached the republicans believe that lowwage workers dont deserve a raise unless paris hilton also gets a big tax cut no wonder the american people are so sick and tired of politics as usual in washington i would ask my republican colleagues why is it so impossible for you to do anything good for working families why does it cause you such pain and anguish and handwringing why cant you just do the right thing congress has not raised the minimum wage since 1997 that is 9 years during that same period of time congress has raised its own salary eight times now that is what i call out of touch the congressional pay raise just the amount of the pay raise in the last 9 years has been 30 000 almost triple what a minimumwage worker earns in an entire year the average corporate ceo who will benefit of course from the estate tax cut earns more before lunchtime than a minimumwage worker earns all year a republican staffer told the columbus ohio dispatcher not too many people work at minimum wage anymore i dont think it gets you anywhere politically politics arent the point the point is to make sure that people who work hard every day in this country have enough money to feed their families and pay their rent and fill up their gas tanks nearly 15 million americans will benefit from a minimumwage increase 6 6 million directly and 8 3 million indirectly almost 60 percent of those workers are women 40 percent are people of color 35 percent of them are their familys sole wage earners you want to talk about family values about helping children just raise the minimum wage even worse the massive estate tax cut being tacked onto this bill will actually harm those hardworking families by adding millions of dollars to the national debt the children of todays minimumwage worker will have to pay that debt they will have to deal with increased interest rates they will have to deal with china and other countries controlling the debt of this country they will have to deal with the cuts in education and health care it is outrageous in additionthis rule makes in order a pefision bill that not only misses an important opportunity to deal with this countrys retirement security crisis it also will lead to benefit cuts for millions of american workers and let me again clarify it for the record so there is no mistake this is not a conference report that we are voting on here tonight i want to make it clear because there is some misunderstanding this is not the result of the conference negotiations that we have this bill before us tonight the pension bill fails to encourage companies to keep offering traditional pensions to their workers it fails companies from using bankrdptcy to dump worker pension plans and it fails to stop companies from awarding lavish retirement compensation packages to executives at the same time they cut workers benefits i cant say it any more plainly the priorities of this republican leadership are not the priorities of the american people what the american people want and what they deserve isa clean upordown vote on increasing the minimum wage we have voted on this issue in various procedural votes over and over and over and over we want a clean vote we want this to become the law of the land we want to make sure that lowincome wage earners get the raise that they deserve so they can get out of poverty and what the american people also want and eserve is a pension bill that protects them they wont be getting any of that today so i urge my colleagues to reject this rule i reserve the balance of my time"],

families i know i speak for all our colleagues when i say it is a privilege to call the gentleman from new york colleague i also extend my thanks to the distinguished ranking member of the subcommittee on trade the gentleman from maryland for his very very substantive review of this cafta treaty it has been an enormous help to members and i thank him for his leadership as well i rise in strong opposition to the central american free trade agreement it is a small treaty economically but it has enormous implications for our country i oppose cafta because it is a step backward for workers in central america and a job killer here at home as a californian and there are many of us in the chamber this evening we all know full well the significance of our close ties to central america my own city of san francisco is blessed with large populations of central americans including those who sought sanctuary from el salvador and those fleeing decades of civil war in guatemala our fate is tied with our neighbors in the hemisphere president john f kennedy recognized this in 1961 when he announced the alliance for progress calling for vast multilateral programs to relieve the continents poverty and social inequities the alliance for progress included both economic cooperation and called for economic reforms as conditions of participation just as we call for stronger labor and environmental standards today as the reasonable condition for trade agreements i wish that the cafta bill we are debating tonight were an agreement that opened markets included basic labor standards and protected our environment this type of agreement would have lifted the economies of both the united states and central america it would have attracted support from a large number of democratic members who have long histories of supporting free and fair trade including recent trade agreements with australia singapore chile morocco jordan vietnam and cambodia unfortunately that is not the type of trade agreement before us tonight instead we are considering a trade agreement that protnotes a race to the bottom that hurts unitedstates workers that turns back the clock on basic internationally accepted worker protections and fails to protect the environment as a result the republican leadership is having a hard time convincing its own members to vote for this bill we have heard our colleague earlier the gentleman from ohio talking about twisting arms until they are broken into a thousand pieces the new york times today the gentleman referenced the new york times so i will too said that a white house official said that the last votes are likely to be won with the most expensive deals we should be able to pass good fair trade agreement treaties on their merits instead the administration is trying to persuade people with side bars side letters and side deals they have never worked in the past they are just a con and i hope that our colleagues will not fall for the con in their desperation to win votes the president and the republican leadership in the house have also proclaimed that cafta here tonight will promote unitedstates security and democracy in central america the truth is if we want to improve our national security and promote democracy there we should heed the words of pope paul vi who said if you want peace work for justice trade alone devoid of basic living and working standards has not and will not promote security nor will it lift developing nations out of poverty our national security will not be improved by exploiting workers in central america here at home this cafta threatens unitedstates jobs by making it harder for american businesses and farmers to compete with countries that have excessively low wages and deficient working conditions i repeat here at home cafta threatens unitedstates jobs by making it harder for american businesses and farmers to compete with countries that have excessively low wages and deficient working conditions we have lost 2 8 million manufacturing jobs since president bush took office cafta does not solve the jobs problem it only digs the hole deeper these downward pressures create a race to the bottom that needlessly threaten unitedstates jobs nothing in this agreement will help raise substandard wages in central america or help create a strong middle class that has the disposable income to buy unitedstates goods democrats understandthe need to help our central american neighbors reap the benefits of increased trade but the cost of this cafta are too high with too little to justify this agreements deficiencies we must have basic worker protections which ensure that our trading partners abide by the most fundamefntal standards of common decency and fairness the cafta we are debating today fails to promote these basic measures of decency and fairness and in fact takes a step backward from current law because it removes the requirement from these countries to abide by the workers rights standards of the international labor standards when it comes to the environment democrats believe that environmental principles must be a central part of the core trade agreement cafta will do absolutely nothing to improve environmental protection in central america and it will open up our own environmental laws to attack by foreign corporations my colleagues this cafta allows multinational corporations to sue governments including our own for compensation if the environmental laws reduce the value of their investment or cut their profits i repeat cafta allows multinational corporations to sue governments including our own for compensation if an environmental law reduces the value of their investment or cuts into their profits cafta places no value on the environmental health of the americas moreover the enforcement provisions of this cafta are virtually nonexistent it merely calls for cafta countries to enforce their own laws enforcement in these areas must be written in to cafta if they are to be effective they are not democrats believe that to keep america in the lead the nation must adopt a bold new and sustained commitment to technological innovation and educational excellence that commitment would ensure that our country remains competitive and vibrant against formidable international competition generating highquality jobs throughout the 21st century we are committed to addressing challenges of increasing competitive global market our economic future rests on our ability to innovate new products and to create new markets for those goods and services we insist that this administration revisit its flawed trade policy and work with democrats so that we can pass free trade agreements including a new improved cafta that will expand markets spur economic growth protect the environment and raise living standards in the united states and abroad that would allow us to move forward with our other priorities american families are facing serious challenges rising health care costs record gas prices climbing college costs and massive job layoffs they are worried about the direction of our country instead of addressing the serious issues that directly affect americas families and coming up with real solutions repgblicans have abused their power and focused on the wrong priorities pursuing an energy bill that does nothing to lower gas prices or a social security privatization plan that weakens the safety net for americas elderly sadly this trade agreement and the way it has been pursued by the administration has become yet another example of those misplaced priorities and missed opportunities again president kennedy said in 1961 that the united states and latin america are firm and ancient friends united by history and experience and by our determination to advance the values of american civilization we must support all economic integration which is a genuine step toward larger markets and greater competitive opportunity it was true then it is an inspiration now i urge my colleagues to send this cafta back to the drawing board the administration can negotiate a new cafta that will open new markets include basic labor standards and protect the environment such an agreement would attract strong bipartisan support this cafta does none of the above it does not protect the environment it does not grow the economy in our country it does not lift the living standard in central america and it does not have my support vote no on this cafta"], [0.0003808736801147461, 0.9996191263198853, 1,

what is happening right now once again this president could not do it by himself needed the partisan vote in this chamber on the republican side to accomplish 1 05 trillion in borrowing from foreign na tions knocking on the door of china saying can you help us because we are fiscally irresponsible that is what the debt ceiling letter comes from we did not write this letter democrats did not set this letter into motion it was the republican policies in this republican house that set this policy into motion raising the debt ceiling not paying as we go this is not the responsibility of the minority on the democratic side it is the majority i want to make sure because we need to break this thing down in 1 2 3 a b c so that no one can go back home and tell their constituents well you know you have got a point there but i did not quite catch that and i did not know that we have borrowed 1 05 trillion more than 42 presidents before this president 42 other administrators before this president 1 05 trillion that other presidents and administrations and congresses have borrowed from foreign nations in 224 years folks say well you all act like you are alarmed by this we are alarmed the american people should be alarmed republicans and democrats it is almost like saying if you had your daughter or son that you gave a credit card to and they went out and they just charged that credit card up as a matter of fact they charged it to the point that it is at the limit let us say they had a 2 500 limit on it what the republican congress is doing now is that they are going even though they are maxed out they are calling the credit card company that happens to be china that happens to be saudi arabia that happens to be other countries of interest as it relates to the defense of this country saying we have maxed out right now we need your help to pay our bills and then at the same time as i continue to go to c here through the abcs they are saying this on one side but on the other side they are saying hey make the tax cuts permanent make them permanent for the most wellfinanced americans for the top tier of the individuals that are making 2 and 3 million a year on this side of the debate they are saying it is okay togive not only royalties but other benefits and tax breaks to the oil industry while they are making record profits they are saying that it is okay but then here in the middle are the american people and the american people are having to suck it up mr ryan the american people who want to educate themselves parents who want to see their children educated if you have a prepaid college program you better revisit that program because it will not assist your child or your son or your daughter in paying for their college because we will just yank the carpet out from under young people and the republican majority did we voted against it the democrats voted against it so if we are going to have a paradigm shift and i am hoping that we put the pressure on the republican majority that we are here to play we mean business we are very serious about having the opportunity to give this country what it deserves and that means representation representation for them and not the special interests i speak all of the time abotlt i do not have a picture of the special interests in my office saying i really dislike the special interests i really dislike individuals that are paid lobbyists i really dislike them no no it is not them it is the individuals that allow the raw needs of those special interests to make it into statutory language it is those individuals that appropriate in those areas where it gets into the appropriations act and into the budget just the way they wrote it without saying you know i know you have a concern i know you have an issue and you have needs but we have to make sure that the american people are represented in this budget we have to make sure that the american people are represented in this bill we have to make sure that the future of this country as it relates to innovation plays a major role in what we do here and that is where we are lacking so you know mr ryan as we go on and many members will return back to their districts and speak to individuals that live there we challenge those americans to challenge your member of congress it is almost too late for us to wait until election day for you to speak the way you want to speak but you have the opportunity i tell you give the republican majority the benefit of the doubt that they are going to take a paradigm shift but i am going to let you know right now the evidence does not speak to a paradigm shift or a change in thinking or their ways so i say mr ryan that yes we do have a couple of friends over here on this side of the aisle that believe what we believe and it will be those individuals those very few that will join in with a democratic leadership if the american people see fit to have it so that will allow us

around the coastline of our country he particularly focuses on natural gas and professes that natural gas is a cleanburning gas and that there would be little to no risk to expanding that drilling well when one is a representative from the state of florida and we have 77 million people who visited our state just last year alone and 56 5 billion in taxable sales is generated by tourism most of which is the result of our beautiful beaches and our pristine coastline one can clearly see why most floridians would have a significant problem with the possibility of there being oil rigs off our beaches within the eyesight of tourists or our residents and mr peterson of pennsylvania has continually represented that natural gas is a potential alternative energy source well just off the florida coastline the minerals management service which is a government agency under the department of the interior has documented that there is only about a 70day supply of natural gas off the coastline of florida in the gulf under current consumption rates in the united states that to me does not appear to take us into the rest of the century in terms of dealing with our energy needs what we should be doing is uniting as members of congress representing this country and dealing with our longterm energy crisis by exploring alternative energy sources not going to the same old energy sources and trying to drill our way out of this problem drilling is not the solution there is far too much environmental risk to drilling whether we are drilling for natural gas or drilling for oil and the proposal that we will be considering that is attached to the budget reconciliation bill the budgetcut document that we will be considering at the earliest next week includes a terrible proposal that would expand drilling off the coastline of florida and bring drilling within 125 miles of floridas coast on the gulf that is a totally inappropriate proposal it makes absolutely no sense it would jeopardize our environment and i am hopeful that my colleagues from florida and other colleagues who represent coastal communities which will also be in jeopardy if this provision passes will join us in opposing this budget reconciliation bill not the least of which because there are many other reasons why it should be opposed because of the dire cuts that are in the budget that are going to rain terror down on americans across this country but to add insult to injury it also has a terrible provision in it that would allow drilling off the coastline around our entire country so with that having been said i want to talk a little bit about what we talked about in the previous hour and turn the conversation back to the budget reconciliation bill there are a number of significant problems with the budget cuts that the republican leadership is proposing but one of the things that i wanted to turn to is what democrats think we should be doing in terms of the budget democrats want to bring the budget back into balance what we proposed in the budget committee today included a proposal that would bring the budget back into balance by 2012 the democratic budget also has a smaller deficit than the republican budget every year and would accumulate less debt and waste fewer resources on interest payments that are needed to service the national debt we would include budget enforcement measures to protect social security we would do more for education the democratic proposal provides 4 5 billion more for appropriated education and training programs than the republican budget for 2006 and 41 billion more over the next 5 years we also reject the 21 billion in cuts that the republican budget requires the education and workforce committee to make over the next 5 years those are cuts that could fall on students loans and school lunches these are not the same old tired complaints it is insulting to suggest that cutting school lunches and financial aid are tired complaints if one is struggling to be able to give their children breakfast and lunch on a daily basis and make sure that they are provided with nutrition and they do not financially have the ability to ensure that they can do it themselves staring down budget cuts that take that opportunity away from them is nothing short of cowardly this is a cowardly budget reconciliation bill it does not show any guts at all and it abandons the american people let us talk about housing in the previous hour we talked a little bit about the housing cuts that this budgetcut bill would hand down and i am

last week hurricane wilma and we were talking in the last hour about housing and the issues related to affordable housing that our constituents were already facing i want to just point out this picture here over the weekend i had an opportunity to go door to door in my district because there are so many senior citizens trapped in their homes without power we still have half a million people who do not have power in south florida and unfortunately whether it is because of hurricane fatigue or just the fact that there was so much damage in the gulf coast region that it may be difficult to feel the pain that we are going through in south florida and understand it but there is not nearly as much attention as we need focused on what happened in south florida when i was going to door to door in my district to try to help some of the folks who have trouble getting out of their houses and i am talking about people who are in their 80s and 90s one of the apartments that the building captain in the condominium brought me into included this kind of damage this is the result of hurricane wilma and this is just one example there are hundreds and hundreds of condominium units and apartment buildings and homes and mobile homes that look just like this there is a perception whether it was created by the media or created by the lack of attention by the national media on what happened with hurricane wilma that everything is fine in south florida everything is not fine in south florida this is the third floor apartment and that is the ceiling of the apartment and as we can see we can look right through the ceiling at the sky this is this womans master bedroom and literally during the storm 1 minute after she walked out of that master bedroom the roof caved in on her bed a minute earlier and it would have caved in on her when we talk about the affordable housing problem that we already had now we have thousands of people in south florida whose homes have been condemned who are faced with nowhere to go because the average price of a house just in broward is 348 000 a year the rental units the monthly rent is sky high and fema has literally only 300

meaningful tax bills we have passed the jobs and growth tax relief act in 2005 and we also passed the economic growth and tax relief act we have to look at where we were in my opinion where we were was we were post 9 11 we had a corporate scandal we were in the beginnings or in the middle of a recession in our economy and we were having difficulty pulling ourselves out for alot of different reasons with the leadership of the president we followed through in congress to pass those two tax relief acts i think i would like to go to the numbers and talk about some of the things that i think are significant in terms of the numbers and how it has influenced americans i always like to personalize everything to my state so i have gome state numbers as well for instance this year who will gain tax relief 111 million taxpayers will see their taxes decline by an average of 1 877 significant numbers five million total individuals and families will see income tax liabilities completely eliminated because we moved the tax the lowest tax bracket down to 10 percent fortyfour million families with children will receive an average tax cut of 2 493 that is because we have moved down significantly the child tax credit fourteen million elderly individuals will receive an average of 2 000 and 25 million small business owners will save an average of 3 641 so those are the numbers in terms of what could possibly be saving average savings through the tax relief but i think we need to look at where we are right now we have an economy that is moving in excess of 3 5 percent in gross national product we have created over the last several years 1 85 million jobs over the last 12 months alone and 5 4 million since augustof 1993 what i think this translates to is more small business owners having more money to create jobs to buy more equipment which creates more jobs i think we also have individuals who have more discretion over their own dollars they can say what they want to buy when they want to buy it because they have fewer federal taxes to pay i think that empowers them to consume more goods which then translates to more business to more jobs so i see it as an engine

and the sudan peoples liberation army the signing of this agreement has ended africas longest running war a brutal civil war that spanned 21 years where 2 million people died i congratulate the parties for reaching this agreement i also want to commend president bush secretary of state powell and his team ambassador danforth and all the outside groups for their unrelenting efforts in the support of peace i also want to commend all the countries that played a critical role in the peace particularly norway and kenya now all parties have to live up to the agreement and begin the task of rebuilding the lives of millions of people this would be a good time for the administration to appoint a strong acting ambassador to immediately go to khartoum to help implement the peace agreement this would not be to reward khartoum but to keep pressure on all parties to make sure the agreement sticks and to speak out on the issue of darfur there is nothing like being on the scene every day all day so much has gone into getting this agreement we must do everything to make sure that it lasts it is also important as we look forward that we do not forget the tragedy still unfolding in sudan as i speak women continue to be raped children die from hunger and disease men continue to be murdered by the governmentsponsored janjaweed and new attacks continue to be launched against defenseless villages many of these people have been huddled in camps for over a year put yourself in their shoes for a minute you are uprooted from your home you live in a refugee camp where conditions are terrible you do not know if your family members are dead or alive you are sick weak watching people die all around you from hunger and disease now picture you have been there for over a year the tsunami in south asia demonstrates how quickly and effectively the world can respond to such terrible disasters once again we are reminded that the world has failed the people of darfur i commend the quick and generous response to the tsunami but we must not only focus on disasters as they occur but also to respond to disasters like in darfur that have gone on for decades the peace agreement between the north and south opens new doors for a comprehensive peace throughout the country and dr john garang who will now be vice president of sudan has an opportunity to play a positive role and should go to darfur to help bring about peace i have strongly supported the united states commitment to the united nations since i became chairman of the subcommittee on commerce justice state judiciary and related agencies of the committee on appropriations all unitedstates assessments to the u n have been paid in full but over the past year we have seen the united nations fight an uphill battle on darfur resolution after resolution has failed to have any impact at least two security council members china and russia have threatened to veto strong resolutions from being passed secretary general kofi annan continues to report that the situation in darfur continues to deteriorate and the government of sudan has violated the previous security council resolutions by failing to disarm and prosecute the janjaweed ngos are leaving the region secretary general annan has sent a commission on inquiry to darfur to investigate if genocide has occurred and he has the report in his hands as i speak most people believe there is genocide but whether or not they use that term it still is horrible what is taking place and no matter what you call it the facts remain innocent civilians are systematically being murdered raped and displaced and the world has failed to stop it it is time for the united nations and the international community to respond in a meaningful way i ask secretary general annan to go to darfur to confirm with his own eyes that the situation has not improved then secretary general annan should make bold recommendations and call on the security council to immediately implement them because a strong meaningful resolution should be put forward and could make a difference it is now time for secretary general annan to use his strong moral leadership he is a nobel peace prize recipient and surely the security council would take his recommendations he should use his power and prestige to plead for the people of darfur and if the security council fails to take meaningful action secretary general annan should resign in protest i am not blaming kofi annan for darfur he does not control the security council but i ask him to use his leadership to demand a new course of action from them i believe these actions could turn the attention of the world back to what is taking place in darfur resigning under protest is an act of great moral leadership and this world would respect his actions great men in history have given up their posts to force change in 1973 at the height of the watergate scandal president nixon ordered attorney general elliott richardson to fire the special prosecutor he refused and resigned in protest and later got the presidential medal of freedom william wilberforce a member of the british parliament he could have been prime minister but spoke out to abolish the slave trade and gave up being prime minister of england anything kofi annan can do to get the world to focus on darfur would be greatly admired if in the year 2005 the security council cannot deal with genocide the raping of women and the systematic burning of villages now occurring then i believe it is fair to ask what purpose is the united nations serving in the 21st century i close by adding that just yesterday the new york times reported that villages continue to burn and that civilians are bearing the brunt of the violence in darfur just last week fresh attacks killed over 100 people and drove thousands more from their homes where is the international community something needs to be done now this past weekend i watched the movie hotel rwanda i urge you all to go see it it is a movie about how the world stood by as almost a million people were slaughtered in rwanda the lead actor don cheadle is nominated for an oscar and the movie is nominated as best original screen play no one who sees that movie can leave not thinking about what is happening in darfur i end by asking the question who will play the leading role in hotel

myself such time as i may consume i rise today to offer the pence amendment to the postal accountability and enhancement act and along with several of my colleagues will endeavor to bring real reform and real enhancement to a bill however well conceived and well intentioned by my colleagues in fact i rise today to begin by thanking the gentleman from virginia chairman tom davis and the gentleman from new york the author of this legislation for their leadership on this measure and their sincerity in attempting to ensure the ongoing vitality of the unitedstates postal service and the tradition that it has enjoyed in this nation an invaluable part of our economy since before our nation was formed but before i get to the substance of the pence amendment i want to begin to address the reasons why the bush administration did today issue a statement of administration policy opposing significant portions of this legislation and in fact suggesting that if this legislation did not achieve the objective of budget regtraint and fiscal reform that the presidents advisers would encourage him to veto this legislation that will come before the house today ia few observations from the report on the presidents commission of the united states postal service are in order the commission found that the number one problem facing the united states postal service is its complete inability to control costs and ratepayers have been paying the freight as a result of that along vith taxpayers who recently financed nearly 7 billion in a postal service bailout just a few short years ago of that uncontrollable cost 80 percent of the united states postal service costs are constituted in labor this in a competitive marketplace where its competitors like ups and fedex spend only 56 percent and 42 percent of their cost on labor clearly the united states postal service is as the presidents commission found desperately in need of flexibility to achieve labor and workforce reforms the usps is currently providing its workers roughly 870 million more in benefits than federal workers receive as a result of lucrative health and life insurance benefits and that is just the beginning h r 22 that we will consider today contains none of the main collective bargaining proposals offered by the presidents commission it contains none of the reforms offered by the commission to establish a bracstyle process to consolidate and shut down facilities that use money and while h r 22 does laudably contain a cap on postal rate increases many are highly skeptical about how that will work the congressional budget office states that the usps will increase rates more frequently than under current law but by smaller increments in addition the cap could be blown if such an increase were reasonable and equitable and necessary for the continuation of services such a cap hardly equips the unitedstates postal service with the tools to control costs and renegotiate its labor costs so we come today a series of us with the kind of reforms that we believe will give the postal service the opportunity and the flexibility to achieve reforms necessary to live within its means that is why i submitted an amendment to enact the commissions recommendation to ensure that health care and pension benefits ought to be a part of normal collective bargaining it was rejected and will not be considered today that is why the gentleman from north carolina had offered an amendment to enact the commissions recommendation to reform the workmens compensation reforms to align more closely with the private sector unfortunately these amendments were made not in order in fact today the pence amendment will deal with a provision of this legislation that believe it or not would set aside a seat on the board of governors specifically for an individual unanimously approved by all labor unions more on that in a moment i say this with deep respect i understand why the democratic minority whip just said on this floor that this was a good bill that should be passed this year i just do notunderstand why a republican majority in congress with the firm and clear opposition of a republican president would do likewise let me get to the substance of the pence amendment if i may the pence amendment essentially removes a provision of h r 22 that requires that the first vacant slot on the board of governors literally be filled by an individual with the unanimous backing of all labor organizations the headlines today would attest that it might be difficult depending on the definition of all labor organizations to get all labor organizations to agree on anything these days currently the board of governors consists of nine members with no more than five from the same party this bill would ensure that one of these seats would be set aside to represent the interests of one special interest group to the exclusion of other interests like mailers or dare i say it taxpayers it is this type of provision that we must confront in this legislation and the pence amendment humbly seeks to strike that and workforce is the issue the unitedstates postal service is the second largest employer in the united states second only to walmart and according to the presidents commission report 3 out of every 4 earned by the postal service went to pay wages and benefits of its employees in fiscal year 2002 the unions have been extraordinarily effective over the last 25 years as has been said over and over again preventing layoffs and recently announcing having inked the second largest pay increase in the unions history i believe that is why the statement of administration policy that was issued today simply read and i quote should the final bill have such an adverse impact on the federal budget the presidents senior advisers would recommend that he veto the bill the pence amendment is all about bringing the kind of reforms in this bill that will allow the unitedstates postal service to maintain its vitality and its fiscal integrity for years to come the pence amendment in its effort to strike section 401 is a modest effort to achieve that goal i reserve the balance of my

gas drilling and production in most of the outer continental shelf ocs more import than what it does however is what it fails to do for instance rather than giving states a buffer zone which allows them to block the construction of natural gas platforms within 20 miles of their shores the provision in this bill opens the ocs to drilling as close as three miles since this provision is being tacked onto an appropriations bill it does not include the critic authorizing language that will provide the department of the interior with guidance on how and where to provide for drilling and production or even grant them the authority to issue leases in addition it lifts only the congressional prohibition on ocs natural gas drilling and leaves intact the executive ban in effect until 2012 making this provision meaningless without more extensive authorizing legislation many of our colleagues have deep concems about the impact that opening our ocs to natural gas drilling and production

listened to the first 5 hours of this debate trying to listen carefully to each speaker and it seems to me that some people try as best they can to isolate iraq from the rest of the war on terror now that may be politically convenient for them to do but it is not what the real world is like as a matter of fact it was not long ago that we found a letter from zawahari osamas number two to zarqawi in iraq talking about tactics just as the cold war had several battles across the globe the war on terrorism has several battlefields across the globe and i believe that it is clear from their own words the terrorists see iraq as the central front in our war against them now and into the future secondly we seem to have a lot of armchair strategists who want to redeploy this way or redeploy that way because they say nothing is going right i would recommend they read the document found this morning or released this morning that was found in zarqawis house it says that things are going pretty well for us and not so well for them i think it is a little early to give up thirdly there are a lot of people who want to debate the procedures or debate congresss job or debate past decisions and it is true history will have to pass judgment on decisions that the military commanders and the president and the congress have made in the past they will do so when the air of partisanship has faded but

line by being part of the government or part of the police force or part of the military do we abandon them when they are trying to build a country i think that would be a mistake in fact i think to retreat at this point whether you call it a strategic retreat a strategic redeployment or whatever word you want to use to back up now will only embolden the terrorists we have seen time after time

confusion around the issue thats important to the people of west virginia and other mining states as we have heard from the other members this is a great opportunity a good chance a good first step and one we must seize this bill has unique support across the mining community and across geographic and political lines the unwa the national mining association the aflcio and the west virginia coal association and others support passage of this and the senate has unanimously passed this legislation as we have heard the legislation would require every underground coal mine in the country to have its own emergency response such as tracking devices and flame resistant postaccident lifelines the bill immediately requires a redundant means of communication with the surface using the best system that is technologically feasible this legislation takes a major step in making sure miners have a reliable supply of oxygen underground the bill makes sure that miners have a 2hour supply of oxygen throughout the mines spaced at distances the average miner can walk in 30 minutes a crucial provision also requires a maintenance and replacement schedule for the emergency breathing devices statements from survivors of recent mine accidents have questioned whether emergency breathing equipment was functioning properly and this bill helps address that to make sure that precious time is not lost in assembling mine rescue teams this bill makes sure that every mine has at least two mine rescue teams that can reach the site within an hour for those who violate safety regulations this legislation increases the maximum civil and criminal penalties and allows msha to issue an injunction in order to close mines that fail to pay fines no one has said that the miner act is the final
