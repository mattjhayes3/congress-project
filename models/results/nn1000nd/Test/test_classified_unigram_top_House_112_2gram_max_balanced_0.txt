the global economy they want us to invest in infrastructure build bridges highways clean energy and cut our dependence on foreign oil because when we make it in america thats when america will make it americans can make it cut yes what we ought to cut are the republican giveaways to the big oil companies to the wall street barons to the hedge fund managers who enjoy massive tax breaks thats where the cuts ought to be they ought to be cut out and what of this legislation thats before us we ought to vote no cut what doesnt create jobs for middle class families like republican giveaways to big oil companies and save what actually works like innovation to jumpstart new industries and education to help middle class people get good jobs i therefore rise in strong opposition to h r 2560 the cut cap and balance act this bill is an extreme version of the republican budget plan that would make permanent the dangerous budgetary and constitutional measures that would destroy medicare and medicaid

of the real drivers our debttax breaks for corporations and the rich and runaway pentagon spending including our misadventures in iraq and afghanistan this legislation is an affront to the very principles of this nation in 1961 president john f kennedy in his inaugural address said if a free society cannot help the many who are poor it cannot save the few who are rich unfortunately it seems that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have no regard for this fundamental american value as the bill they have brought to the floor today attempts to balance the budget on the backs of those with less for the benefit of those with more it attempts to balance the budget on the backs of seniors by taking away their medicare benefits it attempts to balance the budget on the backs of the disabled by taking away their social security benefits it attempts to balance the budget on the backs of lowincome americans by taking away their medicaid and who stands to gain from taking away medicare medicaid and social security benefits special interests and the rich in addition to taking away medicare medicaid and social security benefits h r 2560 would also subvert the federal governments ability to respond to downturns in the economy or special needs including a possible national security crisis during inevitable cyclical downturns it will be necessary to raise the debt limit to stimulate growth by cutting taxes and providing unemployment benefits to help people get back on their feet if theyre laid off among several proven effective measures furthermore in the event of a security threat we have an obligation to act this bill including the proposed balanced budget constitutional amendment would make it nearly impossible to respond to any economic or security crisis at the root of all of this is a system of misguided priorities my republican colleagues have determined that in order to balance the budget we should prioritize cutting medicare medicaid and social security benefits instead of addressing what got us into this current deficita porous lopsided tax code designed to make the rich richer and two unnecessary wars one of which we continue to

become middle class and to get into the ranks of the middle class to enhance their quality of life but far too many americans are continuing to suffer joblessness and have dropped out of the middle

hard impact on communities of color and on women across the country i just have to tell you african americans and women have long found job opportunities in the public sector in public employment african americans in particular often found work with the city or the state because of racial bias and barriers and obstacles in the private sector the american people know that you cant have it both

direct review of all final decisions made by the virgin islands supreme court h r 6116 adopts the third circuit recommendation the bill simply authorizes the unitedstates supreme court to review at its discretion all final judgments rendered by the virgin islands supreme court the suspension version under consideration makes two technical changes to the bill as introduced first it clarifies that the unitedstates supreme court may review final judgments of the virgin islands supreme court pursuant to cert petitions in other words the unitedstates supreme court may exercise its own discretion to accept or reject cases secondly the suspension version expands the unitedstates supreme courts appellate jurisdiction through an additional reference to chapter 81 of title 28 of the unitedstates code chapter 81 sets forth the jurisdiction and venue of the unitedstates supreme court judges lawyers and litigants look to it when they have questions about the courts appellate jurisdiction the creation of an additional reference to chapter 81 makes it easier to find the new law i again express my thanks to mrs christensen for her work on this bill and i urge my colleagues to support h r

highlighting the third anniversary of president obamas failed stimulus package the president promised 3 years ago that the stimulus would create what he characterized as millions of jobs but today unfortunately devastatingly there are nearly 13 million people in america who are still unemployed and many millions more have even given up on looking for jobs three years ago the white house said that because of the stimulus package unemployment would not exceed 8 percent that has not happened in fact the unemployment rate has topped 8 percent for 36 straight months nowthe longest stretch of high unemployment since the great depression the congressional budget office predicts it is going to go even longer we will not see sub8 percent unemployment according to the cbo until 2014 the president sold his stimulus package to the american people by claiming he would make immediate investments in what he characterized as shovelready jobs but last june the president acknowledged that shovelready was not as shovelready as we expected nevertheless a lot of money has been spent as we have been waiting for these jobs to materializejobs that never quite came about in fact some of it was spent in ways that have nothing to do with stimulating the economy for example consider some of the ways in which this stimulus money has been spent mr president 760 000 was spent on interactive dance software 1 2 million was spent on a train museum 2 million was spent to study ant behavior 762 000 was spent to study improvised musici am not sure what that is but i am sure it is lovely not necessarily deserving of scarce federal resources 300 000 to track weather on other planetsgreat if one lives on another planet not so great if one lives on earth in a country that has accumulated an unprecedented debt exceeding 15 trillion 153 000 for an indoor water park and 712 000 to develop a machinegenerated humor systemin other words a joke machine this big joke is on the american taxpayer unfortunately it is no laughing matter in the last 3 years we have added more than 4 trillion to the national debt we have recorded the three largest annual deficits in our nations history and we are on pace for a fourth straight deficit exceeding 1 trillion this week the president submitted a budget that calls for adding 11 trillion in new debt over the next decade his own treasury secretary calls the level of spending unsustainable and it is despite the overwhelming evidence that his stimulus package has failed the president has called for additional increases in spending i know the president is a good man i also know he faced a difficult economy when he took office but the president is unwilling to tell the truth to the american people about what lies ahead about some of the challenges we face i think he needs to do so and he needs to acknowledge the fact that this stimulus package has failed so we can avoid making similar mistakes in the future today we cannot celebrate the anniversary of the presidents stimulus rather we must lament a tremendous lost opportunity by this administration to put this country back on the right track over these last 3 years for the sake of future generations i hope it is not too late to change course i suggest the absence of a quorum"]], "top_unsure": [[0.0001424551010131836, 0.4998575448989868, 1, "i have an amendment at the desk

transportation and infrastructure committee to get this bill done i must also thank the staff if i look a little bedraggled this morning our staff is probably even more bedraggled almost all of the members of the t i committee stayed through a markup that ended at 2 49 this morning and they are here bright and chipper this morning i appreciate all of the staff i want to particularly thank holly woodruff lyons who is our staff director on the faa subcommittee mr jim coon our staff director of the full committee amy steinmann smith who is our policy director bailey edwards and suzanne mullen i also have to give a special thanks to our legal counsel who last night informed me she is resigning today that was at about 2 in the morning but it was with good plans for her her family and her future she has served the committee well well miss her it wasnt as a result of staying up all night and working on this bill but im sure that provided some incentive people dont understand how our staff works on this measure our staff worked over the holidaysand im talking about through christmas last year and the new years holiday they worked on weekends and they worked late into the night not unlike many americans they did this for many americans who want to work and thats what this legislation is about this legislation deals with our entire american aviation industry it sets all of the policy all of the formulas all of the major projects are outlined this is the blueprint for the united states of america and actually for anywhere between 8 and 11 percent of our entire economic activity aviation we take for granted but twothirds of all the people who fly in the world fly in the united states aviation has provided a magic carpet where today these members are here and in a few hours or several flights later theyll be homeacross the continent to the far reaches of the united states and our territories thats the magic it provides us its the engine that drives business and the economy for the united states and this congress failed to provide a reauthorization i have only been the chair of this committee for a year now i had the good fortune of being the chairman of the subcommittee on aviation in 2001 and we wrote the last authorization a 4year bill in 2003 that expired in 2007 when the other side of the aisle had control for 4 years they had control of the house and the senate and for 2 years they had total controlhouse senate white house they could not pass a bill a blueprint for the aviation industry they passed 17 extensions and the former faa administrator said its causing havoc these extensions cost the taxpayer millions of dollars and you cant run an agency thats responsible for so much of our economy with these hiccup extensions now weve done a total of 23 probably more extensions in the history of any other legislation thats come before this congress for authorization of an activity within the government twentythree seventeen i had to do six i got a little testy i got tough but i said enough is enough i was tough and i think i did get people to come to their senses and say that this isnt a republican or a democrat issue this isnt a labor a business issue this is an issue about putting people to work and defining federal policy for one of the most important aspects of our economy so although its tough i intend to be tough last night we stayed till 3 oclock in the morning well stay as long as it takes to get these measures done that are so important to drive the economic engine of america with the transportation legislation last night there were historic reforms and we took 90 amendments i believe from the other side in a very open process and everyone had an opportunity to participate and vote on this faa authorization and in the historic legislation that we passed at 2 49 this morning so no one has been denied the opportunity to participate its amazing when you come together what you can get done and the american people want that theyre tired of the bickering and theyre tired of the fighting yes we may have some heated discussionsyes we may have differences of opinionbut we got the job done so today is an historic day on two counts with two major accomplishments to pass a transportation bill working again with members and i appreciate their work today this historic conference report finally sets a blueprint for aviation industry and an important aspect of our economy this sets the policy for also taking us into the next generation of air travel its called nextgen next generation air traffic control so our planes can fly safer in the skies so we have the ability to save fuel so that we can get from point to point and know where those aircraft are both in the air and on the ground this legislation sets that blueprint so i am very pleased to be here i am pleased for the american people because the congress has done its work they dont want excuses they want results and today is a day of results for one of the longestterm extended authorizations in the history of the united states congress it is important to document for the record a clerical error in the message to the senate

were attacked on 9 11 by al qaeda al qaeda had bases in afghanistan and at that time it made sense to go in and destroy those bases and we did but that took about three weeks we should have withdrawn after three weeks the cia told us more than a year ago that there are fewer than one hundred al qaeda personnel in all of afghanistan so why do we still have 88 000 troops there troops who will continue to risk their lives every day in a war that has already claimed far too many lives and why should we continue pouring billions of dollars into an intractable mess when we should be devoting those funds to our own economy our own jobs our own schools our own bridges and roads and highways our own housing social programs and education afghanistan is in the middle of what is so far a 35 year civil war we do not have either the need or the ability to determine the winner in that war which is what were trying to do if we continue on this course in two years there will be hundreds more dead american soldiers several hundred billion more dollars wasted and two or three more provinces labeled pacified but as soon as we leave now or in 2014 or 2016 or 2024 or whenever those provinces will promptly become unpacified the taliban and the warlords will step up the fighting and the afghan civil war will resume its normal natural course our troops are fighting valiantly but we are there on the wrong mission we should recognize that rebuilding afghanistan in our own image that setting up a stable government that will last is both beyond our ability and beyond our mandate to prevent terrorists from attacking the united states we fulfilled the mission in protecting america from terrorists based in afghanistan over 10 years ago we should have withdrawn our troops 10 years ago we should withdraw them now we shouldnt wait till 2014 we shouldnt have several thousand advisors or troops or whatever advising or helping the afghanis for another 10 years they have their own civil war
