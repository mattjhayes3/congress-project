leader in the global economy they want us to invest in infrastructure build bridges highways clean energy and cut our dependence on foreign oil because when we make it in america thats when america will make it americans can make it cut yes what we ought to cut are the republican giveaways to the big oil companies to the wall street barons to the hedge fund managers who enjoy massive tax breaks thats where the cuts ought to be they ought to be cut out and what of this legislation thats before us we ought to vote no cut what doesnt create jobs for middle class families like republican giveaways to big oil companies and save what actually works like innovation to jumpstart new industries and education to help middle class people get good jobs i therefore rise in strong opposition to

medicare and medicaid and reduce social security benefits for those who need them the most the bill would also handicap the governments ability to respond to economic downturns and create jobs and it fails to address some of the real drivers our debttax breaks for corporations and the rich and runaway pentagon spending including our misadventures in iraq and afghanistan this legislation is an affront to the very principles of this nation in 1961 president john f kennedy in his inaugural address said if a free society cannot help the many who are poor it cannot save the few who are rich

budget on the backs of the disabled by taking away their social security benefits it attempts to balance the budget on the backs of lowincome americans by taking away their medicaid and who stands to gain from taking away medicare medicaid and social security benefits special interests and the rich in addition to taking away medicare medicaid and social security benefits h r 2560 would also subvert the federal governments ability to respond to downturns in the economy or special needs including a possible national security crisis during inevitable cyclical downturns it will be necessary to raise the debt limit to stimulate growth by cutting taxes and providing unemployment benefits to help people get back on their feet if theyre laid off among several proven effective measures furthermore in the event of a security threat we have an obligation to act this bill including the proposed balanced budget constitutional amendment would make it nearly impossible to respond to any economic or security crisis at the root of all of this is a system of misguided priorities my republican colleagues have determined that in order to balance the budget we should prioritize cutting medicare medicaid and social security benefits instead of addressing what got us into this current deficita porous lopsided tax code designed to make the rich richer and two unnecessary wars one of

including over 16 million children are living in poverty in the wealthiest nation in the world the data also shows a wide racial disparity with the poverty rates for whites standing at 9 8 percent while the rates for african americans and hispanics remain unacceptably high at 27 6 percent and 25 3 percent respectively in 2005 i founded the congressional out of poverty caucus because of the

massive financial crisis that they left us on their way out of office with the swift efforts of president obama and congressional democrats we are finally beginning to dig ourselves out of the hole

aboutface on a 15year bipartisan commitment to ensure wic funds cover all eligible women infants and children who apply shockingly at the same time that the republicans are demanding that pregnant women and children starve they continue to promote tax holidays for millionaires and billionaires if we suspended the bush tax breaks to the wealthiest 1 percent of americans for just 1 week we could

understand all that i totally disagree with it but i understand that theyre against the affordable care act they want to defund it they want to do whatever they can to get rid of it but it just seems to me that to pick the one fund that deals with prevention is really the worst thing you could have done today because what were trying to do with the affordable care actand what ive sought to do in everything that weve done in the subcommittee since ive been on itis to really stress prevention because we can avoid people going to hospitals we can avoid people going to nursing homes they can lead a better quality of life and we save money so i just think it is really unfortunate today that after so many years of a bipartisan effort to deal with prevention to fund prevention issues that this is the one fund thats actually picked on today to come to the floor i think its really a horrible thing that that is the case so i would urge my colleagues to vote against this resolution because if you really believe in prevention if you really believe that we can make a difference in making people well and preventing them from getting sick then you should vote against this bill madam chairwoman i

2076 gives the attorney general and the secretary of homeland security the specific statutory authority to respond to requests from state and local law enforcement agencies for assistance in the investigation of violent acts and shootings occurring in public places and in the investigation of mass killings and attempted mass killings its very appropriate of course under the recent circumstances that the leaders on both sides of the aisle have mentioned so this bill unfortunately due to the tragic shooting in newtown the consideration of this bill is appropriately timely of course we should pass the bill today so that the president may sign it into law but it is unfortunate that were not also sending the president even more urgently needed legislation to protect us from gun violence while we must take steps to assist in the investigation of such incidents it is critical that we prevent them from occurring in the first place were simply not doing all we can do to protect our citizens but we celebrate that we have come this far so i urge my colleagues to support the senate amendment to h r 2076"], [0.9696683716028929, 0.030331628397107124, 1, "i thank the

chairman peter king and of course my good friend michael mccaul chairman mccaul for being one of the original cosponsors along with blake farenthold we look forward to working with the folks on the border including a new member from the brownsville area mr filemon vela mr mccaul and i have always worked in a very bipartisan way the jaime zapata bill h r 915 has received bipartisan support in may when it was first passed by the house it was overwhelmingly supported by the house both democrats and republicans it went over to the senate and i want to thank also senator lieberman and senator collins for their support of this bill senator lieberman was just outstanding in making sure that we moved this bill over here as quickly as possible we now have a bill here that does two things the first thing it enhances border security number two is to name this particular bill in honor of a brave individual jaime zapata who has given up his life some months ago both chairman mccaul and i had the opportunity to meet with the family with the mother and father of this strong hero that we got to know in the service of the line of duty as you know ice immigration and customs enforcement in partnership with unitedstates customs and border protection as well as other federal state local and foreign law enforcement has created the best initiative by the way the first best initiative was created in laredo back in 2005 and it has become a model across the country it is a comprehensive approach to identify disrupt and dismantle transnational criminal organizations that have posed significant threats to the border and maritime security through investigations seizures of contraband arrests and prosecutions the best units are building an impressive record of success today there are 34 best units throughout the united states they work not only with their mexican counterparts but also on the northern border with their canadian counterparts and certainly we want to make sure that congress provides support to the best units in order to enhance border security in the communities that we all represent so again members i would ask that you all work and support this bill today a very appropriate time as we had the new presidentelect of mexico who came down here and met with members of congress and i believe at this particular time he is meeting with the president right now president barack obama and we look forward to working with our mexican counterparts we need to make sure that we keep in mind that a secure strong prosperous mexico is in the best interest of the united states mexico is not an enemy it is a friend of the united states and i think both bennie thompson and michael mccaul have been down to the border we understand that the rio grande does not divide us as two countries but unites us together also to the family of jaime zapata losing a son is very very difficult and again we want to thank the family for providing this strong hero we can say jaime zapata was truly a hero of the united states i urge all of my colleagues to support this bill by voting aye on h r 915"], [0.9692965410649776, 0.030703458935022354, 1, "fornia i reserve the

of the house for organizing this special order the house of representatives is a building its a nice place but its really the people and john dingell is the house of representatives as his father was before him pete visclosky is the house of representatives when i got here charlie johnson was the parliamentarian he was the house of representatives and john sullivan has replaced him and he is in fact an institution with the house i dont want to break the mood here but in my opinion the jury is still out on wickham well see how he does but i think things have the opportunity to be okay i just want to tell two quick stories that for me told the measure of the man the first was a number of years ago when we had a member who was going to be expelled from the house of representatives it was only the third time in modern history that that occurred the last one was in the 1970s nobody had really had a chance to study the precedents and things of that nature and i was kind of surprised that that process only took an hour of floor timean hour to basically end somebodys political life so i went to john and he gave me advice and then he told me to file something to postpone it to a date certain which i had never heard of and i bet most members never heard of but that gave members of the house an additional hour to discuss the case and i think at the end of that because of johns stewardship and knowledge of the rules the house as a body felt better at the conclusion of that 2hour debate it happened to be a member of ohio and we are celebrating in ohio that ohio state is in the final four our guy john boehner is the speaker of the house and it also marks the first time in 8 years we havent had a member of our delegation in prison so were pretty pleased about that as well but i will tell you that it was johns counsel that got us through that the second one was more recently a couple of years ago august on our side we call it the day of the stolen vote i think the distinguished minority whip mr hoyer called it a procedural hiccup but regardless if you were here that night it was wild people were screaming yelling and crying and i had the opportunity to watch the videotape about 300 times because we then had a special committee to look into it and always in all of the frames there was one rock like the rock of gibraltar standing there above the fray saying we need to be calm it reminded me a little biti dont know if you saw kevin bacon in animal house where he says stay calm stay calm and the crowd runs him over and hes nothing but a uniform in the end thats what was going on around john the place could have devolved into a very serious problem it looked messy and it was messy but the measure of johns stewardship of the rules of the housei would say that there was pressure on him and the rest of the parliamentarian staff to do what one side or the other wanted him to do or for his opinion to come out one way or the other the republicans we wanted him to say hey they stole the vote it was 215213 the gavel came down you hoodwinked us and from the democratic side the pressure was these things happen stuff happens that no rules were broken no harm no foul john as he has throughout his service both as deputy and now as parliamentarian didnt pick sides he called the game right down the line he told us what he thought based upon the rules the precedents of the house and i will tell you you knew it was a good decision because neither of us liked it the republicans didnt like what he had to say and the democrats didnt like what he had to say that to me is the mark of a fair ruling because he called it as he saw it theres one last thing that i want to say about his service i got here in 1995 and 1995 was the first time the republicans were in the majority for 40 years in the house of representatives i remember going to my first conference meeting and all these guyscharlie johnson was the parliamentarian at the time speakers would get up and say to mr gingrich were not going to keep the democrats parliamentarian are we i didnt know what the heck they were talking about of course mr johnson in fact stayed i imagine there were some discussions about that in the democratic caucus when things changed in 2007 and i imagine i know there were discussions about that when it changed again in the fact of the matter is john is the embodiment of the parliamentarians office hes not the democratic parliamentarian hes not the republican parliamentarian hes the parliamentarian for the house of representatives and thats what makes his service unique and unique to all of our parliamentarians in closing i dont know what john is going to do but if john writes a book and i have to pay 147 to get it on amazon com im really going to be honked off i hope john if you do write your memoirs or some tome with the speaker of the house over in great britain that you let it come out in paperback so that all of us can enjoy it and please make it a good read and not so dry to john and your family i really appreciate your friendship and your service you have gotten me out of a lot of messes and not into too many for your friendship and for your guidance in this house over your career im very grateful and i thank you and i wish you well in whatever you decide to do thank you for your patience and i would yield back the balance of my

weve got a few thousand ice agents border patrol agents doing a wonderful job and they are dedicated public servants but there are so few of them relatively speaking to deal with the millions of illegals crossing our borders many of whom are here in a criminal nature a few thousand federal agents by working with local law enforcement we can multiply that by hundreds of thousands of enforcers of americas laws and we can get rid of the criminal aliens in this country thats what 287 g empowers localities to do now it is entirely up to the local communities if they dont want to participate in the 287 g program and receive funds from the federal government to train their local officials on how to enforce the federal law its their choice they dont have to do it we dont make them do it its purely a local option many communities have however if they want to and if they decide to seek federal assistance it is there for them through this program to help train their local officials we need to better empower states and localities and through this program thats exactly what we do everyone admits we are failing to protect our borders there is a consensus around that we have not protected americas borders yesterday today or probably tomorrow the reason we cant do it is that we are outnumbered and there is just not the federal manpower to stop it if youre going to want to try to stop it particularly keep criminal aliens out i dont understand why you would not want to gain some extra help from the local law enforcement officers properly trained under this program and financed i dont understand that in 1996 this section was added as an amendment to the immigration and nationality act for the express purpose to provide necessary immigration enforcement assistance to state and local law enforcement entities it authorizes the department to enter into agreements with state and local law enforcement equipping them through thorough training to perform important immigration enforcement functions local law enforcement agencies that are closest to the problem are more threatened by the criminality involved and have more motivation to try to stop the criminal activity flowing across the border to date the ice agency has trained more than 1 240 state and local officers nationwide pursuant to this program since 2006 the 287 g program has according to ice resulted in

florida georgia maryland minnesota missouri nevada new jersey new mexico north carolina ohio oklahoma south carolina tennessee texas utah and virginia those states say to keep this program in place

affect anything thats now happening in the federal government the gentleman said that they were trying to undermine the act and that they should enforce it in fact the administration has been very clear while they disagreed with the act they would like it repealed they in fact believe its unconstitutional it is now on the books and nothing is being done in contravention of the defense of marriage act that is there are no things now going on where the federal government recognizes the rights of samesex marriage so i guess my main opposition to this is that the bill is already big enough but it doesnt add anything in substance it adds a few words i would yield if anyone can tell me what the reference is to not enforcing the act now it is true the administration declined to defend the act in court but not defending an act in court in no way means that you are contravening any enforcement going to court is a different story as a matter of fact the house republican leadership has voted to go to court to defend it so i again would be glad if someone would tell me the defense of marriage act says the federal government will grant no rights to samesex married couples that come from marriage its not doing that i agree the administration doesnt like that but the suggestion that they are undermining the law is simply wrong now i understandand this may be the confusionthat the gentleman originally planned to offer a different amendment and that amendment he was told was not in order maybe he changed the amendment and somebody forgot to change the speech because the speech he gave may apply to the earlier amendment but it doesnt apply to this one so it seems to me kind of a waste its late in the evening but the evening is shot anyway it does not say the administration shouldnt go to court that is not contravening the defense of marriage act contravening the defense of marriage act would be extending benefits and i want to reassure the gentleman when i get married in july to jim i will not be looking for any federal benefits he wouldnt be eligible for my pension even if i got onei wont get one but he wouldnt be eligible if i got one i am very familiar with this in fact nothing being done now by the federal government or contemplated by this administration contravenes the defense of marriage act what the administration says is we think its unconstitutional and we are going to oppose it now i know there are some who saythe gentleman from kansas i agree didnt say thatsome have said how dare you to ask the court to throw out a law passed by congress youve heard that rhetoric after all congress passed this how does the court dare to overthrow it well thats an argument i used to hear from my conservative friends a lot more before the health care bill came up so lets be clear there are now two major pieces of legislation passed by this congressnot this particular onethat are being contested and people are asking the unitedstates supreme court to throw them out one is the defense of marriage act one is the health care bill you can be against in principle the courts throwing out an act of congress as unconstitutional you can be for it in principle and differ as to the application but there isnt any way that you can say it is perfectly legitimate to cancel the health care bill through judicial intervention but not to challenge the defense of marriage act so i assume theyre going to want a roll call because they went through all this effort theyd like to be able to talk about it in campaigns it literally means nothing because there is no contravention going on now so ill be glad to vote against it if other people vote for it they can do so again the defense of marriage act says you dont grant benefits to samesex couples as if they were married nobody is doing that that isnt happening it isnt planned it wont happen until and unless the supreme court finds unconstitutionality and refusing to defend an act in court in the english language is not contravention as a matter of fact it says none of the funds made available may be used in contravention well not going to court is not using funds maybe he meant to say none of the funds under this act may be not used in contravention because we certainly arent spending by not spending any money so maybe he meant to say we should spend the money i dont know but i understand his original intention was ruled out of order he had a place in the agenda so he offered an amendment but it doesnt mean very much i yield back the balance of my time"]]}
