legislation the social security and medicare safe deposit box act of 1999 how many of us over the last 30 years and i have only been in the house and had the privilege of serving here for the last 42 years have been asked in town meetings and senior citizens centers union halls vfws and other public forums when is washington going to stop dipping into when is washington going to stop raiding the social security trust fund to spend social security on other things other than social security today we are going to pass legislation that will do that that will stop the raid on social security let us review the history here for over 30 years now washington has been dipping into the s6cial security fund regardless of the rhetoric on the other side where they say it has not it has gone on back when president johnson and the democratcontrolled congress 30 years ago began raiding the social security trust fund they have run up quite a bill according to the social security trustees appointed by president clinton the social security trust fund has been raided by more than 730 billion over the last 30 years i have a check here written on the social security trust fund it is a blank check washington for the last 30 years has used the social security trust fund as a slush fund and as a blank check to pay for other programs this walls off the social security trust fund and puts a stop for those who want to raid it we set aside those funds for social security and for medicare i believe that is an important first step setting aside 100 percent of social security and locking it away before we consider any other reforms or changes to social security let us lock it away first that is an important first step we can use those funds to strengthen medicare and social security this legislation accomplishes this goal i would like to point out of course that not only is the social security and medicare safe deposit box a centerpiece of this years balanced budget but there is a big difference between the clintongore democratic budget and the republican budget the republican budget sets aside 100 percent of social security for social security the 137 billion social security surplus this year will go to social security if we compare that with the clintongore democrat budget that only uses 62 percent of social security for social security and the clintongore democrat budget spends 52 billion of social security money on other things all good programs education defense things like that but the clintongore democrat budget raids the social security trust fund this lockbox will prevent the clintongore raid on social security i would also point out that the social security and medicare safe deposit box sets aside 1 8 trillion the president talks about 62 percent sixtytwo percent is 1 3 billion over the next 10 years clintongore will raid the social security trust fund by 12 billion let us put a stop to it"], [0.0024500489234924316, 0.9975499510765076, 1, "i wish to congratulate the gentleman from south carolina for this motion i rise to endorse it and ask my colleagues to accept it my district showed a definitive difference in the amount of monies paid by senior citizens for prescription drugs it was higher in the 18th congressional district in houston than in canada and in mexico we find that those who are 85 years old 40 percent of them do not even have the ability to pay for any drugs they have no benefit whatsoever and we must realize that seniors are living longer we also find that seniors are paying twice as much for their prescription drugs if they are medicare beneficiaries and they do not have that provision and so they are buying onethird less drugs what does that mean it means sicker seniors that is what it means these are individuals who have worked hard in our communities then we find the cost of our prescription drugs the amount of money our seniors pay is far more than any other health need that they have and this i would say to my colleagues begs for us to have a prescription drug benefit under the medicare provisions i do not know why it is so difficult this is something we should support i cannot go home and tell my seniors in the 18th congressional district that in the united states of america they cannot have a drug benefit but yet in mexico and canada prescription drugs are cheaper i would say it is time now to support this motion to instruct today i rise in support of the spratt motion to instruct the conferees on the budget resolution the spraft motion sets the stage for enacting a medicare prescription drug benefit or other legislation to improve medicare before the reporting date for a tax cut reconciliation bill by setting september 22 as the date for reporting a tax cut bill protected by reconciliation furthermore the spratt motion recedes to the senates slightly smaller tax cut and also recede to the senate by dropping the reserve fund language in the housepassed resolution that provides for an additional 50 billion in tax cuts while the republicans propose large tax cuts over the next 5 years and reconcile the finance and ways and means committees to report legislation republicans do not show the 10year cost of this tax cut which could be as large as the 792 billion that the republicans proposed and the american people rejected in 1999 moreover the republicans do not intend to strengthen or support medicare due to the fact that there are no reconciliation instructions to require legislation that would actually use the 40 billion reserve earmarked in the budget resolution in addition the republicans have cut nondefense appropriations while defense significantly increased for the third consecutive year republicans have chosen to provide large tax breaks for the wealthy this budget resolution provides at least 200 billion in tax breaks over the next 5 years for the financial elite of america furthermore this resolution is a major down payment for george w bushs proposed trilliondollar tax scheme i will not stand by while our childrens future is bankrupted to fund this irresponsible budget resolution this budget contains deep cuts in domestic spending by 114 billion over the next 5 years fails to provide anything to strengthen social security or medicare cuts nondefense discretionary spending by 19 7 billion in 2001 and 138 billion over the next 5 years below the level needed to maintain purchasing power after adjusting for inflation and pretends to reserve 40 billion for a medicare prescription drug benefit contingent upon essentially turning medicare into a voucher program republicans have used slight of hand to hide the facts of their irresponsible budget by showing the effects of proposed tax cuts for only the first 5 years and not the full 10year projections commonly used during the last 4 years i am disappointed in the budget resolution because i do not believe that it provides adequate investment in our nations future americas future depends on that of her young people in providing them adequate resources and opportunities to become our future leaders including providing them education and ac cess to adequate health care the budget resolution provides inadequate resources for the education of our young people i firmly believe that we must focus our attention and our energy on one of the most important challenges facing our country todayrevitalizing our education system strengthening education must be a top priority to raise the standard of living among american families and to prolong this era of american economic expansion education will prepare our nation for the challenges of the 21st century and i will fight to ensure that the necessary programs are adequately funded to ensure our childrens success we must provide our children access to superior education at all ages from kindergarten to graduate school recent studies emphasize the importance of quality education early in a childs future development and yet despite these studies the budget resolution still inadequately funds programs that would provide for programs targeting children in their younger years in addition we need to open the door of educational opportunity to all american children it is well known that increases in income are related to educational attainment the democratic budget alternative rejects the republican freeze on education funding and allocates 4 8 billion more for education for fiscal year 2001 than the republican budget over 5 years the democratic party demonstrates its commitment to education by proposing 21 billion more than the republican budget resolution the congressional black caucus offered an amendnient in the nature of a substitute that promised to invest for the future of our nation the cbc substitute is a budget that maximizes investment and opportunity for the poor africanamericans and other minorities this budget for maximum investment and opportunity supports a moderate plan to pay down the national debt protects social security and makes significant investments in education and training the cbc budget requests 88 8 billion in fiscal year 2001 for education training and development this is 32 billion more than the republican budget provides the cbc substitute proposed a 10 billion increase over the presidents budget for school construction other projected increases include additional funding for head start summer youth employment trio programs historically black colleges and universities and community technology centers in an age of unprecedented wealth the cbc has the vision to invest in the american family and not squander opportunities afforded by a budget surplus i will not support the failed policies of the past senator mccain has best characterized this budget resolution as one that is fiscally irresponsible i support a budget that invest strengthening social security provides an affordable prescription drug benefit for all seniors helps communities improve public education with quality teachers smaller classes greater accountability and modem schools and pay down the national

good friend and the gentleman from massachusetts for the opportunity to address this house i rise in strong support of eliminating the marriage tax penalty i rise in strong support of the house and senate going to conference and sending to the president this week legislation that wipes out what i consider to be the most unfair tax of all we have often asked from the well of the house a pretty simple basic question that is is it right is it fair that under our tax code 25 million married working couples pay higher taxes just because they are married is it right is it fair that 25 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 in higher taxes just because they are married and today the only way to avoid that marriage tax penalty when both the man and the women that are in the workforce is either not get married or get divorced it is wrong that under our tax code one pays higher taxes just because they are married i was so proud of this house just this past week when we passed and sent to the senate legislation which wiped out the american tax penalty for 25 million couples this afternoon the senate by a vote of 61 to 38 an overwhelming vote including democrats joining with republicans voted to eliminate the marriage tax penalty of course the bills are a little bit different we have to work out the differences the bottom line is we want to eliminate the marriage tax penalty let me give an example of a couple from the district that i represent in the south side of chicago in the south suburbs who suffer the marriage tax penalty this is michelle and shad hallihan they are two public school teachers they live just outside joliet illinois shad teaches at joliet high school michelle teaches at manhattan junior high they suffer about 1 000 in marriage tax penalty their combined income is about 62 000 they are homeowners and i would point out that since we introduced the bill to eliminate the marriage tax penalty a year and a half ago shad and michelle have since had a little baby if the democrats have their way this child will probably be out of college before we eliminate the marriage tax penalty because there is always an excuse not to do it today the bottom line is for michelle and shad hallihan and for their new little baby ben 1 400 the average marriage tax penalty is real money in the joliet area 1 400 is 3 months of day care at a local child care center for little ben 1 400 is 3 000 diapers for little ben 1 400 is one years tuition at a community college called joliet junior college in joliet illinois it is a washer and dryer for their home our legislation that passed the house of representatives will help people like michelle and shad hallihan the democrats talk about their alternative it would leave michelle and shad hallihan out they would still be stuck with the marriage tax penalty under our legislation which passed the house of representatives with the vote of every republican and also 48 democrats who broke with their leadership to support the elimination of the marriage tax penalty we helped couples two public school teachers like shad and michelle hallihan as i pointed out earlier shad and michelle are homeowners they also have a baby and of course they give money to church and charity so that means they itemize their taxes under our proposal we double the standard deduction to twice that for single people under our proposal that helps those who do not itemize but if we are going to help people like michelle and shad hallihan we have to help itemizers that means we need to widen the tax bracket so in the 15 percent bracket two joint filers a couple with two incomes have to be able to earn twice as much as what a single person can earn in that tax bracket under our proposal in the 15 percent tax bracket we widen it so that twoearner households can earn twice as much that will help shad and michelle hallihan i would point out that the proposal that the gentleman from massachusetts talked about would not help those who itemize and think about it most middleclass families who itemize their taxes itemize because they own a home or they give money to church and charity we as members of congress can all think of our neighbors back home middleclass working families who pursue the american dream they buy a home and because of their mortgage interest costs and because of their property taxes they itemize their taxes the democrats say if one itemizes their taxes they are rich so they should continue to suffer the marriage tax penalty now michelle and shad make 62 000 a year back in the south suburbs of chicago that is kind of a middleclass working family under the democrat definition of rich they are rich making 62 000 a year our goal is to make the tax code more fair when i am in the south side of chicago at a steel workers hall in the tenth ward or a legion post in joliet or at a local iron workers hall in la salle or a chamber of commerce function or coffee shop people tell me theirs taxes are too high but they also point out that the tax code is unfair that is why we should help people like michelle and shad hallihan let us eliminate

to the second that first topic is trying to eliminate waste fraud and abuse in the federal government and in federal spending i want to start out by alerting members to a brief history lesson on where congressional overspending has gone over the last 30 years in fact going back to 1970 members can see the line below the baseline here is the amount of money that the congress has spent money that it did not have this is deficit quantity spending back in 1970 we began a dangerous habit and trend going down here in 1976 here we were at almost 100 billion in deficits we continued to drop and drop spending more and more without regard to the cash that was on hand for the federal government we can see here in 1982 and 1986 the height of democrat control of congress was when we were on a virtually spending spree here in washington then when deficits got at about their worst down in this area that is about the point in time that the american people changed their mind this is when the republican revolution took place americans were fed up with a congress that year after year after year from 1970 right on up to the 19921993 fiscal years had spent more money than it had on hand in fact borrowing from my children and the children of every other american in order to appease the spending appetite and habits of washington that ended at about this point here we can see the line beginning to go up when a new idea a new party was put in charge with majority status in congress members can see when we took over that the deficit spending began to ease that we began to start moving toward a goal of spending the dollars that we actually had on hand to run the legitimate purposes of the federal government back there in 1994 when republicans took over the congress they promised in a great contract with america that we would balance the budget by the year 2002 well we underpromised and overdelivered because right here in 1998 was the first year in 30 years that the expenditures came above the line here of our baseline spending in other words we began to start saving money this little purple section here represents a cash surplus that we began to accumulate here in washington d c it is this surplus that has allowed us to do a number of things one it has allowed us to stop borrowing the money i would remind my colleagues when we start borrowing money spending more money than the congress actually has to spend we borrow it from somewhere and the fund of preference for many many years has been the social security system in fact this congress and the white house has raided the social security trust fund the social security system to the tune of about 638 billion over a little bit shorter of a time frame this goes back to 1984 once again we can take a look at where we were when we came here and president clinton continued and this was the year of the tax increase and the year that the congress spent quite a lot of money at the presidents insistence again in 1998 this congress got serious about stopping the raid on social security members can see the dramatic decrease this is not the final column of the graph here this is an actual decrease in the propensity of congress to borrow from the social security system this is an effort to stop the raid on social security members can see that that does end right here this year in 1999 the first year we stopped raiding the social security system in order to pay for government that is a trend we want to see continue in fact we want to see this line continue to go down further and build greater surpluses including the social security fund in order to accomplish that we have to exercise some fiscal discipline right now this year in congress that is the debate that is taking place presently between the white house and the congress here is one of the suggestions we came up with as a republican majority to avoid raiding social security as the president has proposed to do we have proposed that of the increase in spending that we have budgeted for this year that we just tighten our belt a little bit for every dollar in federal spending we are asking the federal government to come up the federal bureaucrats and the federal agencies to come up with one cent in savings in efficiency savings in order to help rescue the social security fund and to stop borrowing from the social security system we want to stop that raid we think that out of every dollar that is spent in washington we can find that one cent in savings and continue to run the legitimate programs and the legitimate services that are needed and necessary under our federal system and do it in a way that allows us to save social security at the same time that is what that one penny on the dollar represents when we suggested this idea folks over at the white house almost had a heart attack they said one penny on the dollar we cannot possibly come up with one penny on the dollar in savings because that would cripple the federal government finding this one cent in savings therein lies the difference between the republican majority in washington and the liberal democrat leadership that we find down at the white house we believe that the government can do what every american family does every day work a little harder to find that one cent savings to just simply start realizing that we can be more efficient and more effective with a whole assortment of federal programs to find that one cent again it was a little frustrating but not surprising here in washington to hear the various cabinet secretaries say we cannot find that one penny on the dollar all of the federal departments are so efficient so lean so effective so accountable with their dollars that we cannot possibly find the savings necessary to save social security so we as members of congress decided that we would take it upon ourselves to help that is the point of todays special order i appreciate members going through that brief history with me about how it is we came to the position we are in it is a very relevant and important position to consider because at this very moment the impasse in passing a budget hinges on the difference of opinion between this congress and that white house to find that one penny and do it in a way that honors and respects not only the taxpayers of america but the children of america who rely on a sound and credibly run government and certainly the seniors the current retirees who rely on social security there are a number of great examples one of our colleagues who i have been told was planning on joining us here issued a report out of his committee and that report lists assuming i can put my fingers on it lists just agency by agency the savings that can be found here are some good examples here is the gentleman from california who has arrived in his report he e2319 suggested that we could find savings in the department of agriculture he cited examples in the department of defense the department of defense spent nearly 40 billion on programs for 15 overseas telecommunications systems that cannot be fully used because the department failed to obtain proper certifications and approvals from the host nations that is according to a 1999 inspector general report we found savings in the department of education 3 3 in loan guarantees for defaulted student loans according to one general accounting office audit there is more we will talk about more of that today he found savings in the energy department in the health and human services department administration and so on and so forth it is not hard to find savings to find that one penny if you are devoted to rolling up your sleeves and doing the hard work of finding the money it is an important proposition i suggest for this congress and for the white house rather than fighting over the relative merit of saving one penny out of a dollar to save social security we ought to be joining in partnership and rolling up our sleeves together and getting down in the trenches at the department of education in the department of defense over at the department of energy over in health and human services and working together cooperatively to find all the efficiencies and savings that we possibly can to build a credible government for the future security of our children and for our nation i yield to the gentleman from california who has led the house through this investigation of where these funds may be found and pointed not only me but other colleagues in the direction that we ought to look in order to find some of these savings"], [0.0029020309448242188, 0.9970979690551758, 1, "the issue that we address today will affect every constituent in every congressional district

around the corner and if we do not stop the partisan rhetoric which has clouded this issue for far too long we will once again keep millions of americans from having a voice as chair of the census and civil rights task force for the hispanic caucus and cochair of the census task force for the democratic caucus i am committed to achieving a fair and accurate census the impact of a fair and accurate census will be felt across the nation in every community and in the lives of every american the information gathered in the census is utilized in many ways it is used by states and local governments to plan schools and highways by the federal government to distribute funds for health care and countless other programs it is used by businesses in creating their own economic plans our last census in 1990 was the first time in history that the count was less accurate than the one before in 1990 more than 8 million americans were not counted and more than 4 million were counted twice in texas as already indicated over 500 000 were not counted in my own home city of san antonio as referredto earlier 40 000 were not counted in a report released by the general accounting office this past week it is reported that 22 of the 25 large formula grant programs use census data as part of their allocation formula those 25 formula grant programs distribute approximately 166 billion in federal funds to the states the 22 formula grant programs that utilize census data account for 97 percent of the total that is 161 billion these are federal tax dollars that citizens across the nation have paid federal dollars that should come back to the community in the form of improved infrastructure better neighborhood schools health care for the poor and the elderly local economic development and much more in my state of texas where over 500 000 were not counted it is estimated that we lost close to 1 billion in federal funding over the past 10 years we were second only to california in the harm caused by an inaccurate count this astronomical loss of funding breaks down to 1 992 per missed person it is estimated that if we utilize the same inaccurate enumeration methods for the 2000 census texas will stand to lose 2 18 billion in federal funds we must realize that this is not a political issue this is an economic issue it is an education issue it is an infrastructure issue and most importantly it is about fairness it is about time that we stop the partisan rhetoric and choose people over party politics every person in this nation counts and every american deserves to be counted it is important to point out exactly who was missed in the 1990 census it is really no surprise because the very people who were not counted in the last census are those communities who are typically overlooked of the 8 million americans not counted minorities children and the poor were disproportionately represented nationally 5 percent of hispanics 4 4 percent of african americans 2 3 percent of asian and pacific islanders and over 12 percent of native americans living on reservations were undercounted in texas the net undercount from the 1990 census was 2 8 percent almost twice as high than the national average of 1 6 percent the percentage of hispanics and children missed in texas were all greater than the national average of the 500 000 texans missed over half were of hispanic origin statewide 3 9 percent of african americans 2 6 percent of asian and pacific islanders and 2 8 percent of native americans were undercounted while missing or miscounting people is a problem for the census the fact that particular groups children the poor people of color city dwellers and renters were missed more often than others produced census data that underrepresented these particular groups each of us should be outraged by these types of inaccuracies the census bureau and other experts have told us that the most accurate census can be obtained by utilizing modern and proven scientific statistical methods these are proven methods proven to be the most accurate system to obtain the census now we know that the constitution calls for an enumeration i agree we should try to count as many people as we possibly can i also realize the obstacles that face us if we rely on this head count alone today society is highly mobile most households are twoincome families there are language barriers and there are people who have a distrust of government these are just some of the obstacles facing us if we choose to continue to employ a head count system alone proven scientific statistical methods can overcome these obstacles and will give us the more accurate count over and above the accuracy we know that this system is cheaper than the actual head count the supreme court recently ruled that these scientific methods can only be used for redistricting and distribution of federal funds and that a head count must be done for the purpose of apportionment if we know we can get the most accurate census through these methods and that they will save us money we must utilize them the gentlewoman from new york who just preceded me has introduced legislation that will amend the census act so that scientifically proven statistical methods can be used for every purpose of the census apportionment redistricting and distribution of federal dollars i believe in this bill and

issue that many of us haye raised in this congress over the last several years that is an issue that really is a fundamental issue of fairness an issue of fairness that the american people have been asking some pretty basic questions about over the last several years i represent the south side of chicago the south suburbs in cook and will counties as well as bedroom communities and farm communities in illinois and i found whether i was in the steel workers union hall in hegwish or a neighborhood in chicago or at the local legion post in joliet or the local grain elevator in tonica people often ask a basic question is it right is it fair that under our tax code that the average married working couple pays higher taxes just because they are married they say why do the folks in washington allow a tax code to be in place that tells us that if we choose to get married and work we are going to pay more in taxes they are stunned when they learn that 28 million married working couples pay an average 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married clearly the marriage tax penalty suffered by working married people is fundamentally wrong and something we should change i am so pleased that the leadership of this house the speaker of the house the gentleman from illinois has made reduction and elimination of the marriage tax penalty the first priority this year first out of the box and on a fast track as a taxrelated initiative to help middleclass families the marriage tax penalty has been in place for almost 30 years and no one has gone back to fix it i am pleased this republican congress has made a decision to bring fairness to the tax code by working to eliminate the marriage tax penalty the marriage tax penalty is something that affects real people i have a photo here of a young couple from joliet illinois shad and michelle hallihan two school teachers they teach in the local public schools in joliet shad and michelle suffer a marriage tax penalty of almost a thousand dollars because they are married they recently had a child a baby and as michelle hallihan pointed out to me she said that 1 000 the marriage tax penalty that they suffer that is 3 000 diapers that they can buy for their child that goes to uncle sam instead of taking care of their child it is real money 1 400 in joliet illinois where shad and michelle live is one years tuition at joliet community college and it is 3 months of day care at a local day care center let me explain how it came about our tax code has grown more complicated and since the late 1960s married working couples moms and dads husbands and wives with two incomes have paid higher taxes just because they are married of course we have made this a priority and i would like to announce of course this wednesday the committee on ways and means is going to be marking up committee action will occur on legislation essentially to wipe out the marriage tax penalty for almost 28 million married work couples a real change that is going to help people this is how the marriage tax penalty works take a machinist and a school teacher in the south suburbs of chicago they have identical incomes this machinist is making 31 500 as a single person under our tax code he is going to be taxed at 15 percent rate so he meets a school teacher a gal with an identical income of 31 500 and they choose to get married and at the point they choose to get married they begin filing their taxes jointly when we file our taxes jointly we combine our two incomes in this case this machinist and school teacher who previously were taxed at 15 percent because they chose to get married their combined income pushes their combined income to 63 000 they pay almost 1 400 more in higher taxes because they are pushed under our tax code into the 28 percent tax bracket the higher tax bracket that is wrong but today that is the current situation for working married couples so really the incentives is in the wrong place marriage is one of the most basic institutions in our society and our tax code punishes marriage i would point out that had this machinist and school teacher chose to live together outside of marriage they would not suffer that extra tax only when they choose to get married do they pay that higher tax and i think we all agree that is wrong that we impose higher taxes on married working people i am proud to say that the house republican leadership under the leadership of speaker hastert has made elimination of the marriage tax penalty our first initiative in an effort to bring fairness to the tax code and lower the tax burden on working families this afternoon the gentleman from texas unveiled the legislation that will provide tax relief for 28 million married working couples it is similar almost identical in many ways to the marriage tax elimination act h r 6 legislation that we introduced earlier this year which now has 230 cosponsors and overwhelming majority of republicans and i am pleased that 12 democrats have joined with us in an effort to make this a bipartisan proposal let me briefly share what the proposal that we will be working on in the committee on

working couples for those who do not itemize their taxes they will see immediately 230 dollars in marriage tax relief for those who itemize because they own a home they will see 1 400 marriage tax relief under this legislation i would point out that this makes a big difference under our plan we provide immediate marriage tax relief in 2001 next year helping millions of couples and because we double the standard deduction for those who do not itemize for joint filers to twice that of singles 3 million married working couples will see their tax code simplified because they will no longer need to itemize and fill out extra forms so we make filing for taxes easier and for those who do itemize primarily homeowners they will see marriage tax relief as well twentyeight million married work couples will see up to 1 400 in marriage tax relief as a result of what the committee on ways and means will approve on wednesday and i expect that an overwhelming majority of this house will see it approved before valentines day what a great valentines day gift that we can give 28 million married working couples elimination of the marriage tax penalty i am joined by a number of my colleagues

estimated 131 000 lowincome middle and high school students from receiving the mentoring counseling tutoring outreach support services and encouragement they need to raise their expectations and successfully pursue college cuts out 50 million for new initiatives to educate disadvantaged youth and their families about college opportunities this bill cuts 35 million in requested funding to

meeting the need for 2 2 million additional teachers over the next 10 years the department of education is a vital entity that provides a great many services to our nations education yet the bill cuts

benefits but cutting 69 million out of requested increases for workplace safety enforcement initiatives to promote equal pay to address problems of coal dust in mines and help other countries improve

congress to pass a real school construction legislation without delay before our adjournment for the year we have missed opportunities after opportunities to stop our partisan wrangling and pass a meaningful bill and reach the priorities that we need to reach with this legislation as a congressman from north carolinas second congressional district i represent an area of the country that has undergone some tremendous growth over the last several years in communities throughout my district and across this country our schools are bursting at the seams our local communities are struggling to provide resources to build new schools and to repair old ones and get children out of trailers and just fix up old rundown buildings for nearly 4 years now i have worked with my colleagues in the house on both sides of the political aisle to provide leadership on this important issue and pass a common sense bill that will help our local schools deal with this critical problem we have come together to support h r 4094 the rangeljohnsonetheridge bill that is sponsored by the republican congresswoman from connecticut and my friend from new york this important bill will provide 25 billion in school construction bonds for our local communities to build schools for our children it really provides national leadership on this issue that is critical to the american people a clear majority of the members of this house have supported h r 4094 228 members democrats and republicans alike have signed on as cosponsors the house will pass this bill if we can only get a chance to vote on it the president has stated that he will sign this important legislation the minute it reaches his desk we have an opportunity to provide real leadership and pass this measure to help provide educational opportunities for our children but unfortunately the republican leadership of this house has chosen the path of confrontation and gridlock over the opportunity for consensus and progress rather than working together to produce a common sense solution to the need for school construction the republican leadership brought to the floor today a bill that was a sham of a school construction measure instead of fully funding the costeffective rangeljohnson bill the republican leaderships bill would shift funds to much less effective arbitrage relief and private activity bonds the arbitrage proposal would provide schools with only 24 per 1 000 in bonds compared with 624 per 1 000 in bonds in the rangeljohnson bill in addition because schools would have to delay construction for at least 2 years to receive any benefits areas with the most urgent need would not be able to build the buildings that they need the private activity bonds benefit only those schools available to find a forprofit company willing to pay upfront construction costs neither arbitrage nor private activity bonds target assistance to the schools that so badly need it today the members of this house have an obligation a solemn responsibility in my opinion to work together to craft common sense solutions to the problems facing americas schools but rather we do not work hard to meet the responsibility that is before us the republican leadership has chosen to pass a sham proposal a bill that is truly going to be vetoed they knew it was going to be vetoed when it passed today the republican tax bill contains many provisions that i supported but the sad fact is the republican leadership chose to include many good provisions in a fundamentally flawed bill in addition the leadership today pushed through an appropriations bill that provides 687 million in grants to states to build prisons i supported that provision because we probably need to build some but to me it is the wrong priority to pass prisons before we build schools in conclusion i remain an optimist we still have time to pass a real school construction bill before this congress adjourns and i urge the republican leadership to do so"], [0.0030635595321655273, 0.9969364404678345, 1, "i stand in strong opposition to the passage of the 2001 labor hhs and education appropriations bill because it severely cuts programs that are

education by 3 5 billion this bill would end our commitment to hire 100 000 new teachers and to reduce class sizes i am concerned by the fact that this bill would eliminate head start for some 53 000 children and cut 1 3 billion for urgent repairs to schools across the country these are critical issues for my district and for many districts across the country this bill will also eliminate school counselors serving 100 000 children this action will deprive schools of the professionals they need to identify and help troubled children this bill also does considerable injustice to bilingual and immigrant education the amount included in the bill for programs addressing these issues is 54 million below the budget request the professional development of our bilingual education teachers is critically important the labor hhs and education bill in its current form provides an amount that is 28 5 million below the budget request for the important programs of bilingual education professional development the grants that are provided for the development of our teachers in bilingual education are needed to increase the pool of trained teachers and strengthen the skills of teachers who provide instruction to students who have limited english proficiency these funds support the training and retraining of bilingual teachers the disparities in minority education will be increased if this bill is passed secondly this bill severely shortchanges programs that assist displaced workers this is a major issue for my constituents in el paso as i know that it is for many of you in your home districts in el paso and in other areas along the unitedstates mexico border nafta has created many displaced workers and this bill does an injustice to programs that could help them for example the bill cuts assistance to over 215 000 dislocated workers and it cuts the dislocated worker program by 207 million below the 2000 level these cuts will make it more difficult for these workers to find jobs this bill also cuts adult job training for almost 40 000 adults the cuts in adult training programs equal 93 million or 10 percent below the request and 2000 levels finally this bill provides only 9 6 million for employment assistance to another class of displaced workers our homeless veterans there are over a quarter million homeless veterans in this country and the provisions in this bill will deny employment assistance to thousands of these americans who have faithfully served their country this is unacceptable the root of these problems is that in order to pay

changed the way the federal government operates and have saved billions of taxpayer dollars one of the first things congress did was apply all laws that it passes to itself previously congress would pass burdensome regulations on the private sector but exclude itself from compliance to these laws in 1995 congress passed the paperwork reduction act to identify and reduce burdensome federal paperwork requirements on the private sector especially small businesses continuing toward a goal of creating a 21st century government in 1996 congress passed the federal acquisition reform act to reduce bureaucratic requirements within the federal procurement system we have all heard examples of inflated prices like the 187 screw sets purchased by the government for 75 60 each more often than not such fleecing of taxpayer dollars is due to the cumbersome federal procurement system not fraud the federal acquisition reform act has streamlined the process of doing business with the federal government by significantly reducing such waste in 1997 congress passed the travel and transportation reform act legislation to remedy poor management of the federal governments massive travel expenditures this bill is now law and has led to a concerted effort by federal managers to improve the federal travel efficiency and cost effectiveness the congressional budget office estimates savings of 80 million per year with the passage last year of the presidential and executive office financial accountability act congress created a chief financial officer for the white house this nonpartisan cfo position in the executive office of the president will facilitate prevention and early detection of waste fraud and abuse accordingly the bill promotes efficiency and cost reductions within the white house today congress takes another step toward increasing efficiency and saving taxpayer dollars with consideration of the government waste corrections act in private industry companies routinely audit themselves to determine if they have overpaid vendors and suppliers overpayments are a fact of life for businesses government entities and even our own households overpayments become more likely with larger volumes of payments overpayments occur for a variety of reasons including duplicate payments pricing errors and missed discounts or rebates on average private industry recovers 1 million for each 1 billion that is audited overpayments at the federal level are an especially serious problem when considering the size and complexity of federal operations as well as the widespread financial management weaknesses of the federal government recovery auditing and activity already occurs in limited areas of the federal government recovery audits of the department of defense alone have identified errors averaging 4 percent of federal payments audited or 4 million out of every 1 billion recovery efforts throughout the entire federal government could save billions of dollars more with this in mind the government waste corrections act requires federal agencies to perform audits if their direct purchases for goods and services total 500 million or more per fiscal year agencies that must undertake recovery auditing would also be required to institute a management improvement program to address underlying problems of their payment

rise in opposition to the amendment i have to apologize to our colleagues that we are taking up the time of the house for something that should be settled in houston texas but i rise and feel the need to rise to explain what is going on here i have been involved in mobility around houston for 20 years i have been involved in the regional mobility plan and in developing that plan in the 1980s that we are now finishing i am very proud of the fact that the city of houston as my colleague says the fourth largest city in the country just does not do things like everybody else does we are a major city and a great city in this country because we do not just do it the same way we are the city that built the astrodome we are the city that has a port that is off the shores of texas and the second largest port in the nation we are a city that does not say that they are not a great city unless they have rail and the reason is and i might point out to my colleagues if they had been involved in all the rail systems as i have and the chairman has for over 15 years they would understand why l a is getting out of the rail business because it is a boondoggle and a black hole for a city that is spread out like l a i might say that houston has stepped outside of the box and developed a regional bus plan that is the model for major cities in america this bill has over 20 million in it finishing the last part of 500 million in building one of the best bus systems in the world because we did not grab ahold of the notion that in order to be a great city they have to have a rail system every line that the gentleman from texas talked about every one of those lines loses huge amounts of money and takes money away from mobility systems for those cities but they do get to take a picture of a nice train and put it in their brochures and it makes everybody feel good the problem here in this particular dispute is that the houston metro following the design of many other cities and the gentleman says no elections were held in those other cities it is because the other cities did not pay attention to the voters in those cities and developed the same strategy that is going on here in houston they developed the strategy of starting a little starter line and when it does not make money and becomes a huge hole for transit funds they go to the people and say we made this great investment but it does not work only because we do not have this other line and when that does not work they say well we are just going to build another line and then they wake up and develop what dallas now has dallas now has a rail line but now has surpassed houston in congestion because dallas is more concentrated on rail than they are for the mobility in dallas i do not want to see that happen in houston it is my responsibility as a member of this committee to make sure that the full funding grant by the fta the 500 million is finished what houston metro wanted to do is take money from the regional bus plan from our regional mobility plan and move it to a rail line that makes no sense whatsoever transportationwise my good colleague and friend the gentlewoman from texas says no criticism there is all kinds of criticism including houston metros own study that says this does not help mobility this does not help transportation and this does not help the environment this is an economic development project to build a signature main street in houston texas a very worthwhile project but this is not a transit system this will not carry anybody this will not get anybody off our freeways this will not get bubba i say to the gentleman from texas out of his pickup and put him on a rail system this is an economic development project my position is if they are going to build a huge rail system in the houston region then the people of the houston region ought to vote on it and decide whether they want a rail system or not instead of doing the back doorway that was done in dallas that was done in portland that was done in miami that was done in many other cities that i described there is no transit benefit here major transportation decisions like the proposal to build this system in houston should be decided by the whole community as things stand today houstonians cannot make an informed decision because metro does not have a comprehensive light rail system to take

that no domestic producers or other private sector interests would be adversely affected public input also has been incorporated into this bill the provisions of h r 435 fall into three categories

with the student body government at smith college where she served as student body president continuing here in the house of representatives on the staff of the gentleman from california and continuing to her service at the ins where she spearheaded the implementation of the 1996 immigration bill joyce never stopped contributing never stopped involvement in public life and joyce was an

what was an incredible and unprecedented outpouring from her friends when she became missing i participated in the first of many vigils for joyce held at dupont circle and hundreds showed up to express their concern and their love of joyce and almost immediately posters of joyce appeared all over the city of washington urging people to contact authorities if they had any knowledge of her whereabouts not only her friends but also and especially her family missed and worried about joyce her family endured with courage and religious faith the unendurable 3 months knowing that their

2 percent of seniors in terms of their drug cost constitutes about 25 percent of the total drug expenditures for the senior population so if we give the insurance industry some reinsurance protection so to speak against those extraordinarily highcost seniors then they will be able to write a product produce a product in the marketplace at a premium that will be substantially lower perhaps as much as 25 percent lower than they could if we gave them no protection in a reinsurance way against those extraordinarily highcost seniors so the gentleman is exictly right by basically buying down the

are taxed at a higher shortterm capital gains rate but if one places that same money in a derivative wrapped around a hedge fund they pay tax only at the end of the contract and are taxed at a lower longterm capital gains rate my bill states that if an investor indirectly owns a financial asset like a hedge fund through a derivative he cannot get more longterm capital gain thah if he owned the investment directly in addition there is an interest charge to offset the additional benefit of deferral this tax shelter is not available to average workers or even to average investors it is available only to the very wealthy so that they can avoid paying taxes it is important to shut down these tax shelters as we uncover them otherwise we undermine the faith people have in our voluntary
