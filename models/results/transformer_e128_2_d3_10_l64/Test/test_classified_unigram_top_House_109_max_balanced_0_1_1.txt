tonight and sharing his background and his experience in this area he is one of those loud clear voices on behalf of limited federal government limited federal expenditures and i am proud that he has come out tonight to help us with this let me flush out what he was talking about in terms of increased federal receipts back in january of this year the cbo estimated that fiscal year 2005s tax receipts federal receipts would be about 2 045 trillion cbo is an organization that gets paid to try to estimate these things they generally do a really good job when we finished out the year i was looking at the same treasury report that my colleague made reference to awhile ago and for fiscal year 2005 which ended september 30 2005 receipts were 2 153 trillion over 100 billion more in federal tax receipts than we had estimated just 9 months previously so the numbers we have been talking about tonight the 50 billion in tax cuts the 56 billion and the impact extending the current tax law will have on tax revenues pale against over 108 to 109 billion of increased federal revenues that has come about as a result of the progrowth projob creation tax policy that was put in collectively in 2001 to 2003 in addition to that good news at the end of last week the gdp growth for the third quarter of calendar year 2005 was 4 3 percent that is a good growth rate on any economy a developing economy or whatever it is but let us make sure that we understand this is on the single largest economy in the world it grew 4 3 percent in the third quarter and that is staggering growth under any conclusion fl 2215 the unemployment rate was mentioned earlier as being as low as 5 percent that is full unemployment in reckoning of many economists and is certainly lower than the averages of unemployment of the previous 3 decades the decade of the 1970s which you remember we had a big depression then and as a result of a runup in oil and gas prices we had lower than in the 1980s when those of us in the oil business experienced a significant downturn in 1986 and later and then lower than the boom years of the 1990s when the unemployment rate was as low as anybody thought it would ever be the current unemployment rate is actually lower than that statistics are full of all kind of odd and important indexes that statisticians and economists use to try to make projections as to where the economy is going one of those that you do not hear a lot about is the consumer confidence index and that is supposed to be a measure of how consumers feel about themselves are they going to go spend money do they feel comfortable with their job and those kinds of things it jumped from an 85 2 percent rating in october to a 98 9 percent rating in november a 1month jump of over 13 points in consumer confidence what that tells us is that retailers for the christmas season ought to do very well one of my colleagues today said go try to find a parking spot in the mall these days and for all of the doom and gloom that is out there in the media it is not being reflected in americans going to the malls and working on christmas gifts and charity gifts for other folks that do not have it so the consumer confidence is up another statistic that gets talked about a little bit is that sales of new homes jumped 13 percent in october the largest 1 month percentage gain in 12 years and new singlefamily homes also climbed to an alltime record high of 1 42 million units more people again as we have said several times tonight more people owning a home in america than have ever owned a home now 1 month does not make a trend but continuing to talk about federal tax receipts and revenues the first month of fiscal year 2006 was the month of october of 2005 and during that first month federal tax receipts were about 149 billion and a year ago the equivalent month in october of fiscal 2005 which was october of 2004 federal tax receipts was 137 billion so a 12 billion gain in just 1 month against previous years months now you have got to be careful that may or may not be a trend but it is hard to say it is bad news thai the tax receipts for october of this year are greater than tax receipts for october of last year i think that is good news i would also like to point out a couple of tax provisions that are included in the extension that we will do later on this week that are important and one of those would continue the tax deduction for state and local sales taxes for states that do not have a state income tax states like yours and mine and my former colleague texas does not have a state income tax and so this provision would allow texans to deduct rather than the state income taxes to deduct state and local taxes which are used to fund many of the exact same programs that states who have income taxes use those taxes to provide goods and services to their citizens another deduction that is extended is the abovetheline deduction for higher education expenses now trying not to bore everyone with tax returnese or speak abovetheline deductions means that you get to detect that without having to itemize your deductions so higher education expenses the deduction for that is continued as well as an important expenditure for many teachers who find the school budgets do not provide some of the extras and maybe even sometimes some of the essentials that a teacher needs in providing a good classroom experience for her students teachers get to deduct their outofpocket expenses above the line which means they dont have to itemize deductions to get to deduct those personal expenses that the teacher may pay one that i came across tonight or an example of one i came across tonight is the tax incentive to revitalize the district of columbia included in the code of the past two tax cuts has been a 5 000 tax credit for anyone any new first time home purchaser here in the district of columbia well one of the folks on my staff who as you know staff are legendarily overworked and way underpaid one of the folks on my staff 2 years ago took advantage of this provision and bought his first home and has begun to build equity in that home over the past 2 years and would not have been able to do that were this tax provision not in place when you sell a home you have bought it from somebody who previously owned it hopefully and in all likelihood that person is going to go invest that money in another home so it is important that we have firsttime buyers to work into the market work into the housing market because as we stated earlier for many families the ownership of a home is the single largest asset that they have in their portfolio and this gentleman now has a home that he is paying a mortgage on of course but is building equity in that home building equity in his personal wealth and he is going to be better off as a result of having done that let me talk about something that we probably should have talked about right off the bat and that is the federal government does not grow this economy a lot of times the federal government gets a lot more credit for good economic news than it deserves and in all likelihood sometimes a lot more of the blame for bad economies than it deserves but the truth of the matter is a growing economy that we have right now is not created by a federal government it was created by hundreds of thousands of hard working americans employees who go to work every day and work for their employer to try to provide a good or a service that that employer can sell and make money on selfemployed individuals who have gone out there and taken the business risk of leaving that paycheck leaving the security of a check every 2 weeks to try to make it on their own those are the folks who are building this growing economy who are adding people to their payrolls who are hiring new people or setting up additional businesses to take advantage of opportunities that we are having in this growing economy so we cannot overstate the value of the hard working american in growing this economy but we do have some risks a lot of times of overstating the impact the federal government has in my view the role of the federal government is to get out of the way of these hardworking americans and let them continue to grow this economy pay their fair share of taxes of course but let us not do things that puts the government in the way of creating jobs gets in the way of furthering homeownership gets in the way of growing this economy and providing new opportunities for men and women in this country i participated in back in the early 1990s in a needs assessment for midland texas this was an attempt to survey on a statistically valid basis throughout midland county what were the needs of people within midland what were the needs of your family what were the needs in your neighborhood what were the needs within the overall community and we got all of this information together and began to sort them into like items and pared the list down to 10 so that we had in fact 10 top needs that the people in midland texas told us they were having in their homes their families their neighborhoods and the community and as you look down that list nine of those needs would have been positively impacted by a family that had a job it has been my experience that jobs cure an awful lot of ills within every community when families are working the family itself is better off communities are better off the strains on the social network that is the united way that is all those social charities that we have in place to create that safety net that is so vital in every single one of our communities is less strained when more people have jobs it is also better supported when more people have jobs so it is important that we give credit where credit is due with respect to this growing economy the gentleman from texas mentioned one of his or three actually of his constituents that are good examples of why these pro growth pro job creation tax policies are in effect now and that we ought to continue them in effect i want to talk about calvin fryar calvin is a good friend of mine from brownwood texas he and his partners own a company that distributes gasoline they also have convenience stores they hire people to work and he told me the other day at dinner that because we were talking about extension of these current tax cuts he said that the one that was the most important to him as a small business owner was the section 179 deduction section 179 provides for the immediate writeoff of certain equipment that is purchased by businesses and put into use each year and i think it is about 100 000 calvin told me that when that came into effect i think it was 2003 that it helped him make a decision to invest additional money into the businesses that he was trying to create and not only did he invest the amount of money that qualified him to immediately deduct that amount he also invested a lot of money on top of that and in doing so created jobs and not only did he create jobs for the people who built whatever it is he bought but he also created additional jobs for his company because he was expanding his opportunities within the gasoline distribution area as well as convenience stores so he was adding jobs to his business as a result of that one specific tax code that is expiring and under the tax law that we will pass hopefully pass on thursday will be continued another one of those that is very important and my colleagues earlier in the previous hour mentioned it and that is the tax rate on capital gains and dividends if you were to listen to the colleagues on the other side it is as if the federal government has some innate claim to some portion of your capital gains some portion of your dividends and i would argue that that is not logical where is it stated anywhere that the federal government has a claim on selling property that you have held selling property that you have invested in selling a business that you built from scratch why is it that the federal government has a claim to a certain amount of that and right now under the current tax law the federal government has a claim on 15 percent of that capital gain or 15 percent of those dividends that may or may not be correct it is the law of the land but certainly increasing that number you would have to answer the question is all right why does the federal government have a claim on or does it own in some way the capital gain that i get when i sell stocks and bonds or when i sell a business why is it that the other side believes that a higher tax rate on capital gains is somehow some right of the federal government that is not if we were to let those current tax provisions expire capital gains would get thrown back up to the previously high percentage rates everything is going to get thrown back in with ordinary income the taxable income rates and we will be right back into a circumstance where we are raising taxes the wrong way raising taxes by raising rates as opposed to raising taxes by having an economy that is growing at a staggering rate providing new jobs to workers in this country so i would argue against that as we close out this hour if you look at the reporting we are talking about the economy tonight and if you look at reporting of economic news it is i guess an attempt to be balanced balance is rarely neutral though you will hear somebody talk about well you know this economic statistic is looking up and looking better but if that path continues it will drive us into higher interest rates or if we have got increased job growth or jobs going to be created at too fast a rate then that is going to drive up inflation so it is rare that you ever have good economic news simply presented as good economic news and maybe we will never get to a point where that happens hopefully on the nights that we get to come in here and talk about the economy get to brag on the economy actually we will be able to help set the record straight as i mentioned earlier my good colleague mr hensarling has said often that we are all entitled to our own opinion but we are only entitled to one set of facts not our own set of facts just the set of facts as are out there hopefully we can be responsible for what we say in front of these microphones be held accountable for what we say the other side made a lot tonight about accountability and all those kinds of things i would argue that that same accountability ought to go to things that are said from behind these microphones if i have said something that is incorrect if i have made an insinuation or made some sort of a comment that was intended to mislead that i am called to account for that and i would hope the other side would ascribe to that same kind of philosophy that the folks in the chamber tonight who are listening to this debate or listening to these arguments not really debate since we are not going back and forth but listening to the three of us put out information that we believe is important for the american people to hear and to understandand to understand how we are coming to the conclusions that we are coming too that we be held to a very high standard of what we say and that we are able to back up each and everything that we do say with facts that are verifiable so i want to thank you tonight for being able to lead this hour and i want to thank my colleague from texas mr hensarling for his role in our talk tonight and i want to also thank my freshman colleague from georgia mr price for his helping nie out tonight as well so the message i would leave with the american people is this that we have got a growing economy we have got an economy that is well grounded and is going to sustain this growth but that what we do not need to do is to increase taxes tax rates on that economy but that we continue the pro growth pro job creation tax rates that have been in effect since 2001 and 2003 e 2230"], [0.0022477691527456045, 0.0022477691527456045, 0, "i want to thank the leadership for allowing me to spend some time this evening talking about an issue that is of utmost importance to the american people i am constantly amazed at news reports at home when i go home and i watch television news and i read the newspaper and see what is being portrayed as usual for the american public if you just followed those stories you would not believe that there was anything that was good or positive going on in our nation you would not believe that the economy for example was doing very very well so one of the things that i try to do and i know others try to do as well is to try to assist and bring about some truth in reporting so tonight what we would like to do is spend a little time talking about the economy for the american people know better than what they see on the nightly news and what they read in the newspapers in fact so many of the folks that i talk to at home are really tired of the gloom and doom that gets reported on the news and frankly gets stated over and over and over here in congress by some members they are tired of congressmen and women who put politics and partisanship over good policy and i hear so often back home that folks say why cant you just get something done on behalf of the american people well a lot of good things are getting done and we are going to spend a little time tonight talking about our economy and some things that congress is doing and has done to assist the american people to help american families to help american children to help american communities it is important that we do that because there is good news to tell so what we would like to do is spend a little time tonight and review so many of the positive things that have been done to create really an economy that is on the move i would like to begin by just sharing a number of different charts that demonstrate clearly that the economy is growing this is a chart here that i think really crystallizes so many of the good stories that we have to tell this chart begins in the first quarter of 2001 and along this axis here is the annual change in gdp or gross domestic product that is how well is the economy doing as you see for the first number of quarters of 2001 and 2002 it is kind of going along kind of bumping up and down and then there is a remarkable change that occurs in early 2003 from then on from the second quarter of 2003 on what we see is a gross domestic product growth in every quarter 10 quarters in a row of a growth of greater than 3 percent and oftentimes greater than 4 percent in faqt the most recent quarter grew at a rate of 4 3 percent the individual who wants to know how to continue that kind of growth and who is excited about policies that encourage growth would say well what happened what happened at that point to bring that kind of growth about as most people know what happened was that the tax cuts the tax relief that congress enacted on behalf of the hardworking american taxpayers went into effect and that has resulted in this incredible incredible growth in the economy that continues that continues unabated and what congress has an opportunity to do this week is to continue and extend that tax relief hopefully to be able to continue the lines that we have seen grow in the economy this is another chart that demonstrates the kind of response that the american economy has to that kind of activity this talks about the creation of new jobs in our country in fact since the spring of 2003 there have been 4 46 million new jobs that have come about and this chart shows the percent increase each month from early 2002 through the current time you see again there is that remarkable change that occurs in the early part and midparet of 2003 where the growth in the number of jobs is remarkable again the inquiring individual would want to know well what changed there what made it so that we did not have negative growth in jobs we had positive growth in jobs as everybody well knows now that change was the tax relief the tax relief that congress enacted that took place in early 2003 just to put those numbers all together this chart which is a little busy shows two very clearly distinct lines one is the green line down here that is the number of jobs that increase in our nation each month the red line is the level of unemployment and as you see at the beginning of 2003 the unemployment rate was taken up here somewhere around 6 percent and the number of jobs began to increase at this point when the tax relief package went into effect we see that continued increase and in fact right now the unemployment rate is down at 5 percent which is lower than the average for the decades of the 1970s and the 1980s and the 1990s some economists will tell you that 5 percent unemployment rate is full employment because you have got a number of folks who are between jobs or are working to find other places of employment that is their design so 5 percent is basically full employment the number of new jobs that was created last month 215 000 new jobs so there is good news to tell i have been joined tonight by many of my colleagues and many of them will share some of the same kinds of goodnews stories with you first i would like to yield the time to congresswoman blackburn from tennessee she has been such an incredible leader in this congress in the area of tax relief and in making certain that we enact the kinds of policies here that result in smaller government lower taxes and more opportunity for americans with that let me yield to congresswoman blackburn"], [0.002333682496100664,

off our intercontinental shelf this is an important issue for all of th country but especially true among ms 3 farmers and ranchers in kansas i am one who supports renewable fuels and ethanol and soy diesel pro 1 vide a great opportunity for economi u opportunity in kansas fot kansa farmers and for american agricultur f and for our country we must becom u much more independent from the en s ergy sources abroad but for our farmers and ranchers to remain in business to survive into the future they have got to have access to natural gas and at prices that are affordable natural gas is the primary feed stock the ingredient for the production of many agricultural components but especially for nitrogen fertilizer that is so important and if we are going to produce ethanol in this country if we are going to produce soy diesel we are going to have to have the fertilizer at an affordable price that will allow our farmers to raise the corn and grain sorghum to produce the ethanol to raise the soy beans to produce the soy diesel our farmers are struggling across the country input costs are dramatically on the rise nearly 40 percent of the nitrogen capacity fertilizer capacity has been shut down in this country since 1999 six years ago approximately 15 percent of our fertilizer needs were met in the united states from abroad today 50 percent is imported prices have increased dramatically 250 a ton for nitrogen fertilizer in 2002 today 416 one of my farmers who farms in southwest kansas 30 years ago when he started farming natural gas was 19 cents today it is 9 we are seeing double triple and even fourfold prices that donny young talks about in trying to stay in business with these increasing input costs while the price of corn has stayed the same we in the united states need to become independent if we are going to produce the ethanol and it is important that we remember that natural gas is necessary to make that nitrogen fertilizer i encourage the adoption of this proposal a vote for h r 4761 is a vote for agriculture agricultures ability to produce an affordable food supply will continue to face huge obstacles if our nation does not come to grips with its desire to have limitless resources like natural gas for production and not realize that these resources have to come from somewhere our natural gas crisis has two solutionsincrease supply and reduce demand h r 4761 addresses one aspect of this crisis as it will increase the supply of natural gas from the outer continental shelf this additional supply will do two things it will send a strong signal to natural gas markets and could increase the elasticity in north american natural gas markets it indicates to these futures markets that the united states is committed to lifting the moratoria in the outer continental shelf to provide consumers with an additional supply of natural gas this message should ease the volatility in natural gas prices that all of us have seen since 1999 and the additional supply should help ease the natural gas prices over time why does agriculture care so much about this natural gas crisis simply put agriculture is a very large consumer of natural gas farm3 ers use significant amounts of natural gas for food processing irrigation crop drying heating farm buildings and homes and for the pro duction of crop protection chemicals and nitrogen fertilizers natural gas is the primary feedstock in the production of virtually all commercial nitrogen fertilizers manufactured in the untied states natural gas is not just an energy source it is the raw material for producing the fertilizer today in the case of the nitrogen fertilizer anhydrous ammonia natural gas accounts for over 90 percent of the total cash cost of production just like kansas wheat and wisconsin milk fertilizer is a commodity bought and sold worldwide and subject to basic global supply and demand economic principles as the unitedstates domestic nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing sector declines due to high natural gas prices kansas farmers and other unitedstates food producers will be subject to global supply demand forces on the fertilizer products they buy even more so than today the climb in natural gas prices since 2q00 has forced unitedstates fertilizer production costs to unprecedented levels over this period of high prices and intense volatility the unitedstates fertilizer industry began to shut down production nearly 40 percent of the industrys nitrogen capacity permanently shut down between 1999 and today this has and will continue to make unitedstates farmers dependent on offshore production from the major suppliers such as saudi arabia venezuela and russia this rise in natural gas prices and the permanent closure of so much unitedstates fertilizer production has dramatically impacted fertilizer prices throughout the marketing chain and in particular at the farm level according to usda unitedstates prices to farmers for ammonia climbed from 250 per ton in 2002 to 416 per ton in 2005 that is almost a doubling of the price of ammonia to farmers this continued loss of production from the unitedstates nitrogen fertilizer industry would force farmers to rely on a highly uncertain and highly volatile world market with no assurance that they will be able to obtain enough product to meet their full demand this is particularly important when considering the importance of nitrogen to farmers thirty to 50 percent of corn yields are directly attributed to nitrogen fertilizer passing h r 4761 represents a direct positive action to increase our nations domestic natural gas supply to help relieve the high prices pressuring american farmers fertilizer producers and homeowners allowing exploration and development of the outer continental shelf is an essential commitment that our nation must make these natural resources belong to all americans and should be developed for the benefit of the entire nation a vote

a free ride and now americans they are speaking out recently taxpayers in houston forked out over 125 million in hospital costs in just 1 year by treating more than 53 000 illegals taking advantage of the system in our hospitals taking advantage of americans and really taking advantage of legal immigrants it is morally wrong for illegals to enter this country with the expectation that they will live off of others it is morally wrong for them to expect that americans will pay to take care of them take care of their health costs their education costs and their social services costs but now it is becoming illegal for illegals to get these services that even many americans do not receive taxpayers are finding their own answers while some federal lawmakers in washington remain deaf to their desire because they are too busy dueling over illegal immigration doctrines state leaders are stepping in across the couhtry just this week in colorado lawmakers took a cue from their citizens by cutting through the conflict and passed 11 bipartisan bills taking a tougher stance on illegal entry just like houston illegals have been drawn to colorado like moths to a flame and like many states colorado has left the porch light on for them because they have bad laws that encourage illegal entry such as laws that protect employers that hire illegals providing illegals benefits that many americans do not receive such as unemployment grants and even medical care this may explain why half of colorados immigrants are illegal but those days may be over because now state legislators are aiming to flip the switch and turn out the lights and turn off the benefits that make being illegal so lucrative this week they passed 11 immigration bills including making people prove that they are legal residents of colorado in order to receive state and federal benefits that is a farreaching requirement which will require many of those 1 million people to prove that they are in the state legally to receive benefits without that proof they lose the benefits that americans have to pay for because americans always pay always pay for illegal entry illegals will lose unemployment checks grants to pay energy bills and even some public medical care and even applying for these perks means a monetary punishment to illegals they are also now busting business owners who until recently have left their own porch lights on guiding illegals their way in the name of a bigger bottom line those businesses who exploit illegals make a profit off of cheap labor but americans pick up the tab for all social services now they are going to lose a grip on that filthy lucre that they have gotten businesses that exploit those already living in the shadows of our society beyond the scope of federal work and wage regulations it will cost those illicit businesses money in the form of fines if they do not keep records proving that they hire only legal residents and while many americans do not turn out at the polls it seems some illegals find some way to vote in this country and now it is going to be a felony if they do so and while colorado legislators have been hard at work they are letting the voters make the really tough decisions they are asking them in november on the ballot if they should sue the federal government for not enforcing federal immigration laws voters will also be asked to deny tax benefits to business owners who hire illegals each day my office gets inundated with calls emails and faxes of people demanding their voices be heard demanding we secure the borders

what is happening in the present wedo not even have to go as far back as what happened 4 or 5 years ago or what happened 2 years ago we just have to talk about what is happening right now once again this president could not do it by himself needed the partisan vote in this chamber on the republican side to accomplish 1 05 trillion in borrowing from foreign na tions knocking on the door of china saying can you help us because we are fiscally irresponsible that is what the debt ceiling letter comes from we did not write this letter democrats did not set this letter into motion it was the republican policies in this republican house that set this policy into motion raising the debt ceiling not paying as we go this is not the responsibility of the minority on the democratic side it is the majority i want to make sure because we need to break this thing down in 1 2 3 a b c so that no one can go back home and tell their constituents well you know you have got a point there but i did not quite catch that and i did not know that we have borrowed 1 05 trillion more than 42 presidents before this president 42 other administrators before this president 1 05 trillion that other presidents and administrations and congresses have borrowed from foreign nations in 224 years folks say well you all act like you are alarmed by this we are alarmed the american people should be alarmed republicans and democrats it is almost like saying if you had your daughter or son that you gave a credit card to and they went out and they just charged that credit card up as a matter of fact they charged it to the point that it is at the limit let us say they had a 2 500 limit on it what the republican congress is doing now is that they are going even though they are maxed out they are calling the credit card company that happens to be china that happens to be saudi arabia that happens to be other countries of interest as it relates to the defense of this country saying we have maxed out right now we need your help to pay our bills and then at the same time as i continue to go to c here through the abcs they are saying this on one side but on the other side they are saying hey make the tax cuts permanent make them permanent for the most wellfinanced americans for the top tier of the individuals that are making 2 and 3 million a year on this side of the debate they are saying it is okay togive not only royalties but other benefits and tax breaks to the oil industry while they are making record profits they are saying that it is okay but then here in the middle are the american people and the american people are having to suck it up mr ryan the american people who want to educate themselves parents who want to see their children educated if you have a prepaid college program you better revisit that program because it will not assist your child or your son or your daughter in paying for their college because we will just yank the carpet out from under young people and the republican majority did we voted against it the democrats voted against it so if we are going to have a paradigm shift and i am hoping that we put the pressure on the republican majority that we are here to play we mean business we are very serious about having the opportunity to give this country what it deserves and that means representation representation for them and not the special interests i speak all of the time abotlt i do not have a picture of the special interests in my office saying i really dislike the special interests i really dislike individuals that are paid lobbyists i really dislike them no no it is not them it is the individuals that allow the raw needs of those special interests to make it into statutory language it is those individuals that appropriate in those areas where it gets into the appropriations act and into the budget just the way they wrote it without saying you know i know you have a concern i know you have an issue and you have needs but we have to make sure that the american people are represented in this budget we have to make sure that the american people are represented in this bill we have to make sure that the future of this country as it relates to innovation plays a major role in what we do here and that is where we are lacking so you know mr ryan as we go on and many members will return back to their districts and speak to individuals that live there we challenge those americans to challenge your member of congress it is almost too late for us to wait until election day for you to speak the way

a cleanburning gas and that there would be little to no risk to expanding that drilling well when one is a representative from the state of florida and we have 77 million people who visited our state just last year alone and 56 5 billion in taxable sales is generated by tourism most of which is the result of our beautiful beaches and our pristine coastline one can clearly see why most floridians would have a significant problem with the possibility of there being oil rigs off our beaches within the eyesight of tourists or our residents and mr peterson of pennsylvania has continually represented that natural gas is a potential alternative energy source well just off the florida coastline the minerals management service which is a government agency under the department of the interior has documented that there is only about a 70day supply of natural gas off the coastline of florida in the gulf under current consumption rates in the united states that to me does not appear to take us into the rest of the century in terms of dealing with our energy needs what we should be doing is uniting as members of congress representing this country and dealing with our longterm energy crisis by exploring alternative energy sources not going to the same old energy sources and trying to drill our way out of this problem drilling is not the solution there is far too much environmental risk to drilling whether we are drilling for natural gas or drilling for oil and the proposal that we will be considering that is attached to the budget reconciliation bill the budgetcut document that we will be considering at the earliest next week includes a terrible proposal that would expand drilling off the coastline of florida and bring drilling within 125 miles of floridas coast on the gulf that is a totally inappropriate proposal it makes absolutely no sense it would jeopardize our environment and i am hopeful that my colleagues from florida and other colleagues who represent coastal communities which will also be in jeopardy if this provision passes will join us in opposing this budget reconciliation bill not the least of which because there are many other reasons why it should be opposed because of the dire cuts that are in the budget that are going to rain terror down on americans across this country but to add insult to injury it also has a terrible provision in it that would allow drilling off the coastline around our entire country so with that having been said i want to talk a little bit about what we talked about in the previous hour and turn the conversation back to the budget reconciliation bill there are a number of significant problems with the budget cuts that the republican leadership is proposing but one of the things that i wanted to turn to is what democrats think we should be doing in terms of the budget democrats want to bring the budget back into balance what we proposed in the budget committee today included a proposal that would bring the budget back into balance by 2012 the democratic budget also has a smaller deficit than the republican budget every year and would accumulate less debt and waste fewer resources on interest payments that are needed to service the national debt we would include budget enforcement measures to protect social security we would do more for education the democratic proposal provides 4 5 billion more for appropriated education and training programs than the republican budget for 2006 and 41 billion more over the next 5 years we also reject the 21 billion in cuts that the republican budget requires the education and workforce committee to make over the next 5 years those are cuts that could fall on students loans and school lunches these are not the same old tired complaints it is insulting to suggest that cutting school lunches and financial aid are tired complaints if one is struggling to be able to give their children breakfast and lunch on a daily basis and make sure that they are provided with nutrition and they do not financially have the ability to ensure that they can do it themselves staring down budget cuts that take that opportunity away from them is nothing short of cowardly this is a cowardly budget reconciliation bill it does not show any guts at all and it abandons the american people let us talk about housing in the previous hour we talked a little bit about the housing cuts that this budgetcut bill would hand down and i am joined by my good and close friend whom i had an opportunity to serve with in now three different chambers the

affordable housing that our constituents were already facing i want to just point out this picture here over the weekend i had an opportunity to go door to door in my district because there are so many senior citizens trapped in their homes without power we still have half a million people who do not have power in south florida and unfortunately whether it is because of hurricane fatigue or just the fact that there was so much damage in the gulf coast region that it may be difficult to feel the pain that we are going through in south florida and understand it but there is not nearly as much attention as we need focused on what happened in south florida when i was going to door to door in my district to try to help some of the folks who have trouble getting out of their houses and i am talking about people who are in their 80s and 90s one of the apartments that the building captain in the condominium brought me into included this kind of damage this is the result of hurricane wilma and this is just one example there are hundreds and hundreds of condominium units and apartment buildings and homes and mobile homes that look just like this there is a perception whether it was created by the media or created by the lack of attention by the national media on what happened with hurricane wilma that everything is fine in south florida everything is not fine in south florida

the storm 1 minute after she walked out of that master bedroom the roof caved in on her bed a minute earlier and it would have caved in on her when we talk about the affordable housing problem that we already had now we have thousands of people in south florida whose homes have been condemned who are faced with nowhere to go because the average price of a house just in broward is 348 000 a year the

burgeoning on local police force bashing here he makes statements like they take the money and let the aliens go well in fact by the gentlemans own statistics that he cites local law enforcement does turn over illegal aliens at some percentage of those that they arrest and identify and i assume that they turn over a very large percentage of those that they identify i have not looked closely at that question but in any regard it is clear they are participating in this process with the federal government of identifying and turning over some illegal aliens i would suggest to the gentleman that local law enforcement first of all are not trained to do this mission we have a federal police force we have federal agents that are trained to perform this mission local law enforcement have a little different mission they are in the business of trying to maintain stability in neighborhoods and are particularly trained in identifying criminals in neighborhoods which is a fulltime job while this is not my constituency i cadi imagine in talking to my colleagues who do represent constituencies that have sizeable numbers of newly arrived immigrants that it is a particularly difficult job to operate in those communities effectively if the policemen are seen as reporters on or if you will tattletalers on the people who live in that community i can see where it would dry up information about what is going on and have the opposite effect of what we are trying to achieve with the cops program we are trying to establish relationships with the local community so we can help the local police force maintain stability and keep down crime in those local communities so for that reason i think this is an illadvised amendment we do not give local police forces responsibilities of the federal government unless we train them to do that and they freely take on that mission and unless we give them additional resources to fulfill that mission so first of all local police have to agree to do what the gentleman is suggesting go out and perform the federal mission and secondly if we are going to ask them to take on this federal mandate it seems to me we ought to give it to them not on an unfunded basis but we should give them additional resources to perform that mission if they would voluntarily accept it as i have outlined i am strongly opposed to the tancredo amendment i reserve the

been here we have passed two very meaningful tax bills we have passed the jobs and growth tax relief act in 2005 and we also passed the economic growth and tax relief act we have to look at where we were in my opinion where we were was we were post 9 11 we had a corporate scandal we were in the beginnings or in the middle of a recession in our economy and we were having difficulty pulling ourselves out for alot of different reasons with the leadership of the president we followed through in congress to pass those two tax relief acts i think i would like to go to the numbers and talk about some of the things that i think are significant in terms of the numbers and how it has influenced americans i always like to personalize everything to my state so i have gome state numbers as well for instance this year who will gain tax relief 111 million taxpayers will see their taxes decline by an average of 1 877 significant numbers five million total individuals and families will see income tax liabilities completely eliminated because we moved the tax the lowest tax bracket down to 10 percent fortyfour million families with children will receive an average tax cut of 2 493 that is because we have moved down significantly the child tax credit fourteen million elderly individuals will receive an average of 2 000 and 25 million small business owners will save an average of 3 641 so those are the numbers in terms of what could possibly be saving average savings through the tax relief but i think we need to look at where we are right now we have an economy that is moving in excess of 3 5 percent in gross national product we have created over the last several years 1 85 million jobs over the last 12 months alone and 5 4 million since augustof 1993 what i think this translates to is more small business owners having more money to create jobs to buy more equipment which creates more jobs i think we also have individuals who have more discretion over their own dollars they can say what they want to buy when they want to buy it because they have fewer federal taxes to pay i think that empowers them to consume more goods which then translates to more business to more jobs so i see it as an engine that is moving in the right direction i believe that the tax relief package and the tax cuts that we passed are a large part ofthat"], [0.9883978320285678,

original fair debt collection practices act or fdcpa the bill addresses a conflict between the disclosure requirements of the real estate settlement procedures act or respa and the fair debt collection practices act fdcpa this conflict only applies to a limited number of companies that act as both mortgage servicers and collectors of mortgagerelated debt section 6 of respa requires that any entity that is assigned or acquires servicing rights to a mortgage must notify the borrower of the transfer of mortgage servicing the new entity must identify itself as the new loan servicer and disclose to borrowers thatthey have the right to dispute or obtain additional information about the terms of the debt being transferred section 807 part 11 of fdcpa requires that any person seeking to collect a debt must identify themselves in any initial communication as a debt collector identify the debt to be collected and notify the debtor of their right to validate the debt and other protections provided by fdcpa since mortgage servicers often acquire servicing rights for entire portfolios of loans a number of loans are likely to be in default at the time of transfer subsequent efforts by the acquiring servicer to collect on the defaulted debts have at times been thwarted on technical grounds with claims that the collection effort violated fdcpa this is so because the initial communication received by the debtor was the notice of servicing transfer rather than the required notice of debtor rights the compromise that was negotiated 3 years ago to address this problem and which the house has previously passed under suspension would create a narrow exemption from the requirement to provide a notice of debtor rights under the fdcpa for a mortgage service who acquires responsibility for servicing a mortgage by assignment sale or transfer under this exemption a mortgage servicer could not be held liable for not providing a notice of debtor right for any

incentive for those who would exploit its complexity to avoid compliance thus placing an unfair share on others as nina olson said the national taxpayer advocate stated in december in her annual report to congress the most serious problem facing taxpayers and the irs alike is the complexity of the internal revenue code the only meaningful way to reduce these compliance burdens is to simplify the tax code enormously so said nina olson the national taxpayer advocate all of us of course bear some responsibility for the complexity of our tax code democrats and republicans and every american who believes that the tax preferences that he or she utilizes are worthwhile considered individually the tax preferences that clutter the code certainly can be rationalized and explained collectively however they are a jumble of confusion that have a corrosive effect on our democracy as paul oneill the former secretary of the treasury said one of the unseen consequences of the tax codes complexity is the sense it leaves taxpayers that the system is unfair and that others pay less tax because of special advantages almost every american i think feels that including those who take special advantage a few facts illustrate the scope of the problem in 1913 the tax code was a mere 500 pages in length today the code and regulations total more than 60 000 pages four common forms form 1040 and schedules a b and d take an estimated 28 hours and 30 minutes to prepare think of that they are relatively simple forms when the irs started tracking this information in 1988 the average paperwork burden was 17 hours and 7 minutes about 11 hours less even the simplest form in the irs inventory a 1040 ez perhaps misnamed now requires 3 hours and 43 minutes for the average taxpayer to prepare up from 1 hour and 31 minutes in 1988 complexity costs more than 100 billion that cost is in accounting fees and the value of taxpayers time to complete their returns this is roughly equivalent to what we spend to run the department of education homeland security and state think of it the cost of complexity for our taxpayers 100 billion more than we spend on the department of education homeland

from al qaeda operatives in yemen while the terrorists were living in san diego and that the nsa fearful of being accused of domestic spying did not act do we want a repeat of th~at i do not think any of us do but those who seem to imagine that president bush is a greater threat to civil liberties than osama bin laden is to american lives and liberties need to stop politicizing this issue and work with the rest of us to strike a rational balance between a legitimate concern for civil liberties and the imperative need to equip the agencies responsible for our national security with the technological tools necessary to do their job in an environment where a few hours delay might prove lethal let us refuse to tie our hands again as our hands were tied before september 11 with the gravest results"], [0.0008851289749145508, 0.5008851289749146, 0, "i yield myself such time as i might consume i thank my colleague from massachusetts for his commitment to the programs in this bill and for his partnership in what has been a most interesting journey to bring this bill to a conference this bill is a huge compilation of government operations public service programs and critical national infrastructure like other appropriations bills our allocation and commitment to fiscal responsibility makes funding these programs a challenge our task was to fund wellrun effective programs to the greatest extent that we could and encourage reform in others two of the motions amtrak and hope vi fall into the latter category starting first with amtrak this is a railroad in desperate need of reform this year alone amtrak will carry over 120 million in funds that were provided to them by the congress in fiscal year 2005 but not used the dot inspector general an official respected on both sides of the aisle has informed us that 1 275 billion is sufficient for amtrak to continue operating its existing route structure ithout reductions in frequency and to dedicate sufficient resources to continue the effort to bring amtrakowned infrastructure to a state of good repair also included in this figure is 278 million to meet amtraks debt service obligations on its nearly 4 billion in outstanding loans hope vi is a program that is just that for many people hope that the grant to create new public housing will actually be spent in their neighborhoods currently over 2 8 billion in hope vi grants has not been spent only 37 of the 224 communities have actually seen the finished product for those 37 communities hope vi is a terrific program and i was a supporter of hope vi for that reason because there are some good examples however hope vi is not working for the other 187 here is another program in desperate need of reform and i am hopeful for that in the coming year with whatever level of funding is provided for the program the authorizing committees of jurisdiction will look for ways to make this program more effective section 722 of the senate bill deals with micropurchases i believe the administration has already acted on this issue and we are supportive of the senates provisions in the end we recognize the challenges of reform and have not abandoned our commitment to fund good programs we will do our best under this allocation that we have to meet to fund the priority programs including hope vi and amtrak again i thank the gentleman from massachusetts and all the members of the subcommittee for their hard work this year with that i would merely announce that i would accept the motion to instruct"]]}
