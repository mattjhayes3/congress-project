parenthood is harvesting and selling the body parts of little babies they have so repeatedly proven themselves blind to the dignity of humanity they have always been at the forefront of the greatest human genocide in human history and planned parenthood is the number one advocate of killing more than 3 000 little unborn american babies every day these recent revelations are just one more heartbreaking reminder that the nations largest abortion provider has always had a legendary disregard for the sanctity of innocent human life it beggars incredulity that this congress continues to give hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayer moneyagainst the taxpayers wishes mr speakerto a heartless organization like planned parenthood that goes to such grotesque lengths to promote the killing of innocent unborn babies through abortion on demand at any time throughout the 9 months of pregnancy for any reason or for no reason this body recently passed the paincapable unborn child protection act that would except in rare circumstances protect both mothers and their little paincapable unborn babies entering their sixth month of gestation from the unspeakable cruelty of planned parenthood and evil monsters like kermit gosnell if the paincapable unborn child protection act had already been law it would have saved the lives of thousands of lateterm paincapable babies every year and it would have made it much harder for planned parenthood to harvest and sell the organs and body parts of unborn children since they simply would not have had as many of the more mature organs and body parts of the older babies to choose from there is no question whatsoever that planned parenthood brazenly and repeatedly violated the law in the selling of these little body parts it is an unspeakable disgrace that the obama justice department will likely never launch a criminal investigation to look into these unconscionable acts but if this congress and the american people now also look the other way and ignore this kind of insidious evil we do so at our moral peril if the conscience of this nation is to survive it is now vital for the paincapable unborn child protection act to become law the house has already passed this critically important and timely legislation it is now time for the senate to do the same we must not let the continuous and repeated manifestations of this unspeakable evil of killing lateterm paincapable babies and selling their body parts go unanswered supporters of abortion on demand have tried for decades to deny that unborn babies ever feel paineven those they say at the beginning of the sixth month of pregnancyas if somehow the ability to feel pain magically develops the very second the child is born almost every other civilized nation on this earth protects paincapable babies at this stage and at this age and every credible poll of the american people shows that they are overwhelmingly in favor of protecting these children yet we have given these little babies less legal protection from unnecessary pain and cruelty than the protection we have given farm animals under the federal humane slaughter act it is a tragedy that beggars expression the voices who have long hailed the merciless killing of these little ones as freedom of choice especially the ones who profit from it will be very shrill and loud but when we hear those voices we should all remember the words of president abraham lincoln when he said those who deny freedom to others deserve not for themselves and under a just god can not long retain it for the sake of all of those who founded and built this nation and dreamed of what america could someday be and for the sake of all those who since then have died in darkness so americans can walk in the light of freedom it is so very important that those of us who are privileged to be members of this congress pause from time to time and remind ourselves of why we are really all here do we still hold these truths to be selfevident mr lincoln called upon all of us to remember that magnificent declaration of independence by americas founding fathers and their enlightened belief that nothing stamped with the divine image and likeness was sent into the world to be trodden on and degraded and imbruted by its fellows he reminded those he called posteritythat is us mr speakerthat when in some distant future some man some factions some interest should set up the doctrine that some were not entitled to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that their posterity that is us might look up again to the declaration of independence and take courage to renew the battle which their fathers began thomas jefferson whose words marked the beginning of this nation said the care of human life and its happiness and not its destruction is the chief and only object of good government the phrase in the fifth amendment capsulizes our entire constitution it says no person shall be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law the 14th amendment says no state shall deny any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws protecting the lives of all americans and their constitutional rights especially those who cannot protect themselves is why we are really all here not long ago i heard barack obama speak very noble and poignant words that whether he realizes it or not apply so profoundly to this subject let me quote excerpted portions of his comments he said this is our first task caring for our children it is our first job if we dont get that right we dont get anything right that is how as a society we will be judged president obama asked are we really prepared to say that we are powerless in the face of such carnage that the politics are too hard are we prepared to say that such violence visited on our children year after year after year is somehow the price of freedom the president also said our journey is not complete until all our children are cared for and cherished and always safe from harm that is our generations task he said to make these words these rights these values of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness real for every american never have i so deeply agreed with any words ever spoken by president barack obama as those i have just quoted how i wish mr obama and the rest of us could somehow open our hearts and our ears to his incontrovertible words and ask ourselves in the core of our souls why these words that should apply to all children cannot include the most helpless and vulnerable of all children are there any children more vulnerable than little paincapable babies before they are even born it seems that somehow we are never quite so eloquent as when we decry the crimes of past generations but oh how we often become so staggeringly blind when it comes to facing and rejecting the worst of atrocities in our own time as americans in the land of the free and the home of brave we now live in a day when monsters like kermit gosnell snip the spinal cords of born babies and planned parenthood that for financial gain uses partialbirth abortions to deliberately harvest intact body parts of innocent babies whom they have deprived of the chance to even be born what we are doing to these little children the least of these our little brothers and sisters is real the president knows that and all of us here know that in our hearts medical science regarding the development of unborn babies beginning at the sixth month of pregnancy now demonstrates irrefutably that they do in fact experience pain many of them cry and scream as they are killed but because it is amniotic fluid going over the vocal cords instead of air we cant hear them it is the greatest human rights atrocity in the united states today and for us to now stand by and allow it all to continue unabated while planned parenthood sells the body parts of these little murdered children is to desecrate everything that america was meant to be and for those noble americans who died to make it come to be abraham lincoln gave his contemporaries such wise counsel and it so desperately applies to all of us in this moment he said fellow citizens we cannot escape history we of this congress and this administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves no personal significance or insignificance can spare one or another of us the fiery trial through which we pass will light us down in honor or dishonor to the last generation these are indeed days that will be considered in the annals of history and i believe in the councils of eternity itself this bloody shadow has loomed over america for too long it is time for the senate to pass the paincapable unborn child protection act because in spite of all the political noise protecting little paincapable unborn children and their mothers is not a republican issue it is not a democrat issue it is a test of our basic humanity and who we are as a human family it is time to open our eyes and allow our consciences to catch up with our technology it is time for members of the united states congress to open our eyes and our souls and remember that protecting those who cannot protect themselves is why we are really all here it is time for all americans to open our eyes and our hearts to the humanity of these little unborn children of god and the inhumanity of what planned parenthood is doing to them i yield to the gentleman from california"], [0.0015555182471871376, 0.0015555182471871376, 0, "i am pleased to bring this structured rule forward on behalf of the rules committee this rule provides for consideration of h r 1155 the searching for and cutting regulations that are unnecessarily burdensome act of 2016 or the scrub act this is a bipartisan measure that provides a fair and reasonable way to find and repeal outdated and inefficient regulations that are still on the books it doesnt target any particular type of regulation or industry but it prioritizes older expensive rules that are ripe for improvement or may no longer be necessary the needs of our economy small businesses and american families arent the same today as they were 15 or 20 years ago thus we should ensure that the rules governing the way we live and work reflect what is best for our country today not what agencies thought best decades ago i thank my colleague from missouri for introducing this bipartisan solution and his staff for their hard work on this measure if you put a piece of paper in the hand of every single person who lives in my hometown of gainesville georgia it still wouldnt equal the number of pages in the 2015 federal register in fact it comes in at a recordsetting 82 036 pages that means there were over 82 000 pages of new rules and regulations proposed just last year the code of federal regulations is 235 volumes long containing 175 000 pages of federal regulations knowing this it should come as no surprise that federal regulations impose an estimated burden of 1 86 trillion that is roughly 15 000 per unitedstates household and is higher than combined individual and corporate federal income taxes it is difficult to imagine a scenario where there is nothing in those thousands upon thousands of pages that cant be improved streamlined or retired unfortunately american businesses and families bear the burden of compliance even when a regulation is outdated ineffective or just plain unnecessary the scrub act is a commonsense step toward reducing unnecessary costs for families and businesses leading to more economic growth and job creation if you walked into a grocery store and found hundreds of expired and moldy food on the shelves you would be shocked you would be even more horrified if you were forced to purchase and eat them in the same way my constituents in northeast georgia and men and women all across this nation are appalled that we dont have an existing process in place to clear duplicative unnecessary or ineffective regulations off the pages of the code of federal regulations also this rule provides for consideration of h r 712 the sunshine for regulatory decrees and settlements act of 2015 this legislative package contains the text of h r 712 in title 1 h r 1759 the alert act in title ii and h r 690 providing accountability through transparency act of 2015 in title iii each of these measures were considered and marked up by the judiciary committee and are brought to the floor as reported by the committee americas small businesses and job creators need relief from the flood of new regulations and red tape from washington small business owners often cite government regulations as the single most important problem they face today a heavy contributor to the burden of new regulation is the use of consent decrees and settlement agreements to bind federal agencies to issue new rules regulators often cooperate with proregulatory organizations to advance their mutual agendas in this way the device agencies use is simple an organization that wants new regulations alleges that an agency has violated a duty to declare new rules the agency and the plaintiff work out a deal under the cover of litigation the deal puts the agency under judicially backed deadlines to issue the rules these deadlines often give the public little opportunity to comment on proposed rules and the white house limited ability to review them deals can even require agencies to propose specific regulatory language negotiated by the agency and its regulationfriendly plaintiff those who will be regulated by the new deal typically do not know about these deals until the plaintiffs complaints and the proposed decrees or settlements are filed in court by then it is too late frankly it is just also unfair regulated businesses and individuals are unlikely to be able to intervene in the litigation the court usually approves the deals before regulated parties have an opportunity to affect whether new regulatory costs will be imposed upon them these regulated parties could be families small businesses farmers ranchers or even local governments i introduced h r 712 to restore transparency public participation and judicial review protections to shine a light on one of the worst regulatory abuses in our system today these sue and settle agreements the sunshine for regulatory consent decrees and settlements act of 2015 puts an end to the abuse of this practice and ensures that those to be regulated have a fair opportunity to participate in the resolution of litigation that affects them the bill respects the basic rights of plaintiffs and defendants to manage litigation between them as a result the bill offers an effective and balanced remedy we must ensure more transparency and scrutiny of consent decrees and settlement agreements that require new regulations these commonsense reforms are needed to help control the tide of excessive and costly rules it is time we get rid of the welcome mat outside the door of regulatory agencies for these suits under which they can more easily issue expensive and controversial new regulationspolicies that oftentimes could never pass congressclaiming that the court made me do it again bypassing our constitutional system it is not a good idea h r 712 addresses the weaknesses in the current system while preserving consent decrees as an important mechanism for settling legal disputes it accomplishes this by increasing participation of affected regulated entities and coregulators in the negotiation in the consideration of decrees and settlements the ability of citizens to hold government accountable is an important part of administrative law but it must be appropriately carried out with transparency and full public participation importantly h r 712 puts an end to a practice that uses taxpayer dollars to allow special interests to abuse the system and force regulators to put out even more regulations title ii of h r 712 the alert act continues our work to relieve the regulatory burden on american families by requiring agencies to publicly provide information on planned regulations estimated compliance costs and other updates so that those impacted by the new regulations have the information they need to make financial decisions and plan for the future title iii of h r 712 the providing accountability through transparency act is another good governing measure that demonstrates this bodys commitment to making life better for all americans it requires agencies to publish a brief summary of each proposed regulation online and in plain language agencies do not have the right to conduct their business behind closed doors and hide behind an overly complex regulatory system every regulation impacts every american directly or indirectly and agencies should be held accountable for the regulations they produce and how they communicate the new requirements to those who will be forced to abide by them the rules committee met yesterday evening on these measures and heard testimony from the chairman and ranking member of the judiciary subcommittee on regulatory reform the chairman of oversight and government reform and the government operations subcommittee ranking member this combined rule makes every amendment submitted to the rules committee in order seven amendments to h r 712 will be debated on the house floor and 11 amendments to h r 1155 will be considered for h r 712 the rule provides 1 hour of general debate with 40 minutes equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the committee on the judiciary and 20 minutes equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the committee on oversight and government reform for h r 1155 this rule provides for 1 hour of general debate equally divided among and controlled by the chairs and ranking minority members of the committee on the

done today when i have come before this body it has been to recognize someone who has done something significant in my district or to speak about a bill whether i was for it or against it or a piece of policy or an issue but today i dont have preprepared remarks i just wanted to remind those of us who are here of why we are here why do we attend sessions here in this body day in and day out what is the purpose for our being here before i begin remarks i would like to personally extend my thoughts and prayers on behalf of myself and my family as well as those of the llth congressional district in georgia to those victims of the horrific attack that happened last evening in charleston south carolina i am a member of the committee on homeland security as well as the special task force on foreign fighters and as part of that we spend a lot of time studying terrorism and the terrorist attacks against this nation one thing that i have seen that is consistent about these terrorist attacks is that they are attacking us not because of who we are most of them dont even know our names they may not know our families or what we believe and it may well be the case in charleston as i know it was in garland texas in the attacks there they didnt even know their victims but what i have seen with these attacks of terrorism is they are attacks about what we stand for and that is freedom in garland texas it was an attack on the first amendment our freedom of speech last night it was an attack on the most fundamental right that our founding fathers gave to us and that is our freedom of religion a right that as they said was given to us by god and cannot be taken away i have had the opportunity since being in congress a short amount of timeand it is more than an opportunity it is really a privilegeto take constituents as they come to the capitol here on tours as i walk down the halls of this building and i point out the statue of thomas jefferson that we have right outside the chamber or even as i stand here the image of moses is looking at me as he is looking over the chamber as i see the statues of our founding fathers they have left us reminders of why we are here as we are getting close to the great anniversary festival of the birth of this nation i think it is imperative and important that we as a body are reminded of why we are here i just want to speak briefly about two phrases that you can find in washington d c that remind us not only of why we are here but what it takes to preserve the freedom that we have been given as i walked down the aisle to come to this podium i just glanced up above the rostrum where you are standing and i see four words in god we trust that is one of the phrases that my eyes often go to as i am sitting in this chamber as we are debating bills i reflect back on why do we have that phrase here well it also goes back to another phrase that i have seen recently as i was taking a tour of the mall outside this building where we have the museums of the heritage of this nation there is also a building there the national archives inside that building are the documents of freedom the most hallowed of all of our documents the constitution the bill of rights and then the one that we hold the most sacred the one that is most requested by visitors to this nations capital to see and that is the declaration of independence in that declaration our founding fathers expressed what they believed that this nation would be one day it was their vision it was their faith and it was their philosophy about this new nation they were revolutionary ideas that they brought forth because it was the first time in the history of mankind that a government existed with emphasis on the freedom of individual empowering the individual every other government on the face of the earth before this had focused its attention upon a group a collective whether it was by their race or their religion or aristocracy or their family line but our founding fathers sensed something different if we empower the individual if we recognize the rights that god has given them and we give them the freedom to excel and exceed then our nation as a whole would excel they believed that these rights were important to be protected the right to speak freely the right to have ideas the right to pursue happiness the right to pursue commerce and the right to worship without fear of oppression from the government these were revolutionary ideas they also knew that they had a challenge because of these revolutionary ideas they knew that they would not be well accepted by other governments because it threatened the power base of those governments in fact they knew they would have to take on the most powerful military force in the history of the entire world if they were ever going to see these ideas come to fruition now think about that this ragtag rabble of washingtons soldiers would have to take on the most powerful military force in the history of the world it was an impossible task and they understood that but that phrase that is in marble above the rostrum reflects one of those two key phrases because in the last line of the declaration of independence our founding fathers wrote these words and for the support of this declaration with a firm reliance on the protection of divine providence we mutually pledge to each other our lives our fortunes and our sacred honor you see in god we trust was the first element that they identified that we must have if we were going to preserve this freedom that they were fighting for now outside the national archives where that declaration is still on display are the words eternal vigilance is the price of freedom eternal vigilance is the price of freedom you see that is the second phrase that i think we must be reminded of today the second part of that last line of the declaration of independence says we mutually pledge to each other our lives our fortunes and our sacred honor you see freedom is not free and it is held and it is protected at a price just recently i was given the opportunity to travel to the beaches of normandy as i stood upon the sands of omaha beach i started reflecting upon the price that was paid that day for our freedom and our liberty i brought back a little bit of the sand from the beach as my dad was in world war ii and served in that theater and as i sat at home right around memorial day i was looking at that jar of sand and i started thinking what if these sands could speak what would they say what would they tell us in this august body here what would they tell the people of our nation if that sand could speak you see that sand absorbed the blood of american patriots who had the courage to step off of those higgins boats into the line of fire and i wondered why would they do that knowing that more than likely they would never return back home you see that sand absorbed the blood of these patriots the sand also may be able to tell us of the last words that were spoken by some of those patriots as they drew their last breath after giving their lives their very lives for our freedom would they tell the name of the father or mother as they cried out their last cry of hope would they tell the name of a sweetheart which they will never embrace or a brother or a sister or a child that they will never see as i started thinking about it i started realizing that sand held the dna of these soldiersnot just dna of the soldiers but the dna of our entire nation i believe today that if that sand could tell us anything today in this body it is to remember what they died for i believe if that sand could speak today that sand would tell us these words this is why we died because we hold these truths to be selfevident that all men are created equal and they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights that amongst these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to ensure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed as we are nearing that celebrationwe celebrate 239 years of the birth of this nationi call upon the members of this

stability oversight council reform act and i would like to thank our colleague who authored this legislation the gentleman from minnesota he is certainly one of the hardest working and most thoughtful freshmen that we have on the house financial services committee as the american people know all too well over yearsnot years decades in factcongress has ceded far too much power to unaccountable bureaucrats article i ceding power to article ii at the same time it has provided many unelected unaccountable bureaucrats with access to money with no accountability for how that money is spent the financial stability oversight council or fsoc as it is known by its acronym typifies this misguided yielding of power to the unaccountable and unelected last month there was however a small victory for those who are alarmed by this everencroaching federal government and the shadow financial regulatory system that fsoc is a part of and that operates with little transparency or accountability to the american people i speak of the recent judicial ruling that struck down fsocs designation of metlife as a toobigtofail financial institution fsocs decision was found to be unreasonable and the result of a fatally flawed process well the american people can achieve yet another victory today another step in restoring the rule of law in checks and balances by reining in an administrative state run amok by passing the important bill that is in front of us now fsoc is clearly one of the most powerful federal entities to ever exist and unfortunately also one of the least transparent and least accountable first the councils power is concentrated in the hands of one political party the one that happens to control the white house all but one of fsocs members is the presidentially appointed head of a federal agency but interestingly enough the agencies themselves are not members thus denying bipartisan representation the structure clearly injects partisan politics into the regulatory process it erodes agency independence and it undermines accountability furthermore fsocs budget is not subject to congressional approval removing yet another vital check and balance of its immense power over our economy and over our people fsoc has earned bipartisan condemnation for its lack of transparency twothirds of its proceedings are conducted in private minutes of those meetings are devoid of any useful substantive information on what was discussed even dennis kelleher the ceo of the leftleaning better markets has said fsocs proceedings make the politburo look open by comparison at the few open meetings they have they snap their fingers and its over and it is all scripted they treat their information as if it were state secrets fsoc typifies not only the shadow regulatory system but also the unfair washington system that americans have come to fear and loathe powerful government administrators secretive government meetings arbitrary rules and unchecked power to punish and reward thus oversight and reform are paramount and that is why the gentleman from minnesota drafted h r the legislation before us would bring muchneeded accountability and transparency to two very powerful agencies birthed by the doddfrank act the financial stability oversight council and the office of financial research currently these two agencies are funded by assessments on financial institutions money that ultimately comes out of the pockets of their customers these funds flow directly from financial institutions into the office of financial research coffers and are available immediately to be spent by both the office of financial research and the financial stability oversight council h r 3340 is a very simple commonsense bill instead of allowing unaccountable bureaucrats to set their own budgets the bill places these two agencies on the budget review viewed by the united states congress the elected representatives of we the people it says the council and the office should be funded through the normal transparent congressional appropriations process to ensure accountability and transparency is it too much to ask that these two powerful government agencies actually be subject to congressional oversight and budget approval this should be the rule for a growing number of federal bureaucracies that are tossed into the alphabet soup of washington regulators

going to be on the other foot sooner or later the white house will be in different hands sooner or later congress will be in different hands so this should not be a partisan issue this is about article i of the constitution all members on both sides of the aisle should care passionately about this issue to hold agencies accountable for their spending because we are not just writing legislation for one congress or one administration the bare minimum level of accountability to the elected representatives of we the people is to have congress control the power of the purse it is

for all to come after america was meant to be a permanent fortress of liberty and freedom for all who live within its walls at its essence the concept of religious freedom is about much more than religion it is much more than just showing up to worship service 1 day or 1 night a week it is about our fundamental human right to hold our own beliefs and to live out our lives according to these

are literally wiped off the map the group is responsible for 5 000 deaths last year in 2014 and displacing over 1 million people last year making this organization by the way one of the worlds most deadly but this weekend forces fighting boko haram reported discovering another hundred bodies in a shallow mass grave we dont really know how many they have killed out there in total but we know that the killing continues after watching boko harams violence i wasnt surprised to see that that group pledges allegiance to isis isis publicly accepted the overture claiming this new relationship expands
