individuals i have heard my republican colleagues mention cost throughout this day well make no mistake there would also be a cost in leaving tens of millions of americans uninsured according to a recent study published by the american journal of public health uninsured working age americans have a 40 percent higher risk of death than their privately insured counterparts the study estimates that lack of health insurance causes over 44 000 excess deaths annually that works out to about one death every 12 minutes from lack of health insurance my colleagues let us not forget to count those lives as a very real and continuing cost over 44 000 deaths a year one every 12 minutes i urge my colleagues to support the democratic plan lifesaving legislation and vote against the republican repeal of health care it is wrong for america i urge a no vote i rise in strong opposition to this harmful illconceived bill when the republican majority said it was going to make the deficit their defining issue this congress most of us did not realize it was to make the deficit bigger but according to the congressional budget office their first act to repeal health care would do just thatadd 230 billion to the deficit while making americans pay more for health care instead of focusing on job creation republicans are running up our deficit jeopardizing the health of millions of americans and threatening the creation of new jobs under the republican repeal effort insurance companies will once again be able to drop people when they get sickexactly when coverage is needed most children with preexisting conditions will be denied coverage while insurance companies would again impose devastating annual and lifetime caps young people will not be able to stay on their parents plans until age 26 pregnant women and breast cancer survivors can be denied coverage seniors will face an increase in their prescription drug costsmillions thrown back into the medicare part d donut hole repeal would deny seniors a 50 percent discount on prescription drugs recreating the devastating coverage gap each of these things will disappear if republicans are able to repeal the historic health reform law in my home state of new york repealing the affordable care act would be devastating new york residents providers small businesses and other employers would be denied critical new benefits of the law from protections against insurance industry abuses to new coverage options and millions of dollars in support so states like new york can deliver quality affordable health care options to all of its residents without the affordable care act new york will suffer 77 800 young adults would lose their insurance coverage through their parents health plans sometimes just after they finish school and as they are looking for a job families across new york would lose the peace of mind the affordable care act provides by making sure that young adults can stay on their parents plan to age 26 if they do not have coverage of their own more than 10 million residents of new york with private insurance coverage would suddenly find themselves vulnerable again to having lifetime limits placed on how much insurance companies will spend on their health care insurance companies would once again be allowed to cut off someones coverage unexpectedly when they are in an accident or become sick because of a simple mistake on an application this would leave 734 000 people in new york at risk of losing their insurance at the moment they need it most as one of the worst abuses of the insurance industry would become legal again new insurance plans would no longer be required to cover recommended preventive services like mammograms and flu shots without cost sharing nor would they have to guarantee enrollees the right to choose any available primary care provider in the network or see an obgyn without a referral nearly 2 9 million seniors in new york who have medicare coverage would be forced to pay a copay to receive important preventive services like mammograms and colonoscopies medicare would no longer pay for an annual checkup visit so nearly 2 9 million seniors in new york who have medicare coverage would have to pay extra if they want to stay healthy by getting checkups regularly 192 596 on medicare would see significantly higher prescription drug costs in new york 192 596 medicare beneficiaries received a onetime taxfree 250 rebate to help pay for prescription drugs in the donut hole coverage gap in 2010 medicare beneficiaries who fall into the donut hole in 2011 will be eligible for 50 percent discounts on covered brand name prescription drugs without the law the burden of high prescription drug costs would hurt millions of medicare beneficiaries across the country for the sake of argument if we remove the moral obligation of providing health care to 32 million americans who would lose coverage with this repeal we are still left with a compelling fiscal reason for opposing the repeal of this law repeal adds 230 billion to the deficit over the first 10 years and more than 1 2 trillion in the second decade around onehalf percent of gdp americans purchasing health insurance on their own will see their costs rise americans will get fewer health benefits for their money i urge my colleagues to oppose this bill that will balloon the deficit

for older americans providing quality and affordable health care for all seniors but this week house republicans are proposing to strip seniors of this guaranteed benefit the republican budget proposal dismantles medicare as we know it telling seniors they are going to be on their own to find insurance no matter what the cost or how sick they are and it slashes medicaid coverage for seniors who need longterm care threatening our sickest most frail elderly in nursing homes with no care at all this is absolutely the wrong approach to solving our nations budget problems every day 48 million elderly and disabled americans across this country count on medicare for their lifesaving medications doctor visits and hospital care sixtynine percent of people over the age of 65 and they are both democrats and republicans oppose medicare becoming a voucher program seniors know that changing medicare to a voucher program means that they will no longer have access to a guaranteed set of health benefits that the value of a limited voucher wont keep up with rising health care costs that the voucher would become insufficient over time and the care they need could become unaffordable that too many taxpayer dollars will be spent on advertising campaigns and administrative costs instead of actual medical expenses and seniors know that privatizing medicare means limits on benefits obstacles to care uncertain reimbursements copayments for primary care or specialty care exclusions for certain services discrimination based on income illness or age and more uncertainty if a serious illness or need for longterm care occurs seniors know that privatizing or voucherizing medicare will mean that they pay more in premiums or do without and it doesnt end there in addition to medicare cuts republicans also want to take away medicaid for the nearly 6 million seniors who depend on it for nursing home or longterm care they say proudly that they will cut funding to states by 1 trillion this means that disabled and frail elderly americans will be placed on waiting lists for services or have no access to care at all in pennsylvania my home state nearly 40 percent of funds spent on longterm care would be at risk this includes 62 percent of nursing home residents and 25 000 pennsylvanian seniors who receive home health services and yet when republicans had the opportunity to reduce costs while maintaining and strengthening care for our seniors they demonized the plan voting time and again to stop important improvements in medicare and they still want to repeal the law that eliminates copayments for preventive care services that makes prescription drug benefits more affordable and improves coordination of care and health outcomes reduces errors and reduces costs for seniors they want to repeal the law that curbs the growth in medicare spending saves taxpayers almost 500 billion by ending overpayments to insurance companies and extends the life of the medicare trust fund for 12 years instead the republicans here in washington want to end medicare as we know it and put health care for american seniors at great risk as a senior member of the budget committee i know how important it is to find solutions to reducing the deficit to do this right the solution must include spending cuts tax policy reform and economic growth we should not fix our budget problems by failing to meet our obligations to our seniors every day we hear how determined republicans are to slash billions of dollars from the central programs because we simply cant afford it they say we cant afford to make investments in the future we cant afford to educate our children or fix our roads or fuel innovation or cover health care costs for seniors yet in the same proposal to slash medicare and medicaid for millions of seniors republicans make permanent tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of americans in the very same budget proposal where republicans take away guaranteed benefits for seniors they protect billions of tax subsidies to the oil and gas industry in the very same budget proposal where republicans give seniors a limited voucher to pay for higher insurance premiums they protect the pentagon from spending cuts on unnecessary weapon systems one trillion dollars in tax expenditures 700 billion in tax cuts for the wealthy few 40 billion in tax breaks for oil companies and billions of dollars to continue inefficiencies at the pentagonall of this spending is protected by the republican budget and instead they choose to slash benefits to our seniors and our disabled americans budgets are about priorities and theyre about our values yes we should get serious about our nations deficit but lets be sure that our priorities are right and we do not threaten our obligations to our seniors to our children or to americas future"], [0.0011230111122131348, 0.9988769888877869, 1, "for a great number of hours today in this chamber there has been a great debate on whether or not to repeal the affordable care act when we know fully that the chances are slim to move forward and the measure would not be signed into law is it political posturing i believe it is of a grand style theres a pattern being established here theres been an attackoutright attackon social security attempts to privatize the system its been under attack for the last 76 years its been the underpinning that provides stability for working families across this great nation it has been a security piece that has enabled many to have at least assurances that there would be some support in family budgets as they move month to month we know that that measure social security has been dealing with its enemies for a long timesince before it was made a law likewise medicare which came to us in the midsixties enabled our senior community to have its health care needs met provided predictability and stability for retired households enabled people to enjoy a quality of life a better quality of health care we know that before medicare many of those who had retired expected to see their economic security dip south because of the expected cost of providing health care when they perhaps could not get that coverage in an insurance context so medicare as we know it today would be undone by the republican majority in this house they would prefer to privatize social security allow us to reach to the financial sector to perhaps see a repeat of what happened to so many individuals and families out there with this past recession where they saw their lifetime savings wiped away trillions lost in the american economy pain and suffering endured by families across this land theyd rather see a voucher system for medicare handing it over to the insurance companies to leave seniors digging deeper into their pockets so the pattern has been established here and now a repeal of the affordable care act before its full implementation before given a chance as we arrive as the last industrialized nation in the world to provide a universal health care coverage program unacceptable progress is struck a decision is rendered by the highest court in the land a conservativeleaning court before the ink is dry on that decision a move to repeal the court spoke it has spoken to america and said the litmus test for constitutionality was debated and a decision rendered that said yes in fact it meets the constitutionality test and so this evening on the eve of the attempts to repeal the affordable care act as it stands is a very telling moment it is one that suggests to us that there is this outright attempt to undo programs that serve our middle class so very well and without a thriving middle class our nation is not prosperous without that thriving middle class theres not purchasing power strong enough to provide the recovery of our economy without a strengthening of our middle class there is not a confidence in the economy a confidence that is needed so as to grow more customers for our business base and so the affordable care act is offering promise and hope to millions tens of millions of americans across this land whether youre insured underinsured uninsured all categories will see strengthening because of this measure think of it i represent a large proportion of senior citizens who are concerned about their pharmaceutical costs many dealing with that doughnut hole have reached that threshold that requires them to dig into their pockets we close that doughnut hole we make more affordable the prescriptions that are required for people to stay well and in some cases to have the medications that keep them alive we deny that opportunity to our nations seniors we deny the respect that we offer we deny the dignity in the equation that speaks to affordable outcomes for the pharmaceuticals that our senior community requires that doughnut hole would have been closed by 2020 further at the other end of the age spectrum many young adults finding it difficult in this recessionand now the recovery periodto gain a job as they perhaps leave high school or college are given the opportunity with the affordable care act to remain on their familys policy until the age of 26 therein lies a strong benefit for some 6 6 million young adults denied with the repeal measure denying access and affordability to health care situations how many cases of young adults impacted by catastrophic illness or accidents will it require to turn the hearts and the minds in a positive direction that would not forego this opportunity for our nations young adults a strong benefit associated with this package what about those who have a preexisting condition some 17 million children in that category and thats not to account for the many adults who would be denied because of preexisting conditions asthma in children diabetes in our senior community being a woman utilized as a preexisting condition an opportunity to deny coverage and the basic core need that we should consider to be truly american another benefit lost to the greedy notion of repealing success that was achieved in this house and the united states senate and signed into law by this president what about the efforts to deny lifetime benefits as a threshold cutting people off of an insurance coverage at perhaps a very demanding time in their lives games played with people and their lives and their recovery hope pulled from working families across this nation because of an insensitivity of this congress a deplorable situation assistance to our small business community now if we profess our small business community to be the economic engine that is part and parcel of our economic comeback our economic springboard then would we not want to provide assistance in that basic core need area would we not want to allow tax credits to come the way of our small business community many a majority of those businesses will remind all of us as representatives that they want to provide for their employees they want a productive workforce that means a strong and well workforce and so they see it as a strong investment one however that they could not afford in recent years because of the escalating costs 18 percent larger bill than industry and perhaps weaker coverage they wanted that turned around they wanted a smart approach a businesslike approach a sensitive response they got it with the affordable care act progress denied the small business engine weakened by this sort of neglect that could be advanced in this cited pattern of undoing social security privatizing social security changing medicare as we know it forever now repealing the affordable care act we see the pattern we see the gross neglect the disrespect for americas middle class her working families so we go forward and we understand that with the opportunities of an exchange small employers our small business community understands that if theyre unable to enter into an exchange where all the private sector participants agree to play by the rules to sharpen their pencils roll up their sleeves provide the service live within the parameters and allow for the many to enter into a common exchange to provide corresponding benefits think of it if 1 of 10 in that employee firm of 20 were to be impacted with catastrophic illness its devastating an actuarial impact that hits that small business owner hard in the pocketbook because of the premium increase for that 1 person of the 10 you employ if those same 10 employees were allowed to enter the exchange a better outcome a different outcome a stronger outcome for the economic recovery of this nation because the gross majority of jobs being produced in this comeback are being done by our small business community and so you know the formula is quite obvious we want a comeback we want that strongest response here from washington for that kick that we endured from a recession that drained us of 8 2 million jobs the best way to do it first of three principles small business provide for the strengthening of small business which the affordable care act does because that small business community has forever been the pulse of american enterprise secondly invest in that entrepreneur the dreamer the mover the shaker it always stretched us since our days of pioneer spirit with the industrial revolution and the westward movement very familiar to the district i represent which is the donor area to the erie canal in upstate new york in the capital region mohawk valley that pioneer spirit exists in our fabric today its our dna invest in the entrepreneur to be the ideas economy kingpin we rely on these wizards to build us sustain us stretch us empower us and then finally invest in a thriving middle class which the affordable care act does it enables us as a middle class community to be bolstered by the confidence the security the stability that has come with this success story in guaranteeing access and affordability to quality health care that will underscore the value of wellness and not just deal with illness that will put together efforts to cost contain that will bring people into a structured program so that we can monitor their activities and connect them to a system you know youll hear from some on the floor we dont want to pay for this its going to cost us too much were paying today for the neglect for the consequences of a notsoperfect system status quo will not cut it and so we need to go forward with progressive policies with the soundness of reform with the boldness of transition with the confidence we can instill with the progressiveness of policies that we can draft and so it is a sad note here echoed in this chamber that would attempt to unravel dilute destroy deny the promise we can make to america as i look at this effort for a comeback the containment of health care costs is just one of those areas that we need to help control create that better environment in which to grow jobs cultivate a prosperity its important its important for us to understand that it is part of an economic recovery equation but theres also the wisdom of investing in education in higher education again under attack by a system that does not always profess the strength of research and education and patents and discovery we understand that we are in the midst of a global race on innovation clean energy and ideas and high tech to be outstanding competitors to arrive at that race ready to conquer we will need to be strong and fit in order to be the winning agent on that global scene we saw that order of passion we saw that order of investment in the global race on space just decades ago this nation impacted by a sputnik moment dusted off its backside and said never again never again and what was the result together a nation grew in its commitment to winning the global race on space we are going to be that agent that nation that proud people that would stake the american flag on the moon and we won that race because of a commitment because of investment in the soundness of the people of this great country and her business community we embraced research we embraced science we believed in our strength as a people and the confidence exuded was the elixir that brought us to the victory where is that like passion today where is that leadership a rather youthful president that led us in the sixties and challenged us in almost replication today finds us interestingly to be challenged by a rather youthful president asking us to enter into the global sweepstakes committing with passion to the cause and so we need that investment in education in higher education and research just today in schenectady new york in the 21st congressional district of new york that im proud to represent we announced formally the creation of the advanced battery manufacturing center at that facility of ge ceo jeff immelt traveled for the celebration came to town to announce this wonderful wonderful addition that is america at work with her genius activity thats america determined to win the global race on ideas advanced battery manufacturing the battery the linchpin to so much potential out there to grow domestic supplies of energy to grow jobs as we grow our energy future to reduce the gluttonous dependency on fossilbased fuels oftentimes imported from some of the most unfriendly nations to the united states sending hundreds of billions of dollars annually to those foreign treasuries that are then used to train troops to fight against our own daughters and sons on the battlefield unacceptable there is a better way and this congress knows it we invest in jobs we invest in health care we invest in education we invest in research we do it in a way that promises our best attempt as a nation to generations yet unborn someone was there for us and we need to be there for future generations of americans to provide the sort of cuttingedge opportunity that will spell america at her best i look at that opportunity for not only battery manufacturing but nanotechnology and semiconductor signs chip manufacturing the newly designed 20th congressional district in new york that comprises a good portion of the now existing 21st district that i represent is probably one of the most technology investedin congressional districts in the country it is happening because there is this belief in the worker a belief in the entrepreneur a belief in the small business community a belief in the industrial context of the district and knowing full well that americas needsbe they for the environment or energys sake or business creation job creation business opportunityare inspiring this remarkable progress it requires our moving forward with a plan it requires our moving forward academically with the soundness of policy and with the corresponding resource advocacy that will yield lucrative dividends i see it all the time i see it in energyefficiency programs that produce jobs that enable us to capture waste heat that is part of the energy process enabling us to be much more efficient efforts that enable us to create more and more patents in a world that has grown much more competitive much more sophisticated we can ill afford to weaken in our attempts to be the kingmakers of the international economy the old american spirit the history of this nation replete with those rags to riches scenarios that became the reason and the inspiration for the compilation of journeys made by our ancestors to these shores because the opportunity called the american dream became the prize for which they searched i see it in my own roots the proudest label i carry in life is as the grandson of immigrants their journey gave me great opportunity and it gave my family great opportunity those journeys chased after the american dream we need beginning in this house chamber to reignite the american dream to go back to the core essence of who we are as a people to reach into that american heart and soul that has forever relied on its passion that we can achieve because we have opportunity and that we will not deny that opportunity that we will strengthen the boldness of those dreams and enable us to respond to the needs of the moments and the future and to write our legacy as a generation of americans let us not fail in that attempt let us continue to reach deep into that american spirit at a time when we were challenged and our economy was brought to its knees by failed policies that did not manage well that did not provide for the stewardship of our resources and when we tripped and fell let it be known that in the recovery we were stronger than ever before because of that belief that our best days lay ahead of us the belief that those best days were in the future we moved forward and we dug deep into that american spirit to respond with the respect for americas middle class our middle classall of us in that middle classhave always understood if you play hard if you abide by the rules if you roll up your sleeves and do your best you could rightfully anticipate the taste of success that is america in her most shining moments and that is an economy that we can produce it begins with the soundness of a strong and productive workforce that went through training and retraining that got to taste the potential for success by that self discovery that comes with education and to then understand our gifts so that we could share them in the most profound way and then to provide for the wellness of that workforce so it could be most productive so that the conditioning that came with that sort of commitment and that order of respect and that potion of dignity could then allow for us to speak to a nation that was humbled by its own beginnings where the rightful stories of so many who made it their journey were written by a nation that believed in her people so tonight on this eve of an attempt to repeal the affordable care act let us understand that our budget here in washington our actions with legislation our responsiveness to the needs of the american people are an establishment of our prioritiesa prescription of what we see our future to bea reaching into the heart to say that we are a truly caring lot thats what separates us from other nations it is the uniqueness of america and her greatness the affordable care act is a measurement of not only sound policy it is a statement of a compassionate society that understands its not about oneself that its about neighbors that its about community that its about the great society it has been the history through the decades through the vintages of time that has enabled us to reach to the greatness of our government to reach to the soundness of ideas and innovation to respond to the challenges that have enabled us to build upon those who preceded us always anticipating that the next generation would be made stronger we owe it to our children and grandchildren and generations yet unborn let them look at this moment in history american history knowing that america was challenged that she stepped up to the plate and said yes to her people and truly made a difference and allowed people to understand full well that the best days of this great nation lie ahead of us with that i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.0011550188064575195,

made in this our month of march a tribute to all women as the democratic cochair of the womens caucus i am particularly proud to talk about some of the accomplishments and challenges quite frankly of african american women in this country it is so obvious that we have to honor some of our ancestors on whose shoulders we stand women like harriet tubman who led slaves out of slavery even at the point of a gun a rifle a strong african american woman that really instilled the kind of selfrespect and selfesteem in the african american community that strength of character that has helped us survive all kinds of tragedies in our community sojourner truth of course who really was engaged very heavily in the womens right to vote movement in the suffrage movement and of course fannie lou hamer in mississippi who fought for the right to vote and rosa parks who fought to end the segregation in the south on accommodation and really moving through history people like madam c j walker first millionaire so many people i could just go on and on naming women in every field of business and entertainment oprah winfrey all the way of course to our very own first lady our own great michelle robinson obama but i think that such a tribute would not be complete if we did not recognize some of the people who are unknown to people some of the unsung heroes within our own community and im thinking of such a woman right now a woman named velvalea phillips velvalea phillips lived in milwaukee wisconsin and graduated from north division high school my alma mater the same school that golda meir graduated from and it was at that time a predominantly white school and she won an oratorical contest and the school was reluctant to give her that prize because she was a black student and of course the majority white student body rebelled and insisted that she win the prize as an orator velvalea phillips later came to be known as vel affectionately as vel phillips went on to run for alderman of the city of milwaukee there had never been a woman who had won a seat on the common council until vel ran and because she shortened her name from velvalea to vel they thought she was a man she didnt put any pictures on her literature so they also did not know she was a black so she was the first woman and the first black person to become an alderman in the city of milwaukee she was the first black woman to graduate from the university of wisconsin law school she was the first black person to become a judge in milwaukee county she was the first black woman to ever serve on a national party committee in either the democrat or the republican national committee the very first black woman she is the first and only african american who has ever won a statewide office in the state of wisconsin she is alive and still kicking and is a major force in the community brainstorming conference of milwaukee a sort of black think tank in milwaukee that talks about all kinds of social situations in milwaukee very thriving organization in our community but even then it would be inappropriate to end this tribute without talking about those unknown women who have contributed so much and i believe that this hour started out with your referencing some of these people madea big mama aunt peaches cousin fannie these people who dug deep into their pockets to pull out a very carefully folded 20 bill to press into your hand as you went off to college to give you some support those people who scrubbed floors and were not proud to try to give you a better life than they had those people who held the family together when all else failed and that is why african americans have thrived and survived to the extent that they have because of the strength of the african american woman in our community i will tell you as a physician gentlelady from the virgin islands that african american women are facing some tremendous challenges right now we live in america and of course african americans are very proud to be american but the fact still remains that there is no level playing field in america for african american women women in general only earn 77 cents for every dollar that a man earns and of course african american women earn even less than that and theyre faced with so many challenges with a very high incarceration rate among african american men african american women are often finding themselves in situations where they are the sole breadwinners in a family where their wages are less than african american men or any men in this country african american women though have continued to show that they are overcomers that they can step outside of their story that they can stand in the truth of their power and continue to inspire generation after generation after generation of african americans and we see this so often when we think of people in our community who have been raised up by single female and single female heads of household but have continued to move forward we look at our own president barack obama he is an african american his mother was not an african american woman but she mirrored the condition of so many african american women in this country finding themselves rearing african american children on their own and that is why i think it is important to come to this floor and to implore our colleagues to not eviscerate the kinds of support that makes so much difference to children like the women infant and children program where there have been efforts to cut that by 747 million efforts to cut head start efforts to cut the maternal and child health block grant efforts to cut out basic kinds of support that african american women need to support their often lonely task of trying to rear children who are already poor and the genius of african american women to cobble together a living where there seems to be nothing is something that i admire a great deal and something quite frankly that i have been a beneficiary of my mother was the mother of nine children im the eighth of nine children and my mother was poor at the point at which i was born my mother had nine children and did not have a high school education she went back to high schoolthis was prior to gedshe went back to high school when i was about 5 years old and she got an associates degree after that and she went on to graduate and become magna cum laude as an adult and all this time she kept us fed with beans and cornbread and rice and plenty of fresh water out of lake michigan she believed firmly in taking us to church and feeding us at the trough of religion and good morality and having compassion and loving justice her very best friend ceria travis who went to church with her has a daughter dr dorothy travis moore who has established a school in milwaukee devoted to helping struggling african american men because they saw how these strong black women worked hard and my mom and mrs travis inspired a whole generation of african american men and women to strive for a life better than they had my mom helped so many young people go on and win college scholarships she used to train them and tutor them to be able to win scholarships from the local masons and elks oratorical contests this is why i cant stop gentlelady from the virgin islands because i had a role model in my own life of a sociological miracle someone who overcame all of the things that had been said she couldnt do so that is why if people tell me that i cannot do something i have what all children should have and that is a background of someone who is close to them that says continuously yes i can yes i can yes i can and as black women we can do it however scarce our resources however austere these budgets are we are not going to go away we are americans we work hard we have built this country and we have provided this country with a lot of genius we have provided original music we have provided inventions and agriculture we have built this capitol with our sweat blood and tears and as african americans we are proud of the american part and as black women we have given birth not only to our children but we

living in poverty in america nearly 45 million americans live in poverty and one in five children are growing up in poverty the recession may be over for big corporations and the superrich but for far too many americans the recession is actually a depression yesterday the out of poverty caucus held a press conference with organizations working on the front lines with lowincome and poor people we heard stories of more homelessness long lines at food pantries and the desperation felt by so many our nations unemployment rate remains at an unacceptably high 9 2 percent millions of americans who have lost their jobs are finding it harder and harder to find a new one these new ranks of the longterm unemployed and their families are facing the stark reality of life in poverty for the first time the ongoing impact of the recession on struggling families and those facing or living in poverty simply must not be ignored but instead of working to improve the lives of millions of americans in poverty the republican party continues their drive to plunge our nation into default and our economy over the brink speaker boehner has unveiled yet another republican plan that fails to do what america needs his plan fails to end the threat of default his plan targets the programs aimed at americas most vulnerableour seniors our children and our lowincome familiesfor more draconian cuts trying to balance the budget on the backs of the poor is morally wrong we need a balanced approach that balances targeted cuts with the revenue that we need we must make sure that we can pay the benefits that we owe to our seniors protect medicare medicaid and social security and safeguard our most vulnerable communities while the nations unemployment level remains unacceptably high for some minority communities it was double digits even before the recession began the unemployment rate for african americans today is recorded at 16 2 percent and latinos recorded at 11 2 percent and what many of us have known for a long long time now african americans and latinos have lost 18 to 20 times their net worth more so than white americans due to structural inequalities where race is a factor these numbers are horrific and speak to the larger crisis facing our nation the jobs crisis let me share the story of one american who is looking for a job reverend david was laid off from his job as the successful director of a faithbased nonprofit that served the disadvantaged and worked to put people on a path to selfsufficiency now he is relying on the very safety net programs that he used to connect others to he diligently job hunts week after week david and his wife rely on unemployment benefits to make ends meet and he is worried about what he will do when he reaches the 99week limit of those benefits reverend david is not alone fortyfive million americans worry about where they will sleep at night if their children will eat what will happen if they need medical attention and when

balance the budget on the backs of lowincome americans by taking away their medicaid and who stands to gain from taking away medicare medicaid and social security benefits special interests and the rich in addition to taking away medicare medicaid and social security benefits h r 2560 would also subvert the federal governments ability to respond to downturns in the economy or special needs including a possible national security crisis during inevitable cyclical downturns it will be necessary to raise the debt limit to stimulate growth by cutting taxes and providing unemployment benefits to help people get back on their feet if theyre laid off among several proven effective measures furthermore in the event of a security threat we have an obligation to act this bill including the proposed balanced budget constitutional amendment would make it nearly impossible to respond to any economic or security crisis at the root of all of this is a system of misguided priorities my republican colleagues have determined that in order to balance the budget we should prioritize cutting medicare medicaid and social security benefits instead of addressing what got us into this

understandably concerned and have articulated the concern that if we pass the debt limit deadline of august 2 without raising the debt limit there could be catastrophic financial consequences in light of that i along with a number of my republican colleagues both in the senate and in the house have introduced legislation called the cut cap and balance act to address the debt limit to address it

spending caps to put us on a smooth but steady glidepath toward balancing our budget sometime within the next decade third we need a balanced budget amendment passed out of congress and submitted to the states for ratification we think all three of these steps are necessarily required before we take the significant additional step of raising the debt limit because of the fact that it took us a long time to get to this point the point where by the end of the year we will have accumulated 15 trillion in debtabout 50 000 for every man woman and child in america between 120 000 and 150 000 for every wage earner in america this is a lot of moneybefore we extend that debt limit again by an additional 2 4 trillion we have to solve the problem we have to address the problem that led to its creation in a real lasting binding fundamental way that is why the most critical part of this legislation while each part is important happens to be found in that which rests upon the idea of a balanced budget amendment to the constitution we as members of congress could decide right now that over the next 10 years or 15 years it might be a good idea to cut spending by 2 trillion 3 trillion 4 trillion 5 trillion 6 trillion perhaps morebut if we made that promise today as a downpayment to the american people in exchange for the permission of the people to raise the debt limit it is a promise we cannot make good on because we cannot bind a future congress this congress was sworn in in january of 2011 elections will be held in november of 2012 and a new congress will be sworn in based on those elections in january 2013 the same thing will happen again in january 2015 and every 2 years after that for the duration of our republic the decisions we make right here right now can

balanced budget but we do need to balance our budget in the opinion of the president congress just needs to do its job not amend the constitution i think i understand his point i think he is suggesting that for congress to do its job it needs to balance its budget but i have to ask the question how has that worked out for us have past congresses balanced their budgets has the current congress balanced its budget overwhelmingly the answer is no it happens every now and then some would describe those instances where it has balanced in the last two or three decades as an accident

completely ignoring the fact that this is not just the best legislation to address the debt limit issue right now it is the only legislation it is the only legislation that addresses this issue that is moving through congress and that has been reduced to legislative language it is certainly the only one that has been passed by one body of congress and is now moving over to the senate he is criticizing something when he himself has not offered anything this is the only show in town given how close we now are to the august 2 deadline and in part because we punted this so long and in part because we have not been having the debate and discussion in congress we should have been having for months this is it this is the only proposal if senator reid has suggestions on how we might change this proposal i am all ears i would love to hear what they are if he has his own proposal i would love to see what that is but simply to stand from that desk over there and disparage this legislation is inexcusable absolutely inexcusable given the fact that he has offered nothing let me read some of his words he said the american people should understand that this this meaning the cut cap and balance act is a bad piece of legislation perhaps some of the worst legislation in the history of this country i dont know what he is referring to he didnt give specifics nor has he given any specifics on what he would like to see in its place or how it could be improved my suggestion to our senate majority leader is if he has ideas please put them on the table because as we approach this debt limit deadline we are running out of time the clock has been ticking for 6 months we have known this was going to happen this is not news to us why then has there been so little debate and discussion in this body why is it that we spent weeks and weeks and weeks often dealing with legislation that paled in comparison to the importance of this issue the clock kept ticking and we kept debating and discussing other legislation far less important this in my opinion was a gross dereliction of duty but we still have a few weeks we can still deal with it we can still address it i suggest strongly that we address it by starting with that legislation that has actually been proposed and that we have full debate and discussion but no we are told even after the house of representatives earlier this week passed the cut cap and balance act passed it with bipartisan support by the wayno fewer than five members of the democratic caucus in the house of representatives voted to support this that was passed tuesday night we were told later we would be having a vote on saturday or perhaps monday then just a little while ago we were informed by the senate majority leader that the vote would be tomorrow giving us little or no time for actual debate and discussion on the floor of what is still to this moment the only legislation moving through to address this issue this is not an appropriate moment for demagoguery demagoguery on an issue this important can result in a lot of unnecessary pain no one disputes that there could be significant negative economic consequences associated with not raising the debt limit i do not dispute that not for a moment that is exactly why i put my neck on the line in order to file this legislation because nothing else was moving forward i didnt want to do it but when i was sworn in as a senator just a few months ago i understood it was my obligation to do what i could to make things better to make our constitutional system work so i filed it it is an insult not only to me and to my colleagues but to all americans when addressing an issue this important to have so little debate and discussion over this issue i find it appalling i find it reprehensible i demand an explanation and i demand an alternative solution if the senate majority leader is going to pick this apart and say he will not do it moreover i will remind the senate majority leader that just a few short years ago in 2006 when we had a different president belonging to a different party and this body was in control of another party if my memory serves me correctly not only did thensenator barack obama vote against raising the debt limit calling the need to do so the product of a failure of leadership that he was not willing to condone and perpetuate but every single one of his democratic colleagues joined him in that vote not one of them voted to raise the debt limit here we are again approaching the debt limit here we are again with only republicans stepping to the plate and offering a solution only this time the solution is a permanent one unfortunately in 2006 and prior and in subsequent debt limit extension votes there was no serious debate attached to it as to a permanent solution we have to amend the governing document the law of laws the only kind of law that can bind future congresses in order to solve this problem we have to do it now this is part of what it means to be an american we as americans crave liberty and we eschew tyranny to any degree every single time we authorize deficit spending we fuel the unfettered expansion of the federal government and all its power we commit ourselves and our posterity to a future that will include working more and more hours and days and weeks and even months just to pay their federal tax bills every single year that is time they will not get back that is time we will not get back that erodes our individual liberty it also erodes our liberty when the same regulatory structure that exists today grows bigger and bigger every year because we are borrowing now more than 1 5 trillion every single yearnot because of some aberrational condition some unusual development that requires an unusual expenditure of borrowed money but just to cover our basic daytoday operations this is what fuels the perpetual expansion of government and when government expands perpetually our individual liberty is diminished unfortunately and to a corresponding degree this is unacceptable but there is a way home the way home is found in limiting the role of government we can limit the role of government most effectively at this point in time i believe by limiting the pool of money to which congress has access the only way to do that is through a constitutional amendment i wish to close by addressing one final argument that sometimes has been used in response to and against the cut cap and balance act many of its detractors are making the claim that i find extraordinary a claim that says why are you even supporting this because it cant pass it is a little bit akin to saying why do we even play the super bowl when it is expected that one team is going to beat the other team we have to play but this one is not a game this one is for real when we vote after debating and discussing members of this body can and will be held accountable to our constituents so it will be up to me and each of my colleagues in this body to decide how to vote on this issue for those who make the unfortunate decision to vote against this notwithstanding the fact that 75 percent of the american people strongly support the idea of a balanced budget amendment notwithstanding the fact that 66 percent of americansboth of these figures according to a cnn poll todaysupport the principles underlying cut cap and balance notwithstanding the fact that this is the only permanent way of solving our debt problem if members of congress and members of this body choose to vote against this legislation they will do so i believe at their own peril they will have to face their constituents and explain why a handful of them were unwilling to raise the debt limit unwilling to address this problem unwilling to fix the perpetual deficit spending habit of congress simply because they did not want a balanced budget amendment to the constitution i think that is a tall order i think that is difficult to explain i think those who try to make that explanation to their constituents will do so at their own political peril but more importantly the vote they cast will be at the peril of the people of the united states of america of their liberty of their economic stability and of their ability to prosper now and in the future we can turn this ship around but in order do it we need robust debate and discussion and our constituents deserve more the american people deserve more than to have the kind of sleightofhand scheduling and the kind of dismissive cavalier attitude toward what is being characterized correctly by many as the fight of an entire generation we need to pass the cut cap and balance act it is not only the best solution it is the only solution the time is running out and i urge each of my colleagues to support this thank you mr president i yield the floor"], [0.9925048351287842, 0.9925048351287842, 0, "topping the list of unfinished business this year is the impending collision of two closely related crises the expiration of the payroll tax and the acceleration of social securitys bankruptcy last year congress voted for a payroll tax cut that averages roughly 1 000 for every working family in america as warned it failed to stimulate economic growth and it accelerated the collapse of the social security system but as promised it threw every working family a vital lifeline in very tough economic times we need to meet three conflicting objectives we need to continue the payroll tax cut we need to stimulate real economic growth and we need to avoid doing further damage to the social security system first we need to understand that not all tax cuts stimulate lasting economic growth cutting marginal tax rates does so because it changes the incentives that individuals respond to cutting inframarginal tax rates such as the payroll tax does not but that payroll tax cut did make a huge difference in the ability of working families to make ends meet in a time of declining family incomes and steadily rising prices to restore that payroll tax rate today given the economic pressures on working families is simply unthinkable yet at the same time the payroll tax is what supports the social security system last year that system entered a state of permanent deficit and this condition will worsen until the social security system bankrupts in 2036 at that moment every retiree will suffer a sudden and permanent drop in benefits of roughly 25 percent further reducing the revenues into that system will hasten this day of reckoning just as bad in the intervening time the expanding social security deficit will heap growing burdens on the nations already staggering public debt now some have proposed paying for the inframarginal payroll tax cut that doesnt help the economy with a marginal tax hike that actually harms the economy surely we can do better than that actually congressman landry of louisiana has done better and i commend his proposal to the attention of the house it avoids damaging the social security fund while at the same time offering families continued relief from crushing payroll taxes his measure h r 3551 the social security preservation through individual choice enhancement or sspice act constitutes the most realistic and innovative approach to these twin and related crises that has yet been placed before congress by linking the cost of social security to the benefits that it provides h r 3551 would give every american the choice of paying a lower payroll tax each year in exchange for working a month longer thats all it would take to pay for itselfa months delay in retirement for a years worth of tax relief for the first time individuals can make this choice to pay a lower payroll tax based on their own circumstances without further undermining the fiscal integrity of the social security system or the financial security of those relying on that system for the first time costs and benefits would be linked in a manner that all consumers can understand and judge for themselves based on their own circumstances in a difficult year like this i think most families would rather save the extra tax and work the extra month in better times ahead they may choose to pay the extra tax to maintain their retirement schedule but it will be their choice based on their needs their plans and their best judgment and not the governments and by linking costs with benefits it will protect the longterm actuarial soundness of the social security system a fact that the social security systems chief actuary has confirmed im excited to cosponsor mr landrys bill and strongly and enthusiastically recommend it to the membership of the house and to the leadership mr landry has done an enormous service to every retiree who depends upon the social security system as well as to every working family struggling in america by preserving the fiscal integrity of the system while at the same time giving every american a choice that links the tax they pay to the benefits they receive and its an option they can exercise every year without fear that a future congressional act or failure to act might sock them with a tax increase they cant afford or hasten the collapse of a retirement system that many depend upon for their economic survival"]],

puerto rico for their leadership and their service in bringing this legislation to the floor also and more especially to chairman smith and our ranking member mr conyers for their support in bringing this bill to the floor for consideration i fully support the fundamental purpose of this bill which is to create and integrate blue alert plans throughout the 50 states and the unitedstates territories in order to disseminate information when a law enforcement officer is seriously injured in the line of duty this program is similar to the silver alert public notification system which broadcasts information about missing persons especially seniors with alzheimers disease or the americas missing broadcasting emergency response known mainly as the amber alert a public notification system about a missing child similarly the intent of this legislation is to expeditiously apprehend the offenders that kill or hurt law enforcement officers law enforcement officers put their lives on the line every day to protect and to serve the public each year hundreds of law enforcement officers are killed or seriously injured in the line of duty on average one law enforcement officer is killed in the line of duty every 53 hours last year 173 officers had been killed up to 13 percent from 153 killed in the line of duty 2 years ago the blue alert system is a cooperative effort among local state federal authorities law enforcement agencies and the general public it provides a description of an offender who is still at large and may include the description of the offenders vehicle and license plate information i am concerned to learn just this morning that the initial provision for a grant program to be made available to states and territories in support of the blue alert system is nowhere to be found in the language of the bill instead the current bill language will only provide that the attorney general shall assign an existing officer of the department of justice to act as the national coordinator of the blue alert communications network while knowing that the blue alert system is not mandatory resources should be made available to the 50 states and territories in order for the blue alert system network to work effectively and efficiently otherwise the initial purpose of this bill will not be met under the current bill text before us today however i fully support the needs of the blue alert system i urge that a grant program be made available to ensure that the law enforcement officers in the 50 states and territories are provided equal and fair treatment again i want to thank chairman smith and ranking member conyers for their support of this bill and i urge my colleagues to support this legislation"], [7.855892181396484e-05,

consume in closing this bill is going to pass and its going to pass likely on a bipartisan basis because it would be the ultimate in inappropriate behavior by this body to allow our pay to be raised this is something i think that both sides have said fairly straightforward that this is not a time in which members of congress should take their 174 000 salary and increase it i dont believe weve earned it this year by the way i believe the presidents salary will not go up and the vice presidents salary will not go up and that is also appropriate but as we look at the hardworking men and women of the federal workforce and look at my colleagues from virginia who spoke and my colleague from maryland who spoke the point that the federal workforce should be listening to today is that in fact its not how hard they work its what can the american people afford we cannot afford to continue these deficits its not how hard they work it is the inefficiency and waste not just in their office but in the way government is organized everyone had a new years resolution i trust last night for all of us im sure it was to lose a little weight do a few other things that we havent been doing but for me particularly its to go after the duplication in government to go after the organizational flaws in government that would allow us to be less critical perhaps of what we can afford from our federal workforce and more proud of the fact that it is organized for efficiency in closing the president called for reorganization authority and then did nothing in his first term it is my goal to give him reorganization and a reorganizational plan it is my committees obligation to do that as i vote today to freeze our pay and to freeze all of the federal workers pay i do so recognizing that the best way for federal workers to get a pay raise without it being on the backs of the american people is for us to reorganize government whether its in information technology or any other goods and services

they wouldnt take him because he was not 18 he tried different recruiters he finally found an army recruiter he says he just told the recruiter a whopperthat he was 21 the recruiter took him swore him
