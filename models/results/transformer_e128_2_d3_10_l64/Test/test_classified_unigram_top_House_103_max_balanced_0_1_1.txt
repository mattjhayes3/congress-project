budget forecasts should remember george bernard shaws famous quip about second marriages the triumph of hope over experience while i heartily applaud the presidents emphasis on deficit reduction like the famous irish writer i urge my colleagues to focus on experience the problem is the underlying principles of the clinton plan that tax increases will reduce the deficit flies in the face of precedent recent history shows higher taxes lead to more federal spending lower economic growth fewer jobs and ultimately larger deficits we saw budget agreements and this chart reflects those budget agreements that resulted in massive tax increases in 1983 1985 1988 and 1990 in each case you can see from the charts more spending and larger deficits resulted from those tax increases chairman obeys own chart showed us that it was only in the years when congress was forced to restrain spending under the grammrudman act did we see any slowdown in this pace of runaway federal spending and that is reflected in chairman obeys own chart that he has presented us under grammrudman total domestic spending grew at an annual rate of 1 1 percent under the 1990 budget agreement with its supposedly stricter than grammrudman spending controls total domestic spending grew at an annual rate of 8 4 percent the proof is in the pudding as you can see from this chart here the grammrudman record clearly shows that seriously restraining congress ability to spend is the only real way to achieve progress on the deficit in addition i think it is important to point out actual tax revenues since the 1990 budget deal have fallen by more than 3 25 for every dollar the deal is supposed to raise and the deficit increased from 3 1 percent of gnp in 1990 to 5 percent in 1992 every economic study you look at shows that every dollar in new taxes raised since 1947 has led to 1 59 in new government spending a recent study by citizens agonst government waste showed that the 1990 budget agreement produced 2 37 in new spending for every dollar raised in new taxes that is hardly a formula for real deficit reduction experience shows that excessive government spending not a lack of tax revenues causes massive deficits revenues to the federal government have remained steady at an average of 18 6 percent of gross domestic product between 1965 and 1992 never falling below 17 5 percent at the same time government spending has risen from 17 6 percent of gnp to 23 5 percent in 1992 even more telling tax revenues have grown annually at an 8 percent rate over the past decade but spending has increased at an annual rate of 11 percent during the same time the clinton plan is more of the same with deficits the administration projected to average 250 billion a year and their analysis does not even reflect the blow to the economy of taking 328 billion out of the private sector out of the revenue stream in new taxes 328 billion these new taxes will stifle economic growth destroy jobs reduce revenues and increase the deficit economists across the ideological spectrum are convinced that the clinton tax increases will lead to widespread job loss let us look at a few of their comments david resler of nomura securities puts the cost at 400 000 lost jobs by the end of 1994 from these new tax increases drimcgraw hill says 700 000 jobs will be lost in 1997 and 1998 larry kudlow the chief economist at bear stearns estimates job losses at 3 2 million by 1996 and a reduction in real economic output of 450 billion we are going to have unfortunately i think the votes are there for the huge tax increases and we are going to see the prophecies of these economists realized constricting the economy with higher taxes not only means additional job losses less revenues from taxes higher expenditures for unemployment claims but ultimately larger deficits we all remember the infamous boat tax hike in the 1990 budget agreement that illconceived and shortsighted proposal not only failed to reduce the deficit despite the claims from many that it would do just that but it actually lost revenue the boat tax actually lost revenue because it threw thousands of workers out of their jobs as we now know the government lost the income tax revenues from these workers and increased spending on their unemployment claims the experiences of economies across the globe show that higher taxes and more government lead to longterm economic sluggishness we simply cannot grow the government without seriously stifling the private sector at the same time that the government gets bigger these tax increases stifle the productive private sector and destroy jobs we will not balance the budget or even make a dent in the deficit unless we allow the private sector to operate as the engine of economic growth i hope we can learn something from these economic lessons learned throughout our history economic lessons learned in couptries from mexico to poland but unfortunately lost on many of the politicians in this body when will they learn that free markets less government spending and low taxes are the only solid foundation for real economic growth 1 i urge my colleagues to support real

insult because the bill increases spending when the federal government is already 400 billion in the red 1 out of the 3 spent by this congress is borrowed money this bill is an insult because under this bill the 4 1 trillion federal debt will get worse much worse the federal debt is so bad that 1 out of every 5 that the american taxpayer sends to washington goes for nothing but interest payments on a national debt and now the democrats in this congress are going to increase the national debt under this bill things will only get worse it is an insult to the american people because the democrats in this house are raiding the social security reserves and other trust funds to the tune of 100 billion a year let me repeat that the trust funds in our country are being raided to the tune of 100 billion a year to cover the big spending that the democrats are pushing through this congress and under this bill social security will be raided even more yes social security is being taxed under this bill and the worst insult of all is that the democrats in this house want working families middleclass taxpayers and remember that tax cut they were promised americas senior citizens are going to pay even more taxes the american people should understand that under this bill the democrats will increase taxes on your social security benefits the democrats will tax social security and will tax social security benefits because the democrats in this house cannot control their big spending habits we republicans are opposed to taxing social security on february 10 the house republican study committee and the house republican research committee jointly held a congressional forum on the social security tax we revealed the damage that this bill will do to millions of senior citizens we detailed the unfairness of taxing benefits that average people earn through their lifetime of work just because the democrats in this house cannot say no to the special interest groups it is not only that they are spending money that upsets me it is that it is a payoff to the special interest groups yesterday i inserted in the congressional record the statebystate impact that this tax will have on senior citizens the democrats budget bill is an insult to the american people and it should be it must be rejected but if this budget passes the american people will know who is responsible for raising their taxes because the big spenders the democrats who control everything the house the senate the white house the bureaucracy all of the agencies are now marching on a new banner or i

yield myself 5 minutes and 30 seconds president lincoln must be turning over in his grave one hundred and thirtytwo years ago today he signed into law the nations first income taxdesigned as a temporary emergency measure to finance the civil war today president clinton is raising taxes to finance his version of a class war of course the administration is not without admirers one master of illusion the great houdini must be smiling down on this chamber today when we blow away the smoke and shatter the mirrors what we get from president clintons taxandspend road show is nowhere near what he claims not the 496 billion in deficit reduction not if we use the cbo numbers because cbo based on their estimates would score it at best at 428 billion in deficit reduction even that figure is generous because of the presidents illusory claims of slower spending growth 4 or 5 years from now and then that figure is generous because of the presidents illusory claims of lower spending in the fourth and fifth years this is the president who said we have all got to use congressional budget office estimates they are the real estimates and we have got to reject accounting gimmicks then he ignored cbos baselines and had his bookkeepers invent their own and counted savings from the 1990 budget agreement twice in order to puff up his deficit reduction numbers and i do not know if that is smoke and mirrors or what but if an accountant on main street did it he probably would go to jail that fact is this package includes about 120 billion in promises of net spending reductions almost all in the third fourth and fifth year 255 billion dollars worth of real net new taxes and user fees and about 53 billion in questionable debt service claims that is what you get when you lay this package against cbos estimates instead of the ones the administration cooked up there will be no net spending cuts in the first year zero and virtually none in the second year this package includes deficit increasing items totaling 62 billion over 5 years this new spending probably seems odd to the american people in a socalled deficit reduction package it is one of the reasons why they are nervous about this bill the largest tax increase in our nations history yes the largest by cbo estimates new taxes in this bill are 275 billion the democrats dispute this and they talk about the 1982 tax act but the cbo scored the 1982 tax act as raising 3214 billion in new taxes instinctively americans know these new tax increases are jobkilling poison for the economy they do not believe for one minute that the democrats tax increases are going to create jobs nor do most of the economists in this country the president claims the vast majority of these taxes will hurt only the rich and that is baloney he must not have read his own bill the socalled rich who are targets for massive retroactive tax increases are the small business men and women who create the vast majority of new jobs heaping higher taxes on those jobs creators translates into fewer jobs for working people perhaps we should remember the socalled luxury tax from the 1990 budget deal it is repealed in this bill because that misguided class warfare scheme backfired and killed the boatbuilding industry try to sock the rich and you drown working men and women simplistic attempts to minimize the impact of the energy tax on american families will not hold water either when the democrats tax transportation they are not just taxing people who pull up to the gas pump they are taxing everything that has to be transported senior citizens are among the hardest hit in this package thanks in particular to increased taxes on their benefits it must make them feel real special to learn that president clintons definition of rich people includes seniors with incomes of just 34 000 and that includes half of their social security benefits now that sounds pretty callous especially since seniors on fixed incomes are the one group of americans for whom lower interest rates serve as a financial curse rather than a blessing yes president clinton would like the american people to believe his own taxes only hurt rich people but with over 40 tax increases and 16 user fees in this package no one should seriously buy that story here is what the taxpayers do understand when he was courting their vote clinton promised the middle class a tax cut now he is raising their taxes he promised to create jobs now he is promising tax increases on employers that will kill jobs he promised 500 billion in deficit reduction he is at least 73 billion short of that at best all of the rate increases in the bill including estate taxes are retroactive to january 1 potentially unconstitutional and the installment payments gimmick for individuals does not change the bottom line he is imposing tax increases on people who have already died i urge my colleagues in the house to reject this bill today let us solve our deficit problem

important that the american people realize what exactly happened with this october surprise investigation when the democrat majority first pressed for a task force to investigate these charges i said the majority is offering an unacceptable resolution for an unnecessary investigation into unbelievable allegations based on unsubstantiated claims made by unsavory characters now after an 8month investigatlon at a cost to the taxpayers of 4 5 rrlion the october surprise task force conclusively refuted all alegations nde by the proponerls of 1he october surprise conspiracy theory i hate to tell you i told you so but i told you so i belileve now and i have always beleved that thi investigation was not necessary we were told by th majority tvhi there were trowbing llegations those allgatons were not troubling there were preposterous both newsweek and the new republic concluded as much in detailed investigative reports before the democrats even started this committee there is a curious aliceinwondarend logic about all of this first there were a number of october surprise conspiracy theories reported in the media these theories fed off each other repealing the same myths and fentasles in different ways taking unproven assertions and claiming they were undeniable facts quoting dubious sources playing up anything that could damage the reagan campaign team playing down anything that would damage their own case al the sordid ancient ticks of the conspiracy trade but simply by being reported and commented upon in the politcay correct media outlets ihat is the new york tames public television et cetera the conspiracy theories were said by democrats to raihe questions that needed to be answered once that claim was made it was inevitable that a congress dominated by democrats would be asked to provide the answers particularly since it was the antirepublican conspiracy theorists themselves who primarily did the asdng so the house had a costy investigaton based on nothing more than the claim that questions had been raised but questions are raised all the time in the media theories about secret powerful cabals of sinister puppet masters abound why was this particular theory dragged out for so long in the press paid such respectful attention and finally made the subject of two congressional investigations the fact that the questions were raised by disgruntled democratic party partisans shady characters and worldclass international liars was rarely mentioned by democrats when democrats were accused by republicans of partisanship in asking for an investigation based on unproven allegations they held up their hands in pious horror and exclaimed but questions have been raised we must investigate as if they rush to answer all conspiracy theory questions as matter of principle shorn of its sensationalism here is what happened reaganhating political activists and scoundrels concocted a libelous story claiming that ronald reagan or his aides or both deliberately used the hostages for their own political purposes the media reported the story and gave the theorists forums from which to spread the ibel because the story had been reported democrats said there are questions that must be answered and a congressional investigatory committee was formed and funded the theories were as i have said groundless is this going to be the investigative model for our future in the house will the democratic leadership always call for an investigation of conspiracy theories no manner what the source so long as questions are raised will we see democrats rushing to the floor or secretly enlisting the gao to investigate conspiracy theories about president clinton if and when such theories appear if some disgruntled republican who served in the bush administration manages to get a large part of the oped page given to him of the new york times as mr sick dkto offer a wacko conspiracy theory about the president clinton will democrats say questions have been ralsedl and call for an investigation i watch and wait with patient expectation it is also interesting to note the timing of the release of the report i can guarantee you one thing if there had been one bit of evidence that the reaganbush campaign was indeed involved the information would have been on every front page across the nation before the election instead the report concluded that there was no credible evidence of a conspiracy and it was released following the election i commend mr hamilton the very distinguished member from indiana who did a fine job in leading this investigation but lee hamilton should not be forced to waste his valuable time tracking down erroneous outrageous ridiculous allegations he should spend his time on the substantive things he does best things like heading a task force on congressional reform in fact investigations like this should be an item for the joint committee on the organization of the congress we should have better procedures in the house so that we can make certain that we dont form committees to investigate every wild conspiracy theory that hits the halls of congress we should also have a requirement that the minority is always kept informed of gao investigations initiated by the majority we should also prohibit staff from writing to federal judges urging them to release convicted felons from prisons because they proved helpful with secret investigations i appreciate the role that henry hyde both as the republican leader of this task force and as a force for reason during the entire debate i would like to thank him for reminding us all through this special order that the october surprise task force was formed not because the majority wanted to answer troubling questions from credible sources but because there are some who want to cast a shadow on one of the greatest presidents in our history i think the formation of this task force not the work product of the members of that task force symbolizes much to what is wrong with this house after 38 years of majority control"], [0.004420572891831398, 0.004420572891831398, 0, "several crucial questions remain unanswered about the

which i chair spent the entire weekend studying president clintons budgetary proposals and what kind of an impact it would have either positive or negative on the united states of america here is what we found there were 325 5 billion in tax increases the largest tax increase in unitedstates history by more than 60 or 70 percent the largest before that was around 184 billion in addition to that there are 70 billion in hidden fee and get this they are called spending cuts they have got 70 billion in fees in there that are called spending cuts when that is actually more money coming out of taxpayers pockets when you talk about spending cuts he has been telling america about this there are spending cuts totaling 91 7 billion but there are spending increases totaling 185 9 billi6n for a net increase of 94 2 billion so when he tells you he is going to cut spending the fact of the matter is we are not cutting domestic spending we are increasing it by over 94 billion on top of that there are 395 billion in new taxes and hidden fee increases the only spending cuts in his budgetary propolal that we can find are in the area of defense and those cuts were going to take place anyhow and that is 112 billion so the deficit reduction plan he is talking about is not coming from spending cuts it is coming out of the hides of the american taxpayer now 2 years ago when we had the budget summit agreement and president bush erroneously i believe signed on to that agreement with the democrat majority in both the house and the senate weraised taxes on the backs of the american people to the tune of 182 billion and that tax increase cost us thousands and thousands of jobs and put this country into an economic recession that we are just now coming out of the tax increases president clinton is talking about in my view are going to cost at least 250 000 jobs in the next year to 18 months and it is going to put this country into an economic decline much worse than what we have seen in recent years now i was talking to one of my democrat colleagues today and i promised i would not use his name because he was sorry he said this but he meant it here is what he said with smile any tax you pass is going to put somebody out of business and that is the problem these huge tax increases are going to put a lot of marginal business people over the brink and they are going to go bankrupt today out in the hall just 5 or 10 minutes ago i talked to members from the farm bureau do you know what they told me the btu tax the energy tax which i call the big time unemployment tax the btutax is going to cost them so much that many of them will go out of business because they cannot pass those increased costs on to the consumer because of the way the agricultural markets work on the commodities exchange they cannot pass that on so a lot of small farmers and mediumsized and large farmers are going to go out of business if we pass the btu tax in addition i just had a bunch of people call me who are in the foundry business they rely on energy to make the molds and make the products that most of us in this country use it is one of the biggest industries in america they tell me that many foundries are going to go out of business if we pass this stu tax then we come to the airline industry and i am only going to mention three tonght but i can go on and on and on but the airline industry is going to be hit with a 15 centsper gallon jet fuel increase and many of those airlines if you have been reading in the papers are on the brink of bankruptcy now they are trying to cut deals with british airways and other foreign airlines just to stay above water here we are going to joad on the backs of the airlines one of the most important parts of commerce in this country another 15 cents per gallon fuel tax i guarantee itis going to put alot of them out of business every one of these companies that go out of business has enployees when they go out f business their emplqyees lose their jobs and when they lose their jobs that increases the unemployment rolls for each 1 percent of unemployment when you add in all of the benefits they get that costs the taxpayers and the treasury 342 billion this one little phase of his economic recovery program is a recipe for economic disaster so i am telling my friends across this country who say well we have to do something we have gdt to do something we want to cut that deficit cut the debt that is absolutely true when president clintonstood up here and he said to the american people it is not what is important for me it is what is important for us meaning the entire nation he was absolutely corpect but the solution is not these homongous tax increases which will make us less competitive tith our foreign trading partners will drive business out of this country and itake jobs along with it take money out of the taxpayers pockets withoutwhich they cannot buyproducts and if they donot buy the products they do not produce products and if they do nat produce products people lose their jobs and unemplqyment goesup the solution is to cut government spending ten yearsago we were bringing in 500

possibility that vince foster committed suicide i do not believe after reading that report in some detail with about seven other people that he committed suicide at fort marcy park i believe his body was moved to that location and i will tell this body why i want to go into my remarks this morning because i do not want to hurt the foster family but at the same time i believe that if there was some misdeeds done out there the american people have a right to know and this congress has a right to know and there should be a complete and full investigation if there are any irregularities let us go into this just a little bit the man that found vince fosters body said his face was straight up and yet if you read the report there was blood coagulated on the side of his face and on the shirt forensics experts say his body was like this and they say in the report that one of the people who worked on the investigation must have moved his head the fact of the matter is before they even got out there the man that found him said his head was straight up so the head had been moved before the experts went out there who moved the body we need to find out who moved the body there was blonde hair not mr fosters on his tshirt and other parts of his garments whose hair was it it was not his there were carpet and other wool fibers found on the body where did they come from i do not like to talk about this but there was semen found on his underwear which would indicate there might have been a sexual experience that afternoon between i and 5 if that is the case it is hard to understand the state of mind of somebodk who is thinking about committing suicide and having a sexual encounter at the same time here is something very damaging they dug 18 inches around the body and they sifted all of the dirt and they could find no skull fragments at the site no skull fragments were found at the site and there was a 3inch hole at the back of the mans head from the gun if he was killed at fort marcy park they would have found skull fragments at that site why were they not found there i believe because he committed suicide or was killed someplace else and moved to that spot all of the bullets that were found at the site using modern technology show that there were a number of bullets found but not the one which killed vince foster and they were out there with grids and everything else for several days with 16 people looking and why was the gun in mr fosters hand in the wrong hand mr foster was lefthanded the gun was in his right hand i want to tell you that if you are going to commit suicide and you are in that state of mind usually you grab with the hand you use all of the time the gun was in the other hand why did the man who found fosters body say there was no gun in either hand not once not twice but three times when he talked to gordon liddy and that is the man the fbi investigated my concern is for the facts and the truth when people say i am down here trying to bring this body to a low ebb i resent it i am concerned about the feelings of the family members and i think it is tragic that they went through this mr foster had an awfully good record in life but if his body was moved we need to know from where it was moved if he had this kind of experience during the day we need to know about it we need to know whose hair was on his body these are questions that need to be answered we need to know why there were no skull fragments at the site if he blew the back of his head out it appears to me that he probably was moved from someplace else

commonsense democrat the gentleman from ohio with all the white house has been doing over the last couple of weeks the american people are justified in asking what in blazes is going on with the clinton administration and specifically what is up with his budget while the concern is real the focus may be a little off indeed many things are going up with the clinton budget we are considering today but the worst things about it are what things are going down i want to bring my colleagues attention to both the ups and the downs of the socalled plan needless to say spending is up despite omb director leon panettas comments earlier this year that the administrations budget would contain 2 in spending for every 1 in new taxes this reconciliation bill reverses this plan it actually contains 6 in taxes and fees for every 1 in spending reductions and it is a 20toi ratio over the first 2 years call me a cynic but that is more in line with what some of us expected indeed whether spending reductions will ever occur is open to question but one thing is clear the president and the majority democrats in congress are interested only in paying lip service to spending cuts in its exhaustive search for domestic programs that dont work and are no longer needed the administration came up with only 11 programs totaling less than 3 billion out of the 1 427 trillion in nondefense outlays in 1997 and of the 343 billion this bill contains in reconciled reductions less than 70 billion is not arrived at by higher taxes overall this budget adds nearly 38 billion in new or expanded entitlement programs which have after all been the problem with this budget all along while the administration has been forced into negotiating with congress over entitlement caps little has been said about the entitlement programs the budget creates even though halt a dozen human resources provisions were cut by 1 2 billion over 5 years incredibly 20 other programs were expanded by 1 9 billion creating a spending increase of 700 million so what did the ways and means committee do characteristically it added new taxes including extending the federal unemployment tax which now enjoys permanent status as a temporary tax only in washington the new immunization program is a good example of how the democrats pass up opportunities to reform social services and simply resort to throwing dollars at problems despite evidence that govemmentprovided immunizations will have no impact on the immunization rate the democrats passed on a republican plan to allow states to use rewards and punishments to encourage welfare recipients to immunize their children thereby adding another 2 billion to cost of this bill there is not even a pretense that the regressive energy tax portion of this tax bill will not be used for more spending the white house has stated that the energy tax will help reduce the deficit and put the government on a payasyougo basis for needed public programs thats more spending folks and itis interesting to see how the democrats have tried to hide the taxs regressivity by robbing one class of taxpayers to pay off another this budget spends at least onehalf of the 71 5 billion expected to be raised over 5 years on lowincome families and individuals including printed on recycled paper containing 100 post consumer waste h 2998 c a 28 billion increase in the earned income tax credit eitc 7 billion in additional food stamp payments and 1 billion for lowincome home energy assistance program payments this forces middleincome familieshardly our nations richest taxpayersto pay an excessive share of the administrations revenue goal and as the energy tax increases yearly it is impossible for the middle class to know the size of the bag it is left holding it truly is a stealth tax which brings me to the next item that is up with the clinton budgettaxes all of this increased spending will require passage of the most massive tax hike in history it calls for 332 billion in tax increases over next 5 years and adding the various hidden increases the tax bite will grow even larger in later years it creates a new individual income tax rate brackets at the 36 and 39 6 percent levels which reach even lower down the income scale than now these new tax rates are supposed to raise 31 billion of the 39 billion in deficit reduction for 1994 under this plan gone at least from this reconciliation bill is all pretense of a millionaire surtax the white house no longer pretends that it is anything more than another rate bracket with millionaires defined now as those earning more than 250 000 and of course this tax is retroactive to the beginning of 1993 even families with incomes under 20 000 contrary to the presidents claims will bear the burden every time they pay their heating bills fill their gas tanks of make a purchase of almost any kind the clinton energy tax alone will cost every american family 471 a year individuals with adjusted gross incomes over 150 000 who pay estimated taxes must under the clinton budget pay 110 percent of current year taxes as next years estimated taxes to qualify for a safe harbor so individuals with no increase in income or tax liability during that year are effectually giving the government an interestfree loan this is outrageous but it is even worse for corporations even though this bill sets the maximum corporate tax rate at 35 percent large corporations which pay estimated taxes must pay a full 100 percent estimation rather than the 97 percent under current law this reduces the margin of error in computing estimated taxes and virtually assures the assessment of penalties the administration hopes to gain 2 7 billion from this unfair illusory deficit reduction provision which will only speed up the payment of corporate taxes by a few months and make a cheap profit from hardtofollow rules which are broken there is a hidden rate bracket increase in this reconciliation bill on small businesses and family farms the biggest job creators throughout the 1980s the bill would phaseout the permanent personal exemption limiting itemized deductions and removing the cap on wages subject to the health insurance tax there is also a new maximum marginal tax rate of nearly 44 percent as my colleagues know the maximum marginal tax rate currently almost 32 percentrepresents the true incentive for entrepreneurs to earn extra money so once a person pays the highest stated tax rate of 39 6 percent adds in a medicare tax for selfemployed individuals of 2 9 percent and tacks on an itemized

carefully because the eda was such a publicprivate partnership its record is less than successful every group that has looked at this program the inspector general the grace commission anybody that looks at government waste comes up with the eda and tells us this is an absolutely awful program over the past decade the eda spent 2 billion in unauthorized appropriations the inspector general found the eda invested 27 5 million to create 86 jobs that is 320 000 per job another ig investigation found 82 5 million invested in 80 projects almost half of which actually eliminated jobs it has invested 800 000 on a golf course that washed away 450 000 on a water tank that cannot be used and 670 000 on a marina that is too large for the town to maintain and on it goes the eda was created in 1965 to help economically distressed rural areas originally enacted 12 percent of the country qualified for eda assistance today edas mission has been expanded to 90 percent of the country we all know 90 percent of this country is not economically distressed at least not yet how did the eda lose its focus unlike the popular community development block grants the eda picks and chooses its own projects this makes it highly susceptible to pressure from capitol hill this makes it extremely valuable to members of congress the result has been an administration with a 28year history of bad projects and ineffective assistance it is not all memberdirected pork sometimes it is just bad management let me give the members an example from my own district manitou springs is a small resort community known for its natural sparkling waters it is the home of the manitou springs bottling plant in the early 1980s an investor bought the property with an eda loan then he defaulted on the loan in 1999 after dragging their feet over an ownership dispute the eda formally took possession of the property then nothing happened the eda did not market the property no property managers or real estate professionals were hired the sign outside the property did not say for sale it said keep out the eda did not maintain the property at one time the city had provided the eda with a list of code violations in fact the fire department would not use the bridge going to the property because they did not want to lose their truck as a result the eda did not sell the property for most of the decade the bottling plantsat unused and deteriorating while manitou went through a deep recession one of the best properties in town was tied up vacant deteriorating this is not just a colorado phenomenon at one point over 40 percent of the businesses receiving loans from the eda were in default 40 percent almost half in default this is an agency that is supposed to promote economic growth not deflate it let us protect jobs let us save communities let us save money for the federal government at a time of a money crunch and tight times let us eliminate the eda"]]}
