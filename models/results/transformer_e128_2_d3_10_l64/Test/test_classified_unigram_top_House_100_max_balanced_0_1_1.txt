thoughtful consideration and care that he has shown to all of us but particularly to sala during the last several difficult months i have only been in this congress a relatively short period of time i am beginning my fifth year yet i cannot help but reflect that after one of the first weekends that my wife and i left town in our first term we came back to washington and saw a flag at halfmast and did not know why the flag was at halfmast and were shocked and deeply saddened to learn that it was as a result of the passing of one of the giants in politics and in legislative activity not just from california but from the country phil burton and today as i came into the office i saw the flags at halfmast again and was again very saddened to realize that these flags were flying at halfmast for the other half of that wonderful extraordinary team sala burton so much has already been said and there is little that i can add to the eloquence and touching comments of so many of my colleagues both phil and sala meant an extraordinary amount as is evident from what we have already heard and as we are reminded in so many respects almost on a daily basis i on a personal note could not help last night but reflect during the few minutes that i happened to watch the end of the very impressive show about lbj i thought i was watching phil burton as the man who played lbj demonstrated such an extraordinary ability to influence individuals and such an extraordinary grasp of the legislative process since phil burtons death i have thought so often about the legacy that he has left and so many of us have been touched so personally and so deeply by the fact that sala in her own way has not only continued that legacy but has added in her own personal thoughtful caring fashion a very very personal touch to the lives of so many of us and to the legislative activities in this chamber sala had a visceral opposition to discrimination sala had a visceral concern for people in need sala had a visceral commitment to try to help those in this country and frankly around the globe who needed help and who needed assistance from the public sector sala knew in her own mind what was right she did not have to carefully thoughtfully methodically analyze and weigh issues in terms of where she was going to come out she knew she knew what was right and she fought for what was right she cared as deeply as any individual that i have known about people about people that she knew and about people that she would never know as others have indicated she was such an important influence on each of us as apparently was the case with so many of my colleagues and i who find it fascinating listening today to how many people sala expressed so beautifully a concern not just about them but about their families sala would always in her relations with me first ask me how jan was and how the kids were and it was something that sala cared very deeply about jan and i used to participate with sala periodically in a study group and sala would attend that group religiously not because it would provide sala with any political benefit or not because it provided sala with any significant legislative opportunities but because it gave sala an opportunity to participate in something that enriched her life personally and gave sala an opportunity to share with others of us who cared so much about her her own experiences and her own personal concerns so on a family level on a personal level on a legislative level it is going to be extraordinarily different around here with sala not being here physically but as others have mentioned the legacy that sala leaves the inspiration that sala provided the importance that sala had for each of us in her own way is something that has enriched all of our lives so significantly that we are all and i certainly am the better for having had the privilege of knowing sala burton and considering her a very very close friend i know that i am speaking for jan when i express my condolences to salas family and say on behalf of so many of us that sala has made san francisco the country this legislative body and all of our lives much richer than we would

courageous behavior in the face of riot police hunger fear and the burdens placed on their loved ones the workers who walked out of the shipyards held their heads high and did not back down from their demands for the legalization of the solidarity labor unionthe only way in which the polish government can achieve anything resembling true economic reform in poland on the surface polish workers on strike at nowa huta gdansk and in other areas of the country were protesting huge price increases that would further impoverish them without changing the way in which the economy is ordered according to an article in yesterdays wall street journal polands gross national product stands at about its 1978 level while real per capita income is only 78 percent of what it was 10 years ago solidarity economists have reported that between 2533 percent of poles now live below the poverty line half of all polish workers die before reaching retirement age giving the country the highest mortality rate for workers in all of europe the wait for an apartment can take as long as 50 years health care is in a disgraceful stateneeded medicines cannot be obtained diagnostic equipment is obsolete or not available at all and the environment is in such sad shape that a new grassroots social organizationthe freedom and peace movementhas devoted itself almost exclusively to this vital issue and has seen its membership swell in recent years all of these problems point to the failure of the polish government to implement an economic reform package able to meet the needs of the polish people the workers rose up in protest not just because of price increases but because true economic reform cannot take place without real political reform as solidarity chairman lech walesa has said reform must be based on the citizens natural right to economic initiatives and interprises and this can only come about if the citizens of poland are given the right to form their own trade unions to join other organizations not dominated by the government and to work toward institutional guarantees which will ensure a pluralistic society what gave me a great deal of hope for the situation in poland was the youth of the workers that struck at gdansk most were too young to appreciate the events leading up to legalization of solidarity in 1980 and yet these were the very workers who were chanting no freedom without solidarity and often appeared to be more militant than their elders who had experienced labor unrest in the past on monday it was these young workers who refused to accept a compromise that was largely agreed to by the strike committee only when the prospect of a police attack looked imminent did these young men agree with their older leaders to leave the shipyard the reverend henryk jankowski pastor of the nearby st brygldas church called them wonderful young men who he could not allow to be beaten i want to conmend our president for speaking out and condemning the use of force against the workers it was statements like these which made the polish government think twice about doing at gdansk what was done at nowa huta i sincerely hope the president will continue to watch the situation closely in poland prominent solidarity activists like bodgan lis and wladislaw frasyniuk still remain in jail and the polish government may still take retribution against those who took part in the strike far from being a failure the strikes in poland represented in the words of chairman walesa a new spring for solidarity they reaffirm the demand for workers in a supposedly worker state to have a voice in the management of their factoriesto have a say in the vital matters which affect them i agree with walesa that nothing has ended and that nothing has been finished the end of the strike was certainly no victory for the government the reform policy of the government cannot possibly succeed without the consent of the people of polandand in large part this means the

were safety belts have proven the difference between life and death according to the national highway traffic safety administration the probability of being involved in a motor vehicle injury accident during a 75year lifetime is better than 86 percent nhtsa also has provided some startling facts about automobile related fatalities and injuries approximately 3 528 000 people were injured in traffic injuries in 1985 there were 23 192 passenger car fatalities and 5 763 light truck fatalities in 1985 on average one life is lost every 12 minutes in traffic accidents in 1985 91 percent of the occupants o killed in auto accidents were not wearing their safety belts unrestrained automobile occupants were 40 percent more likely to be injured in an auto accident and twice as likely to require hospitalization as restrained occupants the facts on the record demonstrate that safety belts save lives and prevent injuries in the past few years more than half our nations state legislatures have made substantial process in enacting mandatory seatbelt use laws since 1984 29 states and the district of columbia have enacted mandatory safety belt use laws each of these laws has the objective of reducing deaths and injuries in motor vehicle crashes the fact is that virtually every study produced on the effects of increased belt use indicates that lap and shoulder safety belts can reduce the risk of fatal or serious injury by between 45 and 55 percent these laws work safety belt use has dramatically increased currently safety belt use in states that have enacted belt use laws averages about 45 percent ranging from 78 percent in north carolina to 23 percent in kansas the unitedstates department of transportations center for statistics and analysis has documented the success of increased safety belt use in terms of lives saved and injuries prevented among front seat passenger vehicle occupants safety belts saved about 2 200 lives in 19861 750 in states with belt use laws among front seat passenger vehicle occupants safety belts prevented about 25 000 moderate to critical injuries in 1986 20 000 in states with belt use laws at the current use level in belt law states45 percentbelts would have saved 3 100 lives if all states had belt laws in 1986 at the high use levels achieved in some other countries85 percentbelts could have saved 10 000 lives if all states had belt laws in 1986 the national highway traffic safety administration also indicates that safety belt use has dramatically increased since 1982 nhtsas yearly national safety belt use survey of 19 cities has documented a safety belt use rate increase from 11 percent in 1982 to 42 percent in the first half of 1987 an interesting fact in this survey was that among the seven cities without belt laws belt use was only 27 percent among the 12 cities with belt laws in effect belt use was 51 percent an important aspect of safety belt use that cannot be overlooked is child safety seats in passenger vehicles these statistics are worth looking at the national center for statistics and analysis reports that among children under 4 child seats saved about 200 lives in 1986 with 100 percent correct use child seats could save about 500 lives per year child seat use among children 4 and under in the 19 cities survey was 72 percent in 1986 it goes without saying that one of the most important aspects of educating the public about the advantages of increased safety belt and child restraint use is the active involvement of the many law enforcement educational industrial state medical consumer insurance and safety organizations in promoting this sound policy objective all too often the efforts of these organizations and individuals go unnoticed their wide range of support for national safety belt use day and other activities associated with vehicle safety programs is testimony to the national recognition of the critical importance of safety belt use the good work of

that the gentleman has shown over the years in this issue yes as we all can see if we will allow our eyes and ears and our minds to see another year has come and gone and the cypriot problem persists with no solution to be had it was the early morning hours of july 20 1974 that turkish paratroopers began descending on the island republic on the pretext that they were undertaking a peace operation intended to protect the turkish cypriot minority in the wake of the political turmoil then enveloping the country this socalled peace operation however was codenamed attila and was effectively an unlawful invasion and occupation of an independent country in violation of every tenet of international law custom and behavior the fact is that attila was not a peace operation at all it was an operation undertaken in order to achieve the partitionist plans of the turkish and turkishcypriot people it was indeed successful in meeting that goal for attila and attila ii on august 14 1974 effectively took over almost 40 percent of the territory of the republic while killing thousands of greek cypriots raping others uprooting 200 000 of them from their homes and looting and stealing from the homes and churches that they were forced to leave behind to make matters worse not only were these atrocities carried out but they were carried out with the use of supplies and equipment provided turkey by the united statesin violation of the unitedstates foreign assistance act of 1962 which authorizes the use of american aid solely for defensive purposes thirteen years have passed since that time and the years have seen several initiatives undertaken toward a solution a solution however has not been attained the reason is not that one is unattainable rather the sad reason for the stalemate is that turkey and the turkish cypriots have not negotiated toward a solution in good faith and have in fact taken a series of steps intended to achieve the permanent partion of the republic of cyprus turkey and the turkishcypriot leadership in direct violation of relevant u n resolutions have indeed taken a series of actions subsequent to the 1974 invastion which are aimed at consolidating the occupation and division of the small mediterranean republic facts speak louder than words so i will cite the evidence first and foremost turkey refused and to date still refuses to comply with international requests and pertinent u n resolutions to remove its occupation troops from the republic of cyprus to add insult to injury not only do they refuse to withdraw their troops but turkey has recently begun a military buildup on cyprus in both manpower and equipment to where today there are an estimated 34 000 to 35 000 turkish troops on cyprus with the number of tanks having more than doubled for a total of over 300 furthermore in an effort to further consolidate their illegal presence on the island turkey has moved in more than 60 000 mainland settlers who are threatening to turn the turkish cypriots themselves into a minority while occupying the homes and properties that the greekcypriots were forced to leave behind when they were turned into refugees in their own land in addition turkey and the turkish cypriot leadership is subjecting the greek cypriots to further indignity by systematically and intentionally destroying the christian and hellenic cultural heritage in the turkish occupied part of the island yes the greek cypriots have since the landing of the mainland troops and to this day been subjected to the pillaging theft and destruction of the artifacts and works of art that tell the story of their identity they have seen their ancient churches used as stables and warehouses they have seen their icons and other works of religious art stolen and they have seen their hellenic antiquities sold to private collectors throughout the world in order no doubt to systematically remove any trace of the cultural heritage which represents the national identity of the occupied areas as if these facts were not enough the partitionist aims of the turkish and turkishcypriot leadership were made crystal clear to the world when as recently as november 15 1983 they undertook an attempt to create a new turkish political entity in occupied cyprus yes they declared the northern occupied part of cyprus to be an independent country and called this pseudostate the turkish republic of northern cyprus fortunately law and logic prevailed and the international community almost unanimously withheld their recognition of the pseudostate and criticized the action i say almost unanimously withheld for the one exception and i underline one exception was turkey for turkey was the only country in the world community to grant its recognition to this illegal entity how i ask can turkey possibly pretend that they want and work toward the return of peace and unity to the republic of cyprus when they are a party to such destructive actions to the process how can they pretend to want to work with the u n secretarygeneral to find a workable solution to the situation when they ignore his expressions of concern as well as those of the united states over the military buildup on cyprus that turkey is engaging in by replying as turkish foreign minister halefoglu did on june 6 1987 that the evidence is ridiculous and untrue and that turkey does not have to answer to anyone on the number of troops and military equipment it has on cyprus i declare that turkey does have to answer for its actions and further i maintain that they should answer to the people of the united states it is the united states after all as i said earlier that supplies and equips turkey with hundreds of millions of dollars worth of foreign aid each year and it is the united states that they are giving a slap in the face to when they knowingly and intentionally fail to comply with the restrictions we place on that assistance the unitedstates congress is on record with its sound conviction that there can be no resolution of the cyprus conflict unless and until the turkish troops are removed from the island rather than comply however turkey laughs in our faces and increases its military presence there and does so with no less than united states origin equipment even while both the house foreign affairs committee and the senate foreign relations committee report out legislation prohibiting the continued use of united states origin military equipment by the 35 000 illegal turkish occupation forces on cyprus congress position on the cyprus issue is clear both the house foreign affairs committee and the senate foreign relations committee have reported out legislation that would prohibit the continued use of united states origin military equipment by the 35 000 illegal turkish occupation forces on cyprus in the senate the foreign aid authorization bill contains the pell amendment prohibiting the transshipment of united statessupplied military equipment from turkey to cyprus in the house the foreign aid bill contains language broomfieldyatronsnowe amendment prohibiting the transshipment of united statessupplied arms from either turkey or greece to cyprus both bills also maintain the traditional 7 10 funding ratio between greece and turkey this legislation is anything but a radical approach to this critical problem instead it merely clarifies the intent of congress as expressed in the foreign assistance act i strongly support this legislation because i believe it would be repugnant to the rule of law that we talked about here earlier when the gentleman from california had his special order which is recognized in our constitution for the united states to support in a direct or indirect way this illegal occupation and division of cyprus i take this opportunity to ask my colleagues to likewise support this necessary legislation to make matters worse turkey has the unmitigated gall to inform the state department that it is reconsidering implementing the alreadyagreed to extension of our base rights agreement because of all things congress attitude on the cyprus issue heaven help us i think that the united states and we as legislators have been more than patient and have tolerated an intolerable situation more than long enough i believe that it is now time to implement action in order to force turkey to cease the actions that are preventing an appropriate resolution to the cypriot problem despite our security interests in a strong security interest in a strong relationship with turkey and god knows they are there and those of us who care about america are concerned with the fact that turkey is in a very strategic position as is the country of greece and as is the independent republic of cyprus we must no longer tolerate such intransigence by the leadership in ankara without strong united opposition by the united states to turkish efforts to ensure the permanent partition of cyprus we cannot expect peace to be achieved in that country in the near future cyprus has always been a good friend to the united states and we should do whatever we can to help bring about a just solution cyprus is after all not only strategically important to the peace of the region but it has proven itself time and again to be a good friend and ally of the united states it was for example cyprus not turkey that allowed the united states the use of its facilities to carry supplies to our dying marines in lebanonturkey refused it has furthermore offered us its unrestrictive assistance after the bombing of the marine barracks in beirut in 1983 the bombing of our embassy in beirut in 1984 and during the highjacking of twa flight 847 in 1985 and while we are at it it was the greeks who fought and died heroically in world war ii while turkey chose neutrality and though it is little known it was 38 greeks who joined 6 unitedstates marines to win a military victory in 1805 on the shores of tripoli the same victory i might add that is immortalized in the marine hymn from the halls of montezuma to the shores of tripoli and i ask what has turkey contributed to the security of the west that is an open question turkey for example during the 1973 middle east war granted moscow overflight rights and overland passage rights to resupply syria and egypt while refusing united states overflights rights to resupply israel and among other questionable acts allowed soviet aircraft carriers passage through the dardanelles in violation of the montreux convention of 1936 and over nato objections we as legislators and we as americans must therefore do all in our power to bring about a just and lasting solution to the cypriot issue we must condition aid to turkey on her genuine efforts to reach just such a solution and we must push to see that this solution meets certain minimum conditions of acceptability including first the immediate withdrawal of all turkish occupation forces and colonists from cyprus second the immediate return of all occupied areas to the republic of cyprus under u n auspices for the immediate resettlement of the 200 000 greek cypriot refugees third an agreement by turkey and the turkishcypriots to a constitutional arrangement based on the universally accepted democratic principle of majority rule with full minority rights guaranteed as well as freedom of movement settlement and ownership anywhere in cyprus after all should there be a green line there i think not fourth an agreement by turkey to full cooperation with the international red cross regarding investigation of the five abducted americans and the 1 614 missing greek cypriots i might add that this factor in the cypriot issue has unfortunately not received as much international attention and concern as it might have and rightfully deserves the fact is that much like the americans missing in vietnam 1 619 individuals including 5 americans have been missing since the turkish invasion of cyprus clearly any fair and appropriate resolution of the issue must fully and adequately address the fate of these unfortunate victims and their families and so in closing i say on behalf of all three nations over there on behalf of american security and american interests in that entire area let us all work in earnest to return peace and unity to the republic of cyprus the cards are

motors could result in both higher quality motors and lower costs of those motors to the government in addition to the cost benefits to the government a second source could assure nasa of a continuing supply of motors if the first supplier for any reason should be unable to deliver the number of motors necessary in the case of solid rocket motors the same company has supplied motors for the space

did not mature the lands hired a veterinarian who conducted water and diet tests on the cattle and concluded the sickness was caused by poison in the water during the 1970s the army denied responsibility indicating that the contamination was not emanating from rma on october 6 1976 the army sent a letter regarding mr lands claims to the lands attorney samuel l mcclaren the army

the continuing decline of our doemstic oil industry a standstill in the exploration of new wells and the inability of domestic wells to compete with cheaper world oil have devastated the industry we have enjoyed the recent days of inexpensive oil but we must realize that the future will be different we must plan for those times now by developing an energy policy which prepares us for the time of greater dependency upon oil imported as well as higher prices for it"], [0.0006744265556335449, 0.5006744265556335, 0, "i thank the gentleman for yielding i want to make a statement and see if the gentleman would agree with me i do not see any necessary inconsistency with the kyl amendment and the gentlewomans amendment she is suggesting that before we develop a budget for the defense of this country we have to plan for how to pay for it the gentleman from arizona is saying that we should have a steady sustained but moderate growth from year to year so the two are not necessarily inconsistent but my problem is that you are selecting one important sensitive budget that must be determined by global developments over which we have no control and you are saying that program we must find out how to pay for it pay as we go if you apply that theory across the board you would have a balanced budget amendmkient what you are saying is what goes out must come in and they must be balanced so i assume if we are to be consistent we should apply this theory of pay as you go to the farm program to foreign aid to welfare you are opting for the balanced budget amendment so i hope

colleagues will pay some attention to what i say yes we are living well interest rates are down employment is up everything is fine it is no problem living on borrowed money the trouble is we are borrowing it from our children and our grandchildren that is the legacy of the reagan administration sure everything is fine we are doing real well none of us have ever lived better but who is going to pay the bill the poor people that are saddled with that increase in the budget deficit the debt that is subject to regulation of 1 3 trillion all that the reagan administration has done for all of

amendment some amendments killiwith a stiletto other amendments kill with a meat ax this is a meatax amendment i want to say to the gentleman from ohio my good friend that i share the concern which the gentleman so eloquently expressed about the cuts and a lot of the domestic programs which are so important for the future of our country i certainly hope that ways can be found to avoid some of those reductions but i do not think that this is the way to solve that problem and even if this amendment were to be adopted most of the cuts the gentleman referred to to the domestic programs would take place anyway what would the gentlemans amendment mean for our ability to provide vitally important assistance to a whole slew of strategically important countries around the world the amendment before the members offered by the gentleman from ohio would have the effect of cutting by 20 percent the level of economic security assistance provided for in this bill but in reality the actual reductions it would require among those countries to which it would be applied would be substantially greater the reason for that is that the committee bill earmarks the esf assistance contained in the legislation for israel egypt and the philippines consequently the cuts called for in this amendment would not apply to any of those countries they would have to be applied to the rest of the countries which receive esf assistance whose funds are not earmarked when this cut of roughly 800 million is applied to the countries that are not protected it would result in a cut of close to twothirds in the overall level of esf assistance to those other countries what countries are we talking about we are talking about for example turkey which is the key to the viability of the southern flank of nato a nation which has the largest land border of any country in the atlantic alliance with the soviet union we are talking about substantial cuts in the level of our assistance to spain which recently joined nato and with respect to which we now have very delicate negotiations under way to renew our base agreement in that country we are talking about cuts in the level of our assistance to pakistan i have other problems with pakistan and i hope we will be able to address those problems on the floor a little bit be advised that my amendment still tries in our own hemisphere as as al later on tin the year would heave n 2 7 billion per y ear for ready been pointed tout esf assigtif we can solve our problems with economicsupport amuds ance for the carabbean including pakistan in terms of their muclear thid t does not cut 80n0 million it haiti and granada and for south weapons p rogram there is no question specifically cuts 67 million the type america would p robably be zeroed ou we ought to be providing assistance to of cuts that we should be making rea completely them they are standing up in a stal cuts the gentleman from new york said wart fashion

this amendment would require a town where i found tout what a tigh be substantial cut in the level of tid to regard the gentlemans constituents little or no esf pwould be available pakistan and also require reductions have for him for africa including the milftary in the level of our assistance to el sal i suspect after this amendment they access countries and smaller programs vador and costa

that and america it is not a play on words some of us and again the gentleman it surely cannot be in the interests mr solar i am not making light from new york mr oari bhas been of the united states for the democrat tof your concerns i share those con heavily involved in this as i believe i ically ielected governments of central cerns have have been very active in trying america to be utterly unable to xe i would like to see the revenue to project a better image and a strong spond to the egitimate social and eco sharing program resumed but i know presence for the united staxtes in the nomic needs of their people wery well that if this amendment is south pacific we do not spend much if they are unable to respond to adopted it will not do one ithing to money there and we are not going to those needs then the objective pros resume or resuscitate tevenue sharing under this bill but a little bit goes a pects for the emergence of viable com mr trafcant maybe it willhelp long ways but withdrawal of that munist insurgencies in these countries us from going bankrupt because little bit will go a long ways too a will increase so i say to the members america banktupt will not have
