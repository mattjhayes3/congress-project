united states supreme court since then every foundation of this nation has been stained by the blood of more than 55 million of its own unborn children incomprehensibly those who have profited from it most have hailed it as freedom we should all remember the words of president abraham lincoln when he said those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves and under a just god cannot long retain it mr lincoln called upon all of us to remember americas founding fathers and their enlightened belief that nothing stamped with the divine image and likeness was sent into the world to be trodden on or degraded and imbruted by its fellows he reminded those he called posterity that when in the distant future some man some factions some interests should set up a doctrine that some were not entitled to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that their posterity that is us mr speakerthat their posterity might look up again to the declaration of independence and take courage to renew the battle which their fathers began for the sake of all of those who founded this nation and dreamed of what america could someday be and for the sake of all of those since then who have died in darkness so america could walk in the light of freedom it is so very important that those of us who are privileged to be members of the united states congress pause from time to time and remind ourselves of why we are really all here thomas jefferson whose words marked the beginning of this nation said the care of human life and its happiness and not its destruction is the chief and only object of good government the phrase in the fifth amendment capsulizes our entire constitution it says that no person shall be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law the 14th amendment says no state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws protecting the lives of all americans and their constitutional rights is why we are all here yet today a great shadow looms over america when authorities entered the clinic of dr kermit gosnell they found a torture chamber for little babies that defies description within the constraints of the english language according to the grand jury report dr kermit gosnell had a simple solution for unwanted babies he killed them he didnt call it that he called it ensuring fetal demise the way he ensured fetal demise was by sticking scissors in the back of the babys neck and cutting the spinal cord he called it snipping over the years there were hundreds of snippings ashley baldwin one of dr gosnells employees said she saw babies breathing and she defined one as 2 feet long that no longer had eyes or a mouth but in her words was making like this screeching noise and it sounded like a little alien for gods sake is this who we truly are kermit gosnell now rightfully sits in prison for killing a mother and murdering innocent children like the one i just described yet if he had killed these babies only 5 minutes earlier and before they had passed through the birth canal it would have all been perfectly legal in much of the united states of america if there is one thing that we must not miss about this unspeakably evil episode it is that kermit gosnell is not an anomaly he is just the visible face of this lucrative enterprise of murdering paincapable unborn children in america more than 18 000 very lateterm abortions are occurring in america every year placing the mothers at exponentially greater risk and subjecting their paincapable unborn babies to torture and death without anesthesia it is the greatest atrocity in the united states according to the bartlett study a woman seeking an abortion at 20 weeks is 35 times more likely to die from an abortion than she was in the first trimester at 21 weeks or more she is 91 times more likely to die than she was in the first trimester regardless of how supporters of abortion on demand might try to suppress it it is undisputed and universally accepted by every credible expert that the risk to a mothers health from abortion increases as gestation increases there is no valid debate on that incontrovertible reality yet supporters of abortion on demand try to suppress that they also have tried for decades to deny that unborn babies ever feel pain even those at the beginning of the sixth month of pregnancy as if somehow the ability to feel pain magically develops the very second the child is born almost every other major civilized nation on this earth protects paincapable unborn babies at this age and every credible poll of the american people shows that they are overwhelmingly in favor of protecting these children yet we have given these little babies less legal protection from unnecessary pain and cruelty than the protection we have given farm animals under the federal humane slaughter act it is a tragedy that beggars my ability to articulate but i would submit to you that the winds of change are beginning to blow and that the tide of blindness and blood is finally turning in america because tomorrow we will vote on the paincapable unborn child protection act in this chamber and it will be a vote that every one of us will always remember and for which we shall be held accountable and no matter how it is shouted down or what distortions deceptive whatifs distractions diversions gotchas twisted words changing the subject or blatant falsehoods the abortion industry hurls at this bill and its supporters it remains a deeply sincere effort beginning at their sixth month of pregnancy to protect both mothers and their paincapable unborn babies from the atrocity of lateterm abortion on demand and ultimately it is one all humane americans can support if they truly understand it for themselves not long ago i heard barack obama speak very noble and poignant words that whether he realizes it or not apply so profoundly to this subject let me quote if you will excerpted portions of his comments he said this is our first task caring for our children its our first job if we dont get that right we dont get anything right thats how as a society we will be judged the president asked are we really prepared to say that were powerless in the face of such carnage that the politics are too hard are we prepared to say that such violence visited on our children year after year after year is somehow the price of our freedom the president also said our journey is not complete until all our children are cared for and cherished and always safe from harm that is our generations taskto make these words these rights these values of life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness real for every american never have i so deeply agreed with any words ever spoken by president obama as those i have just quoted how i wish that somehow we could all open our hearts and our ears to these incontrovertible words and ask ourselves in the core of our souls why these words that should apply to all children cannot include the most helpless and vulnerable of all children how does any child become more vulnerable than these little paincapable unborn babies it seems that we are never quite so eloquent as when we decry the crimes of a past generation and we are never quite so staggeringly blind as when we assess an atrocity in our own time what we are doing to these babies is real and all of us here know that in our hearts medical science regarding the development of unborn babies beginning at the sixth month of pregnancy now demonstrates irrefutably that they do in fact feel pain many of them cry and scream as they die but because it is amniotic fluid going over the vocal cords instead of air we cant hear them it is the greatest human rights atrocity in the united states of america today i began and i close with the wise counsel from abraham lincoln to all of us he said fellow citizens we cannot escape history we of this congress and this administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves no personal significance or insignificance can spare one or another of us the fiery trial through which we pass will light us down in honor or dishonor to the last generation it is time to open our eyes and our souls and recognize that protecting paincapable unborn children and their mothers is not a republican issue or a democrat issue it is a test of our basic humanity and who we are as a human family it is time to open our eyes and allow our consciences to catch up with our technology it is time for members of the united states congress to open our eyes and recognize that protecting those who cannot protect themselves is why we are all here and it is time for all americans to open our eyes and our hearts to the humanity of these little unborn children of god and the inhumanity of what is being done to them i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.001779229729436338, 0.001779229729436338, 0, "i want to thank my good friend and colleague keith rothfus for his tremendous leadership on protecting the weakest and the most vulnerable among us including the unborn and their mothers who are at risk of violence perpetrated by abortion and for his dedication to protecting conscience rights again the subject of todays special order next week the court will hear oral argument on a landmark case for religious liberty the impact of the courts ruling in this case cannot be overstated but the question before the court is really quite simple can the government coerce the little sisters of the poor and other people of faith to violate their conscience the obama administration is telling these religious sisters women who have given their life in service to god by taking care of the elderly poor that their conscience is irrelevant and that they must follow the federal governments conscience rather than their own this abuse of government power is absolutely antithetical to the american principle of freedom of religion and the first amendment unless reversed obamas attack on conscience rights means that government can impose discrimination against americans who seek to live according to their faith the little sisters have 30 homes for the elderly across the united states each little sister takes a vow of obedience to god and of hospitality to care for the aged as if they were christ himself and they wear religious habits as a sign to others of gods presence in the world yet the obama administration is dictating to the little sisters and others about how they should interpret their own religious beliefs that in a word is outrageous the sisters object to having their healthcare plans used to funnel drugs and devices that they have a moral objection to including drugs that could even destroy a young human life the sisters say that facilitating the provision of these items is a violation of their religious beliefs and the government is saying no it isnt we know better than you under the obama administrations coercive mandate the little sisters and other religious organizations like priests for life and geneva college are put in the impossible situation of being forced to violate their religious beliefs or face obamaimposed crippling fines of 100 per day per employee in the case of the little sisters that would mean about 70 million per year this obscene penalty is completely unfair unreasonable and unconscionable the obama administration is saying we will punish you we will hurt you we will stop you from serving unless you provide health care according to the governments conscience not your own president obama has no business imposing his morality on people of faith but that is exactly what this oppressive mandate does lets make no mistake about it this mandate is very much obamas willful intention the imposition of this attack on religious freedom is no accident it comes straight from the pages of obamacare in december of 2009 in the runup to passage of obamacare senator mikulski offered an amendment which provided the authorizing language for this oppressive mandate and some including senator casey rigorously supported senator mikulskis amendment when president obama spoke in 2009 at notre dame universitywhich i would say parenthetically has also filed suit over the mandatehe spoke about drafting a sensible conscience clause yet today protection of conscience is another highly visible broken promise of obamacare the supreme court has a duty to protect the right of the little sisters of the poor and others to live according to their conscience to ensure that they serve the elderly poor according to their conscience again i thank mr rothfus for his leadership"], [0.0017913132905960083, 0.0017913132905960083, 0, "there are a lot of important issues before the house this week but i wanted to take an opportunity to raise an issue that we have been working on in our office for quite some time we as a body will be faced with an opportunity hopefully to resolve this issue here shortly in the next few months and that is the issue of the social security disability insurance trust fund not a lot of people are awareand i just read the social security trustees report over the summerthat the disability trust fund goes insolvent in 2016 that means millions of americans who rely on social security disability benefits are looking at a situation where their benefits are going to be cut 20 percent because of the insolvency of the social security trust fund2016 that is right around the corner when i raised this issue 2 years ago with the white house with jack lewour treasury secretaryin our committee on ways and means hearing i asked him 2 years ago what is the plan what is the solution to this problem what i was ultimately told was this is what we are going to do we are just going to take money from the social security retirement fund and move it over to the disability trust fund and bail it out well in my private life in business i knew a lot of businessowners and what that essentially was it is robbing peter to pay paul because the social security retirement fund is on a path to insolvency just a few short years down the road i said we could do better that is why i was glad to join with my colleague sam johnson who chairs the subcommittee on social security here in washington to change the rules to make sure that that solution would not be the one that we follow here in 2015 and 2016 we can do better you know why we can do better it is because we care we care about the people that are in the disability trust fund and we need to listen to those people this is what their experience is with the disability trust fund today they are frustrated it is a bureaucracy it is a mess we have overpayments we have fraudulent payments we have a system that penalizes people returning to work rather than trying to incentivize them and stand with them when they return to work we had an individual by the name of mike zelly come before the committee and testify to us and he is in the disability trust fund he was in a horrific automobile accident 36 years ago and has been in a wheelchair ever since these are the people we should listen to these are the people that know the disability trust fund the best what his testimony to us was he says we should seize this opportunity to fix this problem take care of the bureaucracy make sure the overpayments dont occur because when an overpayment occurs to a disability recipient guess who has to pay it back it is the disability recipient because of the social security administrations incompetence that is not right that is not fair most importantly what he talked about in his 36 years in the disability trust fund is that when he tried to return to work he was faced with obstacle after obstacle of a bureaucracy that said if you do that you will lose your benefit that is not right mike zelly offered ideas on how we can improve the system to streamline this bureaucracy this is the process someone in the social security disability trust fund has to go through in order to try to go back to work we need to simplify it and we need to stand with the american work ethic for the people in the disability trust fund that want to return to work there was a recent brookings institution report that came across my desk that i read there was 40 percent return on the beneficiaries in the disability trust fund that indicated they would like to return to work but because of the bureaucracy there was fear there was a sense that if they did that they would lose their benefit and they just couldnt risk it that is why we are offering commonsense reforms here out of our office out of the committee on ways and means out of this house hopefully shortly so that what we can do is make sure that those disability trust fund recipients dont look at a 20 percent cut in 2016 we will hold them harmless and we will make sure we do what is necessary in order to make sure that our obligations and promises under the disability trust fund are met to those individuals because that is the right thing to do we cannot lose this opportunity to modernize the social security disability trust fund to make sure that we stand with those that want to return to work and believe in the american work ethic like we do i ask my colleagues to join with us on a bipartisan basis and there has been an indication of bipartisan work that we have been able to show here in the initial conversations lets modernize the disability trust fund lets cure the waste fraud and abuse but most importantly lets stand with the individuals like mike zelly who want to return to work because it gives him dignity and it gives him a sense that he is contributing rather than being in any way a burden on the system"], [0.0017996723763644695, 0.0017996723763644695, 0, "i am going to set up here in a second i am going to actually walk through something we have been working on in our office now for the last month and that is what is really going on in budget numbers we did a budget town hall about 2 weeks ago in scottsdale and i always like to start it with a simple question that says how many of you are tired of seeing us in congress fight with each other and the hands always go up and they say yes you have to stop fighting with each other and i always try to make the point it is about the money you need to understand how bad the underlying financial data is and what is really going on in the scale of debt and deficits and just the sheer scale of spending but also where that spending is going because we have so many of my brothers and sisters here we go out and campaign and say things like we are going to take care of waste and fraud we are going to take care of this and foreign aid we are going to do this and that and they are not providing an honest picture of where the money is and where it actually goes so we are going to do about 10 of these boards i know it is going to get technical when you run for congress one of the first things that happens if you are a numbers guy the pollster and the consultants sit you down and say you cant use big numbers people wont understand them in this presentation i am going to treat everyone like adultsthese arent republican numbers they are not even democrat numbers though the majority of these slides actually do come from the white houseto understand what is actually underlying in the data and how quickly it is eroding two points of reference for decades we used to talk about how we were going to hit this inflection point when baby boomers began moving into retirement and what was going to happen to the debt curve and what was going to happen to the curve of consumption of the entitlements guess what we are now well into that inflection point it has begun and congress has done very very very little in regards to mandatory spending you are going to see on these boards that that is actually what may take us down as a republic so this is 2010 lets just do this as a reference and remember 2010 was a year when there was still lots of stimulus money lots of other spending out there you see the blue the blue is what we refer to as mandatory spending it is primarily social security medicare medicaid some transfer programs interest veterans and the new health care law okay in 2010 about 63 percent of our spending was in that blue area 37 percent was what we call discretionary that is what we get to vote on here because what is in the blue is in formulas i have been here a little over 4 years i have really had absolutely no influence on that blue area it is a formula you hit a certain age you get a certain benefit but i want you to watch what is happening in that entitlement in that mandatory spending and yes this is the very discussion that gets people unelected because people get very upset but we have to have an adult conversation of what is really going on here so we are going to do a couple of these slides just to sort of create a reference here is where we are this year and you remember on that slide i think the blue area was about 63 percent of our total spending this year it is 69 percent of our total spending and obviously then the discretionary what we get to vote on as members has now gone down to 31 percent do you notice the movement and that is just in the last 5 years so where are we going well right now to give you a different way of looking at this this is our 2015 modeling from the white house this green area is our revenues that is the total revenues coming into your federal government that purple area is our debt that is what we are going to borrow this year to make up for our shortfalls though you will be happy to know that as of about 48 hours ago the administration changed the debt number from 576 billion for the 2015 fiscal year tonow it is going to be 582 5 billion this continues to erode we are going to talk about that at the end here what is actually going on in gdp on economic growth in this country and if we do not develop a growthoriented agenda we cant meet our obligations we cannot keep those promises we have made and with that i stand here in shock of how often we engage in these debates and it is not a growthoriented focus so one thing on this slide i really want you to get blue over here is mandatory spending the red is discretionary with defense defense is considered discretionary we have to borrow either every dime of defense or every dime of everything else other than defense and mandatory or discretionarysocial security medicare medicaid interest on the debt veterans benefits and the new health care law we have to borrow either every dime of defense or every dime of discretionary other than defense and that is in this years budget that is how quickly this is moving away from us so what happens if we look way off into the future like 4 years from now 2020 is only 4 years from now when i first got elected in 2011 i did a presentation here the numbers i am going to show you that happen in 4 years were not supposed to happen until 9 years from now this is to give you an idea of how quickly the numbers are eroding yet i hear almost no one talking about it so we are going to be working on that budget in 4 years do you remember that 2010 slide sixtythree percent of our spending went to medicare medicaid social security interest on the debt veterans benefits and the new healthcare law well it is going to be 76 percent76three quarters of all of our spending we are only going to be voting on 24 percent of the budget and half of that will be defense i dont know if anyone knows because these numbers are small and it is hard to watch what we will be spending in 2020 on discretionary so defense and all the litany of programs you think of are basically going to be almost identical to what we were spending 10 years earlier i will hold that up as one of the successes of the republican house we have been very disciplined on spending on what we had the ability to influence which was the discretionary budget but the formulaic portion of our budget entitlements continues to explode it is almost as if washington d c did not know that there was a baby boom did not know people were going to be turning 65 did not know that 76 million of our brothers and sisters were born in about an 18year period of time and now we are into the third year of baby boomers beginning to retire and that inflection has begun so just as a reference because i often get asked for this slideand we are putting these slides up on our web sitethere is the spending pie chart for this year you will see the blue area is all the way to here social security medicare medicaid the transfer programs also including the new healthcare law interest on the debt veterans benefits two weeks ago when we were doing a budget presentation in my hometown of scottsdale phoenix i had one woman who was absolutely positive if we would cut foreign aid we would be just fine here it is important to understand do you see this little red area here foreign aid would be ultimately nothing but a small sliver within that yes it is something but in many ways it is theater if you have a politician standing in front of you and they are not talking about the mandatory spending and the speed of its growth you are not having an honest budget discussion it is hard because in many places around the country when you stand behind a microphone and hold up these boards and start to say that we need to have an honest conversation about the math underlying medicare medicaid social security and what is going to happen on interest on the debt the new healthcare law and its cost projections blowing through the ceiling and veterans benefits often those members who have tried to have that conversation get unelected but if you have someone walk in to our door here and say david we so desperately need new spending on this we often pull out our charts and say you are absolutely right this would be wonderful do you have a solution to help me refine and deal with and manage the explosion of the cost in medicare and they just stare at you like we are not allowed to talk about that but that is what is going on here so lets do another slide to just sort of see how the numbers really are exploding if i came to you and said hey in 4 years that 3 8and it is actually a 3 75 billion budget we are going to have this year so 3 756 trillionsorry not billion trillion so we are going to spend 3 8 trillion this year in 4 years we are going to be spending an additional 1 trillion on top of that an additional trillion and every dime of that is going into mandatory spending it is not going into health research it is not going into new parts it is not going into building a new aircraft carrier and it is not going into all these programs that we all talk about because it is easy politics every dime of that additional trillion dollars in 4 years from now will be in medicare medicaid social security interest on the debt veterans benefits and the new healthcare law how many times have you heard that this is right in front of us this is what is going on your government is growing at an exponential pace but it is not in the area where we as members of congress get to vote because it is in the formula areas the mandatory spending are you starting to see a theme in this discussion and on the slides i am trying to build an understanding out there with both my brothers and sisters here in congress and the public out there that if we are not willing to have honest conversations particularly with this coming presidential election about entitlements mandatory spending and ways we can manage themand it is not cuts but there are much better ways we can deliver these you put all the programs all the promises we have made at risk because just pretending everything is going to be fine means you are basically dooming them to a really ugly future or the country to an ugly future so this gives you an interesting projection now if we go beyond that 2020 slide if we go 9 years out9 years outwe will be running over trilliondollar deficits and that is using the current gdp projections for the future which we are going to talk about that model on the very end slide there is something horribly wrong in how we are modeling our future income growth into this country the math is real i know it is uncomfortable and it is almost sacrilegious to many of the political people here saying well we are not allowed to talk about that david why are you such a downer dont you want to get reelected why arent you doing happy talk i am optimistic about the country i am optimistic about some things happening out there in the economy despite government but you have to understand in 9 years interest will be 1 trillion and think about this it is almost going to be approaching all discretionary at that time in 9 years we will be about 1 4 trillion in interest our best interest projection is over 1 trillion the chart when you go a couple years out we will be spending more money on interest than all of defense all of discretionary all of education all of parts all of health research everything else that is what we are doing we are creating this trap where as we build more and more debt and build more and more debt and build more and more debt that becomes our achilles heal that becomes our fragility in this country so once again remember that earlier slide where i went over there and marked that now this years deficit projection is 582 5 billion and that is coming from the white house as of about 2 days ago we had someone in our office earlier today we were trying to do some modeling if gdp continues to do what we think is happening right now we could be having a discussion this coming october that the 2015 shortfall was almost 600 billion you do realize that is approaching double what the optimistic projections were last year for 2015 there is something horribly wrong out there it is a combination of lack of economic growth and lets be honest the mandatory spending the entitlements are growing faster than the underlying models we have built so this is an interesting slide just to give you the point of talking about inflection it is a fancy word that a lot of the statisticians like to use and we politicians will use it but there it and it has begun we are well into it do you see where those blue lines start to explode but do you notice something interesting the red lines from about here over basically stay substantially flat that is the discretionary spending that is what we get to vote on that is your defense that is everything else other than the mandatory spending but what is exploding through the ceiling it looks like washington d c failed to understand the demographic issues that were heading towards this country and systematically avoided them because i am sure it had nothing to do with my brothers and sisters often caring more about their next election than having to go through the painful process of educating our voters to understand this is your greatest threat i believe to our republic one more slide to put this in perspective the blue line is interest the red line is allallof defense spending do you notice something that in about 7 years 61 2 years we are now spending more money in interest than all of defense all of defense it is 6 years away actually in reality my math is closer to 51 2 but we will use the 6 years think about that we will be spending more money in interest on unitedstates sovereign debt than we are spending on all defense of the nation it is absurd and this is what we are about to hand to our kids as a matter of fact this is no longer about our kids this is about us now the numbers have eroded so fast it is here and the happy talk that we were doing just 1 year ago particularly coming from the administration has not turned out to be true so one of the things that is going on out there can you regulate yourself to prosperity can you tax yourself to prosperity can you in an arrogant fashion have a bureaucracy that is so inept its ability to even when we do bipartisan progrowth pieces of legislation like the jobs actwe all got together here 3 years ago and did the jobs act you do realize there are still substantial portions of that piece of legislation that are still sitting at the sec that still dont have their rules because of the underlying politics behind them they are 3 years beyond their due date but we still dont have them there is something horribly wrong in this government if we dont have an honest discussion and actually then do something about our tax code our regulatory code access to opportunity and then the difficult one the design within our entitlement state which is something the republicans for the last 4 years 5 years have been putting into our budget do you all remember the television commercial of the paul ryan lookalike throwing grandma over the cliff great politics horrible math because the republicans paul ryan and the rest of us stood up and said that we are willing to actually propose a model that saves medicare and deals with this curve that consumes everything in our path it is really bad politics it is honest math and we get the crap kicked out of us for telling the truth so now we get to look at a slide like this we were projecting 3 1 percent gdp for this year as of a few hours ago the atlanta fed which actually does this really interesting modeling of collecting current statistics and constantly adjusting their gdp projections now has us not at 3 1 percent gdp for this yearand remember every point of gdp isit matters what velocity model you useabout 80 billion to 100 billion of revenue so you start to realize that a couple of points of gdp is a big deal the atlanta feds gdp calculation on their web site now is 0 7 percent gdp coming in in this quarter and the indicators look like we are going to get additional downward revisions on the first quarter we are in trouble yes the politicians will get up here and blame each other and blame each other but it doesnt make the math go away the other thing is alsoand this is one of my pet peeves herewe systematically do not tell the truth and this is a republican and democrat problem some of it is because we use really bad modeling data really bad underlying statistics we underestimate the swings during boom times and slowdowns we systematically have blown our gdp calculation but understand that gdp calculation has a lot to do with what we model as our spending has a lot to do with what ends up happening on our debt if you look at this chart the red is what real gdp turned out to be the blue was our projection and systematically we are dramatically under the projection it looks like this year we are crashing and burning i am desperately hoping the third quarter and the fourth quarter get really healthy but there is something horribly wrong out there is this administration are my brothers and sisters on the left finally willing to have that conversation about the tax code about our regulatory state those very things thatlets face itare stymying future growth and our ability to save this country one last slide just to sort of provide an opportunityfor those of you who have an interest in watching some of these numbers and there are those out there who are also sort of numbers geeks this is that gdpnow yes it is often a pessimistic calculator except for the small problem is the last couple of years it has actually been the accurate calculator of actual gdp growth this is right off the gdpnow web site from the atlanta fed showing it looks like now we are all the way down to a 7 percent gdp growth in the second quarter a little bit else on this and then i will stop this thing i am doing which may be bordering on a tirade if you are particularly geeky last week you would have seen the journal of economic perspectives did an entire report on social security calculations there is a handful of folks here with all sorts of letters behind their names mostly ph d talking about social security is actually in worse shape than we tell people that they are close to 1 trillion additional underfunded in the latest projections and that some of the modeling are simple things like we are actually using really bad life expectancy tables now i have incredible respect for the actuaries over at medicare and social security i think they deal with some amazing data sets but some of the nations finest economists and ph d economists are starting to write public articles saying we are in real trouble here remember last year when the mercatus did their detailed projection on unfunded liabilities and debt for the united states they came in with a number that scared me half to death they actually came in with a number of 205 trillion as if you did gaap standard accounting not government accounting standard accounting for the debt of this nation and our unfunded liabilities go on the internet right now and look up what is the wealth of the world some of the best models say the wealth of the world is about 180 trillion we have universities out there modeling that unitedstates sovereign debt and unfunded liabilities are over 200 trillion our unfunded liabilities are greater than the wealth of the world we are better than this this is the greatest issue in front of us and we spend so little time actually having an honest discussion about the math i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.0018136503640562296, 0.0018136503640562296, 0, "i yield myself such time as i may consume this year for the first time in over a decade congress

destroying access to quality innovative healthcare choices it is discouraging work and making job creation and economic growth more challenging all this at a time when we are experiencing the worst economic recovery in the modern era now when congress passed our bicameral budget resolution earlier this year we initiated a powerful process called reconciliation under reconciliation we are able to move legislation through the house and the senate in an expedited manner and put a bill on the presidents desk so with the legislation before us today the restoring americans healthcare freedom reconciliation act we are using this powerful budgetary tool to help end obamacares attack on americans health care and its attack on our economy we are doing so to pave the way for a more appropriate responsive patientcentered healthcare system that puts patients families and doctors in charge of health care not washington d c under the guidelines of our budget and the rules governing reconciliation three committees in the housethe education and workforce committee the ways and means committee and the energy and commerce committeeproduced individual pieces of legislation to repeal major components of obamacare the house budget committee then took those pieces and combined them into a single bill that we have now brought to the house floor today the restoring americans healthcare freedom reconciliation act repeals the individual and the employer mandates it repeals the onerous cadillac tax it repeals the medical device tax and it repeals an obamacare slush fund as well as undue demands on employers and employees additionally it prohibits for 1 year taxpayer dollars from being used to pay abortion providers that are prohibited under the legislation while dedicating additional resourcesthat is more money mr speakerto community healthcare centers across this country for womens health care taken together the congressional budget office and the joint committee on taxation estimate that this legislation will lower deficits by 130 billion over the 10year budget window roughly 51 billion of those savings would come from the positive macroeconomic effect of what we are proposing cbo and jct estimate that this bill will lead to an increase in the labor supply an increase in economic growth an increase in capital investment and an increase in total compensation that is takehome pay it would also eliminate work disincentives while decreasing federal borrowing the major components of obamacare that are repealed under this legislation represent the core of the coercive nature of the presidents healthcare law policies that are forcing people into a healthcare system that washington is simultaneously making more expensive less accessible lower quality and with fewer choices nothing in what we are proposing would take insurance coverage away from americans or their families or preclude anyone from purchasing coverage what we are doing is freeing americans from government coercion the provisions included in this legislation also share another important distinction and that is that they all fall within the limited scope of the reconciliation process this is vitally important reconciliation is not a silver bullet there are limitations and if a piece of legislation breaches those limitations it runs the risk of derailing the entire process ultimately however this discussion is not about process it is about people it is about the men and women the families that we have the privilege of representing who know that the only folks who should be making personal healthcare decisions are individuals their doctors and their families this debate is about the millions of americans who have seen their premiums go up and their deductibles go up and their outofpocket costs skyrocket after being told that the law in fact would bring those costs down which it has not this is about lowwage workers mr speaker2 6 million according to the hoover institutionwho are at risk of seeing their working hours cut because of obamacare this is about those americans particularly the one in four americans living in rural parts of our country who found that in many cases their healthcare coverage comes with such narrow provider networks that they have to travel long distances to find the treatment that they need and run the risk of even higher costs we can do better we can do better by these americans and all americans who long for a healthcare system that is responsive to their needs that is accessible and affordable and not contributing to the decline of economic opportunity and job security there are positive patientcentered solutions that would advance the cause of quality health care in this country and none of them require handing more authority over to washington obamacare puts washington in charge we want to put the american people in charge of their healthcare decisions and an important step in that direction is this legislation that we have before us today i urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation i look forward to this debate and moving forward on this effort and putting a bill

planned parenthood act and h r 3504 the bornalive abortion survivors protection act today we provide for consideration of two vital pieces of legislation addressing one of the most important issues of our time on many previous occasions my colleagues and i have spoken on the issue of abortion and the tragedy it is that unborn children are not safe and protected we are not here today though debating the policy of abortion ondemand we are debating specific legislative reactions to horrific wrongs that have come to light the deliberate dismemberment of unborn children to receive compensation for their organs and other body parts and the failure of abortion facilities to care for children born alive during failed abortions even some who support elective abortion agree that those practices are barbaric and must be stopped the horrific reality of these practices in the abortion industry have become clear over the past few months as undercover videos have been released of planned parenthoods leaders and affiliates discussing painstakingly dismembering unborn children for compensation in these days of 3d ultrasounds and highdefinition screens it is impossible to hide the humanity of these child victims they have fingers and toes heartbeats and organs developed enough that tissue collectors will pay 60 a specimen for them in light of the serious questions raised by these videos the house committees on energy and commerce judiciary and oversight and government reform have each launched investigations while planned parenthood does not receive direct federal funding for abortions these investigations are warranted as a recent report from the government accountability office shows that the organization receives an average of 500 million taxpayer dollars each year for other lines of business money is fungible and the federal funds that planned parenthood receives ultimately subsidize their abortion services given the serious allegations that have been raised about planned parenthoods abortion practices related to the procurement and sale of tissue and organs from aborted unborn children it is appropriate for congress to pass h r 3134 the defund planned parenthood act placing a 1year moratorium on all federal funds while congress conducts its investigation no organization that performs divisive practices like abortion particularly in such a gruesome profitable manner should receive taxpayer dollars and this legislation advances that principle in addition the examples of kermit gosnells convictions for murdering children born alive at his house of horrors and separate reports of unborn children may have been born alive or intact prior to being sold to tissue collectors have exposed the need for strengthening the bornalive infants protection act the bornalive infants protection act which became law in 2002 extended critical legal protections to babies who are born alive after a failed abortion attempt that bill passed the house judiciary committee with only two dissenting votes and was passed by the senate by unanimous consent the legislation before us today h r 3504 the bornalive abortion survivors protection act goes one step further to protect these vulnerable lives by requiring healthcare practitioners present at the time of birth to administer professional skill care and diligence to preserve the life and health of the child this small but important step ensures the protection and preservation of precious newborn life by providing for criminal penalties when that life is lost as a result of negligence these tiny precious vulnerable lives deserve the protection afforded all other persons under the law and this bill ensures that their lives are protected i commend this rule and both the underlying bills to my

regulatory decrees and settlements act of 2015 i want to thank chairman chaffetz and chairman goodlatte for their hard work on this package of bills that will help push the government out of the way of the american people i am especially grateful that the alert act which i introduced earlier this congress is included as title ii of the bill the constituents that i represent in northeast texas work hard every day to provide for their families and to contribute to their communities but i can tell you from countless conversations that they are fed up with a federal government that has been invading every aspect of their lives they are frustrated with unaccountable unelected bureaucrats who create regulations that have the force of law regulations that typically appear out of nowhere and bring with them huge price tags for the cost of compliance often with little time to prepare and implement them in some cases regulators are unforgiving to those who either cant or dont timely comply by imposing criminal penalties now lets pause to think about that bureaucrats hammering otherwise lawabiding americans with criminal penalties for regulatory violations at a time when the same administration is giving a free pass to millions of illegal aliens for breaking immigration laws giving early release to tens of thousands of prisonersviolent criminalsand turning loose radical islamic terrorists from guantanamo it is little wonder that my constituents are outraged and if it were up to this administration the problem would get worse not better to underscore that point we need only look at the federal register where agencies publish their mandates that document contained 82 000 pages last year meaning that this administration averaged more than 224 pages of new regulations every day of the year americans have every right to demand to know what we are doing here in congress to stop them from being crushed by this snowball of regulations part of the answer should be that current law requires an update twice a year on federal regulations being developed by federal agencies but guess what under this administration these updates have either been late or not issued at all and until now there hasnt been a way to hold these unelected bureaucrats accountable my bill does just that this bill forces the executive branch to make the american people aware of regulations that are coming down the track and it prohibits any regulations from going into effect unless and until detailed information on the cost of that regulationits impact on jobs and the legal bases for itis made available to the public for at least 6 months predictably the president and others argue that this bill is too tough on regulators but do you know what i am here to fight for hardworking americans not for unelected washington bureaucrats ensuring that folks arent steamrolled by new regulations should be a nobrainer transparency shouldnt be controversial it shouldnt be

bill addresses the epa is proposing to bring forward more radical regulations that are going to increase the cost of household electricity for every family in this country the estimates show you will see an over 12 percent increase in household electricity rates if the epa is allowed to move forward when you look at what this legislation does at least it stands up and protects hardworking

forward through unelected bureaucrats at the epa who want to carry out their own agenda they cant pass it through congress so they try to just ram it through in regulations that arent backed up by science but that would in fact actually lead to more jobs being shipped out of this country where would those jobs go mr chairman they would go to places like china and india and brazil and to other countries that dont have the environmental standards that we have you will actually see more carbon emitted if the epa is successful in moving forward with regulations like this that this bill is

number is h r 4017 this act is the save christians from genocide act i would ask my colleagues to consider cosponsoring this legislation a number have already done so i would ask the public to make sure that they know that their congressperson knows exactly what is going on with h r 4017 and that they would hope that their member of congress would also be a cosponsor of the bill by calling your congressmans office i am sure the members of congress will be very happy to hear your opinion many members of this body need to know that their constituents support the save christians from genocide act h r 4017 what this legislation does is set a priority for immigration and refugee status for those christians who are now under attack targeted for genocide in syria iran iraq libya and pakistan genocide is taking place mass murder is happening christians have been targeted for slaughter and elimination by radical islamic terrorists in the middle east we have to acknowledge that or millionsnot just hundreds of thousandsof christian brethren will die another group the yazidis have also been similarly targeted and my bill covers those people as well although they are not christians the greatest threat to our country today is radical islamic terrorism so it should not be a difficult decision on the part of our president or the people or the public or this body to decide that we are going to do what we can to save christians who have been targeted for slaughter by those very same forces who are now the greatest threat to our own security however what we have is not just a foot dragging but a negative response from this administration our president has been unable to defeat or even to turn back the onslaught of radical islamic terrorism yes i have to admit this president was dealt a pretty bad hand things were not good when he took over in the middle east i think the mistake the united states madeit is clear that when we sent our troops into iraq we did indeed break a stability that has caused us problems it was a bad situation at that time when our president became president well this president has turned a bad situation into a catastrophe we have almost lostand with our presidents policies we would have lostegypt to radical islamic terrorism our president supported the muslim brotherhood leader of egypt a man named mohamed morsi who was at that time president of egypt during the early years of this administration president obama went all the way to egypt in order to give a speech standing beside president morsi to the muslim people of that region what it was was basically an acceptance of the muslim brotherhood which people now know is the philosophical godfather to all of the radical islamic terrorist movements that now slaughter christians and threaten the peace and stability of the world our president encouraged them in the beginning feeling if we did again treat someone nicely they will respect you what happened moderate regimes and yes regimes in the middle east that were not democratic were less than free have been replaced with radical islamists who mean to destroy the middle east and turn it into a caliphate radical islamic terrorists who conduct terrorist raids into western countries radical islamic terrorists who murder people in turkey in russia in san bernardino this is what has happened since this president took over and reached out with the hand of friendship and understanding to those who would become the radical islamic terrorists of that region and i might say a threat to the entire world including the people of every city in the united states had egypt been left the way that the president wanted it to be had we instead not supported the effort by the egyptian people to rid themselves of morsi and his government at the time when morsi was trying to destroy their supreme court and their court system at a time when morsi was trying to establish a caliphate that is totally rejected by the egyptian people had our president been able to support general elsisi perhaps the revolution could have happened peacefully but instead morsi was removed by general elsisi when he tried to betray the egyptian people today general elsisi now has been elected by a landslide in egypt and general elsisinow president elsisihas done everything he can to try to find a way to reconcile between islam and the other faiths of not only the region but the world president elsisi is the only leader the only president of egypt ever to go to a coptic christian church and help them celebrate christmas this was an incredible act on his part he also went to the muslim clerics and personally pleaded with the leadership of the muslim faith in egypt and in that part of the world pleaded for a rejection of the radicalism and pleaded for a rejection of those people who would commit acts of violence on others and try to repress the freedom of religion of other people president elsisi begged and pleaded for the egyptian clerics the muslim clerics to come out strongly for respect of other peoples faiths respect of freedom of religion and tolerance toward others when have we ever had a leader like that our president resented him because he overthrew a man who was in the muslim brotherhood who was trying to lay the foundation for a caliphate of terrorists who would have tried to attack the entire western world so what did general elsisi get for being this courageous person what did general elsisi get from us from our president because he now basically saved egypt but not only egyptbecause had egypt become a radical terrorist statethe entire middle east would have fallen it would have been totally out of control and general elsisi stepped up what did he get from our president because of that he got a feeling that our president really didnt like him he got the feeling not only the feeling but he got rejection on those requests that he made for support from the united states legitimate requests of how he could have weapons systems that would help him defeat the same radical islamic terrorists that are murdering our own people and conducting murderous terrorist acts throughout the world at that time i might add they were also conducting mass murders of christians and of other people of other faiths in the middle east burning people to death taking people out and sawing their heads off and doing this in a very public way capturing young women raping them en masse because they are christians or some other faith than islam yes we needed to confront that at that time but instead when general elsisi needed help what did he get i went to egypt several years ago and general elsisi pleaded we have f16s that we need to combat this threat we need spare parts for our tanks he pleaded with us we need these things or we cant police the desert areas on both sides of egypt where these radicals are beginning to try to establish some kind of an uprising and some kind of a conflict that is hard to get at so they need helicopters they need the spare parts for their tanks and they need their f16 airplanes as well so i came back and i put together along with several of my other colleagues the egyptian caucus the egyptian caucus is nothing more than a group of probably 20 of us who are trying to do our best to see that the radical islamists do not take over egypt and that general elsisi is successful in reaching out to the moderate muslims and trying to create goodwill between people of faith who are people of goodwill and should be working together and rejecting the radical terrorists that now threaten the whole world and threaten the region so we are trying to help elsisi he is the point man i came back a year later and i talked to general elsisi well did you get your spare parts well did you get the f16s yet no did you get spare parts for the tanks you mentioned no well did you get those apache helicopters he said yeah we got the apache helicopters but the defensive systems needed to send apache helicopters into a combat zone were not included so we cant use them now what i just described to you is not something that just happened by bureaucratic happenstance or somebody forgot to send the paperwork out this was the policy of the obama administration i have worked in the white house and seen how these games are played they are looking at elsisi as an enemy and they are trying to play games with him making sure his helicopters didnt have the equipment needed to do their job and that the f16s didnt come and the spare parts didnt come finallyafter 2 years i might addi went back a year later and finally they had arrived after we had raised hell in this body and the american people had their say that people like elsisi and other moderate people like abdullah in jordan and people like that who are moderate in their religious beliefs they are moderate people and they believe in giving people of other faiths respect and tolerance these are the type of leaders we should be siding with i might add that general elsisi has worked with israel he has gone out of his way to make sure there isnt war between israel and egypt what could be better than a man who is reaching out asking for tolerance among all faiths a man who reaches out to a country where they have been at war before and is trying to say we will never be at war again we will work together to build a better world that is what he is doing but that is what our president is trying to undermine our president basically has been unable to use the words radical islamic terrorism we keep saying that that is why right after the benghazi fiasco that is why immediately when they started talking about oh these werent really terrorists who murdered our ambassador it was all caused by a movie that had been shown and it just enraged these muslim people and a demonstration got out of hand and that is when they went in and murdered our ambassador do you remember that i remember hearing it four or five times the very first time that i heard it i said that is a lie everybody who knew what was going on that is what struck them our government was lying to us in order to protect what and i might add our secretary of state then hillary clinton when she was confronted with that lieand finally by the time we confronted her with it it was clearly a lieshe said well what difference does it make whether it was a radical terrorist group or whether it was some people who were demonstrating against a movie what difference does it make i will tell you what difference it makes the difference it makes is that you are sending a message to radicals who murdered our ambassador that they have gotten away with it and we are going to wink and nod and let them get away with it we are not going to challenge them we are not going after the terrorist murderers we are not even giving them credit or making them accountable for it we are going to blame it on somebody else so the american people wont get mad and insist that we do something against it so yeah that was what the administration was trying to tell us this is the same administration as i say that cant get itself to help general elsisi who has saved us from the horror story of having egypt turned into a radical islamic terrorist camp and now we cant even tell the american people that their ambassador has been murdered by radical islamic terrorists in fact those words radical islamic terrorists have not been uttered i would challenge the president tonight not including this in a list of long things but just get up and say one sentence specifically about i reject radical islamic terrorism and the radical islamic terrorists of the world have to know that we havent heard that from him we havent heard that from him at all give me the quote by the way i think he did use the phrase in passing saying christian terrorists and radical islamic terrorists and blahblah no that is not it lets have a condemnation of radical islamic terrorism but no we havent been able to do that that same president then at a time when the situation is spiraling out of control because these terrorists are flooding the middle east and various countrieswhether it is syria iraq and those partsthis area is becoming so unstable that if we do not do something to save the people there who are under attack in two ways number one those people who are there like the kurds like the sunnis in the anbar province who are antiisil like general elsisi and abdullah of jordan we have to make sure we help them that is the first thing we have to do but the second thing we have to do is make sure we do what is morally right when it comes to those people who have been targeted to be slaughtered we are talking about a genocide that is existing we know that the christian communities have been targeted for extinction by a mass slaughter being conducted by radical islamic terrorists those people who have been targeted deserve to come to the united states number one our government needs to help those who are fighting isil number two our government needs to make sure that those people who are targeted for genocide can find safe haven here instead of bringing healthy young muslim men from that area and letting them come into the united states letting them flood into europe rather than those people those christians who are being targeted i went up to munich and took a look at one of these refugee camps we all have seen this video after video of young healthy muslim men by the hundreds of thousands pouring in to western europe we dont know how many of them are terrorists but here is the point if those young men dont like radical islam and this terrorism they should be back in their home country fighting it if they do like radical islam they certainly shouldnt be permitted into the western democracies the same is true in the united states we should not be permittingand our president has been i would say not doing the job that we have been expecting him to do to protect our interests when it comes to the people who are flooding into our country whether they are radical islamic terrorists or whether they are just people coming in from the middle east who we havent checked out yet enough and of course we have hundreds of thousands and yes millions of people who have come here illegallywe dont even know who they arewho have swarmed across the border this president talks about amnesty talks about giving children who have come here illegally free education and health care the dream act et cetera what do you think this does this encourages hundreds of thousands or millions of people to come here the trouble is when there is a flood we dont know if in that group of hundreds of thousands and millions of people in the last few years how many of them have been terrorists do you really believe that our enemies that these people who slaughter innocent people these people who are rampaging through the middle east raping thousands of young girls because they are christians you think that they would care about lying to come here and they would refrain from coming here because they would have to cross the border and break the law we dont know how many of them are here but they are here it is the president of the united states who is at fault we should have had a system of coming into our country a long time ago that handled refugees and handled people with legitimate immigration status and everyone that would come here from the middle east should have been vetted that way i was briefed along with my colleagues on the vetting process top level people in this government admit that they have not been able to really verify the things that the people claim is their background i would suggest and i would insist there is legislation here as well that is pending that i am a cosponsor of that insists on a lie detector test for everybody that comes here at least from that region we could ask them five questions like have you ever advocated violence for your religion do you believe in sharia law or the constitution that is all we have to do just take an extra 5 minutes we havent even done that we have millions of people here maybe 10 000 of them have animosity toward us or are here to try to shoot people like they did in san bernardino right in our own area innocent people were just slaughtered i went to paris these kids were in a dance club and these guys came in and just massacred them they kept shooting at them for minutes at a time they loaded their guns again this is what we are up against it is evil and this administration this president cant use the words radical islamic terrorists well i ask my colleagues today to please join me in cosponsoring my legislation h r 4017 it does this at the very least we can try to save those christians in yazidi cities that have been targeted for genocide and how we do it is this you have a certain number of those on refugee status a certain number on immigration status coming from these five countries that i mentioned in the middle east these are the areas where the christians are the most under attack what my bill simply says is that christians and these yazidis who have also been targeted for genocide are going to get priority they deserve to be on the top of the list they deserve priority long before these healthy young muslim men who want to come here and then we will let them in we will of course vet them make sure we know who they are and they will get the priority now the president made a statementhe didnt use the number of my bill but he talked about itand said well we dont believe in that that is discriminating because of religion it is a religious test we dont do religious tests in america are you kidding we cannot prioritize what we do to make sure that what we are doing is helping the person who is most in danger is a lifeguard in some way showing disrespect in not helping those other people in the water by going out and saving someone who is drowning this isnt discrimination this is a prioritization of the people who are under attack and will be slaughtered this intellectualism will result in what if we accept the president and this administration saying oh you cant prioritize for christians by the way he doesnt seem to have any trouble prioritizing for anybody else but it is very clear that he wont let us prioritize for christians who are targeted for genocide no i reject that totally it is not racism we had another incident like this in our history in 1939 there was at least one boatload of jews that made it to the united states they prayed and pleaded with us to let them in at that moment nazi germany was in the process of picking up the jews and putting them in concentration camps these people got away with their families and they came here and what did we do we turned them back we turned them back for the same reason oh if we let you in it is a special favor to you these people were targeted for genocide and we let them go back many of them died in these nazi concentration camps lets not do that again i would ask my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring my bill h r 4017 the save christians from genocide act join me and we will send a message to the world that yes we are still the same goodhearted people that we have always claimed to be but have not always met that standard today we deserve to stand up and be the champion of the type of values that i am talking about that is what our founding fathers had in mind america was the refuge of the world america was the shining city on the hill that inspired the whole world but we werent cowards we werent someone who undermined some person in his country who is fighting an evil force like general elsisi no our founding fathers made sure that those people who are struggling for a better world had our support by the way let me just note that i worked on speeches for ronald reagan i was reagans speechwriter for 7 years in the white house i was actually researching one of his speeches and i came across the fact that a man named kossuth from hungary came to the united states and was pleading for help for the hungarian people who were then in an uprising against the austrohungarian empire and were fighting for their freedom he was there in the midwest giving speeches and trying to get the american people to support him i read a couple of his speeches then i noted that in springfield illinois right after his speech the town liked him he was a freedom fighter but they passed a resolution at their meeting that said the united states is a noninterventionist power and we should not get involved overseas something like that kossuth was still in town he read the newspaper account of it and when the word got out that he was so in despair that the people of the united states would say such a thing and side with the oppressor through their inaction when the people heard about this they called a second meeting in the second meeting they passed a resolution saying that while we dont want to send our military forces all over the worldwhich is still a good ideawe will support those people who are struggling for freedom throughout the world we will open up our arsenals we will give them what they need to defeat the forces of tyranny that oppress them that second resolution then was passed and was signed by the people of springfield illinois and in the last phases i might add one of the people who signed that document was one a lincoln i will tell you this about that speech of mr kossuth that speech ended with and we do this and we make this commitment so that government of the people by the people and for the people shall not perish from this earth lincoln was there in that room when that speech was given and he later united the people of the united states with that thought from that man that freedom fighter overseas there are people who are struggling for their freedom there are people who are struggling for their existence we do not have to send american military boys to fight the fight that they should be fighting for themselves but at the very least we must give them the support they need to defeat the evil forces in the world that would slaughter them slaughter their families and come after us next that is what the war with radical islam terrorism is all about they are at war with us and they mean to kill our families and they mean to push western civilization out of the history books of the world in the future they want it to be a radical islamic world and they will kill all of us to get it now that is not all of the muslims i agree with our president that we should not say all muslims are this way after all general elsisi is a muslim abdullah of jordan is a muslim the people that we need on our side to defeat radical islam are the moderate muslims of the world i think at least 80 percent of the muslims of the world are moderate and would want to be our friends we need now to recognize that that segment of islam is now a threat to our safety our wellbeing this is an historic moment we can either meet this challenge or we will lose but the most important thing no matter what we do if our president doesnt want to send troops there fine but at least let us ensure that history will record that we saved those christians who were targeted for the genocide of this evil force that was expanding in that part of the world shame on us if we do not i ask my colleagues to join me in support of h r 4017 i ask the people of the united states to let their congressmen know that they expect them to support honorable and noble and moral stands like this it is not discrimination it is prioritizing towards those people who have been targeted for genocide nothing could be better for our soul than to help those who have been so targeted i ask that my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.002110225846990943, 0.002110225846990943, 0, "yesterday a disturbing video surfaced of dr deborah nucatola planned parenthoods senior director of

legislation being brought to the house floor tonight the foreign aid authorization act first passed congress in 1961 if you mention foreign aid to many americans it raises their blood pressure members of our communities often are concerned about foreign aid to other countries because they are just not quite sure where that aid is going and what that aid is accomplishing it is important that we as members of the house of representatives legislatively communicate to america how americas money is being spent in foreign countries it is important that we are accountable and that that money that aid is accountable to the taxpayers it may shock you madam speakermaybe it wontbut congress has never passed a law requiring transparency and accountability of foreign aid i will use a different phrase we have never audited our foreign aid to see if it is working and to see what it is doing so people can see whether it is successful or not the american public is uninformed about how much we spend and why we spend that money a recent publish what you fund study rated half of unitedstates agencies in the poor category when it came to transparency of aid transparency is important because it sheds light on where the money is spent it is a lot harder to steal money if everybody knows where the money went and what it was for the american people have a right to know what we are doing with their money there are a lot of success stories but many americans dont know about them so it is important that we post that information and that the agencies that help in foreign aid assistance post that information on the web so we know who is getting the money and what they are doing with that money transparency will help foreign aid it will make it harder for bad actors to steal that aid it will make those who implement our programs work more vigilantly knowing the information will also be posted online it will educate the american public about all the ways our country is helping other people around the world as i said there are a lot of success stories where people are better off because america is helping them transparency by itself however wont save all of foreign aids problems but without transparency those problems will not be solved we also need to evaluate our foreign aid program so we know what works the key portions of this bill are transparency of the aid and evaluation of the aid evaluate that aid to see if it is working and if it is working may continue to do that aid evaluate aidif it is not working then we cut it off and do something else we have all heard about the boondoggles of foreign aid big infrastructure projects are especially prone to waste and mismanagement that is why it is so critically important that as part of this bill being implemented licensed engineers who know how to do these infrastructure projects are more involved with their expert input and operational skills let me give you some examples of where foreign aid has been mismanaged schools are being built by americans overseas but some of those schools never had a student attend them the special inspector for iraq reconstruction found out that at least 8 billion in american taxpayer dollars was lost to fraud waste and abuse 44 million was spent on a residential camp to house international police trainers the camp included an olympicsized swimming pool the problem is swimming pool and all it was never used the 43 million natural gas station in afghanistan was built by the department of defense when it built the same kind of gas station for 500 000 in pakistan let me explain that again american taxpayers built a 43 million natural gas station besides the enormous outrageous cost nobody ever used the gas station in afghanistan so rigorous evaluations of our foreign aid are important because they can tell us whether or not we are really making a lasting impact we have a long way to go and the state department really doesnt have a system in place to keep track of the dollars spent on evaluation of those projects the state department can only tell how much it plans to spend in the future but as soon as it spends that money on evaluations it has no way of tracking where the money went so the state department cant even tell how many evaluations were even done last year on the aid that we are already spending even in its policy the state department is moving in the wrong direction its new evaluation policy lowers the amount of evaluations that must be done usaid has some troubling signs as well usaid spent less money on evaluations in 2014 than it did in 2013 to solve some of these problems with transparency and with accountability of our foreign aid representative connolly and myself have introduced h r 3766 the foreign aid transparency and accountability act this bill requires the president to issue guidelines requiring tough evaluations and on transparency it codifies what is already being done and increases the amount of information required to be posted online including actual expenditures and evaluations so everyone knows what we are doing and whether it is working or not we need to be reporting on more foreign aid in a more understandable way the american people want to know where their aid is going what it is for and if that aid is effective transparency and accountability for our

when the standards are in full effect the average american family will save about 100 every year that comes to 13 billion in savings nationwide every year but this rider threatens those savings and that is why consumer groups have consistently opposed this rider here is the reality the 2007 consensus energy efficiency standards for light bulbs were enacted with bipartisan support and continue to receive overwhelming industry support unitedstates manufacturers are already meeting the efficiency standards the effect of the rider is to allow foreign manufacturers to sell old inefficient light bulbs in the united states that violate the efficiency standards that is unfair to domestic manufacturers who have invested millions of dollars in the united states in those plants to make efficient bulbs here that meet the standards why on earth would we want to pass a rider that favors foreign manufacturers who ignore our laws and penalizes unitedstates manufacturers who are following our laws

efficiency standards by january 1 of next year it also provided that if final updated standards are not issued by then a more stringent standard of 45 lumens per watt automatically takes effect incandescent light bulbs currently cannot meet this backstop standard this rider blocks doe from issuing the required efficiency standards and ensures that the backstop will kick in ironically it is

chair i thank the gentleman for his amendment in the nature of a substitute but at this time i have to oppose it i appreciate that mr takano does believe that we need to provide real accountability at the department of veterans affairs but as i said at our committee markup when he offered an almost identical amendment this substitute fails to achieve true accountability i am supportive of section 3 of his amendment which would limit administrative leave for all employees to 14 days and i agree with this commonsense policy but i would note that this limitation language is already included in my bill h r 1994 my main concern with the substitute lies within section 2 which would dramatically change the standard and the process set up in my bill of removing va employees the substitute would only give the secretary the authority to remove an employee if they represent a clear and direct threat to public health or safety which is almost an unobtainable if not immeasurable bar to reach this undefined standard would make it almost impossible for the secretary to remove any employee under this new authority thereby ensuring that the current stalemate that exists with the civil service rules would continue unfortunately as i said moments ago maintaining the status quo is not acceptable i would submit that the standard of a clear and direct threat to public health and safety would not apply to those employees involved with many of todays ongoing scandals at the va including the cost overruns of the denver hospital the budget shortfall that we are going to vote to fix later today a 3 billion budget fix the manipulation of data at the philadelphia regional office the allegations of inappropriate use of government purchase cards to the tune of 6 billion the allegations of employees at the los angeles regional office once again inappropriately shredding veterans claim information and the many other egregious actions that continue to come to light at va almost every single day members these are the very type of employees that our constituents and our veterans expect to be held accountable but the standard proposed in this substitute would not give the secretary the authority to provide the accountability we all know that va desperately needs i also have some concerns with the procedures that are laid out in the substitute to actually remove these employees i believe that unlike the procedures that i have laid out in my bill which set definitive timelines to remove someone while maintaining the due process and maintaining appeal rights the procedures laid out in this substitute could allow an employee to be on indefinite suspension for months if not years awaiting a hearing for the secretarys final decision it has been mentioned several times by my colleagues on the other side that passage of h r 1994 would return to a spoils or an atwill employment system nothing could be further from the truth let me compare a spoils or an atwill system to the protections offered in first a spoils system would allow the party in power to hire anyone usually partisan supporters that they want to reward for their political support with a federal job in contrast h r 1994 has no effect on the current hiring process second a spoils or a patronage system makes all employees at will and subject to firing for any or even no reason again that is hardly the case in my bill h r 1994 requires proof in the form of poor performance or misconduct additionally my bill requires the secretary to report the reasons for any such removals to congress within 30 days third in a spoils system a fired employee has no right of appeal in contrast under h r 1994 fired employees still have due process rights including 45 days to appeal their firing to the merit systems protection board fourth in a spoils system there is no such thing as paid administrative leave you are fired gone with no pay under civil service rules a poorperforming employee can be placed on administrative leave for essentially an unlimited time as we have seen with several miscreants identified during our investigations h r 1994 on the other hand would limit the secretarys authority to put someone on paid administrative leave to 14 days at which time the secretary must bring that person back to active duty fifth in a spoils system there are no protections for whistleblowers in an atwill system employees may or may not be covered by whistleblower protection employee discrimination et cetera type laws depending on the type of employer however under h r 1994 employees are protected by both of these types of laws plus the procedures and additional protections created under section 4 of my bill employees cannot be removed without osc approval if an open case exists and employees cannot be removed or demoted if they have an open case under the new process that is laid out in section 4 until the office of accountability review makes a final determination so ultimately not only does this amendment set a standard for removal that is not relevant to a majority of the issues that we see at the department it keeps intact the long and arduous timeline before a final approval is complete this is not fair to veterans to the department or to the employee in question to reemphasize i also have issues with the whistleblower protections that are laid out in this substitute or the lack of protections in this substitute the only mention of whistleblower protections made in this amendment says that a whistleblower may receive backpay if the merit systems protection board ultimately decides they were removed for blowing the whistle not only does this not provide any protections on the front end but it would also strip out all of the whistleblower protections i have included in section 4 of my bill we all know that the secretary has a tall task to restore trust and to rebuild the va we have to give him every tool possible to complete that

long as it is outside of the united states we are approving its expenditure by the way you can go down to the next line where the same is true of the 59 8 million for the marine corps construction of

organizers within 7 days after an election is ordered so you have a week the ambush election rule instead would open the door for greater harassment and intimidation by requiring employers to turn
