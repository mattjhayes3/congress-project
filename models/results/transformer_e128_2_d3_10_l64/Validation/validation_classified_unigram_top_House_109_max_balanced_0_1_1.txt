talking earlier i had to chuckle there for a minute because mr delahunt always takes the opportunity and the privilege to share with us the printed word and it is good to have him here mr ryan will be joining us a little later if i could just take a moment here to let the members know that the great debate took place here on this floor a number of amendments were proposed to make sure that we pass a budget that is just and fair for every american but i must bring to the members attention because i think members do not realize what is happening or if they do realize what is happening i want to make sure that it is in the record that they know we talk about debt a lot in our 30 something working group and talking about debt and doing something about debt are two different things the republican majority continues to spend in a recordbreaking way that is bankrupting this country and changing the philosophy of this country which is payasyougo democrats we are the only party in this house that can say that we balanced the budget we have actually done it we have actually had surpluses as far as the eye can see republicans can only talk about well we would like to cut it in half and we would like to cut it back a quarter or what have you but i just want to make sure that folks understand that there was an article written on tuesday of this week entitled another possible bump to the debt ceiling 2 7 trillion budget plan pending before the house would raise the federal debt ceiling by nearly 10 trillion less than 2 months after the congress last raised the federal debt borrowing limit the provision is buried on page 121 of a 151page blueprint it serves as the backdrop for congressional action this week i think it is important and i usually have my letters here from the secretary of the treasury but i think it is important that the american people and the members of this house understand that what they are doing to this country recordbreaking debt i just want to make sure before we start off and then i am going to be kind of quiet here tonight because i know that we have a lot to share it is almost too much to share but i just want to share this with the members one more time we are talking about who are we borrowing from we are borrowing from japan at 682 8 billion china 249 8 billion the uk 223 2 billion the caribbean 115 3 billion taiwan 71 3 billion opec nations including saudi arabia and a number of nations that we have issues with 67 8 billion germany 65 7 billion korea 66 5 billion canada 53 8 billion and climbing if we do not stop this republican majority from continuing to raise this debt ceiling and burying it within the federal budget on what they believe their members have to vote for and this budget vote has been postponed and postponed and postponed not because the republican majority did not have time to deal with it they just did not want to do to their constituents what the majority wants them to do as long as we are here and we have breath in our bodies we are going to share with the members of this house that we will not allow this to be a back room with the lights off in the middle of the night proposition for the american people that they do not have any choices in but the special interests do i just in closing again history making this is not the kendrick meek report debbie wasserman schultz bill

you tonight with some doturbing news the threat is even more serious than many americans know tucson arizona is 65 miles from mexico i have it here on the map it is shown by the red dot it is the route to two interstates one going north and south and one going east and west just southeast of tucson arizona is the university of arizona technology park on that park which is surrounded by an oldfashioned chain link fence is a technology firm called raytheon raytheon is a defense contractor that makes tomahawk cruise missiles well neighbors in tucson arizona have sent me some pictures of what appears to be illegal entry into the perimeter of this plant here we have the chain link fence this photograph is taken inside the perimeter on these premises 400 acres is the raytheon plant it is true there is another fence around raytheon that is a fence that is a cable type fence that keeps trucks from coming through but someone of course could crawl underneath or over that particular fence and you see there is all types of litter inside the fence and the question occurs where does this come from these are trails that are similar to what you see along the texas border where i am from but border towns down in southeast texas dont have a plant that makes tomahawk cruise missiles tucson neighbors say these trails are filled with trash backpacks water bottles and clothes and why is that well it seems that the illegals that come from mexico sneak under this fence and hide on these 400 acres until the human smugglers come back later and pick them up and transport them throughout the united states raytheon public relations officials have said well they hadnt heard anything about it from the security and they have strict security procedures to enter that facility but a supervisor at raytheon security said yes illegals have been known to come through the grounds but they were just passing through and some illegals have been found working at the raytheon plant by subcontractors but they were ordered off the premises i would like to show you some more disturbing photographs that the tucson neighbors have sent me this is a photograph taken inside the perimeter of the chain link fence and you see numerous backpacks where illegals have come in to the perimeter have hidden on the premises when the human smugglers come to pick them up and take them into the heartland of america they bring with them the backpacks that allow them to change clothes it is somewhat disturbing to me that we have this contractor that makes tomahawk missiles that allows this to occur on their premises because you see lawlessness on the border breeds more lawlessness in the united states and you would think that a company that has submitted a border security plan for the department of homeland security just 2 weeks ago would be concerned about their bordertoo after all it is a national security issue i have one more photograph to show you taken on the same premises but on the other end of the perimeter a similar photograph of backpacks water bottles left by the people that illegally entered the united states how ironic that it is that they hide on the premises of a place and an institution that is trying to protect the national security of the united states the raytheon problems are our problems because the unitedstates mexico border is not secure we have to stop the illegal entry at the border between the united states and mexico otherwise we will continue to see these backpacks throughout the united states and some may have clothes but some may also

spirit at least some of the time and we are able to get a few things done and this is one of them the perkins act aims to prepare youth and adults for the future by building their academic and technical skills in preparation for postsecondary education and or employment the bill we are considering today enhances perkins by ensuring both secondary and postsecondary students participating in the program are acquiring rigorous academic and technical skills and will have the opportunity to transition into further education and or successful employment the perkins act governs widely supported programs of both the secondary and postsecondary level for example nearly all high school students complete at least one vocational education course and approximately 26 percent of students are considered vocational concentrators those students who focus on a single occupational area in my home state of delaware we have five career and technical high schools that enroll a total of 5 500 of the 29 500 total high school students at the postsecondary level the perkins act supports a broad array of options primarily at the community college level including delaware technical community college in the 19992000 school year over 50 percent of all students enrolled at the less than 4year postsecondary level reported that they were majoring in vocational areas todays conference report seeks to build upon reforms made in past reauthorizations and seeks to enhance this popular program to ensure its success in years to come the legislation before us today makes significant reforms to academic achievement and accountability to ensure students have the skills necessary to enter the workforce or continue to an institution of higher learning as i mentioned there are five career and technical high schools in delaware while all these schools met adequately yearly progress under the no child left behind act there is more to be done in academic achievement in these schools and schools across the country today we will improve vocational and technical education by increasing the focus on academics in conjunction with the skill attainment that is incumbent of the program one of the unique attributes of vocational and technical education programs is their ability to show students a path that could end in a certificate credential employment military or postsecondary education the techprep program within the perkins act is intended to focus on a welldefined link between high school and at least 2 years of postsecondary education research has shown however that funds are rarely if ever used to meet this goal rather funds are often used for purposes within the larger vocational and technical education program therefore the conference agreement revises requirements of the program in order to ensure articulation agreements between secondary and postsecondary institutions are in fact being implemented along this same track we include a new requirement for state development of career and technical programs of study for career and technical program areas these sequences of course will incorporate a nonduplicative progression of both secondary and postsecondary elements which will include both academic and vocational and technical content local recipients at both the secondary and postsecondary level would adopt at least one model sequence of courses as developed by the state i believe this will also help drive program improvements by ensuring that states clarify the progression of academic and vocational technical courses needed for the postsecondary education training or employment of a students choice it is clear that we are making some significant and positive changes for the schools and students impacted by this program one of the biggest changes that i think we are making is for congress to finally make the switch from vocational and technical education to career and technical education in my opinion this was an important statement for the congress to make while the president has proposed another avenue for high school reform in the perkins act i believe strongly that the reforms we consider today go a long way in driving program improvement and ultimate success for students across the country the dialogue surrounding high school reform is important and is happening in earnest i trust that the conference agreement will complement these efforts as a result of the changes in the bill i believe it will help states community colleges and other postsecondary education institutions and local educational agencies to better meet the needs of students participating in career and technical education i urge my colleagues to support this report so we may send this bill to the president for his signature i

at after considerable effort of a bipartisan group involving both house and senate judiciary committee staff over several months from hearings in the house and from other reports we have learned that current federal law designed to protect animal enterprises have been proven to be reasonably effective in protecting animal enterprises however serious gaps and loopholes have been identified in current law with respect to protecting employees and associates of animal enterprises present law protects employees of an animal enterprise but we have found that employees board members and family members of businesses and nonprofits affiliated with or doing business with such enterprises are complaining that they are now being stalked harassed intimidated or threatened with some individuals even being physically assaulted and had their homes businesses or cars vandalized since the animal enterprise terrorism law was enacted in 1992 there have been some1 100 complaints of such incidents with property losses reported of being more than 120 million those complaining include farmers scientists biomedical and biotechnology industries research universities teaching hospitals financial institutions magazines newspapers and other advertising groups and others who are viewed as assisting or enabling targeted animal enterprises the evidence is that in many instances extremist elements among the animal rights groups are taking advantage of the fact that the animal enterprise laws do not cover affiliates and associates by using threats harassment intimidation and fear and other extreme tactics to pressure them into severing their activities with such enterprises s 3880 is designed to cover these gaps or loopholes by providing to employees businesses and associates of animal enterprises similar protections to those already covered in other words the bill prevents a person from doing indirectly to an animal enterprise what they are prohibited to do directly now citizens engaging in legitimate animal enterprise activities and anyone associated with them are entitled to be protected from criminal acts and to be able to go about their daily a tivities free from threats to their person or property and that of their family and associates state laws are generally good at providing those protections however the interstate nature of the planning and execution of the criminal harassment tactics used by some individuals or groups skilled at exploiting gaps or weaknesses in the laws have made it difficult for states to get at problems effectively that is why this bill is deemed necessary while we must protect those engaged in animal enterprises we must also protect the right of those engaged in first amendment freedoms of expres sion regarding such enterprises it goes without saying that first amendment freedoms of expression cannot be defeated by statute however to reassure anyone concerned with the intent of this legislation we have added in the bill assurances that it is not intended as a restraint on freedoms of expression such as lawful boycotting picketing or otherwise engaging in lawful advocacy for animals in addition we also wanted to recognize that there are some who conscientiously believe that it is their duty to peacefully protest the operation of animal enterprises to the extent of engaging in civil disobedience if a groups intention were to stage a sitin or liedown or to block traffic to a targeted facility they certainly run the risk of arrest for whatever traffic trespass or other laws they may be breaking but they should not be held more accountable for business losses due to causes such as delivery trucks being delayed any more than a boycott or protest against any other business to violate the provision of the bill one must travel or otherwise engage in interstate activity with the intent to cause damage or loss to an animal enterprise while the losses of profits lab experiments or other intangible losses are included it must be proved that such losses were specifically intended for the law to be applied if there is no damage or economic loss or damage or loss is less than 10 000 the offense is

appropriations bill also provides no funding for those technology transfer centers either i am pleased that this bill does substantially increase funding for energy efficiency for renewable en ergy for basic research i devoutly wish that it was increased more still but i am concerned that we are ignoring solutions to our energy problems that are available to us now i am concerned that we are not supporting moving technology out of the laboratory and into the marketplace where such technologies will save consumers and businesses on their energy bills i hope that you and the committee will recognize the importance of technology transfer and provide a neartermn solution to our energy needs and provide appropriate funding"], [0.000806272029876709, 0.5008062720298767, 1, "the new ceo of

seeking the same compassionate cures to many of our most debilitating diseases have recognized that science and ethics need not be divorced to produce positive results for patients adult stem cell therapies and pluripotent stem cell therapy present exciting and hopeful new possibilities and treatments and even cures to families with loved ones facing the scourge of disease this is good news worth repeating we can do worthwhile and groundbreaking stem cell research to benefit patients without destroying human life science and technology must always serve humanity not the other way around

gambling but other than that i dont think he got much right he says that gambling on the internet does not add to the gdp or make america competitive has it become the role of this congress to prohibit any activity that an adult wants to engage in voluntarily if it doesnt add to the gdp or make us more competitive what kind of social cultural authoritarianism are we advocating here now i agree there is a practice around today that causes a lot of problems damages families people lose their jobs they get in debt they do it to excess it is called drinking are we going to go back to prohibition prohibition didnt work for alcohol it doesnt work for gambling when people abuse a particular practice the sensible thing is to try to deal with the abuse not outlaw it by the way this bill allows certain kinds of internet gambling to stay so apparently the notion is that those few people who are obsessive and addicted will not take advantage of those forms which are still available to them but the fundamental point is this if an adult in this country with his or her own money wants to engage in an activity that harms no one how dare we prohibit it because it doesnt add to the gdp or it has no macroeconomic benefit are we all to take home calculators and until we have satisfied the gentleman from iowa that we are being socially useful we abstain from recreational activities that we choose this congress is well on the way to getting it absolutely backwards in areas where we need to act together to protect the quality of our life in the environment in transportation in public safety we abstain but in those areas where individuals ought to be allowed to make their own choices we intervene and that is what this is now people have said well some students abuse it we should work to try to diminish abuse but if we were to outlaw for adults everything that college students abuse we would all just sit home and do nothing by the way credit card abuse among students is a more serious problem i believe than gambling maybe gambling will catch up but we have heard many many stories about young people who have credit cards that they abuse do we ban credit cards for them but here is the fundamental issue shouldnt it be the principle in this government that the burden of proof is on those who want to prohibit adults from their own free choices to show that they are harming other people we ought to say that if you decide with your own money to engage in an activity that harms no one else you ought to be allowed to do it and once you say oh no but that doesnt add to the gdp and that can lead to some problems in families then this is hardly the only thing you will end up banning the fundamental principle of the autonomy of the individual is at stake today now i have to say i understand a lot of the conservatives dont like it because there are people on the religious side who dont like it some of my liberal friends i think are being very inconsistent we are for allowing a lot of things i mean many of us vote to say you can burn the flag i wish you wouldnt but you can it shouldnt be a crime you can look at certain things on television that maybe other people think you shouldnt you can do other things but you cant gamble there is a fundamental inconsistency there i guess people think gambling is tacky they dont like it well fine then dont do it but dont prohibit other individuals from engaging in it people have said what is the value of gambling here is the value some human beings enjoy doing it shouldnt that be our principle if individuals like doing something and they harm no one we will allow them to do it even if other people disapprove of what they do and it is of course likely to be ineffective the best thing that ever happens to illegal gamblers is when you do a measure like this i hope the bill is defeated july 11 2006"], [0.001681506633758545, 0.49831849336624146, 0, "i yield 3 minutes to my colleague from arizona a member
