mr lasater was known to use cocaine and distributed cocaine freely at many parties and he was convicted convicted by the arkansas authorities of trafficking in cocaine he received a prison sentence and his prison sentence was partially reduced after he got out of prison he was in a halfway house for a few months he was pardoned exonerated by thengovernor clinton his friend during the time that he was incarcerated in this halfway househe really was not in a penitentiary he was in a halfway house most of the time during the time he was incarcerated a lady named patsy thomasson who is his chief financial officer took over control of his businesses and she ran his businesses as the chief financial officer while mr lasater was away at prison when he got out and was pardoned by president clinton ms thomasson continued to be the chief financial officer of his companies and she also became the chief officer of what was called the phoenixthe phoenix group a subsidiary of the phoenix group was the phoenix mortgage co and mr lasater became the president of the phoenix mortgage co so the relationship between patsy thomasson and mr lasater and bill clinton was of long duration and continued even after he went to jail and was out as a matter of fact mr lasater paid an 8 000 drug debt drug bill for cocaine use that bill clintons brother had incurred so he paid off a drug bill for bill clintons brother so there was a very close relationship between the clintons and mr lasater now patsy thomasson to give you some more background my colleagues now is one of the chief officers at the white house she is the personnel director at the white house she conducts quote unquote the drug testing of personnel at the white house now yesterday the people of albuquerque nm awoke to another tale of corruption that may involve the president president clinton the front page of tuesdays albuquerque journal reports that ajoint federal state narcotics investigation of the presidents friend mr dan lasater was called off before it was completed a former arkansas state police investigator j n doc delaughter told two journal investigative reporters that the investigation included lasater a close friend of the president and highdollar contributor to mr clintons campaign and the presidents brother roger clinton delaughter said the investigation was cut off prematurely for political reasons the state police investigators say he briefed the clintonappointed arkansas state police director tommy goodwin twice by telephone about the lasater clinton investigation on both occasions tommy goodwin the state police investigator was using a phone in then governor clintons personal office mr delaughter who was then on the force was not sure whether or not governor clinton now president clinton overheard the conversations but it is very clear that governor clinton now president clinton was very close to the arkansas state police director who was getting the information about the investigation delaughter said and i quote moneys could have been seized and planes could have been seized because we had evidence that cocaine was being used on planes used by mr lasater as i said before mr lasater quite frequently flew then governor bill clinton around in these planes delaughter told the newspaper that he and another investigator were barred from interviews with lasater roger clinton and another lasater associate in other words his superiors on the state police said you cant go and investigate this they stopped him cold in his tracks eventually lasater was convicted of possession and distribution of cocaine as i said before he was sentenced to 30 months in prison but served only 10 months most of which was in a halfway house before being released on parole lasater was later paroled by his friend thengovernor bill clinton now right in the thick of all this is patsy thomasson who is now the personnel director at the white house she took over the daytoday operations of the lasater companies while lasater was in prison as i speak to you tonight she is responsible for the daily administration of the clinton white house the newspaper is careful to point out that there is no evidence to support any indictment of ms thomasson or establish a direct connection between the illegal activity that led to the conviction of lasater and the presidents brother now harkening back to an earlier washington scandal one has to wonder what did ms thomasson know about the illegal activity which surrounded her and when did she realize that her boss lasater was a largescale drug pusher the albuquerque journal found no one in that firm no one in that firm other than ms thomasson the chief financial officer had any doubt about what was going on in the lasater companies i quote the newspapers story former lasater employees interviewed by the fbi said tney left or joined the firm between 1982 and 1985 because of its reputation tor cocaine use as the chief financial officer for lasater during that period are we to believe that ms thomasson now the chief personnel director at the whitehouse haa no clue about what was going on in the company the albuquerque journal reported that the fbi received sworn statements from lasater employees therethat were there at christmas parties at which cocaine was available in ashtrays cocaine was freely available at lasater company outings in lexington ky hot springs ar and elsewhere according to lasater employees reporters dick lynch and mike gallagher quote federal grand jury testimony which said that cocaine was served like hors doeuvres but we are asked to believe that the chief financial officer even though everybody else in that firm knew about it knew nothing of this and we are talking about ms thomasson ms thomasson patsy thomasson was a key player in the lasater operations the newspaper cites numerous public and court records which show her as president of the various lasater enterprises including new mexicos angel fire corp which lasater purchased in 1984 and sold in 1987 articles of incorporation show that thomasson as an incorporator of the phoenix group which was the successor to lasater co records of the sale of angel fire in 1987 to a texas investment partnership bear patsy thomassons signature she was tied to mr lasater all the way through all of his operations at the time of this sale the customs service and the fbi were busy investigating money laundering and drug trafficking she signed the partnership agreement the two agencies formed an organized crime drug enforcement task force and named lasater as the chief target of the probe pasty thomasson was given power of attorney power of attorney by mr lasater in january 1987 while he was in prison and surprisingly appears to still be acting as a registered agent for lasaters phoenix mortgage co calls by the newspaper to patsy thomasson at the white house were not returned i understand ms thomasson has taken leave of absense from her position as the director of administration for the president i continue to be concerned about the presidents association with people like mr lasater pardoning him after he was convicted of dealing in drugs giving him 65 million i believe in state bonds during the time he was being investigated and later indicted by the arkansas state police and the federal authorities for drug trafficking i continue to be concerned about his association president clintons with people like mr lasater and ms thomasson in the very limited hearings that we had on

request for an increase in his white house budget when all is said and done the appropriations committees response funds white house activities at precisely the same level they were funded in 1992 george bushs last year yet as a candidate bill clinton talked about a 25percent cut in the white house staff many anericans are wondering at current levels whether we are not paying too much already particularly in light of the continuing allegations of grave misconduct by members of the white house staff yet bill clinton the man who promised a 25percent cut tb the american people has this year proposed an 8percent increase for the white house budgetv i congratulate my colleague the kdntlelnan from florida who did not see fit to give mr clinton more money but is instead proposing that we hold him to at least some of the spending cuts that he proposed as a candidate in light of what the white house staff has been up to it seems to me they hardly deserve a raise just 18 months ago the clinton white house started out with travelgate it consisted in the firing and smearing of honest career employees in the white house for the benefit of the clintons relatives and campaign workers even the white house press corps were scandalized by such a noxious mixture of cronyism political manipulation of law enforcement and scapegoating the likes of which washington has not seen since the spoils system was first set into motion by andrew jackson all of this certainly set the tone for what we have now come to know as the prototypical clinton scandal the cornercutting the greed cronyism and above all the deceit there has been more serious misconduct by the clinton white house than travelgate but certainly nothing more contemptible than firing and smearing longtime apolitical lowlevel government workers in order to benefit the presidents cousin and his wealthiest friends no less disgraceful was the tampering with the fbi by the white house counsels office the office in which i once served as senior associate counsel to the president the white house counsel is supposed to be preeminently responsible for preventing ethical lapses by the president and senior white house officials instead it was this white house counsels office that was the very source of the scandal including flagrant qbvious misconduct by white house lawyer william kennedy who did not contact the attorney general who did not contact fbi director sessions but interfered directly in the operations of the fbi to target specific individuals yet kennedy remains in the white house two reprimands and several additional scandals later as a seemingly permanent sourceof ethical trouble for this president and the other white house staff as we all know mr kennedy like webb hubble and vince foster and hillary rodham clinton was part ofthe same law firm that represented arkansas wheeler dealers in whitewater and madison savings and loan and dozens of other transactions including the clintons own personal finances one of the most unsavory aspects of this staff arrangement is the cronyism from the first it turned the highest echelon s of the white house legal staff and the justice department into little more than the washington branch office of the kose law firm the predictable result was the president and hillary rodham clinton felt they could treat the white house lawyers as their personal lawyers bu t federal law prohibits government employees including the white house counsels office from performing private services for the president yet shortly before his death vince foster was working in his white house office in the west wing on government time at taxpayer expense at preparing the delinquent whitewater tax returns not only was this improper because it was the personal investment business of the clintons rather than official business but it also covered a period well before the clintons took office most observers who have commented on this fact have speculated on its relevance to mr fosters death as a former member of the counsels office i am at least as struck by its obvious impropriety using a fulltime government lawyer to work on the clinton familys personal business affairs is clearly improper i recall very well the extraordinary pains that for example president reagan took to ensure that none of the white house lawyers worked on his personal business his tax returns were prepared by his own private lawyers and his accountants even his blind trust which unlike the clintons was set up before his inauguration was prepared at his personal expense obviously the clinton white house does not follow the same ethical guidelines what does this mean from a budget standpoint obviously it means today in 1994 we are already paying for too much white house staff yet the size and the composition of the white house staff whose budget we are debating foday is itself another mystery the clintons have repeatedly denied requests from congress for a list of white house staff members and salary levels"], [0.004065786954015493, 0.004065786954015493, 0, "this one to me speaks volumes about where we are as a soclety it is unbelievable to realize that during the same 30year period violent crime has gone up 560 percent the fbi tells us and i find this unbelievable but i do believe it because it is their figures and they are based on their analysis that during the life of an individual 8 out of 10 americans will be the victim of a violent crime that is truly shocking but we all know it do we not look at what is happening in our communities this next oneis fascinating we just heard how during the 0year period that spending at al levels of government has gone up fivefold and welfare spendinghas 630 percent this next chart tells us about the miserable failure of liberalism in this country this chart shows starting hack here you can see in the 50s here is the poverty rate the poverty rate if falling falling falling falling and falling look when it levels offand goes back up this happens when lbj comes into power and launches the war on poverty look at the dramatic increases in spending the more spending goes up look what is happening to this line the line is level it goes down it goes up a little bit then herwe axre in 1990 whereit starts heading up of course these are the last years we have figures for so i cannot tell you more recently but the factof the matter is we have spent in this 30year period i believe 3 5 trillion that put us deeply in debt to alleviate poverty we have created a dependent culture that just saps up more and more of out taxpayer dollars this is resulting in broken homes and more violent crime of enormous proportions this is why we have got to have further time to really talk about this on another occasion next is births to unmarried women look at this line right here in 1960 it was about 5 percent of unmarried women who gave birth look over here in 1990 we are almost at 28 percent a fivefold increase what is happening to these children these children are emotionally deprived for the most part you saw that statistic on the 560percent increase in violent crime the fastest growing component of those violent crimes is juvenile crimes that is what we are creating by the social policies that are entirely misplaced here is the chart that illustrates the increase in welfare spending it is never enough all these trillions of dollars and we still havepeople in power in the federal government from the president on down who tell us oh we have got to spend more that is what president clinton was quoted as saying on the front page of the washington post last friday we have got to raise some more revenues and get this economy going which is totally inconsistent why so that we can spend more this is completely unbelievable then he has given us a plan and let us go back to this chart for a minute a plan which is going to add 1 trillion to the national debt cumulatively and which is going to end us up after the largest tax increase in history at the end of the clinton 5year plan with an annual budget deficit of s228 5 billion some plan the famlily we see federal taxes look at this increase in the average family with median income a family of four in 1948 paid about 2 percent of its total income to the unitedstates government in taxes the same family in 1986 paid 24 percent of its income to the unitedstates government in taxes and that figure went up where by 1990 it looks like over 25 percent now from 2 to 25 percent is a twelvefold increase a 1 200percent increase in taxes to the federal government that is truly dramatic this last chart which i think is very illustrative and maybe we can end on this note represents the federal budget deficit the annual deficit going clear back to the 1940s these are inflation adjusted now of course look at what we have during the world war ii years we have annual budget deficits one of them here looks like about 1943 we have an annual budget deficit inflation adjusted of about 680 billion this is truly staggering but look at what happens here of course during the war years this goes on then we get right to here which appears to be about 1947 you can see what it is it is about 180 billion a dramatic reduction just by way of comparison our budget deficit this year is 320 billion for the fiscal year ending september 30 we are not in world war ii under the clinton plan in 5 years we are going to go from 320 to 228 5 billion look at what happened here you go in 5 years from an enormous budget deficit here at over 500 billion and my word you are up to here where you have nearly 100 billion in surplus now can you see the chauge there it is a 600 billion change we went from deep deficit to surplus we are not in world war ii right now why can we not act more quickly why can we not eliminate these tax increases out the spending bring the economy back up by reducing the deficit reducing the regulation reducing the burdens on the family strengthening our families provide incentives for people to help themselves in the inner cities and in the suburbs and pull these families back together transmit family values make us

next election and ask for their constituents votes after raising their taxes by 402 billion 402 billion = billion in new taxes and 74 billion in hidden taxes that they are not owning up to 402 billion their net spending cuts over 5 years are 3 billion and that includes 112 billion in defense cuts so if you take the defense cuts out that were going to take place anyhow you are actually increasing domestic spending by 109 billion you tell the american people you are going to get control of spending you are going to cut this deficit and you are increasing domestic spending 109 billion and increasing their tax 402 billion more than double the largest tax increase in unitedstates history and if that aint recessionary folks i do not know what is let me just give some information here that my democrat colleagues may not be aware of the nashville center for policy analysis says that this plan will lower capital formation in the united states by 1 8 trillion that is money that we need to have invested for plant and industry expansion that will create more jobs but no and because of this slower growth that you are going to create they estimate 1 4 million fewer jobs over the next 5 years but that is not all this economic loss is equal to more than 1 000 for every man woman and child in the country or more than 2 600 for the average household by 1998 the clinton plan will cause wage income in the united states to be 160 billion lower than it would have been that means that about every fulltime employee is going to take a 1 600 pay cut and on average workers will lose 8 in aftertax income for every dollar lost by investors this is the program you are going to present to the american people i cannot imagine that we created 21 million new jobs in the 1980s we had economic growth and here you are you are going to put 1 4 million people out of work with these huge tax increases not to mention the companies you are going to drive overseas with the btu tax increase truckers the airline industry farmers foundries every industry is going to be adversely impacted by the 15centagallon gasoline tax and fuel tax that is going to be loaded on the back of arilines yet you are going to go right ahead with it i hope you know what you are doing it certainly does not appear as though you do right now let me just give a constructive alternative that we have proposed and i hope the committee on rules will allow us to bring to the floor tomorrow and that is a freeze plus 2 percent i wish my good friend the gentleman from minnesota would listen to this part of my talk a freeze plus 2 percent if we froze at last years spending levels plus a 2percent growth over the next 5 years we could reach a balanced budget by 1998 using cbos figures as far as income is concerned if we go back to a 3percent growth in tax revenues as we have had traditionally we would actually have a surplus by the year 1998 without a tax increase i hope all my friends across this country that may be paying attention to this debate will listen the republicans have the kasich plan which is far superior to the democrat plan in that it does not increase taxes and it gets to a lower deficit figure in 5 years second we have a plan that is a 2percent above freeze that gets us to a balanced budget without a tax increase so if you do not want your taxes raised america if you want to cut the fat and waste out of government spending if you want to take a meat cleaver to government then vote for the republicans because they are the ones that are trying to do something about it they will tell you we do not have a plan we have two plans the kasich plan and the 2percent plus freeze and both of them do it without massive tax increases they tell you we need more money they tell you we need 400 billion more in taxes ten years ago we were bringing in 500 billion in tax revenue and today we are bringing in 1 2 trillion we have almost tripled the amount of taxes coming into this country in 10 years and yet they want 400 billion more is that not amazing we have almost tripled the tax revenues coming in in 10 years and they still want 400 billion more and they are still not

class will be hit the hardest under this plan whether they are young middle class families middle class federal employees or middle class eldery the middle class will be hit by the btu tax which will cost the average family approximately 500 in additional taxes they will be hit with fewer jobs an estimated 400 000 to 600 000 fewer jobs throughout the country including approximately 1 600 jobs lost in my district along according to the national taxpayers union every worker and every business throughout my state and throughout this country will be hit with this new tax big this will in turn hurt our competitiveness abroad as we raise the price of doing business for every employer and producer in the united states this btu tax penalizes lower and middleincome families hurt schools and hospitals and increases our dependence on foreign oil under this tax hospitals will have to spend more or energy and less on healing schools will have to spend more money on transporting kids to school and less on educating them parents will have to spend more money getting back and forth to work less on supporting their families adding tens of thousands of dollars to school and hospital budgets will have a devastating impact on local economies and dramatically harm the physical and educational welfare of millions of individuals the affordable energy alliance estimates that had this proposed btu tax been fully implemented in 1990 virginia residents and businesses would have paid 701 4 million in additional energy taxes a tax burden this large would hit virginias economy particularly hard at a time when we have defense cutbacks hitting our area disproportionately along with millions of federal employees who will be subject to a wage freeze the national association of counties has noted that these increased federal taxes will reduce local revenues and result in the need for local governments to increase property taxes sales taxes and service fees at a time when local governments are still experiencing the adverse effects of the recession again the middle class will be hit the hardest the elderly on fixed incomes are also hit hard under this clinton plan the democrat plan promises to raise taxes on seniors making as late as 25 000 and while the energy tax is indexed the income level at which social security benefits will be taxed at a higher level is not indexed so millions of seniors will graduate into this new tax bracket each year and this increased tax in a breach of trust with the american people will not be returned to the social security trust fund but will instead be diverted into the general revenue fund for increased government spending no country in the world has this kind of tax this tax will be very difficult to administer and will require all kinds of new regulations and regulators to enforce it this bill reserves for the treasury department the power to unilaterally change new energy tax rates expand or contract the products subject to the tax and the power to exempt certain taxpayers this means the rules on this tax can continue to be changed and businesses will be subject to ever changing rules again this will hurt competitiveness and is not fair the republican alternative to the democratic tax plan is superior in many respects and i will support it because it achieves considerable deficit reduction without the burdensome taxes which i have just described my republican colleagues who helped fashion this plan did so under considerable time restrictions and have made many tough decisions in crafting this plan the kasich plan will reduce the budget deficit by 352 billion yet does not increase taxes or touch social security benefits while the clinton plan places a disproportionate burden on federal and military employees and retirees the republican plan eases this heavy burden i believe the men and women who serve in the civil service and milltary should be treated fairly it is important to consider the longterm benefits of having a qualified and effective federal and military workforce and be cautious in producing shortterm savings at their expense unlike the clinton plan the republican substitute wont delay federal retirees cost of living adjustments and it wont put limits on federal employees colas or locality pay also it does not delay military retirees colas and it does not freeze military pay the way the democrat plan would do coupled with the tax increases federal and military employees and retirees would suffer more than any other segment of the population under the clinton plan the republican plan is a dramatic improvement over the tax and spend democrat budget however the republican plan has some aspects i am concerned about under the republican substitute federal employees retirement age would be increased from age 55 to 62 and nondisabled military retirees would have their colas delayed until they reach age 62 federal employees have relied to their detriment on certain promises made by their employer the federal government and these promises should be respecied no other nongovernmental entity can unilaterally alter the terms of an employment contract its illegal and wrong while the congress can change the terms of an employees employment or retirement legally it is still unfair i reiterate that the republican substitute is substantially more equitable to federal and military employees and retirees than the democrat version however if i had the opportunity to amend either version which i dont because the rules committee gagged every member of this body by only allowing one amendment on the floor today i would offer additional spending cuts to make up the difference in maintaining the federal and military employee and retirees benefits what could we possibly cut to make up the difference i suggest and many would agree that we cut funding for the superconducting super collider others concerned could find other cuts if given the opportunity under the rules plagued with dramatic cost overruns management problems and no foreign contnbutions to the projects as was promised i believe this is a project that we cant currently afford given our budget defict yesterday mr victor s rezendes director of energy and science issues resources community and economic development dmsion of the unitedstates general accounting office testified that the total estimated cost of the scc is not yet known but the projects total cost will exceed 11 billion this 11 billion is more than enough to keep our commitment to federal and military employees and retirees if this plan passes the house i would work to restore these benefits by cutting the scc all americans have a deep concern about the deficit which i share and want us to cut the deficit so our children and grandchildren dont bear the burden of our ex cess the clinton plan increases taxes increases spending and as a result the deficit will not be reduced in order to

democrats from around the nation whom im asking to take part in this important survey now obviously this is a computer glitch that got this to me but it did reveal some very fascinating things for example there is an underlying paragraph here that says unfortunately newt gingrich and his rightwing allies succeeded in cutting our congressional majority in last years election and all i could say was yippee and so that was the right thing i also kind of had the feeling at that point that i ought to start flapping my right wing but the fact is that they are admitting here that the gentleman from georgia has in fact gotten his message across to the american people and that we are in fact beginning to win new majorities but then it goes on and it tells the american people a couple of

the clinton administration succeed what tom foley is telling you in this letter is you want democrats in the congress if you dont want the clinton administration to succeed with higher taxes and more spending you want to change the congress the gentleman from washington is absolutely right and i am pleased that he sent me this letter then he went on down here this is a fascinating little p s that

several weeks and listening to what people are having to say about bill clintons agenda my guess is that this is an admission by speaker foley that the republicans are going to take control of the

towards reducing the federal deficit president clinton and the democrats are conning the american people and this is why i checked with my doctors yesterday to get their approval to cast my vote against president clintons budget this vote is the first i have made since i underwent triple bypass surgery on july 16 to remove arterial blockage i believe this vote is crucial to my constituents and the country and this is why i am here before you instead of at home recuperating the democratic leadership claim that the goal of the clintons tax package is to pare 500 billion from the federal debt over the next 5 years what president clinton and the democrats fall to say is that even if they pass the presidents budget the nations debt will still increase by a staggering 1 2 tillion if this doublespeak is not insulting enough to the intelligence of taxpayers clinton and the democrats are trying to pull a fast one on american families and businesses by frontloading 275 billion of gross tax increases without significant spending cuts the clinton tax package heaps taxes on americans already struggling to provide a decent standard of living for themselves and their families rather than making americans pay their fair share the clinton tax plan will ensure that americans will be sharing most of their income with the federal government maybe the president and the democratic leadership in congress have convinced themselves of this but my constituents are not persuaded history has demonstrated to us time and time again that increasing taxes does not reduce the deficit higher taxes means increased spending i ask you my colleagues the question my constituents have asked me how can these tax increases be justified with the knowledge that no mechanisms exist to cut spending in the budget three parts of this budget represent a particularly onerous tax burden that will affect the middle class seniors and anyone else in america who breathes the gas tax the social security tax and surprising new retroactive taxes first the gas tax this federal gasoline tax of 4 3 cents per gallon will be more burdensome to families living in the large states of the west and south california will not escape the affect of this tax this increase will tax gasoline diesel compressed natural gas and noncommercial aviation fuel california will be hit extremely hard since it has a large population that utilizes various forms of transportation transportation costs will inevitably increase the clinton energy tax is inflationary and will escalate the already spiralling tax burden passed on to american families the energy tax will stifle the economic recovery we see occurring right now according to the tax foundation it is estimated that 54 299 jobs will be lost in my state of california behind every number there is a human face a family someone who can blame their unemployment on clintons tax package next the tax on social security benefits or if you listen to the president a spending cut seniors will be penalized for working and saving for their retirement under the clinton tax plan even though in his manifest putting people first candidate clinton promised to protect the integrity of the social security trust fund he hag decided to balance the budget on backs of senors cintons proposal will affect seniors with incomes of over 32 000 or coups incomes over 44 000 by inrea the tax on 85 percent of their social secuty benefits in addition to this these taxes increase the elderly surtax on pensions ira withdrawals interest from municipal bonds and certifcates of deposit the tax revenues generated by these new taxes on seniors will then be used to fund other programs rather than going into the socal security trust fund the president should not

of seniors wastecuting recommendations that have been put before him seniors should be appalled that a president who was not even born while many of them were fighting in world wars to make the world safe for democracy and wordng to feed their families is now trying to pick their pockets to pay for his new spending programs ad speaking of new taxes id like to call my colleagues attention to language ticked away in the budget reconcillatlon bill the measure imposes an unfair rate increase in estate gift and generallonskipping taxes th would be retroactive to january 1 1993 the proposed increase which would raise the top rate from 50 percent to 55 per cent would hit many states and beneficiaries inciud many owners of famiyowned busnessee and famis this change is a radical deperture from tradition no retroactive change has been imposed since the estate tax was enacted in 1916 president clinton and the democrats are not satisfied wilh the amount of revenue mki through the largest tax increase i amercen hi o they sill went to rob the american people of more money american taxpayers are discoverng hey do not have muchleft to tax and to make matters worse president clntons so called budget cuts will not take effect unil he is out of office the crilon administratlon is raising taxes retroactive to january 1 1993 and prolonging spending cut for 4 year i truly doubt that thils is the type of change that amedcana voted for in november eighty percent of small busineses who file as individuals will be hit by these taxes president clinton conceded that up to 1 25 million smal business men and women could be paying this jincreased tax this is a huge sacrifice for the most vibrant facet of our economy the president and the democrat should follow the lead of every previous corgess that has consldered the issue and change the budget reconcillation bill to eliminate revactv taxes when you add it all up clintons budget reconciliation bill cannot possibly shave 500 billion from the federal debt he may ool some of the anedcan people into belevlng that it will but certainly not all and probably not even most the american people will remember this as they watch more and more of their paycheck go toward federal taxes president clinton portrays this package as change for america saying that it is lime the rich pay their fair share however president clinton is robbing everyone in america to pay for the congress insatiable appetite for spending the most common sentiment of the 100s get well cards and letters was cut spending before raising taxes vote no on

for somalia briein 1 what was the extent of involvement by the un unosom 1 command in the planning and execution of sundays raid was operational control of those unitedstates forces involved in any way subordinated to nonunitedstates control precisely who is making the call as to where and how unitedstates forces are employed against aldeed 2 what kind of unitedstates force was kept in reserve to support the contingent conducting the raid do unitedstates forces routinely depend on nonunitedstates forces to provide backup capability during military operations why did it take up to 7 hours for the un multinational contingent to reach the rangers pinned down in support of the downed helicopter 3 it is widely reported that the armored reinforcements going into somalia were actually requested by general montgomery backin early september is this true and if so why were they denied 4 president clinton expressed concern on monday for the adequacy of the protection for unitedstates forces in somalia has the joint staff centcom or anyone else in the command chain expressed concern prior to this past weekend about inadequate available capability to protect our forces 5 what capabilities will the mechanized company with one platoon of tanks give the unitedstates forces in somalia tanks are usually very vulnerable when used in city or builtup area as they lose their standoff and mobility advantage why do we think 4 or 5 tanks will give unitedstates forces a decisive advantage 6 why where the ac1z0s operating in june out of djibouti withdrawn 7 it has been suggested that the force levels we have in somalia are on the minimal end of the scale for what is required to support continued operations given this past weekends experience do we have enough forces in somalia even after the small reinforcements on the way do we have enough forces to enjoy a decisive advantage have we moved away from the decisive force doctrine 8 who authorized the change in the employment of the unitedstates quick reaction force qr from the original concept of a garrisoned reaction capability to their current use as a daytoday military force when the tactical mission changed did anyone reassess force requirements for the new mission 9 given the vulnerability of our helicopters why was this operation conducted in broad daylight how has the somali antiaircraft air defense capability evolved over the past few months since we dont have the forces to maintain open lines of communication on the ground and air mobility now appears to be in question how will our forces conduct future operations i do at this point want to read something from todays october 7 washington post that is stunning it was the president yesterday being quoted in todays paper this is the liberal washington post one of americas three great dominating newspapers all of them liberal on their editorial pages and all of their reporters i have never met a conservative reporter i take it back yes at the l a times one long ago at the l a times none at the other and none at the capital citys paper the reporters with the washington times thank god on its heels all the time this is the post listen to this the president suggested in an interview with copley news service published yesterday that the united nations had changed its mission unwisely failed to provide military operation to back up peacekeepers and staffed the units with troops untrained for their jobs who refused to venture outside their areas and refused to take orders doesnt this sound like vintage clinton the president also referred to u n actions as if he and his u n ambassador has had no role in formulating or approving them the united states sits on the security council and can veto any risolution the clinton administration supported the resolution that established the peacekeeping effort in line with clintons campaign rhetoric of relying more on multinational institutions to address international problems when the united nations included efforts to hunt down aideed and his key aides for the murders of pakistani troope the clinton administration voted for the resolution but in the interview clinton expressed doubts about the operation he said the copley interview we were asked to come in and in effect be the police officer in this thing to start this thing going and then the u n shifted course and said we ought to stay there until nationbuilding takes place clinton said he did not want our young people in harms way in the absence of the united nations aggressively proceeding with a plant to turn this country back over to the somali or to have a longterm peacekeeping strategy that does not involve the united states but clinton made the commitment to leave the troops in somalia as part of the u n force when the mission changed the key decisonmaking point for the president at that time there was no specific date for turning the country back or any schedule for withdrawing all americans i do not believe at this point he should i would like to put in certainly mr aspin should witnraw the record at this point reasons why the halperin nomination morton halperin should not be

weapons so to speak and wait until we are gone on march 31 and then according to clinton the rest of the u n forces so poorly trained will flee that is what boutros boutrosghall secretary of the

usually title our remarks in the record unless we give them a title i would title this clinton quo vadis 4 years of high school latin enabled me to translate whither goest thou translate that here is a newsweek magazine article a long article on values they took key words that we feel embrace concepts missing in many young americans today tom selleck excellent actor and a friend was here on the hila few weeks ago telling all of us he is an activist republican that he could do no republican campaigns between now and the end of the year because he had taken on a responsibility with a bipartisan conservation liberal group to sell six words to american youth that liberals and conservatives could agree on i will refer to one of them that newsweek titled a section of this article on values a few weeks back the word was responsibility that is one of the six words here are the only things that liberal and conservative ethicists and psychiatrists and psychologists and school teachers apparently can agree on caring of course citizenship that is why we teach civics to young kids in grade school respect i guess that is the flip side of what some young people will initiate gunfights over disrespect do not diss me do not disrespect me respect responsibility trustworthiness we agreed that we must teach young boys and girls to be trustworthy and justice we want to teach young people what justice is here is the greatest example of responsibility and i will send it to tom selleck tell him to use this newsweek asked the widow of one of our 19 superbly trained delta commandos special forces men and our rangers that were killed in that fire fight from hell on the night of october 3 and 4 in somalia five days after matthew rearson was killed by a mortar in front of their hangar headquarters while the rangers were being withdrawn angry because they were not allowed to justifiably avenge and punish the killers of their 19 comrades the unitedstatess harlan county arrived in that huge harbor at portauprince on october 11 5 days later on the 501st anniversary of columbus day october 12 the harlan county was ordered to turn tail and evacuate the portauprince area i believe that was the opportunity for us to go in almost a year ago 11 months ago and train the police in some sort of civil decency not to beat women and teenagers with as one of the gis down there said crowbars but on that horrible first week of october during that first week of october 1993 two americans in the prime of life young but in their maturity of their midthirties a first sergeant and a master sergeant who had com6 to love one another as close as brothers both of them married both of them expert riflemen snipers both of them giving cover to our men on the ground that sunday afternoon october 3 both of them begged on the radio three times back to the ranger headquarters at mogadishu airport let us land and rescue or give cover and support to michael durants helicopter crew to his copilot ray frank two door gunners tommy fields and david cleveland let us give them fire support on the ground until the rescue column can get there we see movement in that crashed helicopter twice they were turned down their third plea a long pause twostar general was tracking all of this they were his men he said all right you can go down the helicopter went down was hit so badly with rocket fire although it limped smoking with one of the men with his leg cut off by the rocket blast back to newport and crashed totaling the airplane but saving the crew that same helicopter that came down to a few feet off the ground randy shugart gary gordon jumped off and began to run the first landing they could not make they had to back off 150 yards away they began to run a gauntlet ofintense rifle and automatic weapons fire and rpg fire rocketpropelled grenades they are running toward durants helicopter when they got to the helicopter all four men were alive but so badly injured from the hard impact that not one of them could undohis own seatbelt and get out of the plane in the helicopter the aircraft commander sits on the right side because of the collective in some helicopters that only have one collective so durant was luckily on the right side which is the side of the helicopter up against a building the tail forming a slight wedge a v one of the men i think shugart took ray frank 35 combat months in vietnam and within a month of retirement lay him in the open side on the street take out one of the gunners tommy fields on the right side they take out michael durant thank god he is still with his fariily today and they take out david cleveland the other door gunner he is alive smiling at durant durant told me this personally he laid them on the right side the side against the wall we do not know what the fate of david cleveland was except that his burned remains came back to dover we do not know the final moments of tommy fields or ray frank michael durant chief warrant officer did hear shugart hit gordon gave him the last few rounds for an m16 rifle he had given him all that gary gordon had was his beretta pistol he went back around the front of the helicopter to hold off literally hundreds of people on the slim chance that a caravan of hummvess might arrive with enough firepower to rescue these four badly injured crewmen then michael durant heard gary gordon moan as he was struck as he had heard shugart moan when he was struck then the crowd came around the front overwhelmed david cleveland alive and michael durant alive and only durant is here to tell the story gary gordon and randy shugart got the medal of honor i asked that they be awarded that before i knew their names and knew the full story because i had heard that they had begged to go down and try and rescue this second helicopter shot down october 3 there was a ceremony at th white house may 23 where the men were posthumously awarded the medal of honor given to their beautiful young widows one of the fathers herb shugart with his wife lois at his side randys mom and dad refused to shake clintons hand he said you had flown aideed down to kenya you have treated him like a victor you do not know enough about military operations you should not be the commanderinchief you let my son down and you let aideed live now these men are dead words to that effect at the end he told him i have nothing more to say to you this is a scene i do not want to see reenacted in the white house as another mother father or widow refuses to shake clintons hand

the wife of sergeant gary gordon wrote to her children ian and brittany to be read many times in their youth and their adulthood as they grow up the italicized prologue says in 1993 master sergeant gary gordon was killed trying to rescue a fellow soldier in mogadishu somalia his widow carmen and their two children ian 6 and brittany 3 live in southern pines north carolina close to the military community that they love the special forces community in what they call the worlds greatest fort fort bragg carmen writes my dearest ian and brittany i hope that in the final moments of your fathers life his last thoughts were not of us as he lay dying i wanted him to think only of the mission to which he pledged himself as you grow older if i can show you the love and responsibility he felt for his family you will understand my feelings i did not want him to think of me or of you because i did not want his heart to break children were meant to have someone responsible for them no father ever took that more seriously than your dad responsibility was a natural part of him as easy path to follow each day after work his truck pulled into our driveway i watched the two of you run to him feet pounding across the painted boards of our porch yelling daddy every day i saw his face when he saw you you were the center of his life ian when you turned 1 year old your father was beside himself with excitement baking you a cake in the shape of a train on your last birthday brittany he sent you a handmade birthday card from somalia but your father had two families one was us and the other was his comrades he was true to both h 9432 he loved his job quiet and serious adventure filled some part of him i could never fully know after his death one of his comrades told me that on a foreign mission your dad led his men across a snowcovered ridge that began to collapse racing across a yawning crevasse to safety he grinned widely and yelled wasnt that great you will hear many times about how your father died you will read what the president of the united states said when he awarded the medal of honor gary gordon died in the most courageous and selfless way any human being can act but you may still ask why you may ask how he could have been devoted to two families so equally dying for one but leaving the other for your father there were no hard choices in life once he committed to something the way was clear he chose to be a husband and father and never wavered in those roles he chose the military and i shall not fail those with whom i serve became his simple religion when his other family needed him he did not hesitate as he would not have hesitated for us it may not have been the best thing for us but it was the right thing for your dad there are times now when that image of him coming home comes back to me i see him scoop you up ian and see you brittany bury your head in his chest i dread the day when you stop talking and asking about him when he seems so long ago so now i must take responsibility for keeping his life entwined with yours it is a responsibility i never wanted but i know what your father would say nothing you can do about it carmen just keep going those times when the crying came as i stood at the kitchen counter were never long enough you came in the front door brittany saying mommy you sad you miss daddy you reminded me i had to keep going the ceremonies honoring your dad were hard when they put his photo in the hall of heroes at the pentagon i thought can this be all that is left a picture then deneral sullivan read from the letter general sherman wrote to general grant after the civil war words so tender that we all broke down throughout the war you were always in my mind i always knew if i were in trouble and you were still alive you would come to my assistance one night before either of you were born your dad and i had a funny little talk about dying i teased that i would not know where to bury him very quietly he said up home in my uniform your dad never liked to wear a uniform and up home maine was so far away from us only after he was laid to rest in a tiny flagfilled graveyard in lincoln maine did i understand his parents burying their only son could come tomorrow and the day after that you and i would have to travel so far then there is a bit more our colleague olympia snowe of maine who i think will be

this evening about a very sobering subject about a very dark subject about korea korea is kind of like a grizzly bear i am referring specifically to north korea many have in the last few weeks read extensive media coverage on north korea and the situation that we have on the korean peninsula this is a situation that must be taken by every american citizen very very seriously it is a situation that directly involves 37 000 american soldiers and it involves probably 14 000 to 16 000 american civilians and if a conflict were to break out on the korean peninsula it would involve the entire world not only from an economic point of view but certainly the stability of peace in the world as we know it so i would ask tonight that you bear with me as i discuss a little about korea we are going to talk for a few minutes about the history of korea we are going to talk about the politics ofkorea we are going to talk about the military readiness of korea we are going to talk about the nuclear situation over in korea and finally talk about a few solutions what direction should this country take in regard to north korea let me start out by defining north korea which in my opinion is a lot like a grizzly bear i am from colorado and bears are a big thing back there a grizzly bear and grizzly by the way stands for the word horrible the horrible bear that is why the grizzly bear got its name grizzly bears are sometimes predictable and sometimes not so predictable but there are some things you can do with the grizzly bear in order to judge that behavior the best that we know bow first of all obviously you never pick on the cubs second of all you prepare yourself for a confrontation if you are going up into the high country of alaska or canada where grizzly bears are known to roam you prepare before you enter into those mountainous territories so you are not unprepared when the grizzly bear approaches it has always been thought that the grizzly bear can sense fear if the grizzly bear does not sense fear the grizzly bear turns and runs it the grizzly bear senses fear you have got a real problem on your hands korea is not a whole lot different than that north korea in my opinion now to start this evening let me mention a couple of articles that i think would be very helpful for the average joe and average jane out there that want to know a little more about what is happening in korea i thought time magazine june 13 1994 had an excellent article in addition to that so that you have a geographical understanding of what north and south korea are about and what military options might be available i suggest that you look at the map contained in that july 13 time magazine article in addition i know that many of you may not subscribe to the heritage foundation an excellent foundation here in washington but they have a memorandum it is no 224 memorandum no 224 called defusing north koreas nuclear threat this is written by darryl plunk darryl plunk is an expert in korean matters i know darryl in fact i was in korea i just returned from korea about a month ago i spent time with darryl over there he is well respected i think his article addresses very clearly the kind of challengethat we face on the korean peninsula both of those articles i would recommend to you for some very basic knowledge on what our situation is in korea let us start out by looking at a little geography to assist us here i have brought down a map as most of you know south korea is down on the southern end obviously it is divided by what is called the dmz the dmz runs right along in this area above that is north korea north korea is a very mountainous type of terrain it has a lot of weather similar to the state of colorado right now however the peninsula up there is going through the monsoon rains north korea the access across the dmz is limited again that map in time magazine lays that out very well for you up here on the northern tnd of north korea the largest border on the peninsula is with the country of china we are going to come pack to china and discuss china a little more when we talk about economic sanctions to give you a little history north korea is a dictatorship in my opinion it is a communist dictatorship i noticed the north koreans have recently continued to refer to themselves as a socialist society it is a clear communist type of dictatorship in north korea the dictator in north korea is a gentleman by the name of kim iisong kim iisong is estimated to be 82 or 83 years old and he was installel into power by josef stalin in about the late 1940s in 1950 in june 1950 much to the surprise of the united states congress much to the surprise of the president of the united states president truman this dictator kim ilsong who is the dictator that rules the country today under the pretext of military exercises launched a surprise attack against south korea there is no need to say much more about that attack because we all know about the korean war ironically it was never declared as a war there were still 114 000 fatalities from our country alone so the same dictator that ordered it is the dictator we are having difficulties with today why do i bring that history up it is important history to understand that this dictator has taken it upon himself before to immerse his people into a very intense war and we cannot underestimate his courage if you call it that his insanity if you call it that or his just pure stubbornness if you call it that to launch a military attack now let us move very briefly to the military comparisons between north and south korea again i do not mean to keep referring to that time magazine article but i think it is necessary because that article is very simple and lays out some of these comparisons when you look at the numbers of troops north korea outnumbers the south koreans and american troops 2 to 1 now in south korea we have a united nations command we also have the unitedstates forces we have the south korean forces the combined command in the forces the commanding general over there is a very competent verycapable very tough general by the name of general locke i had the opportunity when i was in korea to spend many hours with him and his staff i came away from there feeling very confident about the military leadership we have got if in factwe provide those military people with the necessary arsenal and tools to carry out their job now let me give you some comparisons north korea 1 200 000 troops south korea and the united states about 235 000 troops south korea has the probability of calling out reserves of 2 million more people north korea the latest numbers i saw has the potential of calling out 6 million people in reserves main battle tanks 3 700 in north korea and approximately 1 900 in south korea artillery 10 000these are multiple rocket launchers10 000 in north korea about 4 600 in south korea air defense guns and this is an important statisticair defense guns and surfacetoair missiles 18 000 in north korea and about 1 500 in south korea let us talk for a minute about the importance of air ballistic missiles korea does not need a nuclear missile to launch an attack against south korea in fact i personally would be surprised if they used a nuclear weapon my primary concern with north korea is that they are going to sell these nuclear weapons but they do not need a nuclear weapon to launch a very devastating very deadly and horrible war on the korean peninsula take a look the most strategic point you have got in south korea is the community of seoul the capitalof south korea onehalf by the way of the countrys population onehalf of the countrys gross national product and less than 30 to 40 miles away from north korean ballistic missiles you do not need even more than one missile to launch into a city of 15 million people to create a panic can you imagine a missile going off in the dmz landing in seoul the kind of panic it would wreak in fact i think panic is going to be our biggest problem if in factand god forbidbut if we do have a military confrontation panic will be our biggest problem these ballistic missiles are located along the dmz several key areas up here and they have a significant ballistic missile system now a lot of people look at the korean peninsula and we should all be justifiably proud about the job the kind of operation we did in the persian gulf iraq was rumored to be this huge force that we would suffer huge casualties that this was an army of might the united stateswent into the persian gulf with the pride of our american people our american service people and we got a quick and decisive victory not so in korea not so at all north korea will have a real fighting force it is ironic that several years ago the north koreans tried to attack the blue house which is the same as our white house in the united states the home of the president in south korea twenty north koreans 20 north koreans attacked the blue house they were completely surrounded very quickly those 20 north koreans had no chance absolutely no chance of survival except through surrender no chance and every one of those north koreans fought to their death even under those circumstances this force has got a heavy militia now we clearly have air superiority north korea has some of the most sophisticated tunnel systems in the world they have a philosophy that the peninsula should be reunified they have unaltered loyalty to their dictator kim flsong by the way kim i1songs son about 52 or 53 years old while the loyalty is not as intense for the son there is still a following of the father son in north korea so this will be a force and unlike the persian gulf this will be if the conflict occurs a conflict in which we suffer immense casualties which will re quire a tremendous amount of resources devoted to that peninsula to sustain that action or hopefully not but to retake the peninsula should the north koreans be successful enough about the military issue let us talk about the issue that has heated up and where we are today let us talk about the nuclear issue we have always been concerned about a nuclear arms race over in east asia east asia is a very important economic center for the entire world the security for eastern asia has been provided primarily by the united states since the end of world war ii for the most part that economic security blanket and military security blanket has provided a great deal of stability east asia has been fairly stable granted we had the vietnam war and so on but i am talking about the korean peninsula and japan and taiwan we have seen very prosperous economies the economy in south korea is a tremendous economy there is good leadership in south korea north korea has a very very poor economy but the nuclear issue and what concerns us is that east asia would get into a nuclear race several years ago we had a number of countries well over 100 sign what is called the nonproliferation agreement what that agreement calls for or preventshopes to prevent through the enforcement of an association called iaearemember those initials iaea because you will hear those a lot as we talk about the nuclear issue the nonproliferation agreement was a hope that we all had that we could stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons and instead we could bring this world together as an economic center so to speak and that the wars and the fears of nuclear war or the fears of a nuclear weapon falling into the hands of a third world country or a country without stability could be minimized well the only way that the non proliferation agreement works obviously is if the participants of the nonproliferation agreement agree with its terms north korea has refused over and over and over and over again to comply with the agreement that it signed on the nonproliferation agreement our president in response to this noncompliance in november of last year made a very clear statement to the north koreans you must never have excuse me i am wrong it is not you must not it is you can never have a nuclear weapon well our president has spoken some very strong words remember my comparison to the grizzly bear if you come face to face with a grizzly bear and you stand there and you look right at him you do not have a gun you have no choice you stand and you look strong the grizzly bear in all likelihood unless you have a cub there will walk away but if the grizzly bear senses that you are going to back off the grizzly bear knows weakness it is the same thing with north korea north korea understands two things they understand strength and they understand weakness if you have a president who makes a strong statement he needs to be able to back that statement up since novemberand i am not trying to be partisan because i think when we talk about foreign affairs we have to lift ourselves above partisanship and worry about the welfare of this country and the welfare of the entire world but since that november statement our country has shown in my opinion a great deal of weakness in its negotiations with north korea example north korea we know has about nine suspect sites for the development of nuclear weapons in korea now remember we have limited intelligence in north korea we really rely very heavily on satellite intelligence and satellites of course cannot pick up what is going on on the ground and we have to have good weather north korea is the most closed society in the world it is very difficult to get ground intelligence out of north korea it is very difficult to do ground intelligence out of north korea very difficult to do this so of the nine sites under the nonproliferation agreement a team from the iaea is allowed to go in and inspect these sites the north koreans have said no then they said yes then they said maybe then they said no then they said okay then they said no then they said come on over then they said no then they said come over and look at a couple of sites then they said no then they said come on over and we will let you look at seven sites but not the two suspect sites this last week they said you can never look at the two most highly suspect sites where you think we are developing nuclear weapons i saw a comparison it said it is kind of like walking through the customs when one comes into this country walk through customs and tell the agent yeah you can go ahead ive got nine suitcases you can go ahead and look at seven of them but im going to point out to you which seven suitcases you can look at the other two suitcases which i pick you cant look at it is clearly flying in the face of the nonproliferation agreement which is really much broader than the nonproliferation agreement because we are talking about a country like korea who soon will have the technology to do what korea is doing and if we do not have an agreement that is enforceable we will have an arms race throughout the world an arms race that the next generation the next generation will have a very difficult tirm dealing with so this agreement means a lot more than just relationships between the united states and north korea or south korea and north korea it really talks about the beginning of an arms race let us talk about some of the ideas dealing with the failure of north korea to comply with the nonproliferation agreement or the inspections i say first of all if you look at north korea they always pay attention as i said earlier when you speak from a position of strength we unfortunately in the last year and a half or couple of years have shown some weakness on foreign affairs in haiti in somalia in bosnia and in north korea and so the north koreans i think believe they can play cat and mouse with us in fact i think they rather enjoy it its a very dangerous game back to the grizzly bear its kind of like poking a grizzly bear when its asleep if its in hibernation and youre sure its in hibernation no problem if its not you better watch out so the nonagreement of north korea and some of the options that are available to force them back into the agreement should be discussed one of those is and i hear it from my colleagues and that is to take a preemptive strike we know for example up here in yongbyon up in that area right in here that there is a nuclear site up there a nuclear reactor there in fact that is the one my colleagues have been reading a lot about where the rods have been removed in the last couple of weeks and there are some that would suggest we take a preemptive strike that we certainly have the capabilities to take that facility out in my opinion a preemptive military strike would be crazy it is not well thought out a preemptive military strike against north korea can assure us of one thing and that is a war on the korean peninsula a war that will have devastating results a war in which many of our 37 000 troops and many of the thousands of subsequent troops that we sent over to korea will lose their lives will pay the ultimate price so a first strike is not a good option even if we carried out the first strike from a military point of view it may not be successful if the key ingredients that we are tying to destroy are stored deep underground and the probability is that they are stored deep underground even if we are successful and we hit a nuclear facility the unfortunate thing is if we set loose radiation the trade winds tend to go this direction would go over seoulremember the population center of south koreaand eventually make its way down over tokyo ind over japan so a first strike preemptive strike against nuclear facilities is not a good option in my opinion will simply start a war well what is the next thing well we heard the president talked a lot in the last few weeks and we heard some very educated scholars and some very welllearned people on korea suggest economic sanctions there are two factors for economic sanctions to work first of all china has to agree that it will not veto the economic sanctions in the united nations security council and second of all even if china does not veto those economic sanctions that china will agree to enforce the economic sanctions remember i said earlier that north korea is the most isolated country in the world they do not have a lot of trade like the united states does for example they are not like taiwan where they trade all over the world or japan they trade primarily with one country and that country is china here is the border remember we looked at the border earlier if that border is not secure if china does not exercise the economic sanctions along that border then economic sanctions will cost this country tens of millions of dollars we will have very minimal impact upon north korea and we will not accomplish what i think is the key goal china in just the last couple weeks the president and this is incredible to me the president the secretary of state have said on and off again that china they think they are going to get china to cooperate with us china is not going to cooperate with economic sanctions they are not going to let this occur just in the last week and a half or so ago china has said that north korea are the quote blood brothers does that sound like the kind of talk that is going to get cooperation from china especially after we have already given to them the mostfavorednation status so we really do not have much to swap with them i do not think china wants to see a conflict on the korean peninsula but their relationship with north korea goes deep remember we were about to overrun the koreans when we finally launched our counterattack in the korean war in 1950 the reason that it was stopped the reason that the korean war came to a stalemate is because china dumped its troops in to face us from the north china has a long history with north korea and they are not about to put that aside to assist the united states with economic sanctions now japan is beginning to play a very important role in this many of my colleagues have probably heard the events of the last couple of days where korea has come out and given a very clear warning to japan back off if you dont back off we have got missiles that can hit your countrys mainland this is more of a confrontation between the south and north than between the united states we have a good ally in japan we have a good understanding with japan but look at the politics in japan for a few minutes first of all there are about a half a million korean citizens who are now living in japan and these descendants of korea came from japan over the years between say about 1910 and 1945 when japan occupied the korean peninsula and brought slave labor into japan and as a result there have been descendants through the generations so about 500 000 korean descendants live in japan they are very loyal to the korean peninsula and they send a great deal of money about a billion dollars estimated as high as 1 8 billion in sympathetic money to korea to north korea every year now the japanese the leadership as my colleagues know they have had a lot of turmoil in their leadership and it does not appear that that leadership is entirely stable they are going through some very trying times we have very capable leadership in japan but japan is getting a little i think getting a little cautious about being involved in economic sanctions against north korea and japan we have said to japan look you of anybody ought to be concerned about this you will be if youre not already well within the range of nuclear korean missiles and those korean missiles could soon contain a nuclear warhead you have got to participate with us we have got to stop this before it gets out of hand but when it comes time to really do something about it as i said earlier japan is very cautious i think they are going to have a very difficult time stepping in there and telling their citizens who are korean descendants that they can no longer send money to their families in north korea well what kind of options do we really have we have talked a little about the history we have talked about the military we have talked about the consequences of a war on the korean peninsula if there were a military conflict in korea what kind of options do we have and again i would refer my colleagues i think to mr plunks article heritage foundation no 224 and by the way it is dated june 2 1994 it lays out some options i would like to add a little to some of those options first of all our president needs to be very strong in his message to the north koreans i believe that our message our president has to go further than he has gone now our secretary of defense mr perry i think has done a fairly commendable job in dealing with the north korean situation since he has come into office but it has to go above mr perry it has to go directly to the president the president has told north korea that their country would be destroyed as they know it i am not sure they take the president seriously i do not think they took the president serious since november when he said they cannot really have a nuclear weapon and then flipflopped around as to whether they should have one a few of them are ok or so forth our president needs to make it very very clear that north korea should not miscalculate what the intentions of the united states of america are first of all i think the president needs to assure north korea that we would not take a preemptive strike against their country but in the same statement the president needs to make unequivocally clear to north korea that should north korea launch an attack against south korea and the united states that we will use whatever weapon in our arsenal is necessary to destroy their country in other words north korea a military conflict would be a gross and fatal miscalculation on your part so we need a firm statement from the president we need to be prepared militarily again if you are going out into the mountains up in alaska or canada into that high country you need to be prepared if you are prepared you are not going to have any difficulty north korea understands strength we have got an excellent command force over in korea the south korean forces that i met with and commanding officers i felt were very capable but we need to shore up our defense we need to immediately in our opinion begin to move more naval force into the area and i think we need to do this very prominently so that people see what is going on i think we need to shore up our capability with our air superiority i think that we have to have a carrier task force an additional carrier task force moved into the area i think that we have got to prepare our troops for war and i think our troops are prepared but i think that north koreaneeds to get the message that should they decide to engage in a war that the united states of america is not only ready for the war but ready to end the war very quickly on our terms if you have a strong defense i do not think there is any better way to stop a military conflict than that defense it used to be in the cold war we talked about deterrence and there is a difference between deterrence and defense deterrence is where let us say there is a fellow named mel mel is sitting out here and mel has a missile and i have a missile now mel is smart enough to know that if he uses his missile against me i can still use my missile against him so mel and i just kind of stay at arms length with each other that is called deterrence deterrence will not work in korea what will work in korea is a strong strong de fense i think what we need to do in addition is the president needs to make a personal trip i think the president needs to visit china i think the president needs to visit japan now the president found time to visit oxford university mr president the most serious international problem that we have right now is korea the two most important allies that we have in korea are japan and china and i support you 100 percent in working with those two partners but maybe you ought to go sit down with them maybe you ought to tell them the importance of their cooperation in nonproliferation of nuclear weapons in east asia maybe we ought to make it clear to japan that it cannot continue to allow its citizens to send 1 billion or 2 billion a year to korea if in turn they expect our young american soldiers to go over and be willing to give their lives in defense of japan i think that our president has got a lot of groundwork to cover i think he is capable of doing it there has been a lot of criticism about the presidents military background there has been a lot of criticism and i happen to think a lot of this criticism is justified on our presidents weakness in foreign policy but our president does have the capability to communicate and if ever there was a time for communication if ever there was a time for us to get behind our president and hope that he could communicate in the clearest of terms it is now on the korean peninsula to the people of this country and to my colleagues in here this is a very very critical situation it is a situation that we cannot allow to continue without clear policy and a clear message and a showing of strength we do not want a war on the korean peninsula any more than you want to run into a wounded grizzly bear on a trail up in the mountains you do not want that to happen finally and let me conclude with this one of the things that i think is very important for us is to approach north korea and say whats up we know you know what is going to happen if you continue to push these nuclear weapons you have got a lot better future for your country and a lot better future for the people of your country if you join the market look at what has happened in russia look how much chinahas improved look at your own blood brothers down in south korea look what its done to their economy when they come into a capitalized type of system you dont have to ct~ange from communism to capitalism open up your doors open up your doors to the rest of the world stop your isolation it is a winwin deal for you north korea if you stop the isolation come into the world start trading with the world youre going to have north korea countries throughout the entire world giving you foreign aid youre going to have countries throughout the entire world wanting to invest in your country to put money into your country what is wrong with a country like north korea when they have such isolation not long ago i had an opportunity to give some graduation speeches and i talked about the difference between an 18yearold in north korea who would probably never taste ice cream in his lifetime has probably never seen a tv certainly has never flown on an airplane unless it is a military aircraft has never owned a car probably has never driven a car has never had an opportunity to go to department stores and pick out clothes has never had an opportunity to go down and buy a soda pop or enjoy some of the finer points of life compare that with the south korean 18yearold who has had those opportunities ice cream is abundant tvs modern life it is there north korea can provide that for its citizens and keep the hierarchy that it has they can preserve that leadership all that leadership has to do is open up to the rest of the world i hope that that is what north korea does every american should hope that that is what north korea does it would stop the proliferation at least starting on the korean peninsula it would show that there is an effective way to deal with nuclear proliferation and military confrontation without missiles i hope that is what happens but we as a country must prepare that that may not be what happens we as a country must be prepared not only for the best of times but for the worst of times right now the pendulum seems to be tipping toward the worst of times on the korean peninsula do not go to bed tonight thinking that there is going to be an attack tomorrow but do go to bed tonight thinking about the consequences if there is an attack tomorrow and the importance of our president of the leadership of this country to step forward and make sure that a military confrontation on the korean peninsula does not take place"]], "top_incorrect": [[0.9947765879333019, 0.005223412066698074, 1, "for 53 consecutive years american

budget amendment i would like the members of the house to focus just for a second on what is special about this debate on the bartontauzin amendment this debate today focuses not necessarily on whether or not one supports the concept of a balanced budget amendment i believe agreat majority of this house does this debate focuses on how we are going to achieve that balanced budget amendment this amendment the bartontauzin amendment is very much like the stenholm amendment the only difference in the balanced budget features of this amendment and the stenholm amendment is the year 2000 date for the accomplishment of the balanced budget goal but the major difference the thing we ought to be focusing on today is the feature of the bartontauzin amendment that provides for some restraint on tax increases as a vehicle for achieving balanced budgets now what restraint is in here the restraint that is in here is a simple provision that says in achieving the balanced budget that all of us or a great majority of us i think want to achieve that we ought to do it without raising taxes any higher than any greater than the income of americans is growing at the time we raise taxes in other words government should not grow faster than the pocketbooks of americans americans individually and american businesses it says in effect that we can raise taxes if we need to in short the amendment we debate today says that while the government of the united states may in fact have to raise taxes it ought not do it except with a supermajority any faster than the rate of growth of income in american pocketbooks and businesses in short it says balance the budget over the term allotted principally by reducing spending wherever you can if we were to poll americans across the width and breadth of this country today i think they would agree with that principle so we are debating an amendment today that really incorporates the stenholm balanced budget amendment with the addition that the balanced budget amendment ought to be achieved with as little as possible in tax increases and as much as possible in spending cuts if members agree with that principle they will want to vote for this version of the balanced budget amendment those who have said they are concerned about this version ought to be concerned because this is a real amendment if we really want to achieve a balanced budget for america we ought to be concerned that this amendment will do it and other amendments may not do it so if we have a concern about the effect of the unitedstates constitution commanding those of us representing this nation in this body to abide by responsible spending limits then we ought to be concerned abut this amendment it will require this congress and this nation to put our fiscal house order without unnecessarily raising taxes again on the american public people have asked us why should we do this at all let me give the members an illustration of the most important reason why i think it is important for congress to enact not only the balanced budget amendment but this version of it with a limitation on tax increases it is incumbent because we need to examine the reason the mandate is normally sent to washington in town meetings across my district folks ask why do you guys keep spending money over and above the income of this government why do you keep putting us in debt why do you keep crowding out money we could be using for useful purposes in america by paying all this interest on the debt conservatives and liberals make this same request why dont you put your house in order quit paying all this interest and spend the money we send you on projects that are good for america instead of paying interest on debt to countries all over the world who buy our tbills the answer is that most congressmen come to washington with a simple mandate the mandate is go to washington get as many of those federal dollars we send you backinto your district and spend them at home the truth is that we all carry out that mandate pretty doggone good the truth is that most of us end up bringing more money home than our folks have sent up here that is why we are out of balance we carry out the mandate pretty good i think what americans want to do in this balanced budget debate is to ask us to give them a chance in voting for a constitutional amendment that would send a new mandate to all of us who come up here and the mandate would be very simple do what you can about bringing projects home do what you can about carrying out the necessary spending in government but dont spend more money than we send you each year at some point stop this crazy borrowing trend that is crowding out the funds we need to carry on a progressive and good economy for our country in short i think the message americans have been sending us in town hall meetings in our mail and in messages to members of congress is that while we want you to do a good job in making sure that projects come home and federal programs are still carried out we also want you to carry out a new mandate and the mandate is dont spend more money than we have sent you and quit raising taxes on us in order to accomplish the purpose of a balanced budget amendment the bartontauzin amendment is the only one that carries out those two mandates of urging americans to live in this government within our means and second to stop raising taxes unnecessarily because this continuous spending spree is about to sink this country into debt from which we cannot recover"],

country i am delighted that the house is considering legislation that will designate the weeks of june 6 1993 and june 5 1994 as lyme disease awareness week the senate approved identical legislation introduced by senator joseph lieberman of connecticut on march 26 1993 i appreciate this opportunity to provide my colleagues with some background on this disease and why the designation of this week is so important lyme disease is a bacterial infection that is spread by the deer tick which is slightly smaller than the dog tick although lyme disease was first officially reported lust 18 years ago in lyme connecticut it has fast become the most common tickbome disease and one of the fastest spreading infectious diseases in the united states once considered to be a regional problem found in the northeast 49 of the 50 states have now reported cases of lyme disease the deer tick lives in grasses along the shore in fields and at the edge of woodlands many people on eastern long island have expressed concern about going to the beach taking a walk in the woods or sitting in their own backyard for fear of getting this debilitating disease many people never even know that they have been bitten by a tick the parasite can attach itself feed detach itself and lay its eggs all without the hosts knowledge in addition due to its ability to mimic the symptoms of other ailments a person may be left clueless as to the cause of his or her ailment lyme disease is often mistaken for other illnesses such as ringworm influenza arthritis or heart disease however if left untreated lyme disease can cause partial facial paralysis meningitis encephalitis and abnormal slowing of the heartbeat severe headaches and depression destructive arthritis memory loss and chronic fatigue as early treatment of lyme disease is the key to warding off its worst effects and as there is currently no vaccine for lyme disease the best defense against it is prevention that is why education is vital if we are to minimize the effects of this painful disease the american public must know what to look for if they are to take precaution against this disease symptoms of lyme disease in its eariy stages include a characteristic rash at the site of the tick bite headaches fever pains in joints and swollen glands however a person might not develop the telltale rash at the site of the tickbite leaving the person puzzled as to the cause of such a rash moreover standard blood tests often do not reveal the presence of lyme disease the key words in combating lyme disease are protect and check protect meaning to protect yourself by wearing protective clothing and repellents and check meaning check yourself your children and your pets as soon as you get home checking is important because most experts believe the tick must be attached for more than 24 hours to transmit the disease in addition i am pleased to announce that a permethrlnbased repellent which has been approved by the environmental protection agency epa is now available to the public this spray must be used only on clothing not on the skin the spray used in combination with a longacting deetbased lotion on the skin can provide very effective protection against the tick and lyme disease mr speaker the prevention of lyme disease depends upon public awareness i want to thank my colleagues for their support in bringing this disease to the attention of the american public it is my hope that the designation of the weeks of june 6 1993 and june 5 1994 as lyre disease awareness week will help to make the

it to the people of guam it is about time that we do the right thing there is bitterness anger rage over the how the land was originally taken in guam but there is also hope and opportunity it is up

resolution its in our hearing record its in the member survey results and its in our final report the final report after repeating the authorizing resolutions mandate that we recommend improvements to strengthen the effectiveness of congress simplify its operations and improve its oversight and the orderly consideration of legislation then goes on to say and i quote in short the joint committee was formed to address how to make congress more effective accountable and credible mr swift argues that many of the goals cited by reformers are directly contradictory he would argue that you cannot be more democratic more representative more responsive more accountable and more deliberative on the one hand andumore efficient decisive orderly and productive on the other well it must be conceded that democracy is inherently inefficient and even messy at times and that the singleminded pursuit of efficiency and order can only diminish our democratic character but as far as i know to true reformers are urging us to commit democracide for the sake of making the trains run on time but i would argue that true reformers can have it both waysthat they can make this institution more efficient while also making it more open accountable responsive and deliberative these goals are not contradictory or mutually exclusive one of the greatest inefficiencies of this institution is the duplication of effort that goes on in our 22 standing committees and scores of subcommittees all because of something called multiple referrals that was an innovation of the 1974 bolling reforms before that any bill could be referred to only one committee but the part of the bolling committee reform package that was not enacted was the realignment of committee jurisdictions along more rational and functional lines so what we ended up with was pretty much the same tangle of jurisdictional responsibilities as before combined for the first time with the possibility that bills could be referred to two or more committees at a time or in sequence and the multiple referral authority which was mandated on the speaker encouraged committees to fight to broaden their jurisdictions even further into the territories of other committees so what we have endedup with is a double inefficiency two or more committees holding hearings and markups on the same bills and also expending time and resources in constant jurisdictional turf battles to preserve protect and expand their own legislative authority what we have proposed in the alternative on the republican side is that first we reduce the number of committees and subcommittees second realign and consolidate jurisdictions where possible third eliminate joint bill referrals require the designation of a principal committee for each bill and keep sequential referrals as discretionary with the speaker subject to time limits for reporting and fourth place strict limits on the number of committee and subcommittee assignments a member may serve on all these reforms are designed to make our legislative process more efficient by eliminating duplication of effort and maximizing the amount of time and effort a member may devote to each assignment moreover by pinpointing responsibility for each bill in a single primary or principal committee we will restore the kind of accountability which has been lacking since the institution of multiple referrals back in 1974 at the same time the implementation of these reforms should help to make the process more representative and deliberative with members having fewer committee and subcommittee assignments there should be greater member participation in hearings and bill markups meaning that the legislative products of these subcommittees and committees will receive fuller and more representative participation deliberation and results in short in the case of these reforms efficiency and deliberative democracy are not contradictorythey are mutually complementary and with fewer committees subcommittees and member assignments it should also be feasible to eliminate the practice of proxy voting now some democrats argue that proxy voting is more efficient since it does not require the presence of members for their votes to be recorded on amendments and reporting bills but it is clearly an efficiency that runs directly contrary to deliberative and participatory democracy and certainly contradictory to a members constitutional obligation to responsibly represent his or her constituents because by giving away a proxy vote members do not know what specific amendments will be offered or hear the arguments for or against them when they entrust their proxy to another member and the resulting decisions will not necessarily reflect the true sentiments of a committee majority and the constituents they represent by the same token onethird committee quorums for amending bills and a new rule allowing socalled rolling quorums for reporting them whereby members can drop by and vote after the deliberative process is completed are absolutely contrary to majority rule and deliberative decision making e h4545 the principle for committee action enunciated by jefferson in his manual should apply with the same force today as it did in his tire and that is that a majority of the committee constitutes a quorum for business they can only act when together and not by separate consultation and consentabsolutely nothing being in the report of the committee but what has been agreed to in committee actually assembled and members when one looks at the waywe handle major legislation on the house floor we are again confronted with a system that increasingly embraces undemocratic procedures in the name of efficiency at the expense of deliberative and representative government in this congress 80 percent of the bills brought through the rules committee have been considered on this floor under a process that restricts the full and free right of members to offer amendments the survey of house members taken for the joint committee reveals that this is not merely a complaint or concern of the minority party it is a very legitimate concern when house members were asked whether they agree or disagree that there have been too many limitations on debates and amendments on the house floor this year 68 percent of the respondents agreed including 41 percent of the democrats and 98 percent of the republicans it is ironic but sadly true that the inefficiencies of our current committee system are being compensated for by an overly efficient house floor system that reduces rather than improves our chances of improving upon the legislative products of those committees is it any wonder the people have less respect for the laws we enact when they see how undemocratically we conduct our business around here we have squeezed out representative and deliberative democracy at both ends of the process through a combination of inefficiency and efficiency both the committee process and the house floor process have increasingly denied us the opportunity to be representative and responsive legislators in conclusion i must respectfully disagree with my colleague from washington on both of his charges that the joint committee never had any agreed upon goals and that the goals of reformers are contradictory the recommendations of the joint committee while not going far enough reflect the consensus not only of the joint committee members but of other house members who testified and responded to the member survey and that consensus is that the existing legislative structure and process are not sufficiently rational responsive representative or deliberative members are being asked to do n we than they can responsibly and c scientiously manage at the committee level and then are being prevented from doing what they were elected to do when a bill reaches the house floor there are reforms that can be instituted that are both internally consistent and which promote the fulfillment of those goals we can again make the committee system a more efficient and participatory policy process and if committees once again produce legislation that is more representative and responsive to problems and our constituents we have less to fear about an open amendment process on the house floor as with any genuine and bold reform effort the major obstacle to its success is the resistance of some powerful members who are wedded to the status quo out of personal power considerations in clear defiance of what is in the best interests of improving the organization and operation of the institution as a whole in the meantime public respect confidence and job approval ratings of the congress continue to decline to dangerously low levels the question confronting us is whether we will have the courage and foresight to reform ourselves now in a rational way before this tidal wave of sentiment engulfs us and imposes on us more extreme and irrational changes we must act now to bring the rec ommendations of the joint committee on congressional reform to the house floor as a single bill and consider them under an open amendment process that will enable us to further strengthen them and make the changes that are necessary in our organization and operations time is running out at this time i want to

when it should have been done back in the bush administration and it was not done when it should have been done in this administration but when it was done it was effective this embargo and the conflict over bosnia were centered around the reality that in titos yugoslavia was the arms production center of yugoslavia and the serbs wanted to get hold of the arms production area and the reason the conflict has continued as long as it has is that the bosnians learned how and knew how to make arms and are still doing it and they have persisted if we lift the embargo more arms will pour into
