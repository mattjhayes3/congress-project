at a commemoration a memorial tribute to one of the great people of the house sala burton basically what i said was that to me sala burton had the glamour of a marlene deitrich and the heart and good will of a mother teresa and the political savvy of a golda meir if anyone read the congressio al record when my distin guished colleague mr edwards dean of the california delegation introduced the privilege resolution they would know the overwhelming expression of grief and love for sala she was really a mother a sister and a friend to all of us she cared in a very special way for people she really did love her roots her family her country the congress and she had a real affectionthose callfornians stick togetherfor the california delegation she certainly loved san francisco she was extremely proud to represent and it was americas perfect city with its great diversity of people she meant very very much to the wives of the members of course she was the cofounder of the congressional wives task force and always reached out to make them feel a part of congress sala often told me of the pride and love she had for her daughter and her soninlaw and her grandchildren she admired her daughters abilities and independence her parents meant very very much to her her mother still is living god bless her and she had a marvelous impression from her parents she often talked about her fathers brilliance and her mothers common sense and their interest in current affairs she was very proud of her brotherinlaw john and believed he had tremendous values as did her husband and values that are known in california indeed nationally as the great burton tradition she was proud of johns personal courage as well and proud of her brotherinlaw bob as well she was very very proud of her brother and her nephew tom who was so gracious to so many of us during salas illness i want to say this about her staff she felt that they were an extended part of her family and they ought to know how much affection sala had for them and how much it meant to her that they carried on during her illness so in a very special way all of us can claim sala in a very real way of course she loved her beloved phillip as she would say you could not talk to her for any length of time without knowing of the respect and love she had for her husband she quoted him often she felt even after he died that she was an extension of him but sala in her own right was a magnificent congresswoman and a very savvy politician she was intensely political and long before she became a congresswoman she served her political apprenticeship she traced her interest to her childhood in prewar poland she said i saw and felt what happened n western europe when the nazis were moving you learn politics is everybodys business she had instant clout in the house when we look at her assignments we see that she was practically hmmedlately after a term of being here assigned to the prestigious committee the committee on rules she was a delegate to the north atlantic assembly where 60 parliamentarians from nato elected her vice chair of the political committee last spring in luxembourg i saw her chair the committee and i saw the love and esteem of our allies and our fellow and sister parliamentarians who really thought that she was so outstanding she knew how to get things done one can recall the many instances in which sala did in fact buttonhole her friends i said in san francisco that she buttonholed the men in congress by flicking the lint from their lapels rather than twisting their arms her style was different from phils to say the least but it was equally as effective so how do we accept her death one of the things that sala was most proud of really was her jewish background so i quoted from the mourners kaddish in which there are a line or two that indicate that thru the long centuries and this is a quote from that beautiful prayer thru the long centuries we have learned to rise in the face of every storm out of the abyss of anguish on the ashes of every destruction to praise gods name to maintain a stance of human dignity and to affirm our consecration to the task of life that was her goal life was so important to her and she was consecrated to this the wednesday before salas death i had the great privilege of visiting her along with senator alan cranston and my friend and colleague the gentleman from california don edwands and at the end i whispered a few words to sala and she said to me and the last words she said to me were tell everyone i think of them and love them and she said goodbye mary rosewell talk which was a common expression of saas we will talk about salafor we will think of her legacy and her values that wonderful burton tradition we know that already there have been a number of things that people are proposing to name after her such as the sala burton maritime museum which of course was part of her legislation to have that funded properly and the gentleman from arizona mr mo udall did change the name in the legislation naming it after her one of the things that i would like to suggest i have introduced a bill that would allow the staff and people who work on the hill to have access to a daycare center and that has been passed i think that it would really be an honor for me to know that my legislation somehowand the gentlewoman from colorado mrs pat schroeder is the one who suggested it and i think it is a great ideato somehow dedicate that daycare center to the memory of our friend sala burton so we accept her death in the sense of alfred lord tennyson when he recalled in his wonderful poem in memoriam when he had the death of one of his dear friends thrust upon him and he was wondering how he could accept this great tragedy one of the lines that he uttered then and which is recorded for all of us immortally is something that consoles me very much when i think of her and that is ris better to have loved and lost than

hours after i learned that sala had died i came to the house floor for another special order that the gentleman from california had arranged as i indicated at that time i was struck that in my limited tenure thus far here in the congress one of the first weekends in which i left and came back to washington the flags were at half mast i was absolutely shocked to learn that they were at half mast because our friend phil burton had died several weeks ago coming to work after a snowstorm again i noticed that the flags were at half mast much to my sorrow i learned that they were at half mast because sala burton who had so ably and really nobly stepped into phils congressional seat and maintained so much of the inspiration and legacy that he stood for and expanded it in so many ways had also passed away sala burton to me was an extremely important member of this delegation member of this house and personal friend as so many others have indicated sala burtons first concern with regard to her relationship with me and it seemed virtually everybody was family sala immediately established a close relationship not just with me but with my wife jan as well every time i saw her she was deeply concerned about how jan was how my kids were how my family was doing this was not just lip service this was something sala truly cared about sala burton was one of the more compassionate people that i will ever know in my lifetime she cared deeply about the dispossessed she cared deeply about the underprivileged she cared deeply about those who were powerless to represent themselves and she eloquently acted as their champion saia burton as i recalled several weeks ago in that prior special order was not a person who had to think very carefully weighing back and forth where she would come out on a particular issue particularly if that issue had anything whatsoever to do with human dignity or social justice sala burton knew whose side she was on she championed that side she never wavered in that commitment whether in private or public of any person in american public life sala burton was one of the most eloquent spokespeople for people who suffered and people in need sma was somebody who in a short time in the house made an extraordinary impression as a human being and as a legislator she was a very dear personal friend and somebody who i miss very much and will continue to miss i simply wanted to come to the floor and add my thoughts to those of so many of my colleagues on behalf of this gracious inspiring marvelous lady somebody who i am very proud to have been able

chairman of the committee on merchant marine and fisheries the gentleman from michigan ranking minority member of both the committee on merchant marine and fisheries and the subcommittee on coast guard and navigation the gentleman from alaska the gentleman from delaware and the gentleman from new york this bill would amend section 88 of title 14 united states code by requiring the commandant to make full use of all available resources including the coast guaid auxiliary and commercial towing firms whose captains are fully licensed by the secretary of transportation in rendering aid in nonemergency cases historically americans are a generous people who are willing to assist others by giving of their time through voluntary organizations since congress authorized establishmont of the coast guard auxiliary in 1939 volunteer members of the auxiliary have been ready and willing to assist fellow boaters in distress in fact in a recent survey of current and former auxiliary members an overwhelming majority of respondents stated that the desire to help others was one of the most important reasons they had joined the auxiliary this desire to help others is the essence of the many successful volunteer organizations in our nation today for nearly 50 years auxiliarists have been doing just thathelping others by teaching boating safety courses providing courtesy marine examinations and of course assisting disabled boaters the coast guard auxiliary is one of the most effective volunteer organizations in our nation and it should be fully utilized to enhance the safety of the estimated 70 million americans who enjoy boating in 1984 the grace commission report on privatization stated that the commercial towing industry should be utilized in nonemergency cases however it also recognized the value of the auxiliary to avoid duplication of effort the grace commission utilized among others the findings of a january 1983 report by the national advisory committee on oceans and atmosphere nacoaj incorporated into the grace commission report is the following statement from the nacoa report in nonemergency cases the coast guard watehbstnnders can send auxiliary vessels when available and otherwise contact private towing interests the administration changed the coast guard towing policy in 1983 by requiring the coast guard to refer calls for assistance in nonemorgency situations to qualified commercial towers when such operators are ready and willing to respond this policy was based on 1982 legislation that required the commandant to review policies and procedures for towing and salvage of disabled vessels in order to further minimize the possibility of coast guard interference with private towing activities when thnt language was approved it was not the intent of the merchant marine and fisheries committee for the auxiliary to be excluded from nonemergency towing however because the coast guard considers the auxiliary to be subject to the same rules as active coast guard units the towing policy has been interpreted to also preclude volunteers in the auxiliary from responding to nonemergency assistance cases when a qualified commercial tower is available many commercial towers are in business because of that policl change i firmly believe that there is enough work out there for everyone and this bill reaches an accommodation that permits use of the auxiliary as well as commercial towers in providing nonomergency assistance to recreational boaters the subcommittee on coast guard and navigation held a hearing on this issue in april that hearing brought to the forefront a number of problems with the coast guard towing policy recreational boaters expressed a deep concern for their safety under this policy disabled boaters are more concerned with the quick appearance of qualified aid than with what form it takes the coast guard should be able to use all available resources including good samaritans commercial towers and the auxiliary to assist distressed boaters on the water the administration recently issued a clarification of the nonemergency towing policy in response to the problems identified at a series of public hearings conducted by the coast guard around the country the many letters received from concerned boaters towers and auxillarists and the concerns of congress this was a good first step however the amended policy gives commercial towing firms priority to respond to nonemergency cases rather than seeking a balance between the private sector and voluntarism i recently received a letter from national commodore william harr ol the auxiliary expressing the auxiliarys deep disappointment in the new policy i ask that commodore harrs letter be submitted for the record i believe this legislation is necessary to clarify in law the responsibilities of the coast guard in the utilization of all resources to properly protect property and lives of american citizens on the water unitedstates coast guard auxiiny lion ear hutto chairnnan subcovinrittee on coast guard ond narigation u s house of represcntotthis washington dc dfar chairman itflito the coast guard auxiliary is decply disappointed that the cowst guard nonemeruericy assistance policy wllo not hanged to remedy either of the two basic problems with the old policy public safety and auxiliary morale the amended policy just issued gives commercial towers the priority to respond to marine assistance radio broadcasts marb by the coast guard in nonemergency cases and gives commercial towers a full hour to reach the distress scene an auxiliary vessel on patrol which is either already on scene or only a few minutes away cannot assist the distressed recreational boater unless the marb is not answered by a commercial tower or until the tower fails to reach the scene one hour later any time a small boat loses propulsion or steering an emergency exists thus the amended policy continues to leave the distressed vessel in a situation which may quickly worsen even though help could be provided sooner by the auxiliary as a practical matter in most areas giving the commercial tower a full hour to reach the scene before dispatching auxiliary assistance is tantamount to giving the coinmercial tower the exclusive right to handle all nonemergency cases this means that our auxiliarists who have trained long and hard and who have committed their time elfort and vessels are effectively deprived of the very mission which they joined the auxiliary to 15rform and the mission which sparks their continuing effort and interest i have discussed the new policy with my district commodores all over the country and they confirm my own opinion which i stated in my previous testimony our people will not continue to commit their time boats and effort when they perceive they arent needed or wanted our leaders have held our operations capabilities together for a long time with promises of relief the amended policy will probably spell the end of our ability to do this i should also emphasize that the people nnd the boats we will lose because they cannot perform nonemergency missions are the same people and boats which perform emergency search and rescue and a whole variety of other important operation tasks for example port security pollution detection logistics for the regular coast guard passive surveillance in support of law enforcement assisting in training regulars for maritime defense etc all of these additional operations capabilities free up regular coast goard facilities to perform higher priority missions which they are stretched to handle under present budgetary rertralnts in summary i appeal to the committee to take the fastest possible effective action to resolve the public safety and auxiliary morale problems discussed above yours very truly"], [0.991414487361908, 0.991414487361908, 0, "i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days in which

gonzalez and mr mckinnzy in making sure that congress acts swiftly to assist the thousands of americans in desperate need of emergency food shelter and health care i am a cosponsor of this bill i wholeheartedly support its objective to provide urgent relief to the homeless now in but with all the hope promise and assistance in this bill not 1 cent will be spent specifically to prevent homelessness while attempting to meet an ever increasing demand for shelter space and i understand that the mayors task force pegs growth in demand at 25 percent in 1987 it does nothing to reduce demand this bill sayswe want to help you but you must be homeless first my amendment acknowledges that our responsibility extends to the potentially homeless as well as those without shelter it will enable many of those on the edge of becoming homeless in the next few months to hold on to their apartment and their selfrespect by utilizing an already existing program operated by the fema board of charities including the united way catholic charities the national council of churches the salvation army the council of jewish federations and the red cross this amendment seeks to ensure that todays opportunity to prevent homelessness is not squandered the program bridges a crucial gap by providing onetime rental and utility assistance vouchers to prevent eviction or cutoff it also can provide assistance with the first month of rent when a homeless individual has found a job and saved the security deposit most landlords require this program of prevention deserves to be a significant and specific component of the urgent relief bill by taking the modest amount of 20 million we will immediately significantly reduce the strain on our shelters and allow at least a few fortunate individuals and families a chance to maintain their residence dignity and selfrespect yesterday every member of congress received a letter from the president of an organized network of homeless people in philadelphia new york chicago los angeles baltimore new orleans and washington in case my colleagues did not get a chance to read this letter i want to quote a few lines shelters are in our view 20th century poor houses they are for the most part institutions that offer no hope dignity or needed support services more importantly and tragically shelters foster a continuing dependency and despair by those who must use them the current public policy is moving the nation dangerously close to institutionalizing the alms house that prevailed at the end of the century we urge you the highest elected legislative body in the nation to go beyond shelters this amendment is a positive step in that direction combined with necessary additional food assistance health care shelter space and section 8 certificates i believe this prevention program provides a more balanced approach to keeping individuals and families off the streets it meets the goals and objectives of our effort and

gentleman from california about 3 years ago i began the task of forming a coalition of hardworking and persistent people who all had one goal in mindto make federal court more accessible to the residents of the fastest growing area in the united states today we have reason to be optimistic that we will soon realize that objective legislative judicial bar and civic leaders in southwest florida worked long hours to develop a plan that was costeffective and manageable and one that would eliminate the many problems associated with traveling great distances to miami or tampa to serve in federal court the plan contained in this bill meets those goals the southern district of florida has jurisdiction over collier hendry and glades counties while de soto charlotte and lee are in the
