brilliant job in putting together the resolution which was reported out of our committee and which is under consideration today i think it is very important at this stage of the debate to be very clear as to exactly what the differences are between the two resolutions we are about to vote on if we eliminate tile differences between them which are due to differing economic assumptions it is quite clear that both the grammlatta substitute and thle house budget committee resoluition~ call for roughly the same level or federal spending in the next fiscal year and both of them therefore require roughly the same lcvel of reductions in federal spending the issue therefore is not whether to cut federal spending or for that matter even by how much to cut federal spending but where to cut the federal budget and how to cut the federal budget it seems to me that when we look at it in that respect it is very clear that the resolution reported out by the budget committee is infinitely more desirable by adding to defense interest and the socalled safety net programs thle grammlatta substitute decreases the allother categories of the budget from 28 1 percent of the total in 1981 to 17 9 percent in 1984 as the house budget committee resolution makes clear it is possible to cut the budget more equitably than the administration has done reagan is using budget cutting as an excuse for an attack on social programs cuts in afdc food stamps and medicaid will reduce the spendable income of over 7 5 million poor and working poor families at a time of high inflation and high unemnployment the proposed cap on medicaid will place an intolerable burden on states and localities and will inevitably result in service cutbacks the house budget committee restores 700 million and rejects the cap the proposed education block giantsi will cut 1 5 billion or 25 percent irn fiscal year 1982 the administration claims that increased efficiencies will result in the same level of service to our schoolchildren when administrative costs average 4 percent it is more realistic to assume savings on the order oi 1 or 2 percent rather than 25 percent the school districts which will suffer from these cuts will be those with the largest enrollments of lowincome students the budget committee restores 900 million or 15 percent of these education cuts the administration proposes 700 million in afdc cuts that eliminate the work incentive this cut is shortsighted and bad social policy the budget committee restores 500 million and preserves the work incentive the administration cuts 2 3 billion in child nutrition programs which will force many schools to elin~inate their school lunch and nutrition education programs altogether the budget committee restores 1 1 billion of these cuts and fully funds the wic program for mothers and infant cliiidren at a time when rental housing in urban areas is in short supply and rents rising the administration proposes to reduce subsidized housing from 250 000 units to 175 000 units the committee resolution funds a level of 250 000 units while we are still dependent on foreign energy supplies the administration proposes to rely on the inequitous technique of energy conservation through price grammlatta proposes to cut 1 billion from conservation and solar programs the committee restores 350 million for these programs qrammlatta suggests a cut of 25 percent in lowincome energy assistance the committee restores 400 million or 80 percent of these cuts finally grammlatta assumes that the strategic petroleum reserve can be entirely funded through the sale of bonds it is bad policy to rely totally on untested schemes in so important an area as quickly filling spro the committee provides for partial financing with government backup with the administration cuts we mortgage our future the latta proposal guts the guaranteed student loan and pell grant programs at a time when we must educate young people to be more productive in a world where our ability to compete is eroding the committee restores 650 million for these programs grammlatta guts ceta training at a time when minority youth unemployment is between 40 and 50 percent we will create a permanent underclass with this kind of proposal the committee restores 600 million for training grammlatta mainly assumes that the private sector will provide capital resources for highways railroads mass transit longterm scientific research and development and support for the arts and humanities it assumes the private bar will provide legal services for the poor the reason the federal government is involved in these activities is because the private sector cannot or will not afford them in all of these areas the committee assumes that there must be a federal presence equally bad is that grammlatta assumes the kemproth tax cut its obvious inequities aside kemproth is inflationary we need no more proof that the recent rise in interest rates which the administration is now blaming on the federal reserve the committee tax cut is smaller and more oriented to productivity than consumption when the economy declines further the administration will find another scapegoat in the end the american people will put the blame where it belongson poorly conceived and poorly implemented shortsighted reagan policies the real issue is whether we attempt to cut the budget on the backs of the poor the elderly the hungry the unemployed the deprived and the disabled or whether we move in a more equitable and compassionate manner as the committee budget resolution does i urge my colleagues to reject the republican budget amendment"], [0.003056347370147705, 0.9969436526298523, 1, "i thank the very distinguished chairman of the full committee on banking i also wish to emphasize the importance of his message that he eloquently has given us there should be no reason for any member to be ignorant as to the exact thrust and nature of what is being foisted in the house but in general terms the chairman has done this i would like to be given the privilege to get into some matters of special importance the committee on banking had the biggest cuts to make of all the committees in the house of all the subcommittees in the house the subcommittee on housing had the biggest amount of the outlays and authority to cut the current service estimate for programs within the subcommittee on housing and urban affairs jurisdiction is 40 8 billion in authority we were told and mandated by the budget resolution to take the standard omb cut of 25 percent now for reasons beyond the reach of rational minds to understand the stockman formula says that domestic programs must be cut by 25 percent it matters not whether the program is for education housing or sidewalks if it is a program for people it goes down by 25 percent needless to say this arbitrary kind of target leads to the necessity of making equally arbitrary decisions nevertheless the subcommittee with the great help and leadership of the overall chairman of the full committee struggled with the numbers juggled the programs and produced budget authority cuts of 10 5 billion we made those cuts in as rational and humane a way as possible with the steady constant and undiluted opposition of the minority but there is no denying the reality that there will not be enough money in this budget to provide anything like the level of community development assistance that our cities require and neither will there be anything like the commitment needed to provide decent and affordable housing for those millions of h 3506 co citizens who are living in substandard and high cost housing we started with a current services level that was already inadequate and then faced the command to cut those services by onefourth thus we began with an assisted housing production level that meets about onethird of a reasonable goal and we ended up with an assisted housing production level that will meet perhaps a fourth of the goal in short beginning with inadequate program levels we were forced to go to absurd and inhumane levels there is no way to accomplish that kind of task without pain the results of this vast budget cut will be with us for years to come in the form of overcrowded overpriced housing in the form of growing numbers of substandard homes and in less visible but equally damaging forms of inadequate community services and underdeveloped local economies if the administration gambles luckily and we do not have more immediate social eruptions and disturbances as are being registered in less fortunate countries such as belgium france and even west germany under very similar conditions in housing that is the commitment that this administration has demanded and which the majority here has accepted we have done our duty to produce the required cuts to protect the existing housing stock we acted to provide 1 64 billion in operating subsidies for public housing this covers operating and maintenance requirements and will enable housing authorities to begin restoring operating reserves that have been depleted through extraordinary utility costs the operating subsidy goes largely to utility costs40 percent of it in fact budgets for 1980 and 1981 assumed that utility costs would increase by only 11 4 and 12 percent respectively when in actual fact utility costs went up by twice those amounts the utility cost shortfall for 1981 alone was 250 million housing authorities were forced to deplete their reserves in order to pay their bills the administration also has failed to provide 100 million to make adjustments in cases where the performance funding system formula does not accurately reflect the real needs of housing authorities which often happens in the case of larger housing authorities altogether the administration budget request was 440 million short of what is required to make the housing authorities whole this bill provides a sufficient amount to cover that shortfall failure to do so will only mean that housing authorities will be forced to cut further back on maintenance and other services which in turn would lead to loss of housing that we cannot afford to lose the public housing stock is valued at 60 billion and it is imperative that this housing be preserved which this bill provides for second this bill alms to protect the poor the budget resolution assumes that housing subsidies will be cut by 60 million through imposition of rent increases we reject that because the evidence is that the rent increases could well result in either no increase in revenue or an actual decline in revenue information we gathered shows that in san antonio for example public housing rents could go up by 5 to 36 a month the trouble is that the people who occupy this housing are so hard pressed that they do not have that kind of money to spare witnesses told us that they would have to move out of public housing into substandard housing rather than pay the increased rent the reality is that these are people who would have to choose between shoes for children and rent increases or choose between food and higher rent the administrations rent increase proposals would hit hardest at working poor families who already pay most of the rent received by housing authorities these are the families that would move out in order to be able to buy ordinary necessities even at the cost of moving into substandard shacks who would replace them in all likelihood even lower income tenants who would pay far less in rent i do not believe that the administrations rent increase proposal would produce the revenues claimed and i know that it would only create greater hardship among people who already have as much as anyone can bear therefore in rejecting the rent increase proposal we believe that we are not just protecting the poor but acting to protect the housing authorities from losing the very families that now provide the greatest rents and the greatest stability aside from turning back the counterproductive rent proposal we acted to provide at least a minimal level of modernization funds too many of the nations public housing units are in a state of disrepair it is imperative that we keep those units in operation it will be far less expensive to do that than to pay the cost of replacing them again we acted to protect the interests of the poor people who live in public housing so that the units they occupy will be safe and decent and at the same time we acted to keep the housing stock from declining third this bill provides as much new housing production as possible a realistic national housing goal requires that 600 000 assisted housing units be produced but in 1981 we expect only a third that many to be started from that already inadequate base the budget resolution called for a vast reduction there is in fact no way to keep up existing production levels and still meet the requirements of the budget resolution however we have provided funds for 1 billion in annual contribution commitments for a total of 20 billion over the life of the resulting contracts this will produce 176 000 assisted housing units55 percent of them in the form of existing homes and 45 percent of them in the form of either new or substantially rehabilitated homes the minority substitute offered a level of 158 000 units which is 17 000 below what the president proposed what we have provided in this bill is far from enough to meet any reasonable goal but is the most that can be done within the budget targets it would be a genuine tragedy to see any further cuts in housing production at a time when we know that the supply of the decent and lowcost housing is actually falling in relation to the need for it there is no disputing the fact that in this decade the nation needs to produce more housing than at any other time in history unless that need is met we will see continued demand pull on housing prices and we will see the continuation and worsening of the pressures that have already priced housing out of the reach of all but the most fortunate of our citizens for that reason we rejected the administration plan to stop ginny mae tandem plan operations and provided 1 1 billion in tandem commitments which should enable the purchase of mortgages with an aggregate value of 1 9 billion during 1982 this is essential in light of the continued high interest rates that make housing unaffordable without some form of relief and assistance we do not believe that the administrations plans to kill fha are realistic and this bill extends fha authority and adjusts insurance limits to reflect existing market trends we also provided an extension of the 202 program for elderly housing at a level of 850 million in fiscal 1982 those are the highlights of the housing portion of this bill i want now to turn to the community development issues for the community development block grant program this bill provides 3 64 billion in fiscal 1982 which is a slightin todays termsreduction from current levels the reduction is 220 million the bill also provides for continuation of the udag program at a 425 million program levela reduction of 250 million the administration proposed vast changes in the community development programs taken as a whole these cuts would have killed off the provisions that assure that community development funds are targeted and used in ways that put the funds into the areas with the greatest needs in short what the administrations changes in cdbg would have done would be to make this into another form of general revenue sharing in addition the administration proposed to put small city cdbg money under control of the states a move that even secretary pierce says the states are not prepared to cope with it is also a move that no city asked for and that an overwhelming number of small cities are opposed to we believe that community development block grants ought to be kept in their present form the program was developed after years of effort and in a bipartisan effort it has been subjected to thorough review by the committee most recently in 1980 we concluded that there is nothing to be gained and much to be lost by the radical changes put forward at the last moment by the administration likewise we rejected the notion of putting the urban development action grant program into a block grant in point of fact the arrangement proposed would have destroyed the merit of udag which is that it has a specific purpose for specific areas it is a highimpact program and its impact and effect would simply be frittered away if it were placed into a general revenue sharing type of program at a time when aid to cities for community development is going down taken as a whole the proposals for community development asked for by the office of management and budget and putatively supported by hud would merely create revenue sharing unders new name both parties have agreed for a decade that the cities need flexibility but they also need funds that are targeted and directed toward their areas of greatest need that is what community development block grants and udag does and that is the concept this bill preserves the housing and community development provisions of this bill are intended to keep essential programs alive some programs have been killed701 planning and others on the whole however our aid is to provide the greatest assistance to the areas and people of greatest need and in the most sensible way possible we have avoided any radical action we have been judicious and prudent we have met the requirements of the budget resolution this is a bill that has been painful to draw and ispainful for me to have to support but in the circumstances it is the best that can be done the housing and community development title is realistic and it merits your support i yield back to the distinguished chairman of the banking committee and in so doing want to take this opportunity to commend him and my colleagues for a splendid job under the most distressing and painful circumstances imaginable i yield back to the distinguished gentleman"], [0.003300964832305908, 0.9966990351676941, 1, "today i am introducing together with a number of my colleagues the 1982 housing bill this bill is a comprehensive positive program to address the great and growing problems of the housing industry of those who depend on it and those millions of americans who cannot now afford to buy or rent a decent home this program speaks not only to the needs of urban dwellers but to those who live in rural areas as well the reagan budget program would actually cause a reduction of 46 000 housing units that are now planned and for which funding is available the reagan program is a wholesale abandonment of efforts to provide affordable housing for the majority who are shut out of the housing market today the bill my colleagues and i are offering today will provide about 250 000 new assisted housing units in fiscal year 1983 under the programs of the department of housing and urban development and it will also provide 57 000 new assisted housing units in the rural areas served by the farmers home administration the cost of our program is modestno more than is available for the current fiscal year for housing assistance which in turn is much less than was available last year modest as it is however our bill is critically needed and is a positive program as against the reagan program of wholesale iandonment and retreat the housing act of 1982 will provide assistance for homebuyers who have modest incomes these are people who could if interest rates were anything like reasonable afford homes without assistance the bill would make available up to 100 000 homes under the section 235 q program and buyers whose incomes are up to 130 percent of area median income could qualify the subsidy would be used to reduce interest payments to a rate of 9 percentsteep by historic terms usurious by my own standards but still affordable by people who have modest incomes the subsidy provided in this program would be limited to 10 yearson the belief that as incomes rise people will be able to eliminate their need for the subsidy moreover there is provision in the bill for a recapture of the subsidy payments additionally our bill will create a new program to replace the existing section 8 multifamily housing program under our bill local government agencies could work with private developers to develop affordable rental housing the subsidy payment would be extremely flexible so that the maximum incentive will exist to create efficient and effective financing plans the subsidy could be in the form of an outright capital grant it coul8a be in the form of a loan a rent subsidy or even a loan for purchase of land it could be any reasonable device that would make the project financially feasible and at the same time modest in cost to the federal government additionally the bill encourages local units of government to do their part by contributions in kind or in cash toward project development this encouragement comes through a preference to project applications that show local participation in the development cost again flexibility is the keythe kind of flexibility that made the urban development action grant the efficient effective program that it has been the bill continues the current level of effort with respect to lowcost public housing development and rehabilitation and provides for adequate operating subsidies as well we recognize that there is an urgent need for lowrent public housing that there is a need to maintain the existing stock and that adequate operating funds are essential to prevent the financial failure of numerous housing agencies we provide in this bill for a full range of rural housing programs at least maintaining existing levels of effort the amount of substandard housing in rural america is disproportionate and our program does not turn its back on the need for better housing in small towns and on farms our bill also recognizes the ravages of unemployment with the resulting rise in mortgage foreclosures we do not believe that the involuntary victims of the nations economic distress should have their misery compounded through the loss of hardearned home equity accordingly the bill provides for an emergency homeowners assistance program one that makes loans available to people who are faced with foreclosures because of involuntary and temporary economic distress the bill extends the various insuring and secondary credit market authori ties all of which are vital tools for the financing and production of homes all of which have proved their worth and all of which have earned the support of everyone who is concerned with housing we recognize that the depression of the housing industry will not end until the economy is set straight but we also recognize that doing nothing is worse than nothing doing nothing will only accelerate the growing crisis among those who seek affordable housing only deepen the depression of the housing industry and worst of all constitute a retreat from our historic commitment to decent and affordable housing for this nation the administration is not offering a housing program it is offering an antimarch 4 1989 housing programan attempt to dis mantle and discard programs that an needed that work ahd that make positive contribution not only to thi wellbeing of the american people bu a positive contribution to the economy as well our bill by contrast is a reaf firmation of the historic and necessary national commitment to housing we understand the certali truth tha without a national housing policy there will never be sufficient housing let alone decent and affordable hous ing for the nation we offer a con structive effective program that learns from the lessons of the past the nonpolicy and antipolicy of the administration by shameful contrast seeks to undo all that has been done and unlearn all that has been learned i include

money a fiscal 1982 expenditure cut of around 50 billion in which military increases areoffset by cuts in the social budget and a 148 billion a year income tax reduction when fully effective in 1984 heavily weighted toward personal income tax cuts for the affluent is the program equitable will it work is there an alternative neither the proposed budget cuts not the proposed tax cuts are equitable no doubt cuts in budgetary expenditures are needed they are needed because the mandate of the november 1980 election is qite clear cut expenditures reduce the present federal take of some 23 percent of gross national product budget cuts are desirable too because of the need to get the deficit under control only a budget deficitwhfch is under control can eliminate the treasurys need to borrow heavily to meet the deficit with a lowered deficit the nations savings could get through to the needed ultimate investment in plant and equipment so the question is not whether there should be budgetary retrenchment the question rather is on whom the burden should fdl and here even a cursory look at the reagan budget shows that a disproportionate part of the cuts fails upon those in the dawn of life the children those in the twilight of life the elderly and those in the shadows of life the disadvantaged the handicapped and the poor health programs are ruthlessly cut med icaid is slashed 1 2 billion which means not only less medical care for the needy but a greater burden thrust upon state and local governments w~hose principal fiscal reliance is on regressive taxes like the real estate tax on the homeowner the 78 million pnrumonia immunization program for the elderly is completely abandoned the 91 vietnam veterans outreach centers providing psychological drug and alcoholic help for vietnum veterans are to be abandoned nutrition prograzwt luch as food stamps and school lunches are severely curtailed likewise hard hit are programns to make jobs the ceta program

helpers for private charities such as goodwill industries will be seen no more likewise sharply curtailed are pro grams of economic and neighborhood development and providing infrastructure for americas industries and citiesroads bridges pox ca railroads utilities primary and secondary school education aids are to be cut 22 percent neighborhoods the crowning glory of the reagan program are to be abandoned cornpletely repealed would be the afttion 312 home rehabilitation proaram under which modce eincome families have been getting reasonable interest loans with which to upgrade their homes the cooperative bank which provides capital for neighborhood efforts in food pharmaceuticals health and housing is to be terminated maintenance funds to repair the leaky roofs of public horsing are curtailed and public housing tenants have their rent raised from 25 percent of their income to 30 percent the legal services corporation which has provided help for so many of the stormtossed who cannot afford a private lawyer is to be ended mass transit is drastically curtailed all these cuts could have aved some 50 billion and i have no qua el with the idea of a 50 billion deficitnarrowing measure but it would have been entirely possible to save that same 50 billion without shortchanging really needy people and without eviscerating programs which foster economaic development for example billions could have been saved by cutting down the federal tax deduction subsidy for interest paid on vacation homes sometimes the third and fourth such home and on interest pr~id largely by the top one~fiftb of income receivers on loaru to carry consumer purchases in addition to putting needed funds into the budgetbalancing column sxch measures woula at least partially remove an incentive which now induces people to overconsume and thus have feer eevtngs to make available for productivityenhawking inflationaryfighting industrial plant and equipment huge savings could also have been achieved by doing something about taxexempt industrial revenue bonds for unnecessary shopping centers and in some cases porno bookstores uneconomic power projects like clich river in tennessee or corps of engineers and bureau of reclamation water projects bonanzas to the oil industry such as the depletion allowance which make no sense in a world where oil brings 40 a barrel but equity aside will the program work will it produce the victory over unemployment and inflation and budget deficits which reaganomics proclaims it will flaith over and beyond the call of duty is required to make one believe that it will the theory is that the supertight money will fight inflation and the superheavy tax cut will stimsulate growth much more likely the tight money and high interest rates wiill retard growth increase unemployment and bring about hankruptcies and the tax cut will simply stimulate higher interest rates if patterns in the current inflationary period are projected only about 5 percent of the total reduction will be nsaved by the beneficiaries of the reduction with the other 95 percent as a present spent indeed since much of it will be spent by the wealthy itis likely to be spent on expensive imported consumer goods ranging from mercedess to claret thus worsening our trade balance and the international dollar and in the next round inflation moreover even the uttle bit theoretically saved from current consumption may in todays inflation be spent by speculating in corporate takeovers or in commodit la such as bunker huntand his blillondollar silver manipulations the administration projects the 1984 workout of its policies as producing a balanced budget and inflation unemployment and interest rates all hovering around the 6 percent level the administration disdains econometric studies and derived its euphoric results largely by hoping or guessing that everyone would conclude from the reagan program that hard times were over businessmen should reduce their prices labor lower its wages and banks make available their money for lower interest rates a number of economic forecast4 rs who still hold the view that logical prediction is possible among them the congressional budget office data resources the wharton school and chase econometricscome up with vastly gloomier 1984 scenarios but these economic thinktanks in programming their computers all assumed that the reagan program in all its brute severity would not actually be carried out hence they softened the assumptions the federal reserve would actually not keep money as tight as the administration is ordaining congress would not by its spending and taxing measures allow the kind of budget deficits that reagan arithmetic postulates so al of these projections fell to take reaganomics nt its word however forbidding the word might be so i asked the joint economic committee staff to put into the computer the reagan program without improving a line of it and out came the result unemployment no better than today inflation down to 8 percent but underlying inflationthe general trend of wage ratesstill at its present 9 percentplus level ~ and a budget deficit of 111 billion the greatest in history rather than a budget in balance what would be happening the computers were telling us was that the reductions in social spending would be more than outweighed by the increases in military spending and the reductions in income tax revenue the added deficits coupled with a very stringent monetary policy would bring about high inbierest rates and slow growth these in turn would further increase the deficit in short the republicans far from learning by the mistakes of the democrats seem doomed to repeat them in 196l the democratic ndministration combined guns and butterguns for a major war in vietnam butter for a whole gamut of new social programs and the result was years of stagflation now fourteen years later along come the republicans and want to repeat the same mistakeguns for the greatest peacetime increase n military spending in history and butter in the form of outsized tax reductions for the affluent with a resulting renewed bout of stagfiation and budgetary deficits a particularly unfortunate element in reaganomics is what it will do to income distr~budion it is too much perhaps to hope for the moment that amnerica can achieve a fairer income distribution a diminution of the gap between rich and poor and a closer approximation to the situation which prevails in countries like germany and japan but income distribution in the united states has been getting worse for the last 16 years and now is certainly no time to accelerate the worsening during 19651978 the share in the national income earned by the lowest quintile of american families the poor remained about even but only because of the treniendous increase in transfer payments such as health welfare education food and housing benefits asto the second and third quintilesthose making 10 00020 000 a year and 20 00030 000 a year today respectivelythey definitely lost their share of the national income declined from 28 percent to 26 percent the fourth quintile those in the 30 00040 000 bracket just about kept even and the top quintile not surprisingly absorbed what the lower middle income second and thi1rd quintiles were losing it raised its share of the national income from 42 percent to 44 percenta total of many billions of dollars under reaganomics the people in the lowest 60 percent are going to lose more the poor will have their transfer payments shorn the second and third quintiles dont have those transfer payments to lose but they will get piddling income tax cut benefitsthe reductions from keniproth will be swallowed by the increases in the payroill tax and in inflationary bracket creep being borrowers rather than lenders they will be hurt by a perpetual high interest rate regime and the tax loopholes that gladden the hearts of the upper income bracketsitemized deductions oil and real estate shelters investment creditsare simply not available to them the top ten percent of american families will profit mightily from reaganomics with the lowest 60 percent taking it on the chin this does not sound like a good way to keep up the demand necessary to take off the market what the economy can produce and thus avoid a recession nor does it seem a good way to make for social peace either in the central city or in the lower middleclass suburbs the view that rehganomics in not likely to w~ork is not held just by congressional democrats reaganomics is also viewed with some private skepticism by a good many congressional republicans ranging from those on the moderate wing who see super tight mones as a real barrier to the necessary growth to those on the conservative wing like the three conservative republican senators who outraged the white house by voting against the budget on the senate budget committee just before the april recess who fear with considerable reason a huge reagan budget deficit down the road and many a market letter from many a respectable wall street firm nowadays is pointing out that the markets are not exactly prophesying success for reaganomics as indicated by the fact that longterm interest rates auguries of inflation have been stead ily rising since the inaugural the president in hisstate of the economy address on february 18 asked anybody with a better alternative to step forward and present it very recently the democrats led by chairman jones of the house budget committee and chairman itostenkowskl of the house ways and means committee have done just that mr jones proposes a slightly gentler hand on social program budget cuts than mr reagansomewhat on the order of 10 percent rather than 25 percent cuts for economic development mass transit food stamps school lunches legal aid and so on by cracking down on military waste and by mandating a somewhat smaller tax cut mr jones is aiso able to reduce the 1982 reagan budget deficit of 40 billion to 25 billion mr rostenkowski would cut 1982 taxes by only 40 billion rather than by mr reagans 52 billion and would shift the benef its very modestly from those at the top of the income scale to those in the middle the democratic alternative represents as does the democratic party nowadays a pale and somewhat more human imitation of the republican programa little tougher on fatcats a little easier on thincats and a bit more responsible about the deficit in short an improvement if hardly a call to the barricades while the two great parties of the middle square off on the minutia of macroeconomics nothing much is being done about the structural problems of our economy yet it is in improving our economic structure that the game will be won or lost for even the most admirable monetary and fiscal policies are insufficient to bring both steady jobs and stable prices at the same time the structural aspects of costpush inflation productivity energy and national defense must be addressed 1 against inflation our only policy is supertight money by itself as thatchers england is proving it cannot lay a glove on inflation without creating unacceptable stagflation recession and unemployment yet the administrations freemarket mythology immobilizes it from addressing the wagepice spiral in steel in automobiles in coal and in a score of other major sectors there are overseas examples of what to do about costpush inflation that we seem intent on ignoring in austria the government has for ycara successfully worked a social contract in which labor and management agree on a compact which puts a productivityrelated ceiling on the spiral in holland the government has had a comprehensive system of wage and price controls in place for the last couple of years and inflation is today less than 7 percent 2 in productivity we have only a fragmentary policy though accelerated productivity increases are one of the best inflationfighters going republicans and democrats are generally agreed on the need for liberalized depreciation for business investments and on the simplification and reformp of regulatory excesses but labormanagementgovernment cooperation for productivity improvement is still frowned on despite the splendid results of cooperation in the two postwar miracleworkers germany and japan in lsth these countries labor has been weened away from inefficient workrules and management from concentration on shortterm and financial fetishism why not hfarerica nor does the reagan budget do anything noticeable for productivity infrastructure programsrebuilding america ruined streets and bridges and sewer systems and waterworks and railroads and utilities and mass transitis badly shortchanged so is manpower training and industrial research and development both public and private 3 the administration is considering killing the department of energy but there is precious little of an energy policy to kill to stand up to opecand in the process make ourself the hero of the nonoilproducing worldwe need to build up a strategic petroleum reserve we need to conserve gasoline but instead of discussing an increase in the present 4centsagallon gasoline tax with a builtin rebate for workers who need it to get to work and other essential uses we talk of abandoning the present national gasolinesaving 55milesperhour speed limit we lavish billions of windfall profits on our oil industry but from solar research we are about to remove the little that it hath 4 finally there are

the house of representatives which recognizes the contributions of the senior citizens who make up an everincreasing segmentof our society eighteen percent of pennsylvanias population is over 60 years of age thanks to better health care better housing better nutrition and better community services americans are living longer today than at any other time in our history these improvements in the quality of life for older americans were brought about to a large degree by the federal government previous administrations realized that the federal government along with society had a moral obligation to insure that the elderly could lead safe and productive lives these programs are indeed necessary since according to the 1980 census one out of six older americans lives on an income below the poverty level when president reagan outlined his program for economic recovery before a joint session of congress and the american people on february 18 1981 he stated we will continue to fulfill the obligations which spring from our national conscience those who through no fault of their own must depend on the rest of us the poverty stricken the disabled the elderly all of those with true need can rest assured that the social safety net of programs they depend on are exempt from any cuts what has happened to that promise only 4 months after president reagan made that pledge the administrationbacked omnibus reconciliation act was passed the effect of this legislation on senior citizens programs was severe food stamps were cut 16 percent social security and railroad civil service and military retirement were cut 20 percent medicare and medicaid were cut 10 percent sharp reductions planned for social security were shelved only after a massive protest by recipients however the administration was not content to make life harder for those to whom hardship was no stranger it set out to comfort the already comfortable through a tax bill which favors the wealthy the american people were assured by the administration that this program of reductions in funds for social programs and taxbreaks for the wealthy would pull the economy out of its slump and provide benefits for all americans where are we nearly 1 year after this program was enacted the jobless rate now stands at 9 4 percent nationwidethe highest rate since the great depression this figure represents an increase of 2 5 million people on the jobless roles since last july when the republican program was enacted instead of reevaluating a program that obviously is not working the administration is simply offering the american people more of the same in its budget proposals for fiscal year 1983 the sum of the new budget proposals would mean further misery particularly for the elderly poor let me cite a few examples of the impact of some of these proposals according to the congressional budget office 2 5 million elderly who now receive food stamps would lose their benefits altogether while another 66 percent would have their benefits reduced food stamp assistance would be considered as income when determining eligibility for housing assistance similarly energy assistance would be counted as income when determining eligibility for food stamps the cumulative effect of these three proposals alone would leave many lowincome elderly with a catch22 dilemma do they choose to eat stay warm or have adequate housing unfortunately the litany of hardships the admininstrations proposals if enacted would impose continues medicare would be cut by another 2 4 billion medicaid would be cut by an additional 1 9 bilion supplemental security income would be reduced 286 million in 1982 and 1 1 billion in 1987 programs which are funded under the older americans act would have their funding levels reduced from 986 million in 1982 to 652 1 million in 1983 the title v employment program would be abolished according to the national council on aging this would cause 80 000 lowincome elderly individuals to lose jobs which enable them to be independent as well as provide valuable community service apparently undaunted by massive public support for social security the administration appears ready to push for cuts in the program once again it supported a measure adopted by the senate budget committee which called for 40 billion in unspecified cuts in social security the administration prefers to leave pinpointing exactly where the reductions will be to a special commission which will make its report after the november election the message that has been coming through to me loud and clear from the senior citizens in my district is that they simply cannot sustain any further cutbacks in the programs on which they relysome for the basic necessities of lifefood shelter and health care this administration has not kept its promise to protect the social safety net of programs which benefit the needy and the elderly this pledge has apparently been lost in the enthusiasm for a stronger defense a stubborn commitment to an economic program that is not working and the need to lower the huge deficit brought about as a result of the administrations economic policies i too favor a strong national defense and a lowered deficit however these goals can be achieved in ways other than by making further cuts in needed social programs in my view an essential first step in lowering the deficit is to cancel the third year of the kemprothreagan tax cut the military budget also needs to be given as careful scrutiny as the social programs which have already borne their share of budget cuts we must restore the american peoples shaken faith in their government as a vehicle for social and economic justice we cannot abandon the elderly and

in the congress for keeping human rights a high priority on this 33d anniversary of the adoption of the universal declaration of human rights by the united nations we must acknowledge the great importance of this internationally sanctioned vehicle which has raised human rights concerns to the forefront of foreign policy to be able to raise objections of human rights violations by member

documented the deteriorating human rights situation in guatemala we have been presented with no refutation of the charges of acts of violence in that country which include murders kidnappings tortures disappearances and desecration of victims bodies the death toll from politicallymotivated murders is estimated by the unitedstates department of state to be between 75 and 100 each month while the government of guatemala may not be responsible for all that occurs i find the recent human rights report of the state department significant the government of guatemala has not taken steps to halt abuses or carry out serious investigations certainly to assist such a government with military hardware in a situation already riddled with violence is misplaced when basic human needs cry for

intensified and antisemnitic activity is growing while antisemitism remains a latent and festering problem in other countres and we have witnessed incrjeasing episodes around the world the soviet government is alone in fostering and institutionalizing antisemitism in its policies and official practices only a strong unitedstates human rights policy can be effective in persuading the soviets to honor its international human rights commitments and we must continue our efforts to improve the situation for soviet jews to wish to emigrate and fctr those who wish to remain in the soviet union the effectiveness of our human rights policies has saved lives and reduced mistreatment to insure that this continues we must have a strong human rights policy we owe that to the victims of prisons of religious and political persecution and to ourselves for without the protection that a strong human rights policy brings none of us are really protected mr edgar unitedstates law requires that human rights considerations be a part of unitedstates foreign policy the administration has spent the past 11 months evading and or violating existing congressionally mandated human rights legislation to justify their actions administration policymakers have resorted to clever misleading and inaccurate arguments the following memo written by bruce cameron and jeff morley of the americans for democratic actions human rights law project carefully analyzes the administraitons legal position the memo exposes the state departments legal arguments as a sham i think that this analysis is an important contribution to congress struggle to enforce human rights legislation in words and actions the administration has shown that it feels no obligation to observe the human rights clauses written into the foreign assistance act in doing so the administration is acting illegally the legislative history of the various human rights laws however shows very clearly that the congress does expect the administration to make determinations as to whether or not a government engages in a consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized hum an rights in the case of section 502b which applies to security assistance it is also clear that the congress did not intend this determination to be made publicly finaly the record of the carter administra~tion demonstrates without any doubt that it did make determinations that a government was a consistent and gross violator of human rights it did so in the course of policy making as a matter of law the reagan has staked out its legal position in testimony before the subcomamittfes on international development of the house banking committee and the subcommittees of human rights and interamerican affairs of the house foreign affairs committee administration state department spokesman 4ave stated that the administration is not under any obligation to make a determination that a government is engaged in a consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights assistant secretary of state for economic affairs ernest johnston argued that the administration does not have to determine in the process of considering assistance whether a government is a consistent and gross violator the administrations only obligation johnstona claimed is to be able to prove that assistance is going to a country which is not characterized by a consistent pattern of gross violations in other words the administration contends that it does not have to make a human rights judgment even a private judgment on every country considered for assistance it only has toshow after assistance has been grante d that the recipient government is not a gross and consistent violator these are very

constructive alternative budget to what it is that the president proposed and those who would hurt the little people of this nation would propose here today and in the few days to come i rise to address the energy function of the congressional black caucus budget this function includes the department of energy programs including research and development of new energy sources energy conservation and preparedness civilian and defense nuclear programs and rural electrification projects the congressional black caucus alternative rejects the premise that energy policy can adequately be addressed on the local level since energy is a nati nal concern the congressional bla k caucus budget retains the department of energy the doe was created to allow for a comprehensive national energy policy on energy production and supply problems as well as on international energy issues in addition the doe amasses data on energy and coordinates and funds energy research and development the dismantling of doe would result in a disunifled response to energy concerns and a disparate application of energy policy despite the vast amount of discussion which has been heard on the issue of dismantlement of doe there has been no clear showing that significant savings will accrue from dismantlement most of the department of energys functions would be scattered among the departments of commerce interior and justice another deleterious result of the threatened dismantlement of doe has been the loss of expertise due to job shifts and reductions in force because of these losses of the past and those to come the requisite skil d persons who could run many of the er ergy programs targeted for transfer are not available to the chosen departments one other program which the congressional black caucus particularly favors for continued funding is the does office of minority economic impact the administration has zero funded this program despite the fact that its funds have already been authorized the office of minority economic impact has research programs at black colleges a minority bank development program a minority business loan program and an engineering college program to name a few of its projects in addition to these activities omei has performed the task of monitoring the impact of energy programs and policies on minorities and making policy recommendations to the secretary of energy the congressional black caucus supports refunding of omei in the amount of 1 635 million a phenomenal but little known fact about this administrations energy budget is that a ful 88 percent is dedicated to nuclear programs this leaves only 12 percent for programs such as fossil research solar and conservation programs the congressional black caucus has provided some relief to the disparity in the use of the taxpayers dollar specifically the civilian nuclear programs have increased since 1981 by 98 million the atomic energy defense activity funding has increased by 1 84 billion during that period since these programs were not subjected to the severe reductions imposed on other vital programs the cbc had redistributed 20 percent of the proposed reagan increases in the atomic energy and nuclear fission programs to other energy projects the cbc again goes on record as we did last year opposing the clinch river breeder reactor deleting 253 million in funding for this project although core programs will be maintained despite these reductions the benefit of the cbcs funding allocations will be to allow vital programs which were targeted for elimination to continue energy conservation solar and renewable energy programs have been decimated over the past 2 fiscal years by the budget reductions energy conservation was reduced from a 1981 funding level of 712 million to the current administrations proposed authorization for 1983 of 21 million solar and renewable energy programs were reduced from a 1981 authorization of 500 million to the current administrations 72 million for 1983 this is a trend which cannot continue the result of the budget cuts in these areas is a rejection of the need to use energy in an efficient manner the result of cuts in these areas is the elimination of state emergency plan ning funds lowincome weatherization programs energy efficiency research programs schools and hospitals pro grams minimum energy performance standards for new appliances among others these are effective programs for example under the home weatherization program homes weatherized jumped from 96 355 in 1978 to 291 ooc in 1981 the energy savings were 23 4 percent and all initial expenditure were recouped in energy saving within 4 years the matching funds given foi energy efficiency investments ir schools and hospitals

those offices that amount is 196 million more than the entire energy conservation budget under reagan in 1981 50 percent of the state energy offices relied on 80 percent or more federal dollars indubitably the extreme cuts to the energy conservation budget will mean the closing of these offices or at least severe paring down and ultimately the loss of these energy and dollar savings the inefficiency of these administrations budget cuts is shown again the congressional black caucus tries to do something about these budget cuts by offering an alternative to the reagan budget by offering a more balanced budget in terms of the division of funds among the various programs in my opinion the challenge and the goal of government is to strike the happy median whereby all facets of our national community are served the pendulum of government during times on economic distress should not swing so lopsidedly that those who only have a weak grasp on the american ladder of success

from texas and then to the gentleman from missouri i rise in support of this resolution which originated in the subcommittee on investigations and oversight of which i have the honor of being chairman this evening has been described by some as one of historic significance and that may be certainly the issue before us is one of great gravity this is not a partisan issue this is an issue that deals with the constitution of theunited states and the prerogative of the congress a coequal branch df government to discharge one of its most important and solemn functions that of oversight and assuring that the laws of this land are being implemented according to the way they were intended as far as the subject matter of the investigation that brought us to this point i want to just take a moment to tell the members just what we are engaged in i can think of no other matter before us today that is more important to our nations quality of life and environment than the threat toxic chemical waste sites pose to the very health and wellbeing of the nations citizens and to one of our most valued natural resources our water resources these wastes are believed to be the cause of birth defects cancer and other chronic illnesses now there are reports from medical researchers that claim simply living in the area of one of these abandoned or illegal chemical dumps can jeopardize a persons health and threaten the very lives of our children toxins from abandoned waste sites contaminate surface waters in many areas making them unfit for drinking and for many recreational purposes and where these wastes leak from the drums that contain them drums that are often left to rust in fields or rot in the ground they seep into the ground waters or run off into nearby streams rivers or lakes making them unfit for use for years and perhaps decades the investigation initiated earlier this year by my subcommittee on investigations and oversight has raised many questions about how the unitedstates environmental protection agency is executing the cleanup and enforcement provisions of the superfund law that we enacted 2 years ago to address these very concerns our preliminary finding suggests that many hazardous waste sites are not being fully cleaned up that chemical companies responsible for cleanup costs are not being held liable for their full share of the cleanup costs in every instance that resource and staff deficiencies in the environmental protection agency may be impeding the agencys ability to follow up leads and obtain critical records and that the superfund itself may be inadequate to address both known and potential hazard waste sites and chemical spills these are only some of the problem areas and concerns that we have already been able to identify and develop but our ability fully to review and assess this program to get at the hard information that is critical and necessary to make these determinations with certainty has been blocked obstructed and delayed for months by the unitedstates environmental protection agency you have heard statements made that we have sought hundreds of thousands of documents that is not the case the fact of the matter is that there are only a very few documents that the committee actually needs in order to do its job but when the door is slammed in your face and the file drawer closed you have no way of knowing what documents are actually being sought it is a total smokescreen and misrepresentation to say that 700 000 documents are being sought that is not the case we are talking about a very few but the epa has precluded us access to their files while they glean them of the very enforcement documents we must see documents that may number in the hundreds by the time they are through with their sanitizing efforts why are they doing this what have they got to hide the attorney general and the administrator have repeatedly asserted that our inquiry into this matter and our efforts to make mutually acceptable arrangements for our review and protection of confidential documents takes from the executive its ability to take care that the laws be faithfully executed my colleagues congress does not forego inquiry simply because it may produce information on government strategies and weaknesses the only way to correct either bad law or bad administration is to examine these matters the position taken by epa would mean that we in congress would in effect diminish or destroy our own oversight power in passing laws for once passed their argument would have us believe that the adrministration of the laws we enact under the authority vested in congress by article i of the constitution would fall exclusively within the executives jurisdiction to the exclusion of congressional oversight determination sealing off from congress an effective means for determining the sufficiency of existing law this argument obviously falls of its own weight the power conferred by the constitution under article ii section 3 to the president is primarily to enable the president simply to carry out the laws enacted by congress it neither expressly nor impliedly authorizes the president the environmental protection agency or any agency to withhold documents essential to the evaluation of the administration of the laws passed by congress a coequal branch of the government this kind of slipshod consitutional construction and the unsupported equivalency drawn between oversight on the one hand and interference with execution of laws on the other hand cannot withstand scrutiny and must be rejected let me turn to some of the comments made by the member from the state of new york his basic contention has been that somehow or other the comriittee has rushed into the decision and rushed into the action which is before the house tonight nothing could be further from the truth the investigation that we are talking about was commenced in the early part of this year and has been ongoing ever since for a while there was cooperation but then the environmental protection agency closed its files to our committee and its ability to do its job after a great deal of effort a negotiated arrangement was made but shortly after that arrangement was agreed to between myself members of the minority and the officials of the environmental protection agency they stopped even applying that arrangement as a means for access therefore on september 30 in executive session so as to have no headline grabbing operation the subcommittee voted to issue a subpena for those documents that is when the decision was made that this congress knew its right to get those documents and to assert that right let me say for the members here that when that vote was taken it was 11 to 0 11 to 0 therefore the people who are now saying did we have a right to get these documents or should we have done it were strangely silent when the issue was put thereafter when the subpena was finally served in november of this year there was plenty of notoriety given because rather than the information being made public by our subcommittee or committee that the subpena had been issued it was leaked to the press by the environmental protection agency itself when the hearing was finally held by the subcommitte and the administrator of the environmental protection agency and assistant attorney general appeared before our subcommittee great lengths were taken to develop why we were not getting the information and why the door was being shut in our face the testimony revealed that we were not only being denied files with respect to ongoing investigations to which we are also entitled if we are to stop the problem from happening but we were told my friends that we could not even see closed files on the settled cases those were being barred to the committee now the gentleman from new york suggests that somehow or other the committee should have provided some postponement of consideration of this matter to december 15 which was yesterday well the whole game that has been played all along through this entire yearlong investigation by the environmental protection agency has been delay put off and stonewall this committee decided that enough was enough the time for the american people through its congressionally elected officials to get the necessary information to do this vital investigation was at hand the gentleman from new york said that the white house requested a meeting with the ranking member and the chairman of the committee and that meeting was never held well the fact of the matter is the chairman of the committee told the members who had contacted him that if the white house wanted to have a meeting they needed to meet with the chairman of the subcommittee who was the person that had most of the information about the matter indeed a meeting was held in my office which the ranking member of the committee attended a meeting that was called for by the justice department and when the meeting began we asked what is your proposal that was before the contempt was voted their answer was we have nothing to offer but still going the next mile at the suggestion of the gentleman from california the ranking member i as chairman of the subcommittee did make a proposal did make an offer as to how we could resolve this problem so that the documents which were confidential would not become public in nature and would not even get into the custody and control of the congress itself that proposal my friends was rejected and the administration insisted once again that they and they alone were the determiner of what documents what information this congress had the right to have access to our proposals to compromise to get the information and to assure confidentiality was rejected as recently as today this morning i met with members of the leadership on the other side with the chairman of the full committee and with representatives of the white house again trying to come to some way to avoid this confrontation and within the last 2 hours was advised that those proposals once again submitted in good faith had been rejected by the administration we have gone every mile of the way to avoid confrontration i say to my colleagues that the very power and responsibility of this congress to protect the american people through oversight and investigation will be crippled and destroyed if the contemptuous actions that have been taken in this case by officials of the administration are left unpunished that is why for the integrity of this body for the prerogatives of the hquse and to uphold the constitutional balance we must take this grave regrettable step and vote the contempt resolution which the gentleman from new jersey has offered"], [0.004934847354888916, 0.9950651526451111, 1, "on february 3 i wrote to secretary of state alexander m haig jr concerning the question of military aid to el salvador and the fact that it did not appear to be conditioned on the government of el salvador taking vigorous steps to discipline its national security forces to investigate atrocities including of course the murder of the american catholic nuns and to further implement the agrarian reform program i urged the secretary to take steps to impose such conditions on any further military aid on february 20 i again wrote secretary haig noting that the administration according to news accounts had explicitly ruled out any link between military aid and progress by the duarte government toward elimination of the excesses perpetrated by salvadoran national security forces in that letter i said the failure of the united states to insist that the duarte government seek a political solution to the violence in el salvador as a condition for the granting of unitedstates military aid would create a situation which may well increase rather than end the violence in that country i did not receive a reply to either letter until march 13 the reply was in the form of a letter from mr alvin paul drischler acting assistant secretary for congressional relations mr drischlers letter was somewhat reas suring in that he stated march 23 1981 cc the unitedstates has expressed its concern over such abuses and will continue to press the government privately for progress in this area we believe that in this manner we will be more effective in obtaining results the unitedstates continues to support strongly these reforms which include agrarian and banking reforms promotion of employment and encouragement of the private sector in fy 80 and 81 the unitedstates provided over 123 million in economic assistance primarily to help the goes implement these reform programs we continue to impress upon the goes the importance of controlling violence whatever its source i offer my letters and mr drischlers reply for printing in the record at the end of these remarks despite the assurances in mr drischlers letter the letter also implies that the military component of unitedstates aid to el salvador continues to have first priority remarks by secretary haig and other administration spokesmen and the talk of sending another 25 million in weapons and additional military advisers to el salvador give the clear impression that the administration is still emphasizing a military solution in el salvador the push for further military aid seems to be at odds with news accounts that indicate that the flow of weapons to the insurgents in el salvador is drying up thanks it must be said to the very firm stance the administration has taken against actions by cuba or other countries facilitating the flow of such weapons to the insurgents it is also at odds with statements by former ambassador robert white to the effect that the duarte government has the military situation under control and statements by president duarte himself indicating that further military aid is not necessary at this time i have not joined in sponsoring any of the resolutions which have been circulated demanding a complete cutoff of further military aid to el salvador even though i think no case has been made as to the necessity for such aid at this time and even though i think such aid sends the wrong signals to the military elements in el salvador who appear to be the principal sources of violence in that country it may well be that a situation will arise warranting further such aid to el salvador in such case i could support additional military aid if the government there shows a substantial commitment to curbing the excessive and indiscriminate violence of the military and paramilitary elements and if it is making significant progress toward economic social and political reform undoubtedly violence from the terrorists of the extreme left continues to be a real menace in el salvador the reagan administration is to be commended for its efforts to choke off the flow of arms to these groups however by far the greatest violence and indiscriminate slaughter has come from the extreme right providing military aid to the duarte regime unconditionally and beyond the minimum necessary will only intensify actions of violence by military and rightwing death squads against innocent people in el salvador and will in turn increase rather than decrease armed resistance to the duarte government unfortunately the reagan administration gives the impression that it intends to impose additional weapons and military advisers on el salvador for reasons of its own and not because they are either needed or desired by president duarte it is not clear whether this policy is merely the result of the desire of the reagan administration to make a political point at home or abroad is the result of manipulation of policy by the pentagon as implied by former ambassador robert white or is simply an example of secretary haigs propensity for choosing military solutions to political problems in any event the most disturbing aspect of the reagan administrations posture with respect to el salvador is that it is part of a larger pattern which plays down support for human rights and economic aid in favor of military support for even the most despotic governments so long as they are rightist rather than leftist in their political orientation one would think that past experience with such regimes as that of batista in cuba the shah in iran and somoza in nicaragua would have driven home a lesson that not even the most hard shell militarist or rightwing zealot could ignore these governments collapsed for one simple reason they had committed so many outrages against their own people that they finally lost the support of the middleclass business community in their countries as well as the masses of the poor and working people until that point was reached no communist or other revolutionary movement had much chance of success but once it was reached unitedstates military aid was powerless to prevent the collapse of the regime in fact most notably in the case of the shah unitedstates military aid was seen by the people as helping to perpetuate the despotic regime and to facilitate its barbarities thereby adding to the popular revulsion not only against the regime but against the united states as well much of the iranians hatred and bitterness against the united states which enabled the fanatics in iran to seize our embassy and hold the hostages and made it impossible for moderate elements to negotiate an early end to the crisis arose from this fact of course each countrys situation is different nevertheless the apparent movement of the reagan administration toward renewal or expansion of military aid to the tyrannical regimes in argentina chile and guatemala foreshadows a comparable series of disasters unless such aid is conditioned on genuine commitments and significant progress toward respect for basic human rights moreover unless there is a substantial component of economic assistance whether through bilateral aid international financial institutions or private investment accompanying milltary aid programs in less developed countries the perception will be that the united states lacks a genuine interest in the people of the country and in helping eliminate the incredible poverty which usually is the root cause of most political unrest without going into the specifies of the reagan administrations developing policies toward africa i would say only that they seem to provide further evidence of the administrations insensitivity indeed blindness to the moral and political concerns of the people in the developing countries there is no question about the importance of maintaining unitedstates and nato military strength versus the soviet union and its eastern bloc allies but to configure our foreign policy with respect to latin america africa and other third world countries as though they were mere pawns in the eastwest military conflict is in my view a tragic misreading of the nature of the problem we face in these parts of the world if it continues it is likely to lead to further instability and failures of the kind that we have experienced in the recent past the letters referred to follow house of representativvs washington d c february 3 1981 hon alexander m haio jr secretary qf state unitedstates department of state washington d c dear mr secretary i am writing to express my concern about the new lethal miilltary aid package being sent to el salvador as you know there v ears to be substantial evidence that elements within el salvadors national security forces have been responsible for politically motivated harassment and murder perpetrated against innocent civilians in el salvador i recognize that the politcal situation in el salvador coupled with unitedstates national security interests in central america presents no easy solution to el salvadors internal problems i am also aware of reports indicating that the insurgent movement in el salvador has received military aid from cuba and from sympathizers in other central american countries nevertheless i am disturbed by the fact that the current lethal military aid package contains no requirement that the government of el salvador take vigorous steps to discipline its national security forces invcstigate alleged atrocities committed by either the left or the right and further implement the agrarian reform program the absence of strict conditions on the granting of lethal military aid to el salvador may well provide direct encouragement to the forces of repression in el salvador in order to make it clear to the duarte government that we cannot continue sending aid to el salvador if its national security forces continue kidnapping and murdering innocent civilians i urge you to take steps to make military aid to el salvador conditional upon certification by the government that it is taking concrete steps to curb excesses by its national security forces is working to bring to justice those responsible for political murders in the country and is vigorously pursuing the land reform program

freeze ground zero week represents the basic sanity of the body politic which is increasingly rejecting the insanity of the nuclear arms race those who are absorbed in the arms race do not see things this way whether sovietor american military planners are able to construct scenarlos which they are convinced are reasonable it is even possible that a small nuclear war can look like a relatively attractive option it is probably the fact that major policymakers in the reagan administration including the secretary of defense the secretary of state the vice president and the president himself have all discussed nuclear war as both survivable and winnable although undesirable that public concern has grown perhaps of even greater concern should be the republican party platform of 1980 which called for the united states to develop nuclear supe riority in contrast to the policies of presidents eisenhower nixon and ford who sought eqyality or a balance of terror since this unreasonable and dangerous goal was in a political party convention platform many did not take it seriously reviewing the nuclear weapons policies of the reagan administration it is now clear that they are attempting to implement this part of the party platform and seek nuclear weapons domination of the united states over the soviet union the calls for a nuclear freeze are a justified reaction to this irresponsible policy a great deal has been written recently about the causes of the nuclear arms race and how it can be stopped or even reversed more than enough blame exists for all who have been involved to share responsibility i am thinking of the governments of the united states and the soviet union the military establishments of each country and the political leaders of each nation former secretary of defense under presidents kennedy and johnson robert mcnamara is a man who shared in the decisionmaking that got us in the mess we are in today his insights are therefore unique frankly i find his current candor and perspective to be truly amazing and an important contribution to our understanding of the nuclear arms race the los angeles times recently printed a fascinating interview with robert mcnamara which i will shortly the main point of this interview is mr mcnamaras observation that the nuclear arms race was spurred on by fears in the soviet union that the united states in the early sixties was seeking to achieve nuclear superiority the current goal of the reagan administration and a unitedstates firststrike capabilitya goal the reagan administration does not claim as its own robert mcnamara should know what he is talking about he in fact received memos from senior air force officials calling for a unitedstates firststrike capability while that policy was officially rejected the roots of our current nuclear arms dilemma go back to those days before i close i would like to announce that this week i will be inserting a number of additional statements ing the nuclear arms race the folly of either great power seeking a firststrike capability and the desirability of a nuclear weapons freeze at this time i wish to insert the interview with robert mcnamara in the record intervimw w i mcnamarafear of a unitedstates first strike sun as cause or arms race by robert scheer soviet fears of a surprise unitedstates nuclear first strike after the cuban missile crisis may have triggered the massive soviet buildup of intercontinental missiles in the 1960s and set off the nuclear arms race according to former secretary of defense robert s mcnamara in a recent interview with the times mcnamara cited a recently declassified document which indicates that the unitedstates air force wanted the united nations to build a firotstrike capability in 1962 mcnamara and president john f kennedy vetoed the proposal the memo given to the times by mcnamara was released under the freedom of information act to author fred kaplan mcnamara in the interview challenged the notion held by president reagan and others that the soviets nuclear buildup of the late 1960s and 1970s was designed to gain a firststrike nuclear attack capability rather mcnamara contended the buildup could be seen as a reaction to the earlier unitedstates military buildup and to rumors that the united states was preparing to strike first at the soviet union i have no doubt but that the soviets thought we were trying to achieve a first strike capability mcnamara said we were not we did not have it we could not attain it we didnt have any thought of attaining it but they probably thought we did had he been the soviet defense secretary at the time he said i would have been worried as hell about the imbalance of force and i would have been concerned that the united states was trying to build a firststrike capability because i would have had knowledge of what the nuclear strength was of the united states and i would have heard the rumors that the air force was recommending achievement of such a capability in the document titled memorandum for the president and dated nov 21 1962 mcnamara warned president kennedy it has become clear to me that the air force proposals are based on the objective of achieving a firststrike capability in mcnamaras judgment the air force recommendation went beyond the requirement of deterring a soviet attack as he wrote what ia at issue here is whether our forces should be augmented beyond what i am recommending in an attempt to achieve a capability to start a thermonuclear war in which the resulting damage to ourselves and our allies could be considered acceptable on some reasonable definition of the term mcnamara cited a memorandum he had sent kenyedy the year before in which he defined a full firststrike capability as a capability that would be achieved if our forces were so large and so effective in relation to those of the soviet union that we would be able to attack and reduce soviet retaliatory power to the point at which it could not cause severe damage to unitedstates population and industry"]], "top_incorrect": [[0.9962422847747803, 0.9962422847747803, 0, "jocko conlan whose son john b conlan jr is a former

escalation in armed hostilities in el salvador over the last several weeks and the administrations stepped up security commitments to the duarte government indicate that the circumstances of the conflict in el salvador are changing rapidly from those a year ago when the administration assured members of this house it had no legal obligation under the war powers resolution to report to congress on the involvement of unitedstates military personnel in el salvador in a memorandum early last year the administration argued that unitedstates advisers in el salvador were not engaged in hostilities nor equipped for combat nor located in areas where such involvement would likely occur it is no longer clear that such a legal judgment holds true today the war powers resolution by which our current military involvement in el salvador must be judged calls on the president to consult with congress before introducing unitedstates armed forces into hostilities or into situations where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances further in any case in which such forces are introduced into hostilities or are in danger of imminent involvement in hostilities or when forces are introduced into the territory of a foreign nation while equipped for combat with certain exceptions such as training of in numbers which substantially enlarge unitedstates armed forces equipped for combat already located in a foreign nation the president is required to submit a report within 48 hours to the congress stating the circumstances requiring the involvement of unitedstates military personnel the statutory basis for his declsion and the estimated scope and duration of hostilities or involvement the resolution provides further that such forces will be withdrawn within 60 days after the president reports to congress that he has introduced such forces unless congress acts to authorize the continued presence of unitedstates military personnel in the area concerned in response to questions raised concerning the administrations obligation under the war powers resolution a year ago the state department submitted a memorandum to the congress stating that provisions of the war powers resolution did not apoly to the serding of unitedstates military advisers to el salvador because they had not been introduced into hostilities nor were they in danger of imminent involvement in iuch hostilities instead unitedstates personnel would be stationed in carefully selected areas and special precautions would be taken to provide for their constant security unitedstates personnel would neither accompaty salvildoran forces in combat situations nor act as combat advisers and would carry only personal sidearms recent events in el salvador have proved sufficiently alarming to the administration to prompt a tripling of our security assistance to the duarte government and to publicly leave the door ajar to the possibility of sending additional advisers and even unitedstates combat troops these events require that the administration thoroughly reevaluate its legal obligations to the unitedstates congress under the war powers resolution the bold guerrilla attack on ilopango air bape on january 27 1982 the destruction of the golden bridge over the lempa river in october and other examples of major guerrilla operations in the countryside and cities suggest a new level of confidence combat capability effectiveness and determination on the part of the armed guerrillas in stark contrast to the lack of such qualities a year ago during the socalled final offensive not only are the guerrillas apparently stronger today than they were a year ago but their effective military reach has expanded no longer is violence limited primarily to rural areas but it has instead spread into the capital and major salvadoran governmental military installations even the secretary of state has acknowledged that an unpredictable environment exists in el salvador today no longer can the administration have the confidence that unitedstates personnel can be safely stationed in areas of security rather there is the increasing prospect that unitedstates personnel may be inadvertently drawn into the crossfire between government and guerrilla forces the guerrillas have also made it abundantly clear in recent weeks that they intend to continue to escalate their violence in an effort to disrupt the elections scheduled for the end of march although the administration assured us a year ago that unitedstates advisers would be limited exclusively to training roles and would in no fashion be involved in combat or operational patrols nor in combat advisory roles it is increasingly unclear where the line between training and implicit us involvement in the actual planning and conduct of salvadoran government military operations is drawn the recently publicized film unitedstates personnel armed with m18 rifles suggests first that the administrations commitments to congress that unitedstates personnel would carry only personal sidearms has been violated and second that the level of danger of unitedstates personnel has increased to the point where our advisers themselves feel a compelling need in the interest of selfdefense to carry more than just personal sidearms under such circumstances it is clear that the prospect of american soldiers becoming casualties in the salvadoran war has increased dramatically finally the reporth last week regarding the stationing of a unitedstates navy destroyer off the gulf of fonseca add to the apprehension of many who view the presence of unitedstates warships with unitedstates military personnel on board in an area of tension and hostilities as a risk of potentially great consequences it would appear that the administration is treading dangerously close to the legal borderline and is at a minimum testing the authority of the war powers resolution if the administration believes that it is in the vital interests of the united states to keep or increase unitedstates military personnel in el salvador it should reconsider seriously its obligations to comply with the war powers resolution many observers inside and outside the unitedstates government have already concluded that the sending of unitedstates military advisers has been counterproductive to unitedstates policy interests and find now the difficult question to be one of how the united states can reverse this illadvised policy decision before the consequences of one wrong decision are compounded by the consequences of others accordingly this past week in a series of letters to the president i have proposed that tbe administration accept the offer of president lopez portillo of mexico to use his good offices as an intermediary in seeking political reconciliation in central america as a first step i have urged the president to anrounce that the unitedstates advisers will be withdrawn from el salvador upon the successful completion of the march elections regardless of who wins these advisers have become a symbol of american reliance upon military means of support for a government unable to control the excesses of its own military esthblishment in a situation where the fundamental problems are rooted in poverty illiteracy and social injustice the very presence of american military forcesregardless of whether they are carrying armshas had the unfortunate effect of closely identifying the united states with the human rights violations of the salvadoran military and converting what bevr s an essentially internal conflict i ato an anticolonialist struggle one of the problems of n great power is how to extricate itsulf from an illconsidered policy in vietnam 3he commitment of a small number of troops and the failed polities that followed led to the commitment of greater numbers and to policies that failed to an even greater degree by removing the advisers from el salvador at an early stage president reagan has a unique opportunity to rectify rather than multiply a mistake few american policymakers consider our sending of advisers to have been anything but a mistake not only have the advisers opened the unitedstates to international criticism from friend and foe alike but it is difficult to believe that a contingent of this minimal size could have a significant impact on the ability of salvadoran authorities to cope with insurgency the problem from a policy point of view is how to establish an appropriate quid pro quo for disengagement in the midst of the vietnam conflict henry kissinger proposed a series of very reasonable deescalation measures to the north vietnamese the problem was they were rejected and the nixon administration got locked into escalating a conflict at a time when prudence indicated the reverse course of action while vietnam analogies are not all appropriate the reagan administration would be well advised not to tie as secretary haig has proposed reduction in the number of our advisers to the actions of other states in the region policy options should be controlled in washington and not become subject to the whims of militaristic potentates bent on irrational behavior the objective of unitedstates cooperation with el salvador should be to encourage and facilitate the holding of free elections not to determine the outcome there would seem little reason to maintain military advisers after elections are successfully completed if the moderate forces of president duarte should prevail a good case could be made that having won a mandate in free elections the presence of american military advisers would no longer be needed less direct forms of support and assistance would be sufficient if the extreme right should emerge in power as many now conjecture withdrawal of our advisers would be a desirable means of disassociating the united states from the human rights violations that would likely insue at the same time announcement that a fiee election is our objective and that the advisers would be withdrawn following its successful completion would remove one of the main justifications for the extreme lefts effort to prevent salvadorans from going c the polls at the heart of the problem in central america and the caribbean basin is an assessment of whether problems are essentially rooted in longstanding patterns of injustice as the unitedstates catholic conference asserts or whether fundamentally the dilemma is one of castroite intervention as secretary haig contends if the former view is given greater weight a policy of economic assistance seems most in order if the latter military options come more to the fore conservative advocates of interventionism have a tendency to exaggerate the castroite dimension of the problem and underestimate the potential counterproductive effects of an overt unitedstates response liberal critics of american foreign policy on the other hand have a tendency to be overly generous in their assessments of the ideals and intentions of insurgency movements perhaps the most appropriate perspective is to recognize the social and economic inequities that exist but not to sympathize with the radical alternatives presented the united states has a profound influence over events in the caribbean but that influence is exercisedmost effectively when active american involvement is limited to economic assistance and peace corps kinds of activities military options dont solve social problems on the other hand economic assistance in some circumstances may not be enough but the united states acting alone on behalf of and within the confines of a smaller latin state is likely to exacerbate rather than diminish hostilities strategic options are far better exercised in concert with other latin states and at this time the most hopeful strategic initiative would appear to be the one proposed by mexican president lopez portillo his specific suggestions may be imperfect but the offer of his offices as a neutral intermediary may be the best chance to achieve a reduction in central american tension available president reagan risks a great deal if he too lightly spurns the assistance of our increasingly important neighbor to the south the president also risks support of congress and the american people if he does not comply with

the steel caucus executive committee were most disturbed by press reports that the administration might settle its dispute over steel imports with the europeans through bilateral agreements which would not protect the interests of the american steel industry according to the reports much pressure was being exerted by the european economic community eec to reach a settlement that would prove unfavorable to our domestic producers consequently the executive committee met in an emergency meeting on thursday morning july 21 1982 and agreed unanimously to inform secretary of commerce malcolm baldrige of opposition to the european offer that same night secretary baldrige rejected the european offer to limit steel exports to 90 percent of the 1981 levels i would like to submit here for the record the official press release of the commerce department on this decision the unitedstates department of commerce could not accept a lastminute proposal by the european communities ec to suspend 12 steel countervailing duty cvd investigalions involving belgium france italy and the united kingdom because the legal requirement of removing the apparent injurious effects caused to the unitedstates industry by subsidized steel imports was not met the proposals were formally presented to commerce secretary malcolm baldrige at 5 30 thursday by the ambassadors of the four countries accompanied by representatives of the ec the contents of the proposals had been received that morning the ec requested that the commerce department suspend the investigation on the basis of quantitative restraint agreements as permitted in unitedstates law under that provision the deadline for reaching an agreement is midnight july 24 in announcing his decision baldrige said we welcome any attempt by the community to settle the unfair steel trade cases between the unitedstates and the ec but unfortunately these proposals are not legally acceptable unitedstates law requires that any quantitative restraint suspension agreement must eliminate the injurious effect of subsidized exports of the subject merchandise to the united states since the steel imports from the ec that caused the injury increased almost 30 percent from 1980 to 1981 the 10 percent reduction offered today from the higher 1981 levels was simply not sufficient to remove injury as required baldrige stated that if acceptable suspension agreements could have been concluded on these products the steel trade tension between the ec and the unitedstates would still not have been eliminated he noted that 19 antidumping ad cases on the same products and 13 other ad and cvd cases are still pending baldrige felt that an overall settlement leading to withdrawal of all cases was the best way to relieve the current trade tension and repeated his willingness to continue discussions with the ec to find an equitable basis to deal with the problem in its entirety as well as the proposed suspension agreements the ec required that the unitedstates accept all of the 12 proposed agreements or none in its decision the doc compared the ecs suggested restraint level to the levels at which the unitedstates international trade commission made preliminary determinations of injury in 1980 and 1982 most of the proposed restraint levels were above the levels found to be injurious by the itc doc also considered the current state of the unitedstates industry now running at less than 45 percent utilization and the level of subsidies found in the june 10 preliminary determinations which in one case amounts to 40 percent subsequent to that decision the secretary made a counterproposal to the eec that provided about a 20percent cut in steel imports unfortunately the europeans turned that proposal down in the meantime in accordance to the relevant trade laws future negotiations on these cases will require the commerce department to seek the approval of the domestic steel industry before reaching a settlement now i have been advised that the secretary will pursue additional discussions along these lines this week in brussels it would seem to be in the interests of the european community to 11 4692 co participate in these negotiations otherwise they will risk final determinations and penalties i urge the secretary to do everything in his power to settle these cases as soon as possible in order to get our steelworkers back on the job a mr bevill the war being waged against the american steel industry by foreign steel producers has taken yet another twist news reports indicate that several of the european governments which have been accused of subsidizing their steel mills and permitting them to dump their steel in this country at prices far below production costs have been applying equally unfair pressure on this government to let them plea bargain their way out of the trade suits filed against them these news reports indicate that the europeans have used the russian gas pipeline deal and other diplomatic issues in an attempt to exert a form of international blackmail against our government they want to force a negotiated settlement without the consent of the injured american steelmakers which brought the complaints if they are successful our domestic steel firms would suffer even further losses of jobs sales and would have to have longer delays in their efforts to modernize their plants further the european nations pressuring for favorable settlements want a guarantee that there will be no future filings against them of additional antidumping cases or countervailing duty that would provide them with free reign to systematically destroy our domestic steel production capabilities already basic steel employment in america stands at a depressing 49year low if current trends continue our steel producers can expect to lose 2 billion during this decade and another 100 000 american steelworkers will be without jobs as a member of the executive committee of the steel caucus i want to express in the strongest terms possible my sincere belief that our government must not turn its back on our own steelmakers who have lived within the

section 119 according to chairman jones letter the committee on the budget met on july 14 and voted to support the waiver as requested by the committee on foreign affairs becausei 1 the 1981 funds authorized to be appropriated for the board of international broadcasting were included in the supplemental appropriations and rescission act of 1981 approved june 5 1981 and 2 the bill will not be

and in support of the purchase of the c5 it seems to me when you have the army the navy and the air force and all the people in our committees that are assigned to this job that make a decision based upon the facts that they have before them and upon information about the needs of our armed services that we should stick with them i rise in opposition to the amendment offered to delete the c5b purchase from the 1983 department of defense authorization the airlift issue at the center of this debate has generated many claims and counterclaims over the virtues and shortcomings of the boeing 747 and the lockheed c5b aircraft although the president the secretary of defense the joint chiefs of staff the service secretaries and the house and senate armed services committees have supported the purchase of 50 new lockheed c5s to improve our overall strategic airlift capability we are now being asked to evaluate the relative performance capabilities of the c5 and the 747 for budgetary reasons i do not disagree that there is a need to cut federal expenditures wherever possible in order to ease the strain n the federal budget but to approve the purchase of an airplane that will cost less at the expense of performance capability is very poor defense planning indeed our defense experts have testified that the c5 is the best possible remedy to alleviate our nearterm airlift shortfall since airlift constitutes such an important part of logistics planning the transport airplane used in the airlift is a major determinant for the efficiency and effectiveness of our airlift missions military experts are telling us that if rendered operational under actual emergency circumstances the more efficient and flexible aircraft for rapid deployment would be the c5 the unique features of which make it the best possible plane to do the job in addition the c5 has been improved to better meet our military needs for todays combat situations proponents of the 747 have told us that 48 747s would be equivalent to 50 c5s will save us 6 billion over the next 20 years and will be available for use 3 years earlier at a glance this option would certainly appear to be the more attractive one however the defense experts in closely examining the boeing proposal have informed us that the boeing facts and figures are misleading enough to warrant a much closer look by this body according to the air force the boeing 747 life cycle cost calculations were not done on the same basis as the air force c5 cost calculations and as such do not provide for a fair comparison of the relative costs involved in fact air force price analysts have refuted the 6 billion savings and documented the difference at less than 1 billion over a full 20year cycle of both planes therefore we are really talking about a 900 million difference over 20 years i believe that cost is an important consideration and we should be circumspect and thorough in this regard but we must not lose sight of the basic and overriding concern at the heart of this issue that of military utility while the boeing 747 may cost less in its present capacity as a commercial passenger aircraft the facts will undeniably change if it is to be adapted for military use even if we did add 48 or 55 modified 747s they still would not meet all of the requirements for our military airlift operations boeings own chairman of the board has publicly stated that boeing is not proposing that the 747 be used to carry outsized equipment keeping this in mind i believe our choice of plane seems clear no one can deny that the 747 is a valuable national asset and with modifications would be useful for some deployment missions however the air force has pointed out that a strong civil reserve air fleet modification program through which existing commercial 747s are already available can provide airlift at oneseventh the cost of air force ownership of these aircraft i appreciate that we are and should be very sensitive to the risks and costs of making and selling airplanes in todays economy procurement of 747s would certainly help those who manufacture the aircraft as well as those airlines from which the surplus aircraft would be bought however tempted we may be to aid our ailing industries can we really justify in todays action on this issue relief for some industries or elements of one industry and not provide relief for others we are faced with a decision that affects the mobility deployment effectiveness and response of unitedstates armed forces i cannot stress strongly enough that we are not going to get a bargain if the product we buy cannot do the complete job the 747 will not adequately meet all of our military cargo transport needs and therefore is not cost effective by any measure in closing i urge my colleagues to carefully consider the real issue underlying this debate and support the armed services committee recommendation to buy the c5b and reject the motion favoring the

subcommittee for the deliberate consideration which has been given to this public broadcasting measure we are facing difficult times in many areas of our economy but i think it is fair to say that in view of those difficult times the subcommittee has done a great silrviee in developing this legislation which deals fairly in my judgment with public broadcasting there have been differences of viewpoint on our subcommitteb and on the committee about the content of this legislation i am generally supportive of the measure because i believe that we have struck the proper balance between the desire to hold down expenditures at the public level while at the same time preserving the important services of public broadcasting i it is very difficult to anticip ate what economic conditions will be like in 1984 1985 and 1986 yet that is what in essence we are asked to do in this legislation because we are making auithorization levels for 1984 1985 and 1986 it is essential that we plan that far in advance in order to retain the independence of the public broadcasting system that method of forward authorization was established for that purpose of maintaining the independence of the system and while it is very good from that standpoint it does make it difficult for those who are trying to make projections into the future because of my confidence in the ability of the subcommittee to turn around under the policies proposed by the administration i have not gone as far as the administration would like in terms of cuts in the authorization levels however i do think it is important to note that we have made very substantial cuts in those authorization levels from 220 million for the oper ation of the public broadcasting system this year down to 160 million in 1984 145 million in 1985 and 130 million in 1986 we have also made cuts in the facilities the telecommunications facilities program moving from 40 million authorization for the current fiscal year to 25 million for the 1982 fiscal year 20 million for the 1983 fiscal year and 15 million for the 1984 fiscal year i am hopeful that these cuts will be considered substantial and adequate by the full house when we are considering this legislation but because we have made substantial cuts in the public broadcasting system funding we are faced with another very serious problem that it how do we keep these stations on the air how do we continue to extend public broadcasting services to the people of our country in order to address that issue the subcommittee has looked at several incomeproducing avenues we have authorized in this legislation the use of logos on public broadcasting in order to encourage corporations and others to provide funds for the operation of public broadcasting facilities and for programing we have also authorized the use of public broadcasting facilities on a rental basis by outsiders who may wish to use those facilities and in that way we hope to generate some income for the public broadcasting system and for the stations i believe however there is one other thing we should do in order to insure the financial stability of public broadcasting in the future when we in the subcommittee considered this issue of providing for the financial stability of public broadcasting in the future we considered the possibility of institutional adverstising as a means of future income for public broadcasting my good friend the gentleman from texas offered an amendment which would have provided for institutional advertising d 1230 in the discussion of that amendment it became clear that we really had very little information on hand that would provide us with the data that we need in order to make a good decision about advertising on public broadcasting we did not know how much revenue it wuuld generate we had no idea what impact it would have on programing we had little idea about what other impact it would have on audience participation and so on so as a result the subcommittee was reluctant to adopt an institutional advertising provision in this legislation what we have done however i think is develop an amendment which i intend to offer which i think has general support in the subcommittee and committee which would provide for an experiment on advertising on public broadcasting stations what we intend to do is allow for an 18month period during which up to 10 public radio licensees and up to 10 public television licensees would have the opportunity to offer advertising during programing on their stations these advertisements could not interrupt regular programs the advertisements would be limited to 2 minutes at any one time the advertisements would have other limitations placed upon them for example there would be no political endorsements permitted through these advertisments after this 18month period the blue ribbon commission that would be established to conduct the experiment would make a report to congress to indicate what the impact had been of advertising on the public broadcasting stations and what the impact had been on the audiences programing and what sources of revenue had come to the station as the result of this experiment with this information i think we would be able to make sound decisions in the future as to the direction we should go on advertising on public broadcasting i can assure my colleagues that i have some of the same concerns and misgivings about advertising on public broadcasting that i am certain many of them do but i think until we conduct a proper experiment in order to determine the impact of advertising on public broadcasting it will be very difficult for us to discuss this issue any more intelligently in the future than we have been able to do so in the past so i urge support for the legislation that is before us and i hope that the house will see fit to endorse the advertising experiment that i will be offering"], [0.9895125031471252, 0.9895125031471252, 0, "i whole al

instructions the waivers provided by this rule are absolutely necessary in order for the house to consider this very important legislation but i do want to take a moment to explain them the first waiver relates to the germaneness of the committee substitute to the bill as introduced the original bill was very limited in nature and the committee on agriculture held extensive hearings on the need for adequate credit to enable rural america to survive a period of great economic stress before reporting the substitute the committee substitute is much more comprehensive than the original bill and thus the waiver is necessary the second waiver provided by this rule is necessary because various sections of the committee substitute constitute appropriations in a legislative bill i want to mention at this point that there was no controversy about these waivers in the committee rules in fact we reported this rule by a unanimous voice vote before i discuss some of the provisions of h r

the subcommittee on conservation credit and rural development for their arduous efforts to bring this bill to the floor for timely consideration they are to be commended indeed the entire committee on

operating loans rural water and waste disposal and other insured community facilities rural business and industrial development and assistance to farmers who become victims of natural disasters there is today in this nation a crisis in agriculture and i think most of us recognize that the high interest rates have forced many farmers off the farm there is indeed trauma today on the american family farm i would just like to point out that in my judgment the family farms of this nation form the backbone of america and if and when that family farm ceases to exist then the 227 million american people will all suffer because if at that timeif it ever comesthey will no longer be able to get the food that they need american consumers use only 16 percant of their disposable income for food and fiber this has been made possible because of the ingenuity the productivity the efficiency and the dedication of the family farmer in todays economic conditions i think that the farmers home administration is one of the most important of our agencies it is certainly the court of last resort for many of our farmers who must look elsewhere for financing so i think the congress cannot remain insensitive to the needs of the family farmers of america today if we are going to continue to produce the food and fiber that has made this the most abundant nation of the face of the earth i do not think any entity of the federal government has done more for this country and for rural america and through rural america for the country than the farmers home administration the housing program has been far superior to anything else that we have had providing houses at low cost to people who otherwise could not affort homes the recapture the payment record that the farmers home administration has maintained has been outstanding the defaults have been very very low had it not been for the farmers home administration there are a lot of people who are on the farms today who would not have been there and they are successful and they have become in normal times completely independent of any further government borrowing of course today we know that we have s very difficult situation i am

of strong convictions yet with a real willingness to compromise a man of the south who yet represented the best in the national interest this gentle man had great warmth and a remarkable sense of humor that made him an outstanding public speaker a man of deep religious convictions he was elected president of the southern baptist convention in 1957 while serving in the house but he never wavered in his dedication to the doctrine of the separation of church and state he was also a man of great modesty he loved to tell the story of how our mutual colleague at that time eugene mccarthy

pope john and pope paul did much to promote the cause of better baptistcatholic relations in the world his religious devotion was well demonstrated by his long and ultimately successful effort to create a prayer room in the capitol where members of all religions could go for a few moments of quiet reflection brooks hays was a courageous champion of human rights but he shunned ostentation so that his quiet courage often went unsung but make no mistake it took great courage for a southern congressman to support home rule for the district of columbia in the 1940s going back to the 1920s he and his father were among the few persons of stature in arkansas bold enough to defy the ku klux klan a stand that cost his father a seat in congress after harry trumans election in 1948 brooks hays

armed services to ban lynching and to create a fair employment practices commission in short the humble man from arkansas did not flinch from recommending steps that would jeopardize his political
