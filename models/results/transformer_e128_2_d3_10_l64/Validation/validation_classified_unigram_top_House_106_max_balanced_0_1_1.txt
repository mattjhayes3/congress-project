on the budget for giving us this opportunity to face americans and define for them what kind of country we would like to be i had the pleasure of organizing the congressional childrens caucus a group of about 60 members who have committed to promoting children first in the national agenda we look forward to hearing from mrs tipper gore the wife of the vice president on the mdrch 25 1999 issues of mental health services for children keeping that in mind i am very concerned with the budget as proposed by the majority leadership because our children must face the challenges of competing in a global environment and the new millennium we have got to invest in children this budget does not children cannot learn if they are hungry tired and improperly prepared the majoritys budget proposal reduces domestic spending in programs aimed at protecting the interests of children allow me to call the roll a program of which many members of this house have testified that they graduated from head start is being cut 501 million a 10 percent cut the wic program that provides for women infants and children being cut 425 million job corps which has allowed many inner city and rural community youth to find an opportunity out of the seat of degradation cut 141 million child care there is not a time that i go home to my district when women and men parents who say give me the ability to work provide child care and help me provide child care for my children sometimes onethird of their income 119 million the summer youth program where a mother gave me the good news of her young person who

community cut 4 7 million native american head start cut 3 8 million child abuse 2 2 million abandoned infants assistance 1 3 million i can only say oppose this majority leadership budget realize that our children are our best investment let us support the democratic alternative and invest in our children i rise in opposition to fy 2000 budget resolution offered by the majoritys leadership i come in the spirit of hershey and bipartisanism i come to request a budget that protects the social security trust fund for americas citizens i rise to request a budget thact will protect the medicare trust fund we must authorize a budget that will protect the social security trust fund while women tend to collect benefits over a longer period than men because of a greater life expectancy women on average receive lower monthly social security benefits since they have lower earnings and are more likely to be widowed or unmarried in retirement the majoritys budget proposal does not protect women or children or the social security trust fund under this budget proposalprograms directed toward improving the quality of life for women and children are the first programs to be reduced and cut in order to give a tax break to the wealthy the majority is suggesting that their budget proposal will save 100 of the social security surplus but 0 of that money goes to the social security trust fund and 0 goes towards strengthening medicare this simply is not true domestic programs are not a priority in this budget resolution offered by the majority we must authorize a budget that will appropriate financial resources to reduce the average classroom size to promote a learning environment and to modernize public schools educating americas children should be our number one priority our children must be prepared to face the challenges of competing in a global environment and the new millenium children can not learn if they are hungry tired and improperly prepared the majoritys budget proposal reduces domestic spending and programs aimed at protecting the interest of our children 425 1 million would be slashed from the wic budget head start would becut by approximately 501 4 million ard liheap funding would be reduced by 109 million nevertheless the majoritys budget resolution reserves 800 billion for tax cuts we must authorize a budget that will protect and extend the medicare trust fund this budget must ensure that patients will have access to high quality healthcare by guaranteeing important protections such as access to the specialists coverage for emergency medical services and affording prescriptions for seniors the majoritys budget proposal leaves the medicare trust fund in a precarious position and its future in question the congressional budget

the social security trust fund congress and the president have come upon the historic opportunity to balance the budget without spending one penny of seniors social security trust fund for nearly 4 decades the raid on social security has gone on taking over 850 billion in social security funds and spending them on unrelated government programs 168 days ago just over 5 months this house passed my social security lockbox legislation by an overwhelming 416 to 12 vote the passage of this social security lockbox legislation showed that house republicans and democrats agree that social security dollars should not be spent on programs unrelated to social security congress made the commitment to stop the raid on social security shortly later however president clinton joined our bipartisan effort and committed the administration to protecting social security that was over 5 months ago unfortunatelyv i am afraid today is a different story while house republicans are continuing to honor our steadfast commitment to protect seniors social security i have great concerns about the recent actions of the clintongore white house and congressional democrats the current budget situation requires that every increase in spending be offset currently if spending is not offset it is drawn directly from seniors social security dollars over the past few weeks president clinton has vetoed five appropriations bills because he says they do not spend enough yet the president has not offered a single solid proposal to pay for those spending increases it appears the president may be willing to spend social security dollars to pay for his spending projects congress and the president are faced with a very clear choice ask federal agencies to save one penny just one penny of a dollar in waste fraud or abuse so we can protect social security or give in to the big washington spenders and raid seniors social security dollars amazingly enough there are still people in washington that do not believe the federal government can tighten its belt by just 1 percent but the american people know the truth a recent poll conducted by the national taxpayers union revealed let me show my colleagues this poll revealed that over 84 percent of americans believe that there is not just 1 percent waste in government but they felt there was at least 5 percent of waste in unneeded spending in the federal spending surely if 84 percent of the american people believe that there is at least 5 percent of waste the president and the congress can work together to find just 1 percent or one penny of waste in order to protect social security dollars so many seniors so many seniors rely upon let me present my colleagues with some examples of waste fraud and abuse that we have found in the federal government the national park service spent 1 million to build an outhouse at glacier national park in montana the expense was explained by the outhouses remote location the outhouse is located nearly 7 miles from the nearest road and it took hundreds of horse trips and more than 800 helicopter drops to get the construction materials to the site another one erroneous medicare payments that waste over 20 billion annually another the department of education maintains a 725 million slush fund which it cannot account for the department of housing and urban development hud estimated it spent 857 million in 1998 in erroneous rent subsidy payments in fiscal year 1998 about 5 percent of the entire program budget let me close with this for a moment and that is delays in disposing of more than 41 000 hud properties cost taxpayers more than 1 million per day these are all examples of how congress and the president can find one penny 1 percent out of a dollar in waste fraud and abuse in the federal government we are all in this together we want to work with the president and vice president gore to find this 1 percent so that we can protect social security dollars we will not however under any circumstances allow the clintongore administration to dip into the social security trust fund to pay for more government spending with that i yield to the gentleman from arizona who serves

strengthen and make our schools safef we want to strengthen social security by locking away 100 percent of social security revenues and surpluses for retirement security republicans want to pay down the national debt and republicans also want to lower the tax burden for middleclass working families i believe this year as we work to lower the tax burden for middleclass families that we should focus on making our tax code simpler and making our tax code fairer to families and let me raise a series of questions today that really illustrate what i believe is the most unfair tax and that is the tax on marriage the marriage tax is not only unfair it is wrong is it right that under our tax code married working couples pay higher taxes than two single people living together outside of marriage do americans feel that it is fair that 28 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married that is right under our tax code today a husband and wife who both are in the work force pay higher taxes than two single people living together with identical incomes that is wrong let me give an example here of what it means as i pointed out earlier there are 28 million married working couples paying on average 1 400 more in higher taxes here is an example of a south chicago suburban couple i represent the south suburbs of chicago if we take a machinist who works for caterpillar in joliet and a schoolteacher in the local public schools of joliet and they have a combined income of 62 000 the machinist makes 35 500 and as a single individual when he files his taxes if we subtract the personal exemption and the standard deduction he pays a certain amount of taxes but if he chooses to marry and his schoolteacher wife with an identical income and when they are married they file their taxes jointly their combined income of 62 000 when he subtracts the standard deductions and exemptions under our current tax code this machinist and his schoolteacher wife making 62 000 a year pay the average marriage tax penalty of 1 400 now there are those particularly on that side of the aisle who believe that this is no big deal that is money that we have to spend in washington back in joliet 1 400 is 1 years tuition in joliet community college 3 months of day care in the local child care center and also several months worth of car payments the marriage tax elimination act which i am proud to say has 230 cosponsors a bipartisan majority of this house we propose to eliminate the marriage tax penalty for all americans under our legislation we double the standard deduction for joint filers to twice that for single filers we double the brackets so that those who are married filing jointly can earn exactly twice what a single filer can make and be treated fairly under taxes the bottom line is the marriage tax elimination act would eliminate the marriage tax penalty for this machinist and this schoolteacherwife who are married in joliet illinois eliminating the marriage tax penalty is really an issue of fairness and will help simplify the tax code what is the bottom line the marriage tax elimination act puts two married people on equal footing with two single people that is fair and that simplifies the tax code i am proud to say i was part of this congress when republicans succeeded in passing into law the adoption tax credit to help loving families find a home for a child in need of adoption we accomplished that as part of the contract with america in 1996 and we followed up in 1997 by enacting into law the centerpiece of the contract with america the 500 per child tax credit which benefits 3 million illinois children that is 1 5 billion that will stay in illinois rather than coming to washington and of course i believe the folks back home can better spend their hardearned dollars back home than we can here in washington we can build on that helping working families by working to simplify our code by working to bring fairness to our tax code by eliminating what is the most unfair tax of all and that is the tax on marriage let us stop taxing marriage let us pass into law the marriage tax

sure during the weeks approaching the vote for permanent normal trade relations for the peoples republic of china corporate ceos flocked to the hill to lobby for increase unrestricted trade with china they talk about access to 1 2 billion potential consumers in china what they do not say is that their real interest is in 1 2 billion chinese workers workers whom they pay wage on the level of slave labor these ceos will tell us increase trade with china will allow human rights to improve democracy will flourish with increased free trade as we engage with china but as these ceos speak their companies systematically violate the most fundamental of human and worker rights in the new report made in china the role of unitedstates companies in denying human and worker rights released by charles kernaghan and the national labor committee we see evidence of american corporations exploiting the horrible conditions of human rights in the peoples republic of china companies such as huffy and nike and walmart are contracting with chinese sweatshops to export to the united states often with the assistance of repressive and corrupt local government authorities 1 800 huffy bicycle workers have lost their jobs in ohio as huffy shut down its last three remaining unitedstates plants over the last 17 months in july of 1998 huffy fired 850 workers from its celina ohio plant where workers earned 17 an hour huffy now outsources all of its production to developing nations such as china where laborers are forced to work 15 hours a day 7 days a week and earn an average of 33 cents an hour less than 2 percent of what ohio huffy bicycle workers earned walmart makes its line of kathie lee gifford handbags in china there are a thousand workers at the factory where they put in 14hour shifts 7 days a week 29 or 30 days a month one off day per month the average wage of the factory is 3 cents an hour workers live in factory dormitories housed 16 in a room their id documents have been confiscated they are allowed to leave the factory only for one and a half hours a day for half of all factory workers rent for the dormitory exceeds their wages workers earn nothing at all and in many cases owe the company money these people are indentured servants to kathie lee and to walmart some would simply call it slavery the findings in charles kernaghans report illustrates why democratic countries in the developing world are losing ground to more authoritarian countries in the developing world democratic nations such as india are losing out to more totalitarian governments such as china democratic nations such as taiwan are losing out to more authoritarian governments such as indonesia where people are not free and workers do as their told the share of developing country exports to the unitedstates from democratic nations fell from 53 percent 10 years ago to 35 percent today corporate america wants to do business with countries with docile workforces that earn belowpoverty wages and are not allowed to organize to bargain collectively in manufactured goods developing democracies share of developing country exports fell 21 percent from 56 to 35 percent corporations are relocating their manuficturing bases to more authoritarian regimes from democratic countries where workers do not talk back for fear of being punished western corporations want to invest in countries that have poor environmental standards no worker benefits belowpoverty wages no opportunities to bargain collectively and worse as developing countries make progress toward democracy as they increase worker rights and create regulations to protect the environment the american business community punishes them by pulling its trade and investment from developing democratic countries to totalitarian governments and developing countries decisions about the chinese economy are made by three groups the chinese communist party the peoples liberation army which owns many of the export factories and western investors which of these three want to empower workers does the chinese communist worker want the chinese people to enjoy human rights i do not think so does the peoples liberation army want to close the labor camps i do not think so do western investors want chinese workers to make better wages have more democracy and bargain collectively i do not think so

interest in changing the current situation in china all three profit too much from the status quo to want to see human rights and labor rights improve in china unitedstates trade law forbids the trade

fair under our tax code a married working couple where both the husband and wife are both in the workforce a married working couple with a twoincome household pay higher taxes under our tax code than an identical couple with identical income who choose to live together outside of marriage is it right is it fair is it fair that under our tax code that 25 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married of course not the goal of this legislation i am proud to say is to wipe out the marriage tax penalty almost entirely for 25 million married working couples i think it is pretty fiscally responsible to take onehalf of 1 percent of a 2 2 trillion surplus to eliminate the marriage tax penalty to listen to my friends on the other side of the aisle you think we would be breaking their piggy bank to take onehalf of 1 percent of a 2 2 trillion surplus to help 25 million married working couples who pay higher taxes jut because they are married i for one and i am pleased to say that 222 republicans and we were joined by 48 democrats who broke with their leadership who believe it is time to eliminate the narriage tax penalty that this house has voted to send to the senate today we are voting on theagreement between the house and the senate we hope the president will join with us to eliminate the marriage tax penalty let me introduce a couple of constituents from the south suburbs of chicago which i represent shad and michelle hallihan they are public school teachers shad is at joliet high school and michelle is at manhattan junior high school their combined incomes are about 62 000 they pay just around 1 000 in marriage tax penalty just because they are married under our tax code now this photo was taken when they were married it was about the time we introduced our legislation about 2 years ago since then shad and michelle have had a little boy little ben and little ben of course is this little guy we hope some day he does not have to pay the marriage tax penalty our hope is for his parents we can eliminate it this year i would point out under this legislation we provide middleclass tax relief for middleclass couples like shad and michelle hallihan this year because our legislation is effective january 1 of 2000 so if the president would join with us to eliminate the marriage tax penalty for 25 million married working couples shad and michelle hallihan would see their marriage tax penalty eliminated this year now under our legislation we do several things we double the standard deduction for those who do not itemize to 8 800 twice that for single filers we also widen the 15 percent bracket to help those who do itemize shad and michelle hallihan are also homeowners and because they are homeowners they itemize their taxes and the only way to help people middleclass families who own a home or give to church or charity or their synagogue is to widen the 15 percent bracket so that they too can receive marriage tax relief under our proposal we eliminate the marriage tax penalty suffered by shad and michelle hallihan think about it in joliet illinois the marriage tax penalty of 1 400 the average marriage tax penalty is one years tuition at our local community college it is 3 months of day care for little ben at a local child care center in joliet it is 3 000 diapers for little ben but it is also if we also think about it if shad and michelle had that money that they currently pay in the marriage tax penalty were able to set it aside in an education savings account for little ben by the time ben is 18 they would have been able to set aside almost 20 000 that they currently send to uncle sam they could put in little bens college fund that is what marriage tax relief means for the hallihans now we have heard a lot of excuses from our good friends on the other side let us do just a little bit so we can say we have done something we have other priorities we want to spend it on but think about this one half of 1 percent of a 2 2 trillion surplus is being given back to middleclass working married couples like shad and michelle hallihan so they can take that marriage tax penalty that currently goes to washington gets spent on other things and use it to take care of their families needs little ben in particular so let us do the fiscally responsible thing let us help middleclass workingmarried couples who suffer the marriage tax penalty there are 25 million of them that is almost 50 million taxpayers who pay higher taxes just because they made the choice of getting married my hope is the president will join with us and sign this legislation the president joined with us when he changed his mind on irs reform he was opposed to it decided to support it he was opposed to balancing the budget now he takes credit for it he was opposed to welfare reform now he takes credit for it my hope is the president will join with us and sign the elimination of the

republican leadership brought to floor in the form and guise of the commerce justice state appropriations as ranking member of the subcommittee on immigration and claims i am mostly concerned about the latino immigration fairness act lifa the phrase compassionate conservatism has very hollow meaning if you just talk the talk and not walk the walk this lifa proposal is the modern day civil rights issue of our time and just 12 days to election day the republicans are thumbing their noses at immigrants who have contributed to our society and are trying to play by the rules i say not deal to this proposal and i urge a no vote this involves amnesty for immigrants who have paid their dues and have been in this country since 1986 parity for liberians guatemanlans haitains and hondurans and restoring section 245 i which allows immigrants to adjust their illegal status pay a fee and remain in this country with their spouses and children these are reasonable proposals and the republican leadership has a blind eye for fairness for justice and equity the republican proposal to provide relief to only 400 000 immigrants who were unable to take advantage of the 1986 law for those entering the country before 1982 is unacceptable it is unacceptable because it leaves and locks too many people out this is a proposal that is thinly veiled as an open door but it really is a feeble attempt to play up to the hispanic vote during the political season the republican legislation is a piecemeal correction of the flawed implementation of the 1986 legalization program basically those individuals who sought the counsel of a specific lawyer and filed suit with him are protected while countless others are left out of those people who are covered in the flawed proposal less than 40 are expected to prevail if the gop acknowledges that the 1986 law was not implemented correctly they should try to right the wrong entirely not pick some winners and losers based on what law firm they signed up to represent them also it is important to understand that this amnesty program in fact is just a long overdue update in the registry provision of the immigration and nationality act the registry provision gives immigrants who have been here without proper documents an opportunity to adjust to permanent status if they have been here for a long enough time and have nothing in their background that would disqualify them from immigrant status the legislation would just update the cutoff date for registry which is now set at 1972 then there is juan gonzalez who has been working for a construction company in houston texas for more than 13 years recently he lost his job because he was not able to present his employer a renewed employment authorization since then his family is living a nightmare juan and his wife luisa are having problems and close to a divorce they lost their home and rented a 2bedroom apartment unfortunately their children are paying the consequences we also need to remain ever vigilant on nacara parity this would address an injustice in the provisions of the nicaraguan adjustment and central american relief act of 1997 nacara nacara currently provides qualified cubans and nicaraguans an opportunity to become lawful permanent residents of the united states the proposed legislation would extend the same benefits to eligible nationals of guatemala el salvador honduras and haiti the bill that the republicans have brought to the floor has completely left nacara parity out i say no deal and a no vote like nicaraguans and cubans many salvadorans guatemalans hondurans and haitians fled human rights abuses or unstable political and economic conditions in the 1980s and 1990s the united states has a strong foreign policy interest in providing the same treatment to these similarly situated people in addition returning migrants to these countries would place significant demands on their fragile economic and political systems like senator jack reed i have worked very hard to ensure that the 10 000 liberian nationals who have been living in the united states since the mid1980s and have significantly contributed to the american economy are not deported this legislation should also include these liberian nations if the latino immigrant fairness act is not enacted hundreds of thousands of people will be forced to abandon their homes will have to separate from their families and return to countries where they no longer have ties the inclusion of the latino immigrant fairness provisions would evidence our commitment to fair and evenhanded treatment of nations from these countriesand to the strengthening of democracy and economic stability among important neighbors the republican proposal creates a v visa for people waiting in the family backlogs but not all including us citizens this counterproposal treats the family members of some legal permanent residents better than us citizens the gop proposal leaves out us citizens applying for their children over the age of 21 ironically the gop fails to help even united states citizens seeking to reunite with their spouses and children if the spouse of the child fell out of status for six months or more in contrast the latino immigrant fairness act 245 i proposal would cover all people in the pipeline to becoming legal equally i say no deal and a no vote the republicans are failing to correct their flawed legislation of 1997 and 1998 it was the republicans who passed piecemeal programs in 1997 and 1998 for some refugees these flaws failed to correct years of uneven treatment to legitimate refugees from central america haiti and does nothing for liberian nationals it is baffling why today the republicans are now turning their backs on the lifa proposal for long time refugees that have been in the unitedstates for years worked hard and paid their taxes when a few short years ago they advanced these same proposals in conclusion there is not compassion here congress should stop trying to trade some deserving immigrant groups for others and move to help all deserving immigrants willing to play by the rules paytaxes and work hard in the united states

entire hour this evening i wanted to spend some time though talking about hmo reform or managed care reform one of the things that i want to really stress is that there is a major difference between the approach that the democrats have been taking on the issue of hmo reform versus the approach of the republican leadership a lot of times i worry that americans and our constituents think that what we are proposing on both sides of the aisle is essentially the same and that everyone is trying to do something to protect patients rights during this managed care reform debate but i just think it is important to stress the differences i really feel very strongly that the patients bill of rights the democratic bill that has been put forward and is cosponsored by almost every member on the democratic side really protects patients rights whereas the republican leadership bills that have been put forward both in this congress and in the previous congress really do not do an adequate job of protecting patients and too often look towards the interests of the insurance industry instead in the last session of congress in the last 2 years in 1997 and 1998 there was some debate on the issue of hmo reform but the issue was essentially left unfinished in the 105th congress in the last congress on the house side the democrats patients bill of rights was defeated by just five votes when it came to the floor it was considered on the floor as a substitute to the republican leaderships managed care bill which did pass and which in my opinion was really not a good piece of legislation and did not do anything significant to protect patients in fact the republican leadership in the house has reintroduced a bill in this session of congress that is virtually identical to what it moved last year on the senate side the senate republicans in the socalled help committee approved a managed care bill which really in my opinion is a sham reform bill and does not allow patients to sue the insurance companies but does allow the insurance companies and not the doctors and patients to define what is medically necessary what types of procedures what length of stay what kind of operations would be performed and would be acceptable under an individual insurance policy i just wanted to if i could take a little time this evening to talk about why this republican bill that passed the senate the republican leadership bill in the senate really does not do an adequate job of trying to protect patients rights if you look at the bill that passed the senate or that came out of committee i should say in the senate this year it leaves out more than 100 million americans twothirds of those with private health insurance it fails to grant key protections needed by children women persons with disabilities and others with chronic conditions or special health care needs and it allows medical decisions to continue to be made by insurance company executives instead of by health care professionals and patients the main difference that i have tried to point out between the democrats patients bill of rights and the republican leadership bills that have been sponsored in the house or in the senate really come down to two points and that is that the republican bills really leave it up to the insurance companies to decide what kind of treatment you are going to get and with regard to enforcement they do not have adequate enforcement because if you want to appeal a decision about your treatment that you felt that you should have a particular operation you should be able to stay an extra day or so in the hospital if you try that appeal there is really no process whereby you can appeal the decision of the insurance company and be successful and certainly if you suffer damages you cannot sue for those damages under the republican bill what the democrats tried to do on the senate side in committee in the help committee when this republican hmo bill came up they tried a number of times through amendments to improve the republican bill all those democratic amendments were essentially defeated but i wanted to give you a little idea if i could about the kinds of things that the democrats were trying to do to improve what was essentially a bad bill that did not provide adequate protections for patients in hmos the committee republicans in the senate rejected on a 108 party line vote an amendment by senator ted kennedy to extend the scope of the bill to all privately insured americans as i said the republican bill leaves more than 100 million people unprotected because most of its patient protections are narrowly applied to only one type of insurance and that is selffunded employer plans the committee republicans also rejected on the same 108 party line vote senator kennedys amendment on external appeals again as i mentioned before the republican bill does not create a truly independent external review of plan decisions so if you feel that you are not getting covered adequately and you try to appeal there really is no effective external appeal under the committee bill the republican bill the socalled external review is controlled by the hmos and contains loopholes to allow hmos to delay or prevent patients from appealing a bad medical decision by an hmo bureaucrat many hmo decisions could not even be appealed under the republican bill just to give you another idea of some of the examples i talked about the issue of medical necessity and how it is defined the committee republicans in the senate rejected again on a party line vote 108 an amendment offered by senator kennedy to define the term medical necessity and to prohibit hmos from arbitrarily interfering with medical decisions again just to give you an example of how this operates this amendment would have prevented insurers from arbitrarily interfering with the decisions of the treating physician on issues relating to the manner in other words the length of stay in the hospital or the setting inpatient versus outpatient care it would have stopped hmos from overruling doctor and going against accepted and best practices of medicine the committee republicanpassed bill does nothing to protect patients when an insurance company bureaucrat tells them they must have a medical procedure on an outpatient basis or be discharged from the hospital prematurely the republican bill allows hmos to continue to define what is medically necessary giving them the ability to deny promised benefits another example the issue of emergency room care many of my constituents have complained to me that their hmo policy does not allow them to go to the emergency room when they think it is necessary or they have to go to a different hospital that is pretty far away if they want to go to an emergency room they cannot go to the hospital near where they live or where they work well senator murray tried to put in an amendment that again was rejected on a party line vote 108 to strengthen coverage for emergency care under the republican bill it is not clear whether a true prudent layperson standard applies to all of the plans covered prudent layperson says that if the average prudent person would think it was necessary to go to the emergency room then you can go to whatever emergency room is close by and readily available well many insurance policies many hmos do not allow that and so the democrats are saying we want to have that prudent layperson standard put into the hmo reform bill instead what happened is that in this case again the ability to apply that prudent layperson standard was rejected by the committee and what that means is that under the republican bill there still is no guarantee that you can go to the closest emergency room or that even if you go to the emergency room and later the hmo decides well you really should not have gone because it was not really an emergency that they can just deny coverage and say you shouldnt have gone to the emergency room therefore were not going to pay for the emergency room care another example that i think is important is with regard to specialists many of my constituents complain that their hmo reform bill does not provide them with access to specialists that they may need in a given circumstance senators harein and reed had an amendment to this republican bill that again was rejected along party lines that would ensure that patients have access to needed specialists under the republican bill patients could be charged more for outofnetwork specialty care even if the plan is at fault for not having access to appropriate specialists within the plan so if you decide that you want to go to a doctor i will give you an example perhaps you want to go see a pediatrician but as many people know today that for children there are pediatric specialists for different areas of pediatrics under the republican bill if there is nobody that has that specialty and you decide that you want to see that kind of pediatrician for your child then you can go out of the network but you have to pay for it again what we were saying with this democratic amendment is that access to specialty care should be provided outside the hmo if there is no one within the hmo that has that specialty and is part of the network but again that was an amendment that was rejected i will only mention one more effort on the democrats part to try to improve this bad bill if you will and there are many others but i will only mention one other one and that was senator kennedys amendment again rejected on a 108 party line vote with regard to liability the republican bill fails to hold limos accountable when their actions result in injury or death i mentioned this before you cannot sue the republican plan would protect most hmos from liability even when someone becomes disabled or is killed senator kennedys amendment in the democrats patients bill of rights would allow 123 million patients who receive coverage through private employers to hold their hmos and health insurance plans accountable under state laws for their abuses this is one of the loopholes if you will in the current law and that is that if you are not covered by certain state laws and your health insurance comes from your private employer oftentimes you cannot sue we were trying to correct that as well if i could just say that basically what i am trying to point out tonight is that there are major differences here and that when we look at what is happening on the issue of hmo or managed care reform it is obviously important that we have an opportunity in this session of congress to get a vote on this issue one of the criticisms that i have of the republican leadership is that frankly it is now april almost may and they have not even allowed us to have any kind of a vote there has not been any movement in subcommittee in the committee on commerce that i am a member of or in the full committee to bring any kind of hmo or managed care reform to the floor so we need to at least start the movement but when that movement starts and when we do have an opportunity to vote on hmo reform we have to understand that there is a major difference between the patients bill of rights which is being brought forth by the democrats and the republican leadership proposal now you do not have to take my word for it one of the things that i think is important is that we look at some of the commentators and what they are saying about the differences between the democrats and the republicans on this issue but i wanted to read if i could all or some parts of an editorial that appeared in the new york times on saturday april 10 earlier this month that talked about the differences between the democrats and the republicans on the issue of patient rights just about everyone on capitol hill professes interest in producing legislation that protects patients from unfair health insurance practices but the prospect of actually passing meaningful protections as opposed to talking about it is uncertain president clinton tried to whip up support for democratic proposals but the republicans are balking at democratic plans as too burdensome on the managed care industry yet it is the democratic proposals that more fully reflect the recommendations of a presidential advisory commission to improve health plan quality the republican senate bill s 326 sponsored by senator jeffords of vermont is too limited to accomplish that purpose the bill which was approved by the senate help or health education labor and pensions committee on a straight party line vote of 108 contains some consumer protections but it is unacceptable because most of the provisions would apply only to 48 million individuals covered by plans in which large employers act as their own insurers leaving 110 million americans in other plans unprotected the republican bill would grant appeal rights to an additional 75 million privately insured individuals but those rights would be quite restrictive appeals to an external reviewer would be allowed only when an insurer refused to pay for a procedure on the grounds that it was not medically necessary or was experimental critics say this would give health plans power to limit appeals by simply asserting that a denial is not based on medical necessity it would exclude appeals where a plan unilaterally decided that the benefit was not covered under the contract even if medical judgments were involved in that contract interpretation the republican bill does not adequately ensure access to specialty care by allowing a patient to see an outofnetwork specialist if the plan has an insufficient number of specialists available both the senate democratic proposal which has white house support and a bipartisan bill sponsored by senators john chafee joseph lieberman and others would be substantially stronger in allowing external review of coverage disputes and defining medical necessity and in giving enrollees greater rights to take health plans to court the insurance lobby has already embarked on a media blitz to defeat any new regulations as too costly but consumer protections under the democratic plan would increase health plan costs by only 2 8 percent according to congressional budget office estimates made last year health plans should be made to deliver what they promise their enrollees and held accountable when they fail i think that new york times editorial really sums up what i am trying to say tonight which is the fact of the matter is that if the patients bill of rights the democratic patients bill of rights would be substantially stronger in almost every aspect of managed care reform over the republican proposal now i just wanted to briefly mention again the important areas where the patients bill of rights a democratic bill of rights really provides for a very good protection for patients once again and most importantly the democratic patients bill of rights allows doctors and patients rather than insurance company bureaucrats to make medical decisions using the principles of good medicine in addition it would first guarantee access to needed health care specialists the democratic bill provides access to emergency room services when and where the need arises the democratic bill provides continuity of care protections to assure patient care if a patients health care provider is dropped the democrats patients bill of rights gives access to a timely internal and independent external appeals process and the democratic patients bill of rights assures that doctors and patients can openly discuss treatment options and not be gagged because the insurance company says that you cannot talk about something that is not covered the patients bill of rights would also assure that women have direct access to ob gyn and finally and almost as important really as the medical necessity issue is that the democrats patients bill of rights provides an enforcement mechanism that ensures recourse for patients who have been maimed or die as a result of health plan actions i sound very partisan this evening and i do not mean to suggest that there are not republican members on the other side of the aisle that are supportive of the patients bill of rights or the types of protections that i think that are needed in a comprehensive hmo reform bill i know that there are members on the other side that would like to see these types of protections provided under the law but the bottom line is that the republican leadership which is in charge of the house keeps producing legislation or keeps proposing legislation both in the house and in the senate that does not adequately protect patients and i think it is very important that we not only move ahead in this session of congress and quickly on hmo reform but that we move ahead with an hmo reform that adequately protects patients rights that is comprehensive and addresses what i consider the major issue that my constituents and most americans seem to be concerned about at this time"], [0.002799391746520996,

new surplus and the new millennium it looks like anything is possible unfortunately they with the new surplus and the new millennium it looks like anything is possible unfortunately they are in for a huge disappointment last weeks unveiling of my republican colleagues new budget proved to be more of the same all bad ideas despite predictions of medicare and social security catastrophes looming on the horizon the republican budget does nothing to extend the life of either social security or medicare for even one day but it still manages to siphon 775 billion into tax cuts for the richest americans instead of investing in education health care to prepare this country for the next century like nero the republican budget fiddles while social security and medicare burn the chief actuary of the social security administration has said this budget will have virtually no effect on the date that social security becomes insolvent it will just make sure that it goes broke on schedule that is not me speaking that is the chief actuary of the social security administration in contrast the democratic budget has a lock box which will protect social security until the year 2050 and protect medicare until the year 2020 my republican colleagues propose a plan that is less secure than the democrats and treasury secretary rubin recommended that the president of the united states veto it because in reality the republican lock box is more of an open till the differences do not stop there the democratic budget reduces the debt more than the republican budget every year that it is in effect the democratic budget provides 40 billion more for veterans health care over the next 10 years than the republican budget we made our veterans a promise we must keep that promise americas fighting men and women risk their lives for this country they deserve the very best health care the best services we can give them but my republican colleagues will not allow a vote will not even allow a vote on the clement veterans amendment the democratic budget provides more for defense spending over the long run than the republican budget because in the later years my republican colleagues had to choose between defense spending and tax cuts what do my colleagues think mr speaker they chose the tax cuts meanwhile the democratic budget still manages to provide some balanced tax cuts and keep our economy from slipping back into deficit the republican budget on the other hand will create a whole new deficit by the year 2014 the democratic budget does more to reduce class size and modernize our schools than the republican budget which will cut spending for head start cut spending for pell grants and cut money for work study the democratic budget protects important programs like wic which the republican budget cuts by so much that 1 2 million women infants and children will lose their benefits next year 16 400 of them live in my home state of massachusetts the wic program provides essential nutrition and education during the early years of the childrens development in order to make sure that they start school ready to learn if we do not give them good nutrition when they are very young we lose our chance forever some of my democratic colleagues tried to make sure that we got that chance but this rule does not make in order the defazio amendment on the progressive budget the clement amendment on the veterans budget or the mink amendment on education this rule does make in order the shadeggcoburn amendment which some people are equating with president clintons budget they say it reflects some cbo comparison i want to make something perfectly clear the shadeggcoburn amendment looks as much like president clintons budget as i look like gwyneth paltrow looking at this budget we would think that my republican colleagues have very sharp memories when it comes to bad habits that gave us the budget deficits in the 1980s and the tripling of our national debt now that our budget finally is in the black we should be very very careful about repeating those mistakes so i urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question if the previous question is defeated we will make in order the clement amendment to take care of our american veterans our veterans deserve every bit of care we can give them this country made them a promise this country should live up to that promise yesterdays unitedstatesa today says if your member of congress comes home this weekend bragging about having adopted a responsible federal budget dont you believe it so i urge my

citizens immigrants and the children of undocumented immigrants in the country are developed and implemented i do not see the same concern for the 3 8 million united states citizens in puerto rico the americans in the island continue to be neglected and discriminated against by being barred from equitable participation in the most fundamental rights of citizenship the right to vote and the right to representation not to mention participation in the safety net programs that provide basic relief to the neediest in the nation the disadvantaged the aged the handicapped and the children it is distressing to behold that by virtue of living in a territory some american citizens do not have the same rights and benefits as all other americans in the nation why are citizens in the territories denied what all other citizens are guaranteed are there two different kinds of citizenship in our nation the example of democracy what is even more discouraging is that not only the great expectations for future success and equal participation do not apply to puerto ricans in the islands but that residents in the island will continue to lag further and further behind as they are fenced out from the rest of the nation throughout my political life i have fought to provide equality for the united states citizens in puerto rico and i wonder how our nation can continue to maintain separate but equal policies similar to the discriminatory policies that were the force that brought about the enactment of the civil rights act of 1964 i am compelled to provide a voice for the thousands of low income disadvantaged the handicapped elderly and children who are deprived of the most basic safety net programs that all other americans and immigrants can participate in the 50 states of the union it is terrible to consider that our nations commitment to equality in health does not extend to the american citizens in puerto rico or in guam or in the virgin islands and thus deprives us of the necessary medical care that may prove the difference between life and death by virtue of the fact that we reside in a territory health discrimination is an abomination this includes medicaid for which puerto rico contrary to the policy for all other states receives a block grant capped this year at 171 5 million i am also talking about our exclusion from supplemental security income the supplemental income that ensures blind disadvantaged and handicapped individuals have income protection i am also talking about medicare and how reimbursement for providers has been set at a lower rate despite the fact that costs are comparable to the provision of services in many states unfortunately as the nation benefits from the tremendous budget surplus the americans in the territory will also be excluded from many of the most significant policy initiatives presented this session the 500 billion social security enhancement proposed by the universal savings accounts commonly referred to as the usa accounts will not apply to the citizens in the island even though we contribute to social security equally as all other citizens what is more money from our contributions to the social security funds will be used to manage and administer the program which will be denied to us but this initiative is just one of the many new proposals that will not apply to the nearly 4 million unitedstates citizens in puerto rico many other proposals ranging from welfare to work to building new schools to providing incentives to workers and even the empowerment zones and the new market initiatives that aim to

are equal americans how can our nation stand as a model for the world when it maintains a policy of discrimination a policy of economic and political apartheid for 100 years we have stood shoulder to shoulder as we have defended freedom and democratic values wherever and whenever it has been needed in the world as we enter the millennium we should not be pushed behind our fellow citizens in the 50

security and phase it out over time this is the house majority leader dick armey what my friend from north dakota has said is right the majority has never felt good about medicare as my friend has said in 1965 when medicare came into being there really wasnt a need for prescription drugs because prescription drugs were in their infancy and it didnt matter the vast majority of the time whether someone was going to live or die be comfortable or not now how can we the only superpower in the world a nation that is leading the world in research and medical products how can we have a medicare program a program for health care for senior citizens that does not include the prescription drug benefit we cant do that i also say to my friend the reason we are here is this morning a senator came over and gave this presentation and said what my friend from north dakota said sure we want to do something about medicare but i have gotten letters from my constituents saying im against the big government plan this is exactly what we hear on the radio advertisements and the television advertisements that are paid for by the health care industry they want the american people to think that the program the democrats are propounding is a big government plan there could be nothing further from the truth what does this have to do with big government a woman by the name of gail rattigah from henderson nv writes i am a registered nurse who recently cared for an 82yearold woman who tried to commit suicide because she couldnt afford the medications her doctor told her were necessary to prevent a stroke it would be much more cost effective for the government to pay for medications that prevent more serious illnesses and expensive hospitalizations these include but are not limited to blood pressure medications antistroke anticoagulants and cholesterol medications the governments current policy of paying for medications only in the hospital is backward get into health promotion and disease promotion and save money this is a registered nurse from henderson nv i want everyone on the majority side to know they are not going to be able to come over and make these statements as if there is no opposition to it what my friend from tennessee says is wrong he states he has gotten all of these letters saying i am against the big government plan that is because of the radio and tv advertisements from the powerful health insurance industry but the real people are like the 82yearold woman who wanted to commit suicide because she couldnt get medication also i want to spread across this record that my friend from tennessee who came and said we need the republican plan makes the statement that he wants to involve senator breaux in this the majority cant have it both ways they either support the bush plan the plan of the person running for the president of the united states on the republican ticket or they dont support the nominee it appears what my friend from tennessee is doing is trying to have it both ways because the senator from louisiana does not support governor bushs plan the majority realizes that their medicare plan simply can not work because of their nominees 1 6 trillion tax cut proposal senator breaux pointed this out quite clearly today my point is i say to my friend from north dakota people who come here and make statements on the floor need to have substantiation i say the senator from louisiana does not support the bush medicare plan i also say the majority has introduced a proposalso we understand it but it is a medicare prescription drug benefit in name only a new york times writer states all indications are that this plan is a nonstarter insurance companies themselves are very skeptical there havent been many cases in which an

senior citizens not people who make less than 12 000 a year it is a program that is essential it is essential because people as we speak such as gail rattigan who is a registered nurse who wrote to me

opportunity tonight to be able to make some comments of my own on such an important subject but first i want to thank him for his giving the attention to such a complex sensitive and yet important subject that it deserves and also thank the gentleman from colorado for his expertise and for his knowledge of immigration which i think provides a great contribution to those of us here in the house who certainly can benefit from his personal knowledge firsthand knowledge of immigration as it impacts his state of colorado i would like to call the attention of my colleagues to the destructive effect of our current immigration policy it is having a destructive impact on recent immigrants and black and hispanic citizens and also how a more enlightened immigration policy would benefit american minorities and in fact the overall american economy each year close to 900 000 legal immigrants enter the united states of these about 300 000 have less than a high school education and their competition forscarce jobs does have a destructive impact on the opportunity of american workers with no more than a high school diploma who are disproportionately and unfortunately recent immigrants and black and hispanic citizens among reports of a growing prospering economy are other more troubling reports on a growing gap between the welltodo and the working poor the national unemployment rate is about 4 percent where for those with less than a high school education it is more than twice as high over 8 percent in many cities where there are high recent immigrant populations the unemployment rates are in double digits for those with less education where is opportunity for these individuals and their families numerous polls indicate that black and hispanic americans know this only too well this is no surprise given that they are hurt disproportionately by our immigration policy today we cannot pretend that the adverse impact of mass immigration on minorities does not exist we can and should find solutions to protect the jobs and wages of recent immigrants and black and hispanic citizens how often do we read about the longterm unemployed or the working poor or single mothers with no mention of the serious impact of immigration on their employment wages and working conditions how often do we hear comments about the growing gap between the welltodo and the working poor that do not mention that almost half the relative decline in wages of those who do not finish high school is caused in fact by competition from immigration think of a single mother barely surviving in a minimum wage job who sees her annual wages depressed by 2 000 because she must compete with more and more unskilled immigrants she very well might be a recent immigrant herself seeking a better life for herself and her children or she might be able to trace her roots in this country back generations and is simply seeking the american dream that has been denied her ancestors think what she can do for herself and her children with that lost money buy a used car so she does not have to take a bus to work put a down payment on a modest home or even fix the furnace before winter comes worse think what would happen if she actually loses her job because of the neverending competition from new arrivals it is certainly not the immigrants themselves who are to blame and who understandably want to come to america it is our immigration policy that is to blame but who knows how many people have been hurt by the unintended consequences of our outdated immigration policy a series of recent studies have all documented the effects of immigration policy on lowskilled american workers and recent immigrants the national research council of the national academy of sciences concludes that immigration was responsible for about 44 percent of the total decline in relative wages of high school dropouts between 1980 and 1994 the rand corporation reports that in california the widening gap between the number of jobs available for noncollegeeducated workers and the increasing number of new noncollegeeducated immigrants signals growing competition for jobs and hence a further decline in the relative earnings at the low end of the labor market the unitedstates commission on immigration reform chaired by congresswoman barbara jordan finds that immigration of unskilled immigrants comes at a cost to unskilled unitedstates workers the hudson institute states that unitedstates immigration policy serves primarily to increase the number of unitedstates residents who lack even a high school degree america must stop recruiting workers for jobs that do not exist or exist only at the lowest wages the brookings institute published a paper concluding that immigration has had a marked adverse impact on the economic status of the least skilled unitedstates workers the center for immigration studies calculates that immigration may reduce the wages of the average native in a lowskilled occupation by over 1 900 a year cis also found that the poverty rate for persons living in immigrant households of 1997 was 22 percent almost double the 12 percent rate for persons in native households it concluded that reducing the flow of less skilled immigrants who enter each year would have the desirable effect of reducing job competition between more established immigrants and new arrivals for lowwage jobs reducing the supply of this kind of labor would create upward pressure on wages and benefits for the working poor including immigrants already in the country over time this should reduce poverty among immigrants who work these studies reinforce what common sense already tells us in addition add three other facts together first immigrants will account for half of the increase in the workforce in the 1990s second the skilled level of immigrants relative to americans has been declining for years thirtyfive percent of immigrant workers who have arrived since 1990 do not have a high school education compared to only 9 percent of nativeborn workers some 300 000 illegal immigrants without high school educations arrived last year and will total 3 million this decade third close to 90 percent of all future jobs in america will require more than a high school education the mismatch is clear nearly half of all immigrants today are not prepared for the jobs of the future current immigration policy has many americans and recent immigrants competing with hundreds of thousands of newcomers without high school degrees for a fixed number of lowskilled jobs this is a recipe for disaster for millions of bluecollar workers and their families no one should complain about the plight of the working poor or the persistence of minority unemployment or the levels of income inequality in america without acknowledging the unintended consequences of our present immigration policy of course immigration is neither all good nor all bad immigrants benefit america in many ways but we should design our immigration policies so that it enhances rather than diminishes opportunity for american workers we should protect the jobs of working americans and we can make a better life for all americans wherever they were born just as american minorities would benefit from a reduced number of lowskilled immigrants the american economy and american firms trying to prosper in this era of global competition would benefit enormously from an increased flow of more educated immigrants american industry is pleading for more skilled and educated workers the chairman of the national association of manufacturers recently stated that the shortage of skilled employees is not a distant threat anymore the skills gap is now catching up to us and could threaten the amazing growth and productivity gains of the past decade finding an adequate supply of qualified employees is the number one issue for american industry today nam found that 88 percent of manufacturers are experiencing a shortage of qualified workers 60 percent find that current workers lack basic math skills and that 55 percent find serious deficiencies in workers basic writing and comprehension skills these problems can be solved with more educated workers and because immigration accounts for such a high percentage of workforce growth almost onehalf an emphasis on more educated immigrants would be an important part of the solution the result would be a more productive american economy and more productive american businesses as the productivity of the american economy increases so will the prosperity of all americans american citizens and legal residents will benefit in another way from more educated immigrants to borrow a line from a new book by george borjas skilled immigrants earn more pay higher

tremendously disappointed with the leadership shown or lack of leadership shown by the unitedstates department of agriculture during the entire process that has led up to the publishing of the tmdl rule the total maximum daily load during the entire process there has been much much to be faulted there are serious questions about the science and financial analysis underlying these new water quality regulations proposed by epa recent reports by the general accounting office the society of american foresters and other respected experts have questioned the wisdom of epas proposed rules our colleagues on the committee on transportation and infrastructure have called on the epa to withdraw this rule as have a number of agricultural and environmental groups even usda in their own testimony before the committee on appropriations took strong exception to some of what epa proposed in their tmdl rule although they seem to have tempered that concern somewhat this house has already spoken on this issue with a provision passed by the house in the vahud appropriation bill that does not allow epa to implement the proposed rule in fy now usda has the technical and scientific expertise to review the actions of epa and help guide them toward a reasonable solution that might actually work in the field and that is why the gentleman from arkansas offers this amendment today and why it is very pertinent to the discussion today if the department of agriculture is not willing to use their resources to stand up to epa for the benefit of farmers and ranchers and the environment then we should spend their money helping those same landowners that are already trying to preserve their soil and protect water quality that is the simplistics of this amendment now i find it very frustrating because i happen to have been chairman of the subcommittee on department operations oversight nutrition and forestry when we reorganized usda in 1992 and one of the things we agreed to in this congress and with the administration was that we wanted to improve the ability of usda to be a coequal with other branches of government when it comes to dealing with environmental and food safety issues the problem is that we do not have a coequal when one part of the coequal does not stand up for that which is in their own testimony and also in which they have said we agree so the purpose of this amendment today is pretty simple it is delivering what we hope will be a very strong message to both epa and to usda that common sense must apply and to all of those groups that keep pounding on epa to do things that do not make common sense to require our farmers and ranchers to spend unlimited amounts of money fixing a problem that may not be fixable with any amount of money if we could just come back just come back to a common sense approach in which we recognize that farmers and ranchers want to solve the tmdl problem i certainly in my district have some very serious problems in which all farmers and ranchers are willing to work with reasonable people to come up with a reasonable solution that will solve the problem therefore i am not here today saying we should do nothing but many times doing something is very very detrimental to the very cause in which we are talking and today it is clean water when there is someone within a bureaucracy that so believes they are right that they are completely completely willing to ignore all common sense and forge ahead with requiring paperwork burdens and things that absolutely will not solve the problem in the opinion of everybody but them there is a problem so this amendment is very serious let us put the money where there is an indication that we will have a willingness to solve the problem hopefully though we will have the kind of common sense approach to this question that will lead us to a solution that can be embraced by all certainly that is the desire of farmers and ranchers that i represent in my district in my state and the other 49 states to those out there in epa land listen carefully we want to work with them we do not agree with those of them who believe that the only solution is theirs and they

victims in their most productive years medical costs rising families that are dissipated children that are put to work lack of educational opportunities according to the who recent studies in india

hundreds of thousands of dollars to treat in the united states let us ratchet the amount up i rise today in support of this amendment to increase funding for global tb control because although we have a cheap effective treatment for tb the tragic fact is tb will kill more people this year than any year in historysomeone every 15 seconds tb is the biggest infectious killer of young women in the world in fact tb kills more women than any single cause of maternal mortality tb is the biggest killer of people with aidsaccounting for 40 percent or more of all aids deaths in africa and asia in the developing world tuberculosis also destroys girls and womens futures tb tends to attack its victims in their most productive years often killing or sickening the primary breadwinner of a family in order to pay for medical costs and generate income families frequently take their young girls out of school and put them to work tb means the loss of educational opportunity for girls it means dire poverty for families in some parts of the world there is a great stigma attached to contracting tb this leads to increased isolation abandonment and divorce of women according to who recent studies on india found that 100 000 women are rejected by their families because of tb every year in nepal there are numerous stories of young widows with no income and no prospects for another marriage turning to prostitution in order to support their families currently an estimated one third of the worlds population including some 1015 million people in the united states are infected with the tb bacteria because there is no way to stop tb at national borders the only way to eliminate tb here in the unitedstates is to control it worldwide especially in nations with the greatest tb burden the real tragedy is that effective tb treatmentwith drugs costing as little as 10 for a full 6 month course is only reaching 20 percent of those ill with tb it is crucial that we act aggressively now to expand access to this costeffective treatment and thereby control the spread of tb worldwide there is only a small window of opportunity available to us to do so if we fail to act now resistant strains of tb will continue to develop which will be incredibly costly and possibly even impossible to treat i want to acknowledge and thank the foreign operations subcommittee especially chairman callahan and ranking member pelosi for their efforts this year and over the past several years to give tb greater priority i stand here today because i believe we need to ratchet up that effort even more to go

before or shortly after the incoming administration assumes office actually does occur this orientation process provides an opportunity for a smoother transition for the new administration and would eliminate many of the mistakes that we often observe that occur because of the transition that many people who serve in an administration have to make into public life crafting an explicit provision

they are being asked to pay higher prices at the supermarket we are no longer giving farmers in certain areas of the country an incentive to produce milk we are now giving them an incentive to overproduce milk that is where we are today this type of system does not provide an incentive for farmers to operate efficiently or produce items that are natural to their agricultural environment if
