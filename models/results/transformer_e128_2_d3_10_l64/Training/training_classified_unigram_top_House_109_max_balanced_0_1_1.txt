balance the republican budget includes a deficit for 2006 of 372 billion and a deficit for 2007 of 348 billion these deficiti mean that under republican policies the five largest deficits in history will have occurred in five consecutive years over the next five years 20072011 the budget resolution calls for deficits totaling 1 1 trillion since this administration took office it has requested and the congress has provided four increases in the statutory debt ceiling totaling 3 trillion under this budget by 2011 the statutory debt will increase by another 2 3 trillion for a total increase of 5 3 trillion it will leave the statutory debt at a record level of 11 3 trillion the presidents reckless economic policies have doubled our nations debt further i am concerned by the amount of the debt that has been accumulated by foreign bank individuals and governments in 1980 17 percent of the federal debt held by the public was in foreign hands by 2006 45 percent of the debt held by the public was ovned overseas unfortunately this trend seems to be increasing rapidly during the past year approximately 90 percent of the debt we have accumulated has been purchased by foreign banks individuals and governments i support the representative john spratts alternative budget which would reach balance in 2012 the spraft budget also has smaller deficits than the republican budget and accumulates less debt by contrast the republican budget never returns to balance and even refuses to show how big its deficits will be after 2011 the spratt budget backs the twosided payasyougo paygo budget enforcement rules that require that the cost of any new mandatory spending or revenue legislation be fully offset during the 1990s twosided paygo rules played a critical role in turning record deficits to record surpluses the spratt budget also requires a separate vote to increase the debt limit and prohibits using fasttrack reconciliation procedures to make the deficit worse the republican budget cuts appropriations for domestic services by 9 4 billion relative to current services and by 3 2 billion below the level passed by republicans in the senate meanwhile the budget continues medicare subsidies close to 60 billion for managed care providers of medicare even though they are supposed to save medicare money not cost more the resolution also includes 228 billion over five years for additional tax cuts part of a 3 trillion tenyear republican tax cut agenda the republican resolution cuts appropriated funding for education and related programs below current services providing the same inadequate level as provided by the president for 2007 that repub ican level cuts funding for the department of education by 2 2 billion below last years comparable level and eliminates 42 education programs the spratt budget provides 4 6 billion more than the republican budget for education appropriations and over five years provides 45 3 billion more than the republican resolution the spratt budget rejects the deep cuts proposed by the republican budget and preserves programs such as vocational education perkins loans safe and drugfree schools state grants and the gearup college readiness program the spratt budget also makes a down payment on college affordability by cutting student loan interest rates after a temporary one year gain the republican budget after five years cuts funding for veterans health care by 6 0 billion below current services the spratt budget includes 6 0 billion more than the republican budget over five years for veterans health care the spratt budget also rejects the increase on health care fees on military retirees who are enrolled in tricare the republican budget asks additional sacrifices from those who have served and sacrificed for our country the spratt budget rejects the misguided republican policies and keeps our commitment to our veterans the republican budget cuts funding for health by 18 1 billion below current services over five years the same insufficient level provided by the president the republican level means cuts to priorities such as the centers for disease control 18 of 19 institutes at the national institutes of health and rural health activities the spratt budget provides 18 billion more over five years to fund health priorities cut by the republican budget including medical research at nih and graduate medical education for childrens hospitals the spraft budget also takes steps to address the problems with theimplementation of the medicare prescription drug benefit including extending the may 15 signup period through the end of year and protecting seniors from any enrollment penalties the spratt budget also takes steps to help the uninsured and creates a reserve fund to increase medicare payments to physicians which are currently scheduled to be cut for the environment and natural resources this republican budget imposes a 25 0 billion cut relative to current services over the next five years and imposes a 2 9 billion cut for next year alone this is the same level as the presidents budget which cuts funding for the environmental protection agency including the clean water state revolving fund the army corps of engineers and the national park service the house republican budget resolution actually makes the deficit worse offers no plan to bring the budget back to balance and adds to the growing burden of the national debt meanwhile the republican budget makes harmful cuts to critical services for the american people including education veterans services health and environmental protection i ask my colleagues to oppose this budget and support the spratt alternative budget"], [0.0021331780590116978, 0.0021331780590116978, 0, "ida i ask

on so many issues that are important to the american people i am going to be heading to my district for the weekend as most members are spending some time there having the opportunity to talk with them but as the gentleman from georgia was saying we wanted the opportunity to just address and maybe do a little bit of correcting on some of the points that our colleagues from across the aisle have been saying and stating sometimes i think that they are just sadly misinformed on some of these issues they saidthat republicans are not looking to cut spending i just find that extraordinary they said that democrats are the ones that are wanting to cut spending the level of hypocrisy in that statement is absolutely astounding we have a democratic party in this house whose message and i honestly believe many days is the only message that they have that message is spend more whatever it is spend more whatever they are wanting to do if they do not think the outcome is right go spend more and for years they have held this thought that if you just put more money in the pot then the outcome is going to be what they want spend more spend more and what holds them together i think that is something that is a curiosity to many people because they are not united on foreign policy they are not united on winning in iraq they are not united on border control issues they are not united behind working families who tell us repeatedly that what they want is lower taxes lighter regulation preserving individual freedom and having their shot at hope and opportunity our colleagues across the aisle are not united on that the one thing that they repeatedly seem to be united on is spending more of the taxpayers money spending more of your hardearned money and it is amazing to me government never gets enough of the taxpayer money government has this huge voracious appetite for the taxpayers money they just cannot get enough of it there is always another program many of them are great programs but one of the truths that we all see here in this body if government moves in to solve a problem generally neither the private nor notforprofit sector will move in and address that problem 1415 so you have additional costs that come about every time we talk about winning in iraq our friends across the aisle seem to say let us get out regardless of the sacrifices that are made every time we talk about controlling the border they are over there saying no way yesterday i was on a cnbc program and a democrat member of the house said that their party had never been invited to offer spending cuts there are 435 members of this body and they are waiting for an invitation to come in and participate in how to reduce the size of government this morning i was on the floor and i said please consider this the invitation come on everybody needs to work on this it should be a bipartisan effort it should involve every single member of this house how we go about reducing what the federal government spends i have three bills that would enact acrosstheboard cuts 1 percent 2 percent and 5 percent cuts and for all of their talk today about how they want to cut spending not one single democrat is on those bills not one we have got 14 republicans who are on those bills and not one democrat has signed on to commit to finding 1 2 or 5 percent of waste fraud and abuse in government spending i ask my colleagues who is really leading on this issue i hear plenty of accusations from the left i hear plenty of complaining and i see zero action a lot of talk no action they controlled this body for 40 years and in that 40 years they built layer after layer after layer after layer of government they cooked them a big old government cake layer upon layer we have got programs out there that do nothing but waste our money we have got 342 different economic development programs there is a lot of work that we can do everyone is invited to come in and work on these issues and anytime we even try to restrain spending look at the rhetoric that we hear it is our party in this house it is our leader the gentleman from illinois speaker hastert who truly is leading on this issue not the minority leader it is our leaders who are pushing this it is our party who would like to reduce government spending by billions of ddllars billions more in next years budget it is our party that would like to see acrosstheboard spending reductions their solution that they offer is repealingtax relief that is well deserved by hardworking american families repealing that reliefand raising taxes period that is the only thing that unites their party i hope that they will work with us on reducing the spending of the federal government i thank the gentleman from georgia

have in this body is such a wide variety of experience from our members that bring that experience to bear here as we look at how we grow the economy how we exercise economic opportunity how we make certain that free enterprise stays free just as the gentleman from georgia has mentioned it is no secret everybody knows that this economy this wonderful unitedstates economy truly is our nations our worlds economic engine it is the envy of all of the world it is i guess something that is really a little bit uniquely american there is something about us we strive to do things a little bit better maybe it is that yankee ingenuity maybe it is that we are out here with that good old commonsense knowhow but we are always trying to do things faster better more efficiently more effectively and one of the things we certainly want to do is to build a strong economy so that our children know that they are going to have hope and opportunity and the ability to dream big dreams and create a really exciting life for themselves and for their families i guess that is just kind of the american way of doing things we try to improve it give us something and we are going to build a better mousetrap then we are going to figure out how to get that mousetrap into the marketplace in todays economy we look at it and we say how do we get that into a global marketplace we know in order to do that it means you have to stay competitive we know that as you look at policies creating the right environment so that job growth can take place so that economic growth can take place that when we see that right environment created then free enterprise and the private sector take over and they do what they do well the gentleman has shown us the charts which tell this story you go back and you look at 2003 and look at when those tax reforms were implemented and what we saw was an economy that took off what we are seeing is consistent economic growth every single month we are reaping the benefits from that we see that our gdp growth continues to be very consistent it was 4 1 percent last quarter there are some really wonderful benefits that come from this as the gentleman mentioned 4 460 000 new jobs those are new jobs many of those jobs are jobs that are basically in new sectors technology sectors sectors of the economy that will lead to an economic renaissance and lead to an economic renaissance in this country it works out to be 194 000 jobs a month that we have been creating over the past several months and i find it so interesting that the unemployment rate is near alltime lows when we look at the charts on that we see that as these tax reforms have been put in place and i applaud the senate i applaud the administration and i certainly applaud the leadership in this house for pushing forward these tax reforms in 2003 and as we see those going into place and we see the gdp growth and we see the jobs creation and we watch the unemployment level fall to near historic lows there is also afother benefit from this our colleagues who are joining us here on the floor this evening certainly are watching this one with us and it is that we are seeing the deficit reduced through two ways we have talked so many times on this floor about there being two ways that we work through reducing the deficit and reducing the size of government and rightsizing the federal government and that is we reduce spending and continue to work to root out waste fraud and abuse focusing on that spending column but at the same time we put the focus on economic growth that is where our focus rightfully should be this is an aggressive economy and it is therefore a reason and tomorrow this house is going to move forward and take some excellent steps to pass a bill that is going to continue these tax reforms at this time i am going to yield back to the gentleman from georgia so that he can yield to another of our colleagues and we can continue with our discussion this evening on the benefits that lie ahead by extending these tax reforms and continuing to work toward having a federal income tax system that is flatter that is fairer that is simpler and having one that is going

for spending restraint reduction of the deficit and by slowing the unsustainable and automatic growth of mandatory spending programs and extending tax relief to families and small businesses we have successfully accomplished the first two now this rule will provide for consideration of our final commitment to american taxpayers extending numerous important tax relief provisions in 2001 2003 and 2004 congress enacted responsible tax relief to help create new jobs grow americas economy and put more money in the hands of workers families small businesses farms and ranches following this tax relief unemployment dropped a full percentage point to 5 percent and we have experienced 10 uninterrupted quarters of real growth in our economy above 3 percent the longest stretch since the 1980s as was proven by the tax cuts during the kennedy and reagan administrations federal revenues actually increase after taxes are lowered our expanding economy is led by consumer spending job growth and business investment this is a result of allowing workers to keep more of their hardearned money decreasing the tax burden on small businesses so they can expand and hire more workers and providing incentives for families to save and invest unless we take action today many of the important tax provisions that have helped our economy grow strong will expire without passage of this legislation workers families and small businesses will have less of their paycheck to take home each week h r 4297 the tax relief extension reconciliation act not the most eloquent of names but an important one will continue to build on the economic progress we have already made a key part of the american jobs creation act of 2004 was a return to fairness for those who live work and raise families in states with no state income tax the state and local sales tax deduction is particularly important to those in my home state of florida and nine other states because it gives every taxpayer the opportunity to deduct state sales tax from his federal tax bill something that other highertax states have enjoyed for some time this provision is set to expire in 3 weeks while i will continue to work to make the state and local sales tax deduction permanent this bill extends the provision for an additional year which is an important step forward for fairness the bill also extends several tax incentives to enhance the affordability of higher education including taxdeferred education savings accounts and tax credits for postsecondary education it allows all taxpayers to deduct up to 4 000 of higher education expenses which will help more students go to college for teachers the tax bill extends an important abovetheline deduction to help them contain the costs of outofpocket classroom expenses such as books supplies and computer equipment we all know that our hardworking educators are covering for some of our neediest students and this bill lets them keep the tax deductibility of their generosity in an effort to encourage savings and stable retirement security this tax bill allows lowerincome families that contribute to individual retirement accounts and pension plans to continue receiving a federal match in the form of an income tax credit for the first 2 000 of annual contributions this encourages families to save and plan for their own retirement while we were unable as a body to settle on a social security reform plan surely we can all agree that encouraging lowincome families to save for retirement and giving them the tools to do so is a sound economic policy our bill freezes the rate on capital gains and dividends and prevents an increase of the tax burden on 24 million families it is imperative that we extend this tax relief so our economy will continue on its upward track new data released at the start of december show that our economy continues to strengthen and grow the labor department reported that employers added 215 000 jobs in november after adding 44 000 in october and 17 000 in september in the wake of devastating hurricanes the jobless rate remains unchanged at 5 percent the economy grew at an annual rate of 4 3 percent in the third quarter much stronger than expected forecasters outlooks for coming months are upbeat as well novembers increase in payroll the largest since july was broadbased construction employment rose by 37 000 employment in professional and technical services rose by 22 000 health care employment rose by 20 000 jobs manufacturers added 11 000 jobs last month following an increase of 15 000 in october the most recent commerce department report shows overall consumer spending increased at a 4 2 percent annual rate exceeding expectations purchases of nondurable goods surged 3 6 percent exceeding expectations housing spending came in at 8 4 percent business investment spending rose at 8 8 percent exceeding expectations obviously the current tax policy of this congress has encouraged economic growth and to raise taxes now would close the door of opportunity that is open for so many today this rule provides for consideration of a substitute bill while we often hear democrats decry tax relief they have decided to offer a substitute that extends many of the same tax provisions as this underlying bill does but let us look at who they left out the democratic substitute does not extend an income tax credit for lowincome families who contribute toindividual retirement accounts iras and pension plans this hurts lowincome families who are struggling to save for retirement people who are doing the right things to prepare for their future rather than solely depending on the government to do it for them the democratic substitute does not extend enhanced small business depreciation expensing so it increases taxes on small businesses the very engines of innovation and growth and employment in this country the democratic substitute does not include an extension of the reduced rates on capital gains and dividends without this extension 24 million families will see a tax increase including 7 million seniors who have benefited an average of 1 200 annually from that change at a time when concern is growing about foreign investment in the united states the democratic substitute throws up barriers to americans investing in america the democratic substitute does include a tax increase on families and small businesses to pay for the bill many of these individuals are small businesses who do much of the hiring and buying in this economy the democratic substitute bill leaves behind small businesses omits lowincome savers and hurts families and seniors at a time when home heating bills are rising and local property taxes are growing why would the democratic substitute take even more from the wallets and purses and piggy banks of the american taxpayer the republican tax reforms of 2001 2003 and 2004 have created jobs strengthened our economy and increased federal revenues in the process they quantifiably aided in shortening and curtailing the severity of the recession of 2000 and 2001 they buoyed the economy through major terrorist attacks devastating natural disasters and a global war on terrorism now is not the time to increase taxes on the ameriqan people failure to pass this bill would result in higher taxes on seniors savers small businesses and

rise to introduce an amendment that would make the dream of a college education more accessible to youth who are homeless and on their own while many young people experience homelessness as part of a family so many youth in homeless situations are on their own these children are unaccompanied for reasons that are extremely diverse and usually heartbreaking in many cases they have run away to escape physical or sexual abuse others have been abandoned by their parents due to their severe poverty these homeless students are extremely unlikely to be able to access postsecondary education without federal student aid but in order to determine student eligibility for aid the fafsa requires them to provide financial information and a signature from their parent or guardian while these requirements are logical for most applicants they create insurmountable barriers for unaccompanied homeless youth so the very children who are most in need of financial assistance are the least likely to rdceive it my amendment removes these barriers by allowing unaccompanied homeless youth to be considered independent students to ensure that there is no fraud or abuse the living situation of the student must be verified by one of the following individuals a mckinneyvento act school district jiaison a shelter director or a financial aid administrator this independent student status will ensure that unaccompanied homeless youth are not required to provide their parental income information and parental signature information they simply do not have and cannot get the amendment thus opens the doors of higher education to some of our nations most vulnerable youth i should add that this amendment was scored by the cbo as having no budgetary impact"], [6.830692291259766e-05,

year september 30 i believe some sort of liability protection or indemnification is necessary and appropriate to encourage the development and the manufacture of some measures that are going to deal with a pandemic flu i would support reasonable language whatever our respective views are about the wisdom of liability protection the manner in which this particular provision was included in the defense appropriation bill last year is indefensible last december legislation granting liability protection to the vaccine manufacturers was unilaterally inserted into the defense appropriations bill after the conference had closed after an understanding verbally and in writing that no legislative liability language would be inserted into the bill it was done in the dead of night absent any careful consideration no public hearings or debate among the members of this body nothing it was the work of one person and one body it should never have been allowed further there are now no means for victims who are seriously injured to seek compensation unlike other federal vaccine programs swine flu smallpox childrens vaccines usually when government grants liability exemptions to companies it provides some form of relief for the consumers who are injured as we further discovered ajout this bill the liability protection was granted not only to vaccines being developed to prepare us for an avian flu outbreak but also for a far broader range of potential vaccines and medical equipment just about anything else the hiis secretary deems appropriate this sweeping unchecked power granted to a cabinet secretary is unprecedented to my knowledge also sweeping power granted to the pharmaceutical industry the congress ought to consider carefully before ceding its authority to this or any administration under this law manufacturers and their suppliers distributors and their employees vwould be shielded from a lawsuit even if they turned out to be negligent or reckless none of us would agree that a negligent distributor someone who ruined a vaccine by mishandling it for example should be held harmless do we want to say a drug maker who knows a product is defective but chooses to sell it anyway is above the law we face a frightening prospect that millions of americans could contract this deadly flu our first priority ought to be inoculating the american public from a deadly strain of flu and not inoculating pharmaceutical companies from the threat of legal liability this provision has serious implications all my amendment seeks to achieve is to grant the full congress and the committees of jurisdiction the opportunity to fully consider the policy implications of this issue it accomplishes that by sunsetting comprehensive liability protection to the drug manufacturers beyond this fiscal year it gives us plenty of time to have the appropriate parties debate this issue thoroughly lastly let me say a word about the rationale for making this amendment in order because i understand that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are preparing to challenge it on the basis of it being in violation of rule xxi and rule xvi and that is certainly their right but before they do let me ask where was the concern for the rules when a member of the other body unilaterally rewrote liability law in this country given the complete abdication of procedural norms which made this provisions enactment possible which we have seen time and time again in this institution i would ask the majority spare us the lectures about the need to respect house rules in this instance the house should have a full debate on this measure and an upordown vote let us give this institution the opportunity to reclaim the dignity and constitutional authority that the majority renounced in allowing one member to usurp the power of this body to bolster himself on this critical issue that is what this amendment is about i reserve the balance of my time"],
