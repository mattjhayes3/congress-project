you in this house with what i call a sunset memorial because you see before the sun sets today in america almost 4 000 more defenseless unborn children will be killed by abortion on demand in the land of the free and the home of the brave that is more than the number of innocent lives lost on september 11 in this country by a multitude of thousands and it happens every day it has now been 42 years since the tragedy called roe v wade was first handed down since then the very foundation of this nation has been stained by the blood of almost 56 million of its own unborn children some of them cried and screamed as they died but because it was amniotic fluid going over the vocal cords instead of air we couldnt hear them all of them had at least four things in common first they were just little babies who had never done anything wrong to anyone each one of them died a nameless and lonely death and each one of their mothers whether she realizes it or not will never quite be the same all the gifts that these children might have brought for humanity and to humanity are now lost forever yet even in the glare of such tragedy this generation still clings to this blind invincible ignorance while history repeats itself over and over again and our silent genocide mercilessly annihilates the most helpless of all victimsthose yet unborn we should remember the quotes of president abraham lincoln when he said those who deny freedom to others deserve it not themselves and under a just god cannot long retain it mr lincoln called upon all of us to remember americas founding fathers when he said their enlightened belief was that nothing stamped with the divine image and likeness was sent into the world to be trodden on or degraded and imbruted by its fellows he reminded those he called posterityand that is us mr speaker when in the distant future some man some factions some interests should set up a doctrine that some were not entitled to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that their posterity again that is usmight look up again to the declaration of independence and take courage to renew the battle which their fathers began when authorities entered the clinic of dr kermit gosnell they found a torture chamber for little babies that defies description within the constraints of the english language according to the grand jury report dr kermit gosnell had a simple solution for unwanted babies he killed them now he didnt call it that he called it ensuring fetal demise and the way he ensured fetal demise was by sticking scissors in the back of the babys neck and cutting the spinal cord he called it snipping over the years there were hundreds of snippings ashley baldwin one of dr gosnells employees said she saw babies breathing and she described one as 2 feet long that no longer had eyes or a mouth but in her words was making like this screeching noise she said it sounded like a little alien for gods sake is this who we really are kermit gosnell now rightfully sits in prison for killing a mother and murdering innocent paincapable children like the one i just described yet if he had killed them only 5 minutes earlier and before they had passed through the birth canal it would have all been perfectly legal in many of the united states of america including here in the district of columbia if there is one thing we must not miss about this unspeakably evil episode it is that kermit gosnell is not an anomaly he is just the visible face of this lucrative enterprise of murdering paincapable unborn children in america more than 18 000 very lateterm abortions are occurring in america every year placing the mothers at exponentially greater risk and subjecting their paincapable unborn babies to torture and death without anesthesia it is the worst atrocity in america today and this in the land of the free and the home of the brave throughout history there has often been great intensity surrounding the debates of protecting the innocent lives of those who through no fault of their own find themselves obscured in the shadows of humanity it encourages me greatly that in nearly all of those cases the collective conscience was finally moved in favor of the victims the same thing is beginning to happen in this debate related to innocent unborn children especially those that are pain capable we are beginning to ask ourselves the real question does abortion take the life of a child we are especially asking the question recently does very lateterm abortion torture and take the life of a paincapable baby and we are finally beginning to realize as human beings that it does ultrasound technology now demonstrates to all reasonable observers both the humanity of the victim and the inhumanity of what is being done to them and we are beginning to realize as americans that taking brutally the lives of the innocent unborn does not liberate anyone and that 56 million children is enough ironically i have heard barack obama speak such poignant words that whether he knows it or not apply so profoundly to the tragedy of abortion on demand in america let me quote excerpted portions of his comments he said this is our first task caring for our children it is our first job if we dont get that right we dont get anything right that is how as a society we will be judged he went on to say and by that measure can we truly say as a nation that we are meeting our obligations can we honestly say that we are doing enough to keep our childrenall of them safe from harm can we say that we are truly doing enough to give all the children of this country the chance they deserve to live out their lives with happiness and purpose the president went on to say i have been reflecting on this the last few days and if we are honest with ourselves the answer is no we are not doing enough and we will have to change oh how true the presidents words are the president also said we cant tolerate this anymore these tragedies must end and to end them we must change and then the president asked are we really prepared to say that we are powerless in the face of such carnage that the politics are too hard are we prepared to say that such violence visited on our children year after year after year is somehow the price of freedom is this not the most relevant of questions we should all be asking in the midst of this genocidal murder of thousands of unborn babies in america every day the president has said our journey is not complete until all our children are cared for and cherished and always safe from harm finally he said that is our generations taskto make these words these rights these values of life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness real for every american never have i so deeply agreed with any words ever spoken by president barack obama as those i have just quoted and yet this president in the most merciless distortion of logic and reason and humanity itself refuses to apply these majestic words to helpless unborn babies oh how i wish somehow that mr obama and all of us could open our hearts and our ears to his words and ask ourselves in the core of our own soul why his words that should apply to all children cannot apply to the most helpless of all children we honor abraham lincoln most because he found the courage as president of the united states in the days of slavery and he found the humanity within himself to recognize the image of god stamped on the soul of slaves that the supreme court said were not human and that the tide of public opinion didnt recognize as protectable under the law could it still be that president barack obama might consider that perspective as well as his own legacy and even eternity itself and recognize that those little unborn children look so desperately to him now for help could it be that the president might finally remember that on the pages of the bible on which he laid his hands were the words written in red inasmuch as you have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren you have done it unto me whether he does or not it is time for those of us in this chamber to remind ourselves of why we are really all here thomas jefferson said the care of human life and its happiness and not its destruction is the chief and only object of good government the phrase in the 14th amendment capsulizes our entire constitution it says no state shall deprive any person of life liberty or property without the due process of law the 14th amendment tells us that we should have equal protection of the laws for all protecting the lives of all americans and their constitutional rights is why we are all here the bedrock foundation of this republic is that clarion declaration of the selfevident truth that all human beings are created equal and endowed by their creator with unalienable rights the rights of life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness every conflict and battle our nation has ever faced can be traced to our commitment to this core selfevident truth it has made us the beacon of hope for the entire world it is truly who we are yet today another day has passed as so many sunset memorials that i have given another day has passed and we in this body have failed again to honor that foundational commitment we have failed our sworn oath and our godgiven responsibility as we broke faith with nearly 4 000 more innocent unborn babies who died today without the protection we should have given them so let me conclude this sunset memorial in the hope that perhaps someone new who heard it will finally embrace the truth that abortion really does kill little babies that it hurts mothers in ways that we can never express and that it is time we stood up together again and looked up to the declaration of independence and that we remember that we are the same america that rejected human slavery and marched into europe to arrest the nazi holocaust and we are still the courageous and compassionate nation that can find a better way for mothers and their unborn children than abortion on demand it is still not too late for us to make a better world and for america to be the one that leads the rest of the planet just as we did in the days of slavery from this tragic genocide of murdering nearly 4 000 of our own children every day so now as we consider the thousands the hundreds of thousands out on the mall marching to protect these little babies as we consider the plight of the unborn for 42 years under roe v wade maybe we can each remind ourselves that our own days in this sunshine of life are all numbered and that we too each one shall walk from these chambers one day for the very last time if it should be that congress is allowed to convene on yet another day may that be the day when we finally hear the cries when we finally hear the cries of innocent unborn children may that be the day when we find the humanity and the constitutional duty to protect these the least of our tiny little american brothers and sisters from this murderous scourge upon our nation called abortion on demand it is now 42 years to the day since roe v wade first stained the foundation of this nation with the blood of its own childrenthis in the land of the free and the home of the brave i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.0013949415879324079, 0.0013949415879324079, 0, "i appreciate you making time to be down here with me today i am down here to talk about the war on coal and when i say the war on coal people think of that as if we can actually go and attack a natural resource i am not worried about attacking natural resources i am worried about the impact it has on american families in particular i am worried about the impact it has on families in my district in georgia you cant see this chart but it is a chart that represents section 111 d it is the language that the president used to create his new carbon emission targets i am not saying that congress passed a law to do this because congress didnt pass a law the president just decided he was going to do it i am not saying that the house and the senate got together and debated it because we didnt get together and debate it the president just decided this was the way it was going to be it is 292 words that were already in statute the president has turned it into a 130page regulation that he is implementing on the countryhundreds more pages of technical support documents going behind that this is what president obamas constitutional law professor had to say again this is a regulation that the president is implementing without any action of congress whatsoever laurence tribe the harvard law professor who was president obamas constitutional law professor said this in december of last year to justify the clean power plan the presidents energy plan the epa has brazenly rewritten the history of on obscure section of the 1970 clean air act that is these 292 words i talked about passed by congress in 1970 professor tribe goes on to say frustration with congressional inaction cannot justify throwing the constitution overboard to rescue this lawless epa proposal a clean air act passed in 1970and i will get into some charts that show the successes we have had of previous clean air acts in 1970 1990 the president wants to do things differently than the law of the land allows and he is frustrated as described by professor tribe that congress refuses to do what the president wants us to do i am going to talk about why it is we dont want to do what the president wants us to do we dont want to do it because it is destructive to the american economy and it is destructive to american families we dont want to do what the president wants to do the president hasnt come up here to lobby congress to try to get congress to do what the president wants us to do the president to quote professor tribe is throwing the constitution overboard to rescue this lawless epa proposal we will come back to professor tribe i want to talk about it in terms of my constituency i am right there in kind of the northeastern atlanta suburbs there it is only two counties but they are two of the fastest growing counties in the state of georgia they have also just been named two of the healthiest counties in the state of georgia this is what we are talking about in georgia this is our georgia public service commission that group of elected officials in charge of keeping energy prices affordable for georgia families that group that is tasked with keeping energy supplies reliable in georgia that group that is tasked with regulating energy in the state of georgia it is not the epa it is not president obama it is the georgia public service commission they say this about the presidents rule this rule will be unduly burdensome on georgians placing upward pressure on electricity rates an outcome that is not acceptable to our organization or the citizens that we serve these are not republicans and democrats these are folks who are concerned literally about how families are able to keep the lights on how do you keep the lights on we talk about getting the mortgage paid we talk about getting the car note paid how do you keep the lights on the georgia public service commission is concerned about the burden of this new rule the clean power planthat is what the president calls his planhas nothing to do with clean power it has to do with a war on americas energy security he says this the clean power plan is illegal unfair and unwise that is georgias attorney general that is the one elected official in georgia that is tasked with enforcing the laws of the land as they exist in georgia a statewide elected office he calls this plan illegal unfair and unwise it is not just president obamas constitutional law professor laurence tribe calling it unconstitutional we hear it from our georgia state attorney general as well this is from one of our power suppliers in georgia you may think of power suppliers well of course they want to pollute that is what those big energy companies dononsense oglethorpe power is the group that supplies power to all of the electric coops in the state i know you have electric coops in your state as i do in mine these are citizenowned utilities these are citizenowned companies that make sure the lights stay on oglethorpe power provides the power to those citizenowned groups this is not some big investorowned utility this isnt some dirty power producer this is the group of citizens that represents every single one of us in the state of georgia who receive our power in this way this is what oglethorpe power says consequently there is substantial probability bordering on certainty that oglethorpe power will suffer economic injury if the epa finalizes the proposal in its current form or in any substantially similar form it is a bad idea to do it because congress wasnt involved in it it is a bad idea as professor tribe suggests to do it because the constitution doesnt allow it is a bad idea as georgias attorney general says because it is unfair and it is unwise and it is unlawful it is a bad idea to do it as oglethorpe power says because it is going to burden every single american family particularly these georgia families that oglethorpe power serves if that goes into effect who is going to get hit the hardest i will just use my state of georgia because i get so tired on this house floor of pitting one group of folks against another there is that part of me that remembers when president obama was first running for office and he promised to be the president that had the most transparent administration in american history and he promised to be a uniter bringing america together as we have not heretofore been together in recent times that is not what i see what i see is division what i see are politics of division each and every day so often along economic lines i would argue what is the right metric is not how much money you make in a day it is how much money you are able to make tomorrow the opportunity is the metric on which we ought to measure do you have opportunity for tomorrow do you have choices that you can make to make your life better quoting an energy economist who testified before the energy and commerce committee just this week he said this lowerincome groups will bear the burden of higher energy costs imposed by the epas plan but will be among the least likely to invest in or benefit from the energy efficiency programs that the proposed rule envisions i want you to think about that the president has big plans in this unlawful rule this unconstitutional rule this undebated rule but he has big plans it is twofold number one he is going to get american families to invest in energy efficient products in their home which in theory if i am using less electricity in my home i am going to be spending less money on that electricity the presidents plan is if i can get families to have more efficient products in their home i can drive up the cost of electricity to the home but families are still going to be out about the same amount of money that is not the way the economists see it look at families with their aftertax income of less than 10 000 a year now that is not altogether uncommon in the great state of georgia and certainly those are the folks who already have a tough time keeping the lights on thirty percent or more of their income on average is dedicated to energy costs thirty percent or more of everything that family has is dedicated to paying their energy costs this rule proposes to run those costs up dramatically now you move up to folks who are making aftertax incomes higher than 50 000 and you are down below 5 percent of their income that they are spending on energy costs the folks who can handle an increased rise in energy prices are also going to be those folks who invest in the more energy efficient system it is those folks who are trapped at the bottom of the income ladder who dont have those opportunities to invest in more energyefficient products who are going to be hit the hardest by rising energy prices there is not a man or woman in my district700 000 strongwho doesnt want to see clean air but the presidents rule isnt about clean air it is about picking winners and losers in energy production the president doesnt like coal he doesnt like coal miners he doesnt like coal processors he dont like coal power plant operators this isnt about clean air it is about coal is going to have an economic impact on constituents in my district let me go back to the words that folks use this is the georgia chamber of commerce they obviously have an obligation to grow the economy in georgia let me just tell you that you cant pay taxes if you dont have a job right it is an essential point of basic government economics you need people to work you need people to be successful because if they are not successful they cannot pay their taxes the georgia chamber of commerce is dedicated to success in our part of the world they say epas regulations will impose billions of dollars in costs on the united statesand georgias economy but fail to meaningfully reduce 0o2 emissions on a global scale if epa adopts policies that substantially increase the cost of energy thereby decreasing the competitiveness of the united states investments and emissions will be sent to other less efficient countries with higher c02 emission intensities as a result overly restrictive and costly united states policies to reduce emissions will not only be offset around the globe but could actually result in a net increase i want you to think about that i want you to think about that we just had this conversation in respect to the keystone pipeline the president vetoed bipartisan language passed in this house passed in the senate to build the keystone pipeline this pipeline has been in the approval process for longer than it took to build the entire hoover dam the entire hoover dam start to finish was built faster than we can even get an approval this law wasnt to mandate the building of the pipeline this law was to mandate that the approval process come to conclusion the process still hasnt come to a conclusionthe president wont do itas if if america decides not to build the keystone pipeline oil will not be harvested in the independent nation of canadanonsense canada didnt ask us whether or not they should bring the oil out of the ground they asked us to help them get the oil to market they are americas largest trading partner they said america will you help us with this pipeline the answer should have been absolutely yes if not yes perhaps the answer could be no but instead of a yes or no we had 7 years of delay well that oil is going to come out of the ground it is going to be shipped to a port in canada it is going to be shipped overseas to china i promise you it is not going to reduce emissions it is going to increase emissions because they are not going to process it in china as responsibly as we process it here what is the president asking of us we are talking about how this is going to raise the cost of producing goods again just in georgia between 2005 and 2012the last 7 years mr speakerwe have reduced carbon emissions in georgia by 33 percent the presidents targets have georgia needing another 44 percent in reductions by 203044 percent according to the georgia environmental protection divisionagain these arent the folks who are in charge of polluting the air these are the folks who are in charge of protecting the air our georgia epd which is our equivalent of the epa they are tough on polluters they are tough on folks who dont want to be good corporate citizens they say the cpp this is the presidents proposal does not provide flexibility to georgia in fact the cpp is inflexible and punitive to states that have taken early action i want you to think about that if you were sitting around doing nothing if you didnt come from two of the healthiest counties in the country as i do if you werent worried about protecting the planet about our stewardship responsibilities to the earth if you werent worried about any of those things the president is going to set some targets for you again these are the unlawful unwise constitutional targets but he is going to set some targets for you that you need to achieve if you have been working as we have in georgia to do the right thing ahead of time he is still setting those targets for you giving you no credit for the good things you have done in the past asking you to do even more in the future it is not going to be economically feasible georgia number six in the nation is being asked to do the most by the white house in this unwise unlawful unconstitutional rulemaking lets talk about the dollars and cents that are required here for the nation we are talking about between 360 billion and 480 billion to implement the presidents proposalagain the unlawful unwise unconstitutional proposalbut the presidents proposal 360 billion to 480 billion according to the economic projections that is going to be about a 12 or 13 percent increase in electricity prices across the countrya 12 or 13 percent increase in utility prices electricity prices across the country now in georgia that translates into about 400 a year we have a pretty mild climate in the great state of georgia but it is about 400 a year per family in my district it is about 94 million a year you put all of my constituents together all those folks who are the boss of the seventh district of georgia together we are talking about almost 100 million lost to implement the presidents plan now my question is for what my folks are responsible folks they are dedicated to their stewardship responsibilities they are dedicated to doing the right thing for the right reasons we are not a district where we try to figure out who is to blame we are a district where we try to figure out how to fix it how do you fix it but the current worldwide carbon emissionsagain this isnt about clean air this is about carbon dioxide in the air carbon dioxide is in the air it is a natural part of the air it is a required part of the air carbon dioxide emissions across the country across the world rather if we talk about developed nations we generally talk about the organisation for economic cooperation and development the oecd carbon emissions of those developed nations are projected to be relatively flat for the twogenerational future two generations from now still flat you are not seeing those increase you look at nonoecd nations those emissions are projected to double and then triple from 1990 when we passed the clean air act you see level emissions coming from both oecd and nonoecd nations about 2000 you begin to see those lines diverge and there is no expectation that nonoecd nations are going to change their carbon dioxide emissions there is a funny thing about the earth mr speaker we are all in this together i dont know if you have reflected on that there is no escaping this big ball of rock that we are all floating through space on we are in this together we will succeed or we will fail together for the price tag of 400 per american family for the price tag of 100 million a year just in my one congressional district for the price tag of more than 400 billion a yearthat is about 10 percent of everything we spend in this country about 10 percent of the federal budgetis the cost of implementing the presidents unwise and unlawful regulation and what we get for that what we get for that investment of american treasure what we get for disadvantaging american businesses relative to foreign businesses what we get for raising the costs of american products so that other products around the globe can be cheaper what we get for thatgolly i dont know if you can even see itis this little bitty red line in terms of carbon reductions what i have charted here are metric tons of carbon being produced carbon dioxide being produced around the globe this is the entire globe here i have 1990 i have 2010 i have 2020 i have 2030 the benefit of disadvantaging american workers the benefit of disadvantaging american manufacturers the benefit of raising prices for every single american family is that the amount of carbon produced on the entire planet will drop the distance of this little bitty red line i dont think you can see it now that is 2020 2030 perhaps the line gets visible enough to see it is virtually nothing virtually nothing the president talks about this unwise unlawful unconstitutional proposal as if it is designed to save the world it is not it is not designed to save the world it is not designed to reduce carbon emissions around the globe it is designed to put coal out of business in america we are the saudi arabia of coal we have coal we have clean coal we have coal now if we pulled up the charts of the energy information administration they are not going to tell you that coal production in america is going to go to zero it is not it is falling off dramatically we are putting coal mining families out of business in record numbers if you go into coal mining country it used to be all democrats all the time you know there is not one member of this chamber from the democratic party that represents coal country today because coal miners threw every one of them out not because they as individuals were bad members but because the president was driving those individual families out of business those families said we are doing honorable work we are doing lawful work we work hard for a living and we are providing a national service they are absolutely right 500 billion annually in american treasure for virtually no reduction in carbon around the globe now if we were actually going to talk about clean air and i wish we would i wish we would get out of the business of picking winners and losers and talk about clean air i wish we would get out of the business of having an ax to grind about energy producers and get to talking about clean air if we were going to talk about clean air we would talk about things like nox and sox that is nitrogen oxide sulfur oxide nox and sox we passed the clean air act of 1990and i will remind you that was a republican president and a democratic congressthat bipartisan legislation where the president just didnt decide what he wanted to do he came to congress and worked with congress to craft the law it went after what at that time was so frequently referred to as acid rain you would get this nitrogen oxide this sulfur oxide in the air it would come out of the air when it rained it had an impact around the country nox and sox we went after in the clean air act amendments of 1990 the dark green line represents the sulfur the yellow line represents the nitrogen 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2011 and 2012 we came together as a nation we targeted these pollutants in the air and we changed the way we produced power in this country we didnt abolish coal we made it cleaner coal we didnt abolish electric power coming from these big power plants we changed the way the scrubbers and the smokestacks worked and we positively impacted air quality in this country we didnt pass the clean air act of 1990 because we had an ax to grind we passed the clean air act of 1990 because we had a problem to solve and as you can see by this chart we solved it we didnt just spend money to feel better about it we solved it we werent just trying to pick winners and losers we were trying to solve a problem i want to quote the associated press they are talking about coal in this country talking about the presidents rule talking about carbon production they say thisthey say it is leaving this nations shores but not the planet the fossil fuel trade which has soared under president obama soared because we have had record exploration going on on private land as you know the president has completely eliminated exploration on public lands those permits are not going out the door private exploration has soared under president obamas administration they said this fossil fuel trade threatens to undermine his strategy the presidents strategy to reduce the gases blamed for global warming it also reveals a littlediscussed side effect of countries acting alone on a global issues as the unitedstates tries to set a global example by reducing demand for fossil fuels at home american energy companies are sending more dirty fuel than ever to other parts of the world exports worth billions of dollars each year let me go back when we were working together when we were working together in congress working together with the administration we changed the way we produced energy we changed the way we burned this coal to drastically reduce the pollutants coming from that coal in a classic example of federal overreach again acting alone unlawful unwise and unconstitutional the president has said i want to do more and in doing more according to the ap which is no conservative defender in doing more what the president is doing is telling these energy companies dont try to do better dont try to be cleaner we are going to put you out of business in america so bring these products out of the ground and ship them overseas where do you think our overseas competitors rank in terms of reducing these pollutants where do you think where do you think india ranks where do you think china ranks where do you think these nations competing with american workers rank do you think they are producing it as cleanly as we were in 2012 maybe you think they are a little worse like they were in 2000 maybe you think they are as bad as when we started way back in nonsense they are way back here off the chart altogether if you believe in a stewardship responsibility to the planet if you believe we have a multigenerational obligation to care for our environment then you know that only nations with a robust economy have a robust environmental protection program you think about that you will not find a single nation living in poverty that has advanced environmental protections you cant afford to care about the environment if you cant keep the lights on you cant afford to care about the environment if you cant feed your families we do both in this country in the name of protecting the environment the president is forcing these natural resources overseas which has the combined negative effect of polluting the planet to a greater degree and making american workers competitive to a lesser degree you are shipping cheap energy overseas which makes that manufacturing more productive you are raising energy prices in america which makes our manufacturing less productive i am all about making a difference i am all about solving a problem the president wants to spend half a trillion dollars more than 10 percent of what we spend in this country every year focused solely solely solely on reducing carbon emissions by the size of this line that you cant even see and the people who are going to pay the price for that literally the price are going to be american citizens with higher energy bills and american workers with fewer job opportunities we have two models that we can choose from we can choose from the model that we used in the clean air act of 1990 where we came together in a bipartisan way and we solved a problem together we identified the problem we solved the problem and we have measurable results or we can go it aloneand by alone i dont mean america going it alone i mean the administration and the epa going it aloneunlawful unwise unconstitutional spend a half a trillion dollars more than the size of our budget deficit this year making us less competitive trapping more american families in poverty to achieve absolutely no result at all i will end where i began an obscure section section 11 d 292 words that were never intended to allow the president to do what the president is doing where the presidents own constitutional law professor laurence tribe says the presidents desires cannot justify throwing the constitution overboard to rescue this 130page proposal this 130page proposal which promises to do virtually nothing to change global emissions but promises to disadvantage the american economy in a global economy we can solve our energy challenges we can find energy independence in this country energy security in this country we can solve our environmental stewardship responsibilities we are doing things cleaner and better today than we ever have and we will continue to do so the value of divided government as it is today the value of folks who hold different ideas as we do today two ends of pennsylvania avenue mr speaker the president and the democratic party on one end and republicans and congress on the other the value of that divided government is that it allows us to do the big things the big and necessary things if it is all republicans or all democrats folks just tend to try to jam their own ideas through whether america likes it or not that is not the way to build a stronger nation divided government requiresnot just allows but requiresthat we come together to solve problems every time the president goes it alone every time congress goes it alone we miss an opportunity to come together and solve a problem to justify the clean power plan the presidents power plan the epa has brazenly rewritten the history of an obscure section of the 1970 clean air act frustration with congressional inaction cannot justify throwing the constitution overboard to rescue this lawless epa proposal we have an opportunity to do better and more importantly we have the ability with the men and women in this chamber mr speakerthe men and women who serve this entire institution this entire nation good men and women on both sides of the aisle who care about american workers and who care about the american economy and who care about not just americas environment but the global environmentwe can come together and we can do better but this proposal by the president is not it i hope you will help me to encourage all of our colleagues to reject this proposal to rein in this overreach and then to work together to do those things that matter to our constituentsour bosses back home with that i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.0014165949542075396, 0.0014165949542075396, 0, "i rise today to speak about an issue that i care deeply about protecting unborn babies later today this body will vote on h r 36 the paincapable unborn child protection act this legislation should not be controversial it simply protects unborn babies that a preponderance of scientific evidence has proven can feel pain we are talking about the sixth month of pregnancy this bill is an important step in protecting the unborn i am a proud cosponsor i look forward to casting my vote in favor of the legislation later today recently a group of students at west virginia university made news for courageously speaking out in defense of life at an abortion clinic near morgantown i know firsthand that it is not always politically correct to stand for your values but we should never back down from protecting the unborn i applaud these brave wvu students for their actions their willingness to stand for life reminds me of my days at dartmouth college when i served as the president of the dartmouth coalition for life i remember standing in the cafeteria and handing out educational materials about protecting the unborn and the development of life while i may not have won any popularity contest by standing up for my beliefs that life is precious and abortion is wrong i sure got my fellow students thinking about the prolife issue my prolife commitment was cemented even further when i became a father i have three children and actually today my youngest daughter turns 7 months old i am pleased to represent the state of west virginia where the prolife movement is thriving and the rights of the unborn are being restored in fact just this past february our west virginia state legislature passed our own paincapable unborn protection act by wide bipartisan margins in the state senate of west virginia the exact same bill banning abortion after 20 weeks passed the state senate of west virginia by a vote of 295 with 11 of 16 democrat state senators in my statethat is 68 percent of the democratsvoting for the bill in the west virginia state house of delegates the vote was 8812 again with twothirds of state house members that are democrats voting for the bill this is a bipartisan issue i am hopeful today that a strong bipartisan majority in this chamber will follow the example of my home state of west virginia and pass the paincapable unborn child protection act so these protections are extended to unborn babies in every state in the united states i am honored to also be the lead cosponsor of the life at conception act which simply clarifies that human life begins at conception there is no question that we in the prolife community have our work cut out for us president obama and most democrats in congress refuse to protect life at any stage one of the best examples of how out of touch the other side on this abortion issue came just a few weeks ago across the aisle in the senate where democrats were willing to block a bill aimed at protecting victims of human trafficking simply because it included a provision that prohibited taxpayer funding of abortion they are the extremists on this issue look at president obama himself in 2008 when he was running for president and he was in a debate against john mccain in the saddleback church forum moderated by rick warren the moderator asked president obama when life began and the presidents response was whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade the president of the united states said it is above his pay grade to say when human life begins that is a shame when i ran for congress i made the commitment to the people of the second district of west virginia that i would do everything in my power to defend the unborn i continue to be guided by my faith my values my education and my constituents on this issue i look forward to working with my colleagues to defend the innocent and give a voice to the voiceless unborn babies"],

american energy means jobs when we come here on this house floor and talk about ways to get our economy moving again ways to help americans who want to get back to work there is a very clearcut commonsense answer to get our economy moving again and that is just to open up more of the resources of this great nation just on the placard right there above us inscribed on the walls of this house chamber is a plaque that starts off that says let us develop the resources of our land it is on the house chamber and yet president obama through his policies through his radical regulationsevery single day his unelected bureaucrats wake up figuring out more ways to close off those resources to kill those american jobs when my colleagues come here on the house floor and tell story after story about things like the war on coal these are real wars that this obama administration is waging upon american workers the war on coal is real i have seen it in the eyes of coal workers when i went to my colleagues district in ohio we sat out before a whole room full of coal workers many of them multigenerational these arent people who have their first job in the industry for many of them their father their grandfather worked in the coal industry when you look out at coal workers today as i saw in eastern ohio you see the look of fear not because they face global competition they can beat global competition what they cant beat right now is the barrage of radical regulations coming from the obama administration killing american jobs it has got a real direct impact on workers across this country people who are part of the middle class today that the president loves talking about yet that middle class dream is under attack by these policies they have real impacts in fact one of the other things i went out and saw when i was out in eastern ohio was the utica shale play another example of great american ingenuity these arent just american jobs this is american ingenuity that is figuring out how to explore new areas of energy to allow us not only to create good jobs in america but to be completely energy independent to export our energy to other countries including some of our friends in the world our allies around the world right now that have to get energy from countries like russia who use energy as a weapon against those very countries who would love to get energy from america what is the presidents answer to them the presidents answer is to make it more difficult to create that energy here through rules through regulations what are some real examples just this week the president is in paris not to talk about ways to combat isis and the global threat of terrorism the president is over in paris talking about global warming as people are walking around this town in parkas right now because it is so cold the president is trying to focus on ways to make our economy in america less competitive globally so this week we are bringing up more legislation to push back on those kind of regulations one example is later this week under the congressional review act we are going to be bringing up legislation to reverse president obamas new source performance standard this was one of the many radical rules coming out of the epa one of the biggest threats to jobs in america is the unelected bureaucrats over the epa who have another brilliant idea again dreamed up by people that are unelected that now have a plan to actually make it more difficult to create electricity in america not only more difficult but dramatically more expensive for hardworking taxpayers in this country to buy electricity so we are going to bring up a bill on the house floor this week to reverse that radical regulation as we bring that up we are going to have this debate about something very specific in terms of a policy brought up by the president that is going to make it much harder for our country to be competitive much harder for middle class families to achieve that american dream because it is going to make things more expensive for them things that they buy not just their electricity but it cascades into all the other things that people buy when they go to grocery stores when they go do their christmas shopping these are having real impacts on real people something else we are going to be taking on is the department of the interior right now one of the other agencies of president obama coming out with a well control rule that is going to make it very difficult to drill for oil in the gulf of mexico a place where we through american ingenuity have figured out ways to generate more energy in america that we can use not only to help our economy but to help our friends all around the world so what is the presidents answer using unelected bureaucrats once again to propose a rule that is going to make it more difficult to create those american jobs then of course as my colleague from ohio was talking about this week we are also going to bring up a bill called the architecture of abundance a bill to create more american jobs to create real american energy security again to open up those natural resources that are being shut down by this president so when you talk about getting the economy back on track you dont need a team of economists to come in and figure out some new way to invent the wheel the answer is sitting right underneath our feet in many cases it is the energy that is trapped not trapped by the lack of ingenuity because americans more than anybody in the world have figured out great ways to go and use technology to go and get those resources attract those resources explore and then produce those resources but unfortunately their biggest challenge every day is not the competition from other states not the competition from other companies it is the challenge of the threatening regulations from this obama administration that are trying to shut those opportunities down it has real impacts on real people the coal industry the oil industry the natural gas industry all across the board when our allies around the world are looking to us and saying we want to trade with the united states we want to be able to buy the oil that america is generating that we have now a surplus of and yet the president wants to issue a veto threat when we say lets allow for exporting of oil for goodness sake we have an abundance of it people are getting laid off in the united states those middle class workers that the president loves talking about at photoops who are being laid off because of his policies we have got the technology we have got the expertise we are the world leader all we need is for the right policies to unleash that potential to unleash that opportunity to create those american jobs so as we have been talking about tonight the house will actually be taking actionnot sitting on the sidelines not just criticizing but taking actionbringing bills on the house floor this week to open up those opportunities for hardworking taxpayers to create more middle class opportunities for people who want to be a part of this industry but also to lower costs for these middle class families who are struggling under these tough economic times to be able to have more opportunities for themselves and their families hopefully we will continue this debate throughout this week and throughout the rest of this congress as we bring these good pieces of legislation to open up those resources again as the placard says at the top of the house chamber here to develop the resources of this land so that america can be the world leader in energy so we dont have to get our energy from countries who dont like us but we can actually export and create more job opportunities and help our allies around the world by undermining countries like iran and russia and others who want to do them harm i look forward to continuing this debate i am so proud to be a part of this effort in the house to create more energy opportunities in america i thank my colleague from ohio for leading in this effort"], [0.0014711832627654076, 0.0014711832627654076, 0, "i thank the gentlewoman from south dakota yesterday

government with this in mind last week i was proud to introduce legislation prohibiting the use of funds by the irs to target citizens for exercising their first amendment rights americans have seen federal agencies abuse their power and the irs is one of the worst offenders the irs has specifically targeted conservative groups simply for being conservative this is a direct violation of the first amendment my bill preserves the integrity of the first amendment by ensuring its protections are never compromised by unelected federal bureaucrats specifically h r 4903 protects americans by prohibiting use of funds by the irs and its rogue bureaucrats to carry out government abuse on citizens for exercising their constitutional rights i can think of nothing more despicable than persecution for beliefs tax day is stressful enough with the tax code we have in place the irs has no business in striking fear into the hearts of americans for expressing their strongly held beliefs and convictions the constitution is the law of the land whether the irs likes it or not we must hold the irs and its unelected bureaucrats accountable especially because they have overstepped their constitutional bounds before as my colleague pointed out my colleague on the other side may dispute our legislation but they cant dispute the facts my colleagues serving on the oversight and government reform committee and the ways and means committee have been investigating the irs unlawful targeting of conservative groups since 2012 they were dogged in their pursuit of justice for every americans fundamental right the freedom of speech the investigation revealed that as a result of the supreme courts decision in citizens united v federal election commission democratic leadership pressured irs bureaucrats to fix the problem by taking an aggressive stance against political speech by taxexempt entities my colleagues also found clear evidence and testimony that the tea party and other conservative organizations were targeted for enhanced scrutiny because their organizations names reflected their conservative beliefs for 27 months from february 2010 until may 2012 the irs systematically targeted conservative taxexempt applicants for additional scrutiny and delay this is an egregious violation of the first amendment rights of all americans the leader of this scheme was lois lerner an irs official at the time as was mentioned in april 2010 a sensitive case report on the targeted tea party groups is shared with lerner when she first learned of a spike in tea party applications in june and july of 2011 lerner is briefed that employees are using such terms as tea party patriots 9 12 project government spending government debt taxes and make america a better place

march 2012 darrell issa thenchairman of the committee on house oversight and government reform expressed concern to the irs inspector general that tea party groups were being targeted by the irs doug

oversight and government reform she proclaimed her innocence before invoking her fifth amendment right and refusing to answer questions from lawmakers for 2 more years the irs circumvented congress investigations lois lerner time and time again refused to cooperate with congress in its investigation of targeting conservative groups and instead hid behind the fifth amendment before i was elected

small community banks with burdensome regulations they cannot afford to comply with doddfrank created a new unaccountable bureaucracy called the cfpb which is funded in a way that obscures its transparency and prevents congress direct oversight of the agency the lack of accountability like that seen with the cfpb and the heavy hand of agencies like the epa and the irs have become hallmarks of this administration with the stimulus bill democrats gave handouts to their union and socalled green energy friends taxpayers were on the hook for loan guarantees to companies like solyndra which used its political connections in the white house to push through irresponsible loan approvals when solyndra went bankrupt it was at the cost of the american people many other smaller boondoggles came out of the stimulus silly studies on ducks over 1 million on road signs that promote the stimulus and over 3 million for a tunnel for turtles in florida this leaves obamacare too many americans have felt the negative consequences of what boils down to a government takeover of the healthcare industry the president claimed this law would decrease premiums by 2 500 per year instead they have risen since obamacare has been enacted to go with the increase in cost many americans have seen a sharp decrease in their choices there are fewer plans available restricting the ability of hardworking

put discretionary spending on a downward trend discretionary spending funds our federal agencies such as the epa and the irs as well as the department of defense we have made real cuts in spending not slowdowns in growth and not projected cuts down the roadhonesttogod cuts in spending since i took office in 2011 discretionary spending has been cut significantly by 434 billion but this does not address mandatory spending which is the real driver of our national debt this includes programs like food assistance welfare medicare medicaid social security and interest on our debt reforms are needed to ensure these programs work efficiently and are sustainable because of the way obamacare was written and enacted mandatory spending also includes large portions of obamacare funding mandatory spending is on autopilot and will continue with or without congress annual appropriations process the fact is we have to change the law that means both chambers of congress have to pass reforms and the president has to sign them or we have to override a veto mandatory spending accounts for threequarters of all money spent by the federal government this is a 180degree change from when i was a teenager when in 1970 mandatory spending was only about a third of government spending realistically there is only one path to a balanced budget and shrinking our national debt that path is to pass a budget and use a process called reconciliation a budget facilitates reconciliation which only requires a 51vote majority in the united states senate and avoids a filibuster by liberals who want to continue running up americas credit card not doing a budget forfeits the opportunity to do reconciliation reconciliation with mandatory spending program reforms coupled with real tax and regulatory reforms will send a strong signal to our entrepreneurs and businesses which will unleash innovation and the american spirit and will thus grow our economy and provide for our national defense a vibrant economy will provide for our national security and priorities without raising taxes we have an opportunity with a new president next year to send two reconciliation bills to his deskone for

found a torture chamber for little bornalive babies that defies description within the constraints of the english language the grand jury report at the time said dr kermit gosnell had a simple solution for unwanted babies he killed them he didnt call it that he called it ensuring fetal demise the way he ensured fetal demise was by sticking scissors in the back of the babys neck and cutting the spinal cord he called it snipping over the years there were hundreds of snippings ashley baldwin one of dr gosnells employees said she saw babies breathing and that she described one as 2 feet long that no longer had eyes or a mouth but in her words was making like this screeching noise and that it sounded like a little alien now in recent days numerous video recordings have been released

now see behind the walls of the abortion industry and the horrifying plight of its little human victims who we must not forget are also the least of these our little brothers and sisters our response

filibuster in the senate against legislation that would protect little bornalive human babies i hope they ask of themselves one question in the core of their own souls is filibustering against a bill to protect bornalive human babies from a torturous death at the hands of monsters like kermit gosnell who i truly am now i know that legislation like this has been attacked by president obama and even others because of the many obvious similarities these bornalive children have with lateterm paincapable unborn children this was an unborn child but she was born alive and she survived as hard as it is to consider that that could happen she did president obama explained his reasons for voting four timeslet me say that again president obama explained his reasons for voting four times against the bornalive infants protection act which would have protected children born alive he was afraid it might give bornalive babies personhood under the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment he said it would essentially bar abortions because the equal protection clause does not allow somebody to kill a child and if this is a child then this would be an antiabortion statute it is impossible to deny that president obama had a very sad and ironic if also completely merciless point indeed it does require enormous deliberate selfdeception to say that those who deliberately kill a child who is born alive after 5 months of pregnancy are guilty of murder and deserve prison but those who deliberately kill the same exact paincapable child at the same exact age and development but are not yet bornthose individuals are merely furthering freedom of choice and should actually get paid for doing it but it still bears repeating the bornalive abortion survivors protection act that we voted on today and passed out of this chamber protects little children who have been born alive no matter how blind opponents try to make themselves or convince others to be no one can truly obscure the humanity and personhood of these little bornalive children of god nor can they take refuge within the schizophrenic paradox roe v wade to which this country has been subjected for now more than 40 years the abortion industry has labored for all these decades to convince the world that born children and unborn children should be completely separated in our minds that while born children are persons worthy of protection unborn children on the other hand are not persons and are not worthy of protection but those who oppose this bill today or those who might oppose it in the senate that protects bornalive children now have the impossible task of trying to rejoin born children and unborn children back together again and then trying to convince us all that to condemn them both as inhuman and not worthy of protection after all is the thing to do to anyone who has not invincibly hardened their heart and soul to this absurd inconsistency there is an opportunity for a profoundly enlightening moment because you see this country has faced such paradox and selfimposed blindness and heartlessness before there was a time that our own house rules banned any discussion or debate in

engine of our economy and when our economy gets up and going our families flourish what does this administration produce more than 60 of every day here is a hint it is not jobs the answer lies in the heart of many woes facing small businesses and established industries what they produce every day is regulations the goal of any regulation should be to achieve a benefit that would not be possible without it designed in such a fashion that the achieved benefit far outweighs the cost but our administration has lost sight of this goal and americas economic engine is paying the price our current federal government designs regulations that are often unnecessary and achieve little to no benefit but at very high cost the rules have become so skewed that this administrations regulators are at war with american businesses industries such as manufacturing and technology are fighting to compete in a global market but first they must survive the regulatory beast that is strangling innovation and growth this administration is legislating through regulation yet decries the reins act and calls it an unprecedented requirement when you circumvent congress and exploit the rulemaking process in order to one make law and two make law in contradiction to the wishes and needs of the american people you should expect unprecedented responses in just the first 7 days of 2015just the first 7 days of 2015the administration unveiled 300 new rules over the memorial day weekend the administration quietly published the spring 2015 unified agenda of federal regulations what it contained was so disheartening to the american people and so destructive to small business that it didnt go unnoticed the agenda showed that the federal departments and agencies have 3 260 rules in the midst right now of the rulemaking process unfortunately it is not just the sheer number of regulations that is astounding it is also the oppressive cost one of these 3 260 rules i mentioned is predicted to be one of the costliest regulations ever put forward the epas national ozone standard a recent analysis found the cost of this one regulation to be upwards of 140 billion it will cost my home state of georgia over 11 000 jobs to add insult to injury the first line of h r 427 statement of administration policy states the administration is committed to ensuring that regulations are smart and effective and tailored to further the statutory goals in the most costeffective and efficient manner this is the statement from the administration on why they oppose h r i cannot believe that a single regulation promulgated by this administration with 140 billion of cost was put forward in the most costeffective manner and a regulation costing 11 000 jobs in georgia alone is hardly smart the statement of administration policy also claims that the underlying legislation would create business uncertainty i encourage this administration to use the infamous pen and phone to actually ask businesses what creates uncertainty for them because when small businesses across the country came to congress last week as part of national federation of independent business lobbying day their top legislative priority was regulatory relief these are smallbusiness owners who sat with us and said here is what we are facing in trying to get people jobs the 3 000plus regulations in the works by this administration create the uncertainty not this bodys effort to require agencies to submit the most costly regulations to congress for approval the underlying bill applies only to regulations with a 100 million impact or greater the american people do not elect this administrations regulatorsor any administrations regulators for that matter they elect us in this body to represent them this bill allows us to do so properly the system is broken the system has failed the american people the reins act is the first step toward restoring proper order and even sanity toward our regulatory framework the administration states that executive order no 13563 requires careful costbenefit analysis but they dont explain why only 7 rules out of the thousands had costbenefit analysis in 2013 and only 14 rules had that in 2012 this administrations regulators have stated publicly that they are not going to sit around and wait for congressso much for respecting the powers enshrined in our constitution

that he was there requires as secretary clinton said the willing suspension of disbelief this february the former head of pakistans version of the cia called the isi said that pakistan most likely sheltered osama bin laden and just last month three unitedstates intelligence sources told nbc news that pakistan knew where osama bin laden was hiding all the time not only did pakistan not help us get osama bin laden pakistan threw the doctor who did help us under the bus and put him in jail for 33 years for cooperating with america pakistan did not help us because pakistan was working with osama bin laden newly released documents retrieved from bin ladens compound show that pakistans intelligence service was in contact with bin laden and was working with him to convince unitedstates leaders to negotiate with al qaeda there are some who say we need pakistan to help us fight the war in afghanistan but pakistan is on the wrong side pakistan is helping the terrorists not us pakistans intelligence service gives safe haven resources and training to terrorist groups like the haqqani network that has killed dozens of americans on september 22 2011 admiral mike mullen chairman of the joint chiefs of staff testified before the senate armed services committee with isi support haqqani operatives planned and conducted the truck bomb attack as well as the assault on our embassy the truck bombing he mentions wounded more than 70 unitedstates and nato troops admiral mullen went on to say the haqqani network acts as a veritable arm of pakistans interservices intelligence agency throughout 2011 pakistan tried to cheat the united states by filling out bogus reimbursement claims for allegedly going after terrorists when they werent even doing that that is the same account this money funds there are others who say we need pakistans southern supply route to help our troops in afghanistan but for 7 months in 2012 pakistan closed off the supply route and we did just fine what we really need access to is pakistans tribal areas terrorists that kill our troops in afghanistan run back and forth across the pakistan border and hide in these tribal areas but pakistan wont let our troops chase them there and so the terrorists kill americans and they get away with it pakistan did do some military operations in the tribal areas last year but they tipped off the haqqani network before they got there that they were coming pakistan tipping off terrorists is nothing new last fall leon panetta secretary of defense at the time of the bin laden raid says of the pakistanis we just cant trust them i agree we cant trust pakistan my amendment does not cut money to protect pakistans nuclear weapons the amendment does recognize the unitedstates pakistan relationship for what it is we dont need to pay pakistan to be our enemy they will do it for free pakistan has already received over 30 billion of our money since 2002 after 13 years of giving pakistan more and more money it is

provides family planning on national television when asked whether there was any evidence that planned parenthood had broken any law even republican chairman chaffetz of the committee on oversight and government reform who investigated planned parenthood said no im not suggesting that they broke the law in fact that was the finding of other committees here yet our republican colleagues have now set up a witch hunt special committee to go after planned parenthood ironically they claim to be doing an investigation but here on the floor they have obviously already reached a conclusion and have decided to defund an organization that helps provide health care to american women and families so rolled into one bill you have something that would deny access to health care to 22 million americans and at the same time deny important health services to millions of american women and their families when our republican colleagues pose this question and say that the president is going to be faced

americans that should be an easy choice for all of us we are not going to do it it also shouldnt be a tough choice as to whether or not we defund planned parenthood and the services they provide to american women and families that is not going to be a tough choice for the president the republican leader was absolutely right when he talked about the consequences of the 2016 elections because we are fortunate that today we have a president who will not sign that bill but who will instead veto that bill our colleagues are absolutely right if you had a different president including as far as i know all of them on the republican side they would be signing this bill so this is an important statement of what our republican colleagues think is the top priority on the first day of 2016 which is to get rid of affordable health care for 22 million americans lets talk about that with the american public because i believe that the american public wants to do what the gentleman from massachusetts

alien and lawful immigrant labor supply your past record and current stance on immigration conflicts with the values of the americans i represent and causes great concern to me and the americans i represent yesterday during discussions about the speaker race you made two representations about immigration that stood out they are 1 it is unwise or unproductive to bring up any immigration legislation so long as barack obama is president 2 as speaker you will not allow any immigration bill to reach the house floor for a vote unless the immigration bill is supported by a majority of the majority of republican house members although you talk faster than i can write your words down i believe the above statements properly reflect what you said i send this letter to confirm that i

concur that my portrayal of your remarks is accurate and that i and the rest of the gop conference and the american people may rely on your words as i have written them i need your assurance that you will not use the speakers position to advance your immigration policies except when in accord with the two above statements because there is a huge gap between your immigration position and the wishes of the american citizens i represent your words yesterday constitute the needed assurance if your assurances as i have portrayed them are accurate then i am much more comfortable voting for you for speaker on the house floor and will do so absent something startling coming to my attention between now and the election which i dont anticipate if however you would use the speakers chair to advance an immigration belief system that is unacceptable to the americans i represent it will be very difficult for me to vote for you for speaker on the house floor to be clear i intend to publicly share

in congress since i first went to an independent community pharmacist and you spoke with such great passion you are not alone as you know every single person like you in my district can tell me the same things that you have told me that is why i am on these bills that is why i am talking tonight about these issues i dont have the firsthand experience that you have as a pharmacist the closest i ever got to a pharmacy other than picking up my prescription drugs before i got into congress was when i was 16 and 17 years old i was a delivery boy for greenville pharmacy in sioux city iowa which by the way still exists since 1969 actually longer ago than that it was established but i would deliver prescription drugs to folks especially to the elderly who couldnt get out of their home who couldnt get to the pharmacy that is what this is about as you said it is about making sure ultimately and as a member of congress my job is to make sure that folks have access to affordable quality health care and that is where pharmacists play such an important role whether it is with medication therapy management or just simply consulting on an informal basis with someone who comes in and has a lot of different prescriptions and is confused by what to take and when to take them you folks really do such a wonderful job and if we lost that service as you said because of unfair business practices because of being squeezed by the big guysand it doesnt make any sense at all for that to happenthen patients would suffer in the end that is why i support both of these pieces of legislation two of these that have been mentioned already 244 which mr collins just mentioned again to make sure that everyone understands what it is about it is a measure that will increase transparency of generic drug payment rates in medicare part d and the federal employees health benefits program which serves a lot of folks as we know millions of folks and in the tricare pharmacy program by requiring those pbms one to provide pricing updates at least once every 7 days that doesnt seem like a lot to ask to me and i am sure it doesnt seem like a lot to ask for you number two disclose the sources used to update that mac list and to notify pharmacies of any changes in individual drug prices before these prices can be used as a basis of reimbursement this is complete common sense that is why there are republicans and democrats alike on this bill and i hope we can move this bill forward in iowa the state legislature did pass something not quite this comprehensive but something similar to this because in iowa folks understand what these pbms are doing and what those independent community pharmacists are up against and the second piece of legislation h r 592 that was already referenced again a bipartisan piece of legislation has got 218 cosponsors if memory serves me that is exactly the number we need if everybody votes to pass a piece of legislation in this body we could get it done if we brought it to the floor we could get it done maybe we ought to do a discharge petition sorry i dont mean to create too many anxieties there with you folks but nonetheless we have got to get this thing done it is about making sure that our pharmacists are able to continue to deliver the kind of quality health care look whatever we decide at the federal level when it comes to utilizing pharmacists to their full potential this legislation does stipulate that nothing will override state scope of practice laws as well because i know that a lot of folks in other professions have concerns about that that pharmacists are going to go too far well they are not going to if states have laws in place about scope of practice this legislation will not override that but it is about making sure as mr carter said and as mr collins would agree and others who have been so active on these issues would agreeit is about making sure that folks get the quality care that they need if we close down these pharmacies in these rural areas95 percent of the folks in iowa are within 5 miles of an independent community pharmacistif they close down those pharmacies those folks in my

that the combined emissions would result in substantial cumulative health and environmental impacts instead the real health impacts due to this rule will be felt by the workers who lose their jobs their health benefits and even the education and training opportunities offered by their employers the brick industry primarily consists of small familyowned businesses they are often located in small communities that depend on the plant for goodpaying jobs to comply with the epas requirement these small businesses will be forced to borrow millions of dollars to pay for the required control technology many brick companies are already struggling to find the capital for plant modernization i cant imagine how difficult it will be for these companies to secure the needed investments to pay for new control equipment equipment that provides zero return on investment and lets not forget that the brick industry has already been through this before the epa finalized a similar rule in 2003 that required brick companies to spend millions of dollars on control equipment a few years later a federal court vacated that rule unfortunately the brick industry couldnt roll back the clock and recover the investments they had made worse yet the epas new emission rules use the reductions achieved by the vacated rule as the baseline for further reduction requirements so the industry essentially got no credit for the hard work that they had already done this history further underscores why this legislation is so important it also baffles me when i hear some of my colleagues say the brick act is not needed because parties can already seek a judicial stay however the epa has effectively indicated in a statement for the record submitted to the committee on energy and commerce
