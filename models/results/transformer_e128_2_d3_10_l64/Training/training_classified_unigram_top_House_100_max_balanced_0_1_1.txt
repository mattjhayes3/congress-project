commitment her friendship i will miss our conversations on the floor of the many moving words said of sala in recent days i think that these words spoken at her memorial service in san francisco by frank kielinger gave the greatest sense of who sala and phil burton were frank kieliger worked with and for the burtons for many years i would like to insert his remarks in the record yesterday as we stood in this rotunda and watched the people of san francisco pay tribute to sala there was a moment of overpowering grief and loss and i said to my son this is the last time we will see sala later as we walked in the dark through the plaza outside this teenager said to me dad your wrong look around you well isee sala every time we see these people only she would notice we had just passed one of the confused and homeless night people and we were in sight of the tents of those seeking help for aids victims by demonstrating at the old federal building in a single sentence he had captured sala he had told me her story elie wiesel in his work souls on fire tells us of the role of story and memory in our lives he writes my father an enlightened spirit believed in man my grandfather a fervant hasid believed in god the one taught me to speak and the other to sing both loved stories and when i tell mine i hear their voices whispering from beyond the silenced storm they are what links the survivor to their memory we are here today to refresh our memories and to renew our commitments to all that sala burton represents in her life we come to share our stories of her i leave to others the task of commenting on her political prowess and her skills as a legislator the sala i knew and loved was larger then the sum of these parts 1 have asked myself over and over what made her so special and how can that specialness be expressed in brief remarks i have searched my thirty year recollection of her and what i find is a woman so secure in the knowledge of her own humanity so secure in knowledge of her own dignity and worth as a person that she would spend her life defending the dignity and worth of others sala was a woman who could talk to me when i was a young man about the worlds indifference to the approaching holocaust and of her own personal experiences of eastern european antisemitism and of fleeing poland she could do so without hate but with a fierce determination that the story be told for sala this bitter lesson of the past must be alive in our memory so that this most heinous crime against humanity can never happen again she told me the story sala was a woman who lived rather than preached the values of her jewish heritage in her struggle for peace in the world for an end to the arms race for a world freed from the threat of nuclear annihilation in her opposition to the immoral practice of hiring mercenaries by funding the contras in nicaragua there can be heard the echoes of the prophet isaiah they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks and nations shall make war no more in salas ceaseless quest for a just and more humane society a society which recognizes its obligations to the poor the aged the infirmed the homeless and all who are dispossessed in this land she made tangible the words of micah you have been told 0 man what is good and what is required of you to live justly to show mercy and to walk humbly with your god for sala accidents of race color creed national origin ancestry gender or sexual orientation could never be excuses for denying the inherent dignity of the human person and her life is summed up in the struggle to make that ideal a reality it was sala who introduced me to the reality of racial discrimination and racism and who educated me and formed my conscience on these issues as she involved me in the struggle for fair employment practices and fair housing in our state so many years ago it was sala who introduced me to the concept that the magnificent document we call the constitution of the united states protects all or it protects none it was sala who opened my eyes to the dangers of mccarthyslm and to its remnants in our society as we stood in union square and listened to phil then in the assembly call for the abolition of the house committee on un american activities some of us can still remember the picture of the hoses being turned on demonstrators and the water cascading down these very stain as dedicated civil libertarians were dragged down them for protesting the presence of that comnittee in our city and sala would feel deep anger at the sight of this injustice for sala was a woman whose conscience was so finely honed whose perceptions of social justice and human rights were so clear that she was truly a woman well ahead of her time she was a pioneer ever pressing forward ever encouraging the more fainthearted of us to follow where phil would move mountains by the shear volume of his knowledge and the weight of his arguments sala would touch the heart would prick the conscience would call us to be what we can and should be concerned and caring human beings when phil might seem preoccupied or distant in his singlemindedness sala was always the embodiment of care and concern they were a unique team their lives were both public and private and it is in the private moments that their great love and respect for one another was most evident and as i say these words i can envision phil even now reaching over and grasping her hand in a gesture which in life spoke volumes they are once again together they are once again an invincible team i have spoken of the sala i know with a very special affection it was she after all who suggested to phil many years ago that he hire me on a six month trial that six months stretched into twenty five rewarding years in which i learned from them that the purpose of public life is service that power is always exercised in behalf of the powerless and that those who possess the platform for public debate have the obligation to eloquently and forcefully express the aspiration of those in our society who are voiceless that is my story of sala burton the sala i will remember every time i see the faces of the people she saw and whose dignity she defended it is my prayer that the god of abraham our god who blessed her and kept her in life who made his continence to shine upon her with a special radiance will now grant her peace sala we loved you we will remember you and we will retell you story for years to come"], [0.002039313316345215, 0.9979606866836548, 1, "i

on and the gentleman from california sought the opportunity for the members to come to the floor under special orders to pay the first tribute to sala burton i came to the floor and i listened to what the others were saying about sala and i know each of us was so taken with our own thoughts one of the things i did i kept looking up to that area of the gallery and remembering so many times that i would look up there if there was one of phils battles on the floor a major piece of legislation that phil would be handling if it was an important moment for this house sala burton before she became a member but as phils partner would be sitting right up there i kept looking up there missing her i have to say that sala was my very dear personal friend when i heard so many members coming from all over that day on such short notice to eulogize sala and to say how much they loved her and how much they would miss her i have to say i was surprised because i thought she was just my special friend i thought that she was a political acquaintance to the other members of the house and she was a colleague to her colleagues from california but that she was my special friend i realize today that that was salas special gift that for each one of us she was our special friend she was a wonderful woman sala burton was a wonderful wife too i was fortunate enought to be a friend of both phil and sala i met phil in the late sixties here and he helped me to get legislation through this house that gave the virgin islands a seat in this house of representatives the relationship between phil and sala was such a beautiful relationship phil the stormy phil burton the great legislator the powerful individual with a heart even bigger than that huge body he had and sala that loved him that was his true partner and how he loved her too at the funeral service in san francisco there were those that recalled how sala would calm the troubled waters that phil had passed by and she had that gift we will all miss sala she was a woman of great conviction as another member just said today she was so proud of her jewishness she cared so much for the poor and for those that needed help and that was why i particularly liked both phil and sala they were legislators that cared and never forgot why they had come here when sala came into this body as an elected representative many thought perhaps that this was just sala burton the devoted wife and partner of phil coming here but she sure showed us she was a very very effective member of this house and legislator in the short period that she was here now we will miss her she was a wonderful woman she was a wonderful wife a great legislator and a great friend the sorrow of losing sala burton will be slow to pass but we can take heart knowing the inspiration of salas life and convictions also will be slow to pass her commitment to peace social justice and equality for all knew no compromise we must keep that commitment before us as we wrestle with the hard decisions that face us in this hall but salas inspiration goes far beyond the political realm as we usually know it her political beliefs crew directly out of her compassionate and caring personality it was wonderfully typical of salawhose political causes spanned continentsthat she found time to lend a hand to the small territory of the virgin islands she and her late husband phil were abiding political allies and personal friends for more than 20 years over the yearseven as they worked tirelessly for peace and civil rights and national parklands for allthey extended their concerns to the virgin islands and other offshore territories thanks to leaders like sala and phil we in the islands have won basic rights to elect our governors and gain representation in congress

yielding to me i take this opportunity to say a few words about our beloved sala burton mr speaker and my colleagues and those who are watching this memorial sala burton served in this house for 3 years her husband served for close to two decades if you look at that statistic alone it does not really tell you the reality of the contributions of both phil and sala because they both served together during all those years they worked together collaborating together in the mutual objectives that they shared politically they both cared deeply about the role that government could play to help the disadvantaged the dispossessed to try to bring about social and economic justice they cared about the working people and the ability of those people to organize collectively to fight for their rights they always saw the people who were struggling who were having a tough time as the ones who needed their help most they cared about protecting the environment and they cared very deeply about this nation of ours sala burton was a refugee from poland she and her immediate family survived the nazi holocaust in europe those in the immediate family that did not come to this country were all lost in the crematoria of hitlers death camps that fact probably more than any other impressed upon sala the deep commitment to protecting civil liberties civil rights understanding that minority groups that might be discriminated against one day could be hated the next and uncontrolled discrimination and hatred can lead to such enormous evil that she knew we had to act before these kinds of things got out of hand on a personal note i have known sala and phil for close to 30 years when i was a young teenager and belonged to the young democrats in california phil and sai would talk to us when most grownup politicians were not spending any time with the kids about why politics was a noble thing to be involved in why the fights that we were fighting were often so frustrating were important and that we could make a contribution and that we had to keep on trying to make things better when my family and i came to washington the door was always open to us at the burton home 01450 i know that both when i was in sacramento and when we came here our daughter who is now 23 grew up calling sala burton aunt sala there was a very very close bond of friendship between our families on a very personal level they were always there phil and sala to give us some guidance some encouragement some reinvigoration of commitment to try to accomplish in some way the goals they set out for themselves and set as role models for us to try to emulate one of the most touching tributes at the lovely memorial service in san franscisco was given by the speaker of the state assembly another person who has gone back even longer than almost any of us who are involved in public office in his political and personal relationship with phil and sala and that was speaker willy brant he closed his very eloquent remarks by saying that the best memorial tribute to sala burton is to try to act the way saia acted to try to live up to the ideals that she not only personified but urged upon all of us if we in some way could live up to that standard we would be by that example following her example and giving the greatest memorial to her i hope that as we remember fondly the memories of sala burton and the time we have had with her over the years the time that she has been with us in this institution that we will try to live up to the standards that she set for all of us to the goals and ideals that she so strongly and firmly believed in and in that way we will indeed be giving a living memorial to all the work that she has done over the years i do want to indicate that my wife janet had the opportunity to do an interview with sala burton a couple of months ago and i will insert that interview into the record i think it speaks a lot about sala in ways that many people did not know about her particularly her remembrances of the holocaust and very strong feelings of jewish identity and the commitments to the goals and ideals of her religion"], [0.0022191405296325684,

delegation in a sense you are kind of the overall dean of a lot of us and that takes nothing away from my own dean the gentleman from ohio but we all look to you for your leadership i especially want to thank don for his very special way of making sure that everyone understood salas wishes in this whole thing because i think when you see one of your dear friends who is sick and indeed passes on you really think about your own loss it is don who has given me i guess as much as anyone tremendous consolation not only during salas sickness but just seeing him today and having this tribute to sala gives a great deal of inner strength i met sala like many of you i have my own stories to tell about my dear friend i met sala in my freshman year which was about 10 years or more ago and i remember phil had asked me to be one of the delegates to the north atlantic treaty the first foreign trip i ever took was as a parliamentarian to the distinguished group and i was asked to do that by her late great husband i did not know anybody on that trip really none of my friends or classmates were on the trip as a result i felt fairly alone it was sala frankly not the other members but sala who had the sensitivity to come over and ask who i was and talk about what i should do and how much she loved ohio because phil was born in cincinnati and always talked about his roots and so on she was the one who extended that special warmth of friendship later of course i got to know her even better through the years as the wife of phil burton but also as a person whom i think was one of the most politically savvy people i have ever met even before she became a member of congress you knew that the socalled legacy of phil burton was really the legacy of sala burton because she shared her husbands values and indeed supported those values in many ways and networked those values in more ways than anyone could imagine i recall like many of us speaking on the floor eulogizing phil and it seems frankly like only yesterday that he passed on and i remember saying and i thought about this before i did it i thought it might be poor taste but doggone it i am going to say to sala if she is listening or watching that she should be the one to run for that wonderful area for congress because more than anyone else she was totally capable of replacing her husband and really continuing that magnificent legacy of values and indeed she did i think we are all wondering because the one thing that struck me about sala was how much she absolutely positively adored loved and admired and respected her husband and you just wondered how it was going to be like since they were so close what she was going to be like as a member of the house and the fact is sala burton i think was one of the greatest members of this house she was a person who was not here formally as a member for many years but a person of enormous quality and compassion i remember her saying to me you know i have got a little something that i want to put in the education bill she said on the latchkey children idea and concern for children and what happens to these kids when they come home from school and their parents are working she said i am going to walk over to the senate side and talk to the republican senator who will be unnamed and convince him that is the right thing to do and she did and no one thought she could have done it i do not think phil could have done it because the difference between phil and sala was i think that he was able to get things done but once in a while he rattled people the wrong way in the process sala could get things done and everybody loved her nobody ever had any kind of hostility or resentment or illfeelings toward her approach and so on but she could achieve the same end result one of the things that struck me about her is that she had a tremendous love not only for her husband but for her parents she often told me about her father and her mother and what that must have been like during world war ii for their family being jewishpolish immigrants and how they just by the skin of their teeth got out of poland in time yet she never and we can really all learn from this and it is interesting to hear other members of japaneseamerican ancestry speak of her compassion to that issue related to reconciliation with respect to the japaneseamericans and their need to be satisfied on the manner which they were treated but sala burton never felt a resentment toward people the fact is that irrespective of what everyones background was even if she had known that somewhere along the line their ancestors may have been responsible for the awful horrible horrendous deeds that took place from world war ii she was able to forgive and bring people together that is a marvelous legacy that all of us i think can really profit from she always said to me when she was here and we would be sitting on the floor and she would be listening to some of our colleagues whom she would very seldom agree with and she would say you know the thing is that i do not judge them on every issue i cannot just judge a person on how they vote on one or two issues i am going to judge them on what they can do in the future so i think that is an important lesson that she certainly taught me and i hope that we will all learn from it to me her compassion for people and the strength that she had was an extension of her own femininity and caring about others and she brought that with her she had a special love for her wonderful daughter joy and her soninlaw who was spanish her daughter and soninlaw lived in spain for many years and her grandchildren and she expressed the joy she had in visiting them in spain now they live as i understand it in san francisco and she expressed how happy she was that they came home i know she would want us to mention her wonderful brotherinlaw john i understand she had another brotherinlaw as well she felt very strongly about the good work that john did in the house i also know that she had a tremendous love and respect for her mother who is still alive i understand salas mother is well over 90 and this must be a special loss for salas mother who sala told me was as sharp as they come and who often asked her about democratic politics and so forth and i just want a special word to her mother because i just want her mother to know and her daughter to know in particular that for me sala did not pass away i will recall her good works every day of the house because that is the kind of impression she made on each and every one of us i think maybe it is time to recall the words of alfred lord tennyson who when he was mourning one of his very very close friends said that it was better to have loved and lost than

year at that time remember well that sad occasion and the strength that sala showed at that time shortly she again showed us her great strength and courage by running successfully for her late

fdr a reference to leftist democratic revolutionary front were written on their chests in red ink a few days later a catholic lay worker who guarded a carmelite convent was killed under circumstances that implicated the treasury police an arm of the salvadoran govemment these incidents are a clear reminder that the ruthless salvadoran death squads which have been largely dormant under the presidency of jose napoleon duarte have reared their ugly head once again anaya was the second president of the commission to be killed and the seventh commission member to have been slain or to disappear in the last 7 years the human rights commission and the roman catholic church estimate 65 000 persons have been killed since the salvadoran war began in 1979 of that total at least 40 000 were victims of death squads responding to the resurgence of death squad activity the archbishop of el salvador arturo rivera y damas warned in a nationally televised homily in midnovember that the escalating terror of death squads must stop i pray to god he said we do not lose our heads and get entangled in the trap of violence which only generates more violence after the slaying a government spokesman denounced the killing and admitted it was the work of extremist elements seeking to destroy the entire process we have been building a full investigation was promised it is time for the unitedstates congress to join archbishop rivera y damas and the government of el salvador in calling for an investigation of the anaya slaying it is time for us to send a signal to the salvadoran

reconciliation and internal dialog under the terms of the guatemala peace agreement the amendment offered by my friend fromif mr fascell of florida offers the perfecting amendmentcalifornia and my colleagues from massachusetts does just that it signals the deep concern that congress has about the anaya killing and tells the death squads of el salvador that their days are numbered as far as the unitedstates congress is concerned until now there has never been punishment of anyone associated with a death squad for this reason the death squads have assumed that threats intimidation and murder are acceptable means of governing we must change this perception the boxermoakleykennedy amendment calls for such an investigation into the anaya murder and offers united states assistance in that effort the peace plan signed in guatemala city on august 7 calls for respect for human rights as well as national reconciliation a peaceful resolution of the conflict in el salvador requires at a minimum that the government protect the security of civilians wishing to participate in the political life of their country including critics of the government in 1984 the paramilitary squads facing

possible last week the house agriculture committee acted on the portions of hr 3 the comprehensive trade reform bill under that committees jurisdiction one of the issues raised was the matter of trade or the lack of it with the republic of korea particularly with regard to beef exports i offered as an amendment to the trade bill an amendment that essentially states that it isr the sense of the congress of the uhited states of america that the current ban of beef imports into the republic of korea was a direct violation of that countrys gatt obligations and that the united states should take all necessary and appropriate actions up to and including retaliation to open that market up to united states beef production i am happy to report that my amendment passed the committee unanimously for the record i am inserting the text of my amendment so that the findings of the house agriculture committee and the sense of congress section of my amendment will be available for all our colleagues to read we have heard a great deal about the problems we have had with japan and the exports of our products including beef into that nation the republic of korea has decided apparently that it wants to join the ranks of those who would keep out our beef because they know that if given the choice between quality and price their consumers would readily buy our beef products we are not here to ask for some kind of an unfair advantage over other beef producers around the world we just want a chance to compete i hope that the republic of korea will take note of the actions of the house agriculture committee and the members of the congressional beef caucus participating in this special order by opening up their markets to united states beef exports the republic of korea will take a significant step toward meeting that nations gatt obligations and avoiding retaliatory action by the united states"], [0.9899192154407501, 0.010080784559249878, 1, "i move to strike the requisite number of words and i rise against the amendment i was hesitant to take the floor on this particular issue but i find it necessary because of the direction that i see that the house is taking i served in the field of public health education before i went into the political arena i worked in the field of tuberculosis that was a communicable disease i remember very well back in the late 1930s and early 1940s that the same kind of hysteria that we find here in this house today we found in state legislatures in city councils and in boards of supervisors in the state of california it was a time when the incidence of tuberculosis was the very highest there was not a single sanitarium in the entire country that was not full now tuberculosis is closely associated with poverty and the one thing that i remember happening then is that the health authorities were constantly telling the legislators that something of course had to be done but it had to be done in cooperation with those who understood epidemiology the epidemiologists of that time and the health authorities it took that combination before we were finally able to almost eradicate tuberculosis now that particular disease is on the rise again again due to poverty again due to all these other things that contribute greatly to the incidence of communicable diseases in general i believe that we must go back now to the time and carefully consider the fact that experience has taught us a great deal in the last few years and what it did teach us with regard to tuberculosis and other communicable diseases was that it was not the prerogative of the legislator by himself to do anything but that the legislator in order to be effective had to be in full consultation with the experts of health epidemiologists and also be in touch constantly with the problems existing in the community i think that this house would be ill advised to adopt any of these amendments i think that what we should do is to make it possible for a committee of this house to study the situation in cooperation with the department of health with the health authorities of this nation and with the experts who are now studying the incidence of aids in this nation you probably remember that it was not too long ago that we brought in the first appropriation for aids right here in this house you probably will remember that up to that time not a single penny had been spent of research well that was 5 years ago now we know a little bit more than we did before but we also have the experience of the past with other communicable diseases it seems to me that we as legislators should take one step back and as we do that make it possible for the experts to come in the doctors those who are involved with this and to advise us as to what the next step should be that i offer as humble advice from someone who actually dealt in that field believe me if we do not do that i think the time will come when we may live to regret it"],

have become so sophisticated that we cannot recognize it that it was free dom fighters who made our own united states possible have we gone so far from our roots that we have forgotten the men and women who cre ated this great country of ours what about these americans who dumped tea into boston harbor in defiance of the british rulers what of those who fought and died at saratoga and at valley

our country was built the brave men and women who crossed the river delaware with general washington to put to rout the british enemy whom they had opposed they were also contras they were contra england how can we justify a vote in opposition to these nicaraguan freedom fighters how can we turn our backs to those who seek freedom who are even willing to give their lives in freedom let us remember that nicaragua is in desparate straits its inflation rate is at an astounding 13 000 percent and as the eloquent columnist of the washington post mr krauthammer said if the united states stops helping the contras she will have managed the most extraordinary self inflicted strategic surrender in memory our decline will be well earned certainly no redblooded american would want to be present at that consummation this afternoon we are debating the future of tile contras but the basic issue in this debate is what america itself is all about the opportunity of freedom over the years america has stood for freedom and thousands of people from other lands have come to america because they hated oppression one of the very first actions of the new united states of america was a proposal sponsored by our fourth president james lonroethe monroe doctrineand its impact was sweeping that we would tot permit any foreign government to eatablish itself in our hemisphere we wanted only governments that were free as we in america the issue before this free american congress today is freedom itself the nicaraguan government as everybody knows has violated that monroe doctrine a native leftwing groupthe sandinistasforcefully took over the somoza government but they only did so by promising the organization of american states that they would establish a free democratic government that would include other parties that free elections would be held and that would include persons representing all groups in the nation but those promises were quickly shoved aside and the government of the ortega boys promptly forgot their promises to the nicaraguan peopleabout freedom within a short time nicaragua has become a totalitarian communist regimea total violation of the

rise in opposition to the amendment the amendment before us would unduly strengthen the recently adopted regulation of direct investments in real estate undertaken by statechartered institutions

magnitude that would normally signal that it should not be brought to the house floor this amendment deserves to be defeated the outcome of this issue raises one of the most critical questions facing the troubled savings and loan industry the savings and loan industry grew up in a stable protected environment in which managers could count on a stable relationship between shortand longterm funds a builtin spread to reward them for making longterm fixedrated mortgages this environment changed radically not long after congress attempted in 1966 to guarantee temporarily that the savings and loan industry would have an advantage over its competitors in attracting funds from the public to finance housing by the early 1980s the money markets had become unstable savers were demanding and getting a market rate of return and the growings securitization of the mortgage market was attracting new investors to housing investment and diminishing the historic role of thrift institutions one segment of the industry has continued through all of these changes to insist that if only congress and the american people would make a sufficient commitment happy days could be here again they have advocated continuing concentration in mortgage lending even as spreads have narrowed despite the growing involvement of private investors in housing finance and severe losses among portfolio lenders who have failed to match their assets and liabilities they argue that portfolio lending is a socially useful activity in which congress has directed the industry to engage therefore as long as the industry remains committed to housing congress has a moral obligation to pick up the losses the other major segment of the industry believes that the realities of the market require them to pursue new opportunities to use their mortgage expertise in areas where it is still possible to make money such as direct investment in real estate granted that either philosophy can work when applied by competent management i am not ready to join those who insist that direct investments are inherently evil that case has not been made and until it is made convincingly i must oppose this amendment i

to enable congress to monitor this area to fashion restrictions on investments in the least intrusive manner possible and to keep a closer eye on the bank board itself we are profoundly concerned by the bank boards recent tendency to go beyond the prohibition of specific unsafe investments to the prohibition of entire areas of investment the band board possesses no authority to override state
