brought a very interesting packet of information to my attention it contained a colorful brochure an order blank and several other pieces of literature all aimed at promoting a unique numismatic adventuregreek olympia coins these coins are being marketed by numinvest corp a subsidiary of the parisbased international bankers lazard freres an organization that wanted to market unitedstates olympie commemorative coins as you know the house of representatives recently approved my olympic coin proposal by a vote of 302 to 84 this plan calls for the minting of two silver dollars and one gold 10dollar coin to be sold directly to the public by the mint the house vote signaled an overwhelming rejection of a rival proposal that called for the minting of 17 coins to be sold to the public through private marketers i vehemently objected to the private marketing plan because it had all the ingredients of a firstclass ripoff too many coins issued with nontraditional face values a prohibitively high price tag and an enormous potential for private profiteering at the expense of our olympic athletes if numinvests greek venture is any indication of how they would have approached the marketing of our olympic commemorative coins my suspicions were wellfounded when i opened the greek olympia coins brochure i was immediately struck by the slick packaging there is absolutely no way to deny itthis is an impressive brochure the photographs are clear the layout bold and the text of the copy persuasive it is filled with reference to the history of the modern olympics and their greek heritage indeed the designs for the coins shown in this brochure were based on ancient works of art after perusing the leaflet a bit longer i decided to look more closely at the information on the coins themselves and this is where the story really gets interesting this pamphlet merely describes the first series of coinsthere are two more to come these coins can only be purchased in sets of either three silver or two gold coins so if you want to buy just one coin you are out of luck although the brochure contains quotes like these coins have already cpatured the interest and admiration of experts around the world due to their historical significance beauty attention to detail and affordable price in light of their generous precious metal content these coins are hardly what you would call a good value a set of silver coins in uncirculated condition costs 64 50 the same coins in proof condition are 93 based on current exchange rates and silver prices these coins have a total face value of 13 14 and contaih bullion worth 8 31 that is an incredible markup ranging from 390 percent to 608 percent over the intrinsic value of the coins the gold coins are priced in a similar fashion they are available only in proof condition with a set of two going for 527 70 these coins have a face value of 116 and contain bullion worth 176 at todays gold prices the consumer is paying three times the intrinsic value of the coins a complete set of three silver and two gold series i coins in proof condition has a price tag of 620 70 for this sum the consumer receives 184 worth of precious metal and coins with a face value of 129 one should keep in mind that these figures represent the cost of owning only one series of coins in proof condition the actual cost of participating in the program could be considerably higher since there are three threecoin series each of proof and uncirculated silver coins and three twocoin sets of proof gold coins indeed owning a complete set of the coins would cost 2 056 the 24 coins in the complete set would have a combined face value of only 427 and contain bullion worth 577 these figures certainly refute the brochures claim that this is truly an affordable collection contrary to the marketers claim that the greek olympia coin collection is sure to be sought after by collectors as the first authentic coin issue of its kind these coins are not likely to appreqlate in value the greek olympia coins are what experts call pseudocoins that means that the coins although they officially have legal tender status are really more like medallions since their face values and technical specifications are artificial and arbitrary as a result they are not attractive to coin collectors numismatists tell me that the coins are not likely to be worth any more than their bullion value thus the consumer is paying over 2 000 for bullion worth only 577 one piece of literature states thatthree percent of the face value realized from the sale of the coins in the united states and canada will go to their respective olympic teams and athletic federations therefore as a subscriber to this collection you become in a real sense a participant in one of mans oldest and noblest traditions if someone purchased these coins in order to support our amateur athletes he or she would be sorely disappointed spending either 64 50 or 93 for one series of the silver coins would yield the unitedstates olympic committee exactly 39 cents our amateur athletes would receive 3 47 from the 527 70 one spent on a set of gold coins if one paid 2 056 for the entire series of coins the net to our athletes would be 12 75 this is hardly a cost efficient means of supporting amateur athletics i soon realized that the slick packaging was a vain attempt at disguising the shortcomings of the product itself you may in fact be wondering exactly what it is that greek olympia coins are commemorating i wondered the same thing as i was leafing through the brochure the marketers go to extreme lengths discussing the greek olympic traditionundoubtedly in the hope that you will think that these are greek olympic coins they are not these coins are being struck to commemorate the 1982 paneuropean games to be held in athens nevertheless you would have an extremely difficult time figuring this out from the sales material one piece of literature mentioned the word olympic or its derivatives 23 times there was only one reference td the paneuropean games apparently this ploy can be very effective the person who sent me this material attached a note that began enclosed find letter i received on greek olympic coins as you can see this is a clear case of misleading advertising the coins are grossly overpriced worthless to collectors useless as a means of raising money for amateur athletes and have absolutely nothing to do with the olympics given the history of privately marketed commemorative coins i should not have been surprised by this latest commemorative coin scheme throughout the entire olympic coin controversy i warned this congress about the inadvisability of allowing the consortium formed by lazard freres and occidental petroleum to market our olympic coins the greek olympia program is a clear example of that the house vote signaled a clear mandate to keep these people out of our program however although the house has endorsed a governmentrun program the full congress and the administration have not yet concurred if they retreat from the house position and favor the private marketers we may very well end up with a greek olympiatype program if that happens these marketers will make huge profits at the expense of both the american consumer and our amateur athletes"], [0.0030189156532287598, 0.9969810843467712, 1, "had he lived lyndon b johnson would be 74 years of age this month august 27 i rise to honor his memory to recall his vision for america and to remind my colleagues that it is not only possible for our country to rise to greatness it is necessary to do so lyndon johnson never believed in a diminishing future he believed in growth in dynamism in progress he never believed that this country must live by some sort of economic fatalism he believed that we could control our own destiny he never believed that this nation could or should abide the waste of unemployment the scourge of poverty the numbing blight of ignorance nor the casual inhumanity of injustice lyndon johnson had a vision for his country he believed we could conquer our problems that we could alleviate poverty and indeed his programs did open whole new worlds of opportunity through the vision and unparalleled political skills he commanded president johnson brought decent medical care to the old and the poor he demanded that we no longer tolerate hunger among the people of this the greatest food producing nation in the world he established vast new programs to improve the nations schools to insure that every child got a sound education and to make available a university education to all who could benefit from it he insisted that the poor even the longterm unemployed could be placed into useful jobs through all these and many other efforts he was responsible for a vast reduction in the incidence of poverty in our country where there was no hope he opened hope and where there was hope he insisted that there be genuine opportunity compare that to the experience of today under our present leadership we have not progress but retreat there are millions of newly unemployed there are millions of newly poor no longer do we seek to insure that the poor are decently housed and fed far from it our leadership demands that the hungry should go more hungry our leadership is not one with a vision of what our country could be but one that sees a diminishing futurea world with shrinking hopes not one of growing possibilities lyndon johnson was excoriated as a free spender but the leadership of today the current administration will incur deficits that are 60 times as great as any that johnson would even dream of he was called a radical ex perimenter but he never abandoned the basic principle of sticking with programs that were practical that were proven whose results could be measured compare that to the pie in the sky claims that we heard for supplyside economics nonsense that we are paying dearly for today the present administration likes to say that there is no need to produce new housing for the poor or for anybody else because the marketplace will take care of everything but lyndon johnson knew that this was not so and could not be so if there are millions of people who cannot even get into the marketplace the market serves only people who bnve the means it does not serve those who have no means johnson would have wanted to know how many were without housing what could be done to get them into housing and how to get it done compare that to the breezy callousness of todays antihousing administration there is no way for me or for anyone else to describe the whole complex dazzling being who was lyndon johnson it might be said that he never believed that there was a problem that could not be licked whatever it was he would argue threaten worry demand plead work and pester anyone and anything in his considerable reach until he was satisfied that the matter had been disposed of it might be civil rights it might be interest rates which today are treated as given from godly writbut which he knew were made and broken by men just like him it might be education or any one of a thousand things whatever it was he believed the problem could be solved and he intended to do it compare that to the casual callousness of today when human needs and human miseries are ignored and when not only is no positive action taken every effort is taken to destroy what little help people have available he would never understand would be terribly grieved to see the sorry spectacle that we have today in which misery is compounded in which inequity is heaped upon unfairness in which shameless dishonor is dismissed as practical politics he would be horrified by policies that are nothing more than warmed over 19th century darwinism nothing less than callous disregard of even so basic a thing as providing for economic growthfar from it policies that destroy even that possibility lyndon johnson reached farther than he could grasp but he drove this country to its greatest heights his programs were the most comprehensive humane and effective domestic efforts ever attempted they were also the most effective there is no way to describe the kind of new dreams that were not only made possible but that were achieved thanks to president johnsons efforts he could not understand and would not tolerate a government that was indifferent it is a mercy that he never lived to see the inlifference the outright emptiness that characterizes the present occupant of the white house a man who was a doer could never understand one whose sole mission seems to be to undo do nothing do deliberate and calculated harm i salute the memory and legacy of lyndon johnson no man ever cared so much dared so much or did so much for his country may his spirit endure and may someday this country be blessed with another leader as bold as caring as great and as determined as he was

bringing this legislation to the floor there is no question that without his able advice and counsel we would not be here today and the george washington half would be but a dream we are all aware of george washington and of the many things that he did to shape our republic in its early days however we tend to view him more as a marble statue to be honored than for what he was a very human person who did his best in trying circumstances and created a republic that is still the hope for freedom of much of the world today it is my hope that the issuance of a commemorative coin for his 250th birthday will cause people to think about his life as that of a man who lived rather than just as a historical subject h r 3484 provides for the striking of a special silver dollar by the mint to honor this important anniversary the coins when issued next year will have a composition of 90 percent silver and 10 percent copper identical to the silver coins struck in this country before 1965 they will be available for 2 years 1982 and 1983 and will be legal tender for half a dollar although they will be sold for more than that h r 3484 provides that a maximum of 10 million of these coins will be struck with the actual number issued being limited to those ordered during 1982 the number 10 million is admittedly arbitrary but was chosen as the number most likely to approximate the actual demand for the coin at its maximum demand for the eisenhower silver dollar ran at close to 7 million and while i believe that the washington half will attract more interest i believe that 10 million is a fair estimate in addition i felt that the mint should have some way to plan its production and that a ceiling would probably heighten the interest in the coin and encourage early orders my legislation provides that the price will cover all costs associated with the coin plus a profit of up to 20 percent the sales will be handled according to regulations issued by the secretary of the treasury and all profits will go into the treasury general fund briefly there are three reasons why h r 3484 should be approved first a commemorative half dollar is a fitting way to honor the 250th birthday of george washington second there is a market for the coin and it will provide an american alternative for the millions of collectors and investors who invest in silver coins yearly and are now limited to foreign coins as sqch it will help our balance of trade to some extent third the sales of these coins will provide a profit to the treasury that will help to reduce the deficit in fiscal year 1982 of these three reasons the first the desire to commemorate george washington on his 250th birthday is the most important in honor of this anniversary a silver coin is particularly appropriate as washington took a special interest in the establishment of our nations first mint and was responsible for our first silver coinage personally the establishment of a mint was one of washingtons main priorities when he became president in 1789 but circumstances delayed it for over 2 years in a speech to congress on september 25 1791 he again urged the establishment of a mint to remove the scarcity of small change a scarcity which is so peculiarly distressing to the poorer classes the congress responded to this plea and not only established a mint but also provided for a national coinage system washington took a personal interest in the establishment of this coinage system and intervened when the senate bill provided for the pieture of the current president on the coins instead he successfully urged that a representation of liberty be placed on the coins the next year 1792 he used 100 of his personal silver plate for the minting of the first unitedstates coins silver 5cent pieces according to old mint documents he had not forgotten his concern about the need of the poor for coins and the coins were promptly released into circulation as shown by the heavy wear that most of them exhibit today the coin that you are considering today will not be the first time that congress has decided that a coin is an appropriate way to commemorate an anniversary of george washingtons birth fifty years ago for the 200th anniversary in 1932 a special commemorative quarter was issued supposedly for 1 year only however it proved to be so popular that it remains in circulation today the second reason for passing this legislation is that not only is there a market for the coin domestically but it will also be the first and only american entry in the worldwide silver commemorative coin market although silver coins have not been struck for circulation in recent years many nations sell them at a premium to collectors and investors and make a profit on them one excellent example is the royal canadian mint which this year will offer a commemorative silver dollar honoring the construction of a transcontinental railroad across canada this coin is part of a regular series that canada issues yearly for sale to collectors with a new design each year the coin will be offered to americans in two finishes for either 18 or 14 depending on which is chosen their efforts to attract large numbers of american buyers are shown by the many ads for the coins that have appeared in major american papers including the new york times and the wall street journal the canadians are not the only ones taking advantage of the market the april 29 issue of coin world a major hobby paper lists new silver issues aimed at collectors and investors from austria egypt gibraltar israel poland sudan switzerland and venezuela in addition it displays a prominent ad from the soviet bank for foreign trade offering that nations silver and gold medals for sale silver coins are issued internationally for a variety of reasons the silver institute states in its april newsletter that many nations issued coins for the international year of the child in 1980 and that up to 24 nations will issue them this year to commemorate the international year of the disabled person modern silver coins are sold in the millions each year many of them to american collectors and investors the profits from their sale then goes abroad to the issuing government and helps their balance of trade while at the same time hurting ours american competition would not drive the others out of the market but it would have a wide appeal with the millions of american collectors and investors in addition it would attract some foreign business and would give all the option of buying an american coin nor is the tradition of commemorative coins foreign to this country beginning in 1892 this country issued commemorative silver halfs on 48 separate occasions gold commemoratives on 6 occasions and silver dollars and quarters once each in addition there was a 40percent silver set of coins commemorating the bicentennial the profits that this coin will provide to the treasury are the third reason to support h r 3133 as written the bill directs the treasury to price the coin so that all costs associated with the production and sale of the coin are covered along with a profit to the government of up to 20 percent of the total the exact percentage was left to the treasury so that the coin could be priced at the nearest quarter dollar or so as i mentioned earlier the profits will go to the general fund of the treasury and will help to reduce the deficit for fiscal year 1982 i cannot closely estimate how large these profits will be but if silver stays at about 11 an ounce it could equal up to 15 million if the entire issue is sold while the details of the sale are left to the secretary i would hope that the coin will be promoted through the media and through other outlets such as the mint mailing list in addition if possible i would like to see volume discounts similar to those offered at one time on bicentennial sets given to financial institutions and others to encourage them to offer the coin to their customers at the original issue price if these steps or similar ones are taken i believe that the entire issue would be sold out in conclusion i believe that this coin will provide a fitting memorial to our first president while at the same time offering an american alternative to those who choose to buy silver coins this is no susan b anthony dollar but rather a profitable venture into a proven market utilizing the mints almost 200 years of expertise ameri can coins are traditionally known for their technical excellence and enjoy a wide popularity in the world now an american silver half dollar will meet the same acceptance this will be a popular coin and will be accepted by the american people as a collectors item that honors a great american h r

between 100 to 275 million if all the coins were sold given the success of the recent carson city silver dollar sale i fully anticipate a sellout of the olympic coins my legislation provides for a general accounting office audit of both the sale of the coins and the use of the proceeds by the united states olympie committee to make certain that the money goes directly to the benefit of athletic training the week after introduction of my bill a second bill which i call the lazardoccidental bill was introduced this legislation calls for the striking of 29 different coins by the unitedstates mint with all of the coins being sold directly to a marketing group composed of the investment banking firm of lazard freres and occidental petroleum who have been given a license by the los angeles olympic committee to sell olympic coins the bulk of the proceeds from the sale of these coins would go to the private marketers in fact the private interests can earn as much as 94 million profit on this deal a portion of the funds raised by the 29 coin bill would be given to the los angeles olympic organizing committee laooc and an even smaller amount would be funneled to the united states olympic committee the legislation does not allow for the general accounting office to audit any portion of the transaction and in fact it virtually turns control of the unitedstates mint over to lazard freres and occidental i am deeply concerned that the lazardoccidental bill will lead to scandal not only will our athletes be tainted and the american people disillusioned but the bill actually may provide little or no money for training our athletes in february 4 months prior to the introduction of any legislation the laooc quietly awarded exclusive worldwide marketing rights for olympic coins to a concern composed of lazard freres and occidental lazardocaidental gave the laqoc 5 million of which 1 million is nonrefundable the laqoc is also entitled to keep all th interest earned on the other 4 million in march the laooc gave the unitedstates olympic committee a check for 500 000 as their share of the nonrefundable 1 million in effect the laooc and the unitedstates olympic committee sold their rights in any coins to lazard freres and occidental petroleum this is morally and ethiically wrong and casts doubt on the ability of the lagoc and the olympic committee to speak objectively on this issue secrecy seems to surround the details of the relationship between the laooc and lazardoccidental for the past 3 months i have tried without success to obtain a copy of the contract between the laooc and lazard freresoccidental i have received a copy of theletter of understanding between the parties but despite assurances from those representing the coin marketers that i would get a copy of the contract it has never been presented i can well understand why they would not make the contract available to me because the letter of understanding is so shocking that the complete contract is probably too hot to be made public lazardoccidental are no strangers to the world of marketing olympic and sportsrelated coins last year they had the exclusive rights to marketing soviet olympic coins in the free world it is ironic that they were pushing these coins in the american market at the very same time our athletes had made a decision not to participate in the moscow games while i stood on the capitol steps as our olympic athletes received medals for boycotting the moscow games lazardoccidental were busy raising american money to stage those games as with the agreement with laooc information about the financial aspects of the sale of soviet coins is hard to come by as far as i know no information has been released although various members of the media have requested it from both the russians and the lazardoccidental marketing concern recently i learned that a company called numarco distributing co has been accused of improprieties in greece in obtaining

1969 when the country was going through the agony of the war in vietnam has the house conducted a debate such as the one we are engaged in today thirteen years ago this house talked about a war in a small country in southeast asia today we talk about global wara war that would end civilization as we know it the subject we are addressing today is the ultimate subject we can debate in this chamber the condition of the economy at if the silos are emptied there will be no economy we can argue for thi social program and that social program but after nuclear war there will be no society we can have one foreign policy initiative after another but if the warheads explode the entire international order and structure will be dismembered i commend representatives jim leach and matthew mchugh and the staff of members of congress for peace through law for organizing this debate it is long overdue representatives conte bingham and i have introduced a resolution in the house calling on the superpowers to freeze their nuclear arsenals and begin cutting back so far 160 members of the house have cosponsored this resolution a similar resolution introduced in the senate by senators kennedy and hatfield has attracted more than 20 cosponsors in that chamber but this discussion today is not the result of this resolution no this measure is part of a much largeri movement gaining strength in the country that movement has a clear and simple message enough is enough the arms race must be halted before we blow ourselves of the face of the earth the nuclear arsenals of both superpowers must be reduced and reduced drastically why has the public suddenly turned itself toward nuclear arms control and disarmament because the public is afraid the american people want a strong defense but they are afraid that the 1 7 trillion arms buildup of the reagan administration heats up an arms race where nobody wins they do not want nuclear war but they hear talk of nuclear warning shots from their secretary of state and limited nuclear war in europe from their president they do not want other countries to acquire nuclear bombs but they see nuclear trade policies from the admi istration that show that proliferation will be none of its business all across the country religious leaders business executives lawyers doctors college students and local legislators to name a few are organizing to demand a halt to the nuclear arms race the one initiative gaining momen tum nationwide is the proposal for the united states and the soviet union to freeze their nuclear arsenals so far more than a million people have signed freeze petitions in california a compaign is under way to place a referendum on the november state ballot calling for a freeze the campaign has collected about a half million signatures nuclear freeze groups have sprung up in 43 states and 279 congressional districts the massachusetts oregon and new yor4 legislatures have passed freeze resolutions more than 160 vermont towns have voted to support the freeze these are not people who want the united states to lay down its arms they are not advocating unilateral disarmament they are people with commonsense they are people who want both sides to stop the arms race the contemarkeybingham resolution is a response to that commonsense appeal the resolution calls on the superpowers to halt the arms race it calls on the united states and the soviet union to sit down and negotiate a mutual and verifiable freeze on the testing production and further de ployment of nuclear warheads mis siles and other delivery systems it calls on the superpowers to then begin major mutual and verifiable reductions in their nuclear arsenals yes there will have to be some giver and take at the negotiating table because of differences in both sides deployment cycles deciding on how to draw the line on testing production and deployment and figuring out how to cut back on the weapons will certainly keep the negotiators busy yes the process of implementing a freeze will be arduous and detailed but we have no choice but to begin that process for time is running out the arms race is getting out of control the overkill the two superpowers have amassed defies any rational justification the weapons states now have more than 50 000 nuclear weapons with a total explosive power equal to 1 million hiroshima bombs one poseidon submarine has enough warheads to cause 30 million fatalities in the soviet union more than it suffered in all of world war ii in europe alone the united states has one nuclear weapon for every 50 soldiers just 200 of the some 9 000 strategic warheads in the unitedstates arsenal would destroy every major city in the soviet union but now the american public is being told this overkill is not enough the administration wants to build 17 000 more bombs over the next 15 years i both the united states and the soviet union are in the process of deploying or producing a new generation of weapons deadly weapons like the soviet ss18 and the american mx missile that improve each sides ability to knock out the others missiles in a nuclear exchange and will put a hair trigger on nuclear deterrence both sides are taking technological leaps in the research and development of nuclear weapons that will make it more difficult to negotiate arms control treaties george kennan once said that the nuclear bomb is the most useless weapon ever invented it can be employed to no rational purpose but now we hear dangerous talk from the white house the state department and the pentagon about using nuclear weapons we hear talk of waging a nuclear war rationally of employing nuclear weapons as instruments of foreign policy we hear this laughable statement from mr t k jones a deputy undersecretary over at dod who says that everybodys going to make it if there are enough shovels to go around his plan is for each american to dig a hole throw 3 feet of dirt on top so its the dirt we are told that does it we read in the paper today that president reagan pland to spend 4 2 billion on a program to relocate twothirds of the american public in case of a threat of nuclear war not only would this be a waste of money such a program would dangerously delude the public into thinking it can survive a nuclear holocaust and win when the bombs explode there will be no winners while the administration professes that it wants to deter nuclear war it is pursuingpolicies and developiqg weapons that could push us into a nuclear war we must now realize that spending more money on more nuclear weapons merely buys us more trouble our resolution has received quite a bit of criticism recently that criticism reached a low point with this ad from the college republican national committee which is an auxiliary of the republican national committee the ad says the soviet union needs you support a unitedstates nuclear freeze to imply as this ad does that the 160 representatives who have cospon sored our resolution22 of whom are republicansto imply that they are preaching moscows line is an affront to their integrity and intelligence to imply that rev billy graham and averell harriman and the more than 300 prominent individuals and organizations across the country who have endorsed this resolution are communist sympathizers does a monumental disservice to people who are committed to the security of america i also wish the administration would expend as much energy stopping the arms race as it has attacking our resolution the administration claims that our resolution would freeze the united states into a disadvantaged position with the soviets that is not true each side has advantages over the other in certain weapons systems but overall there exists a balance of imbalances between the two superpowers when administration critics talk about a disadvantaged position i would ask them which position they would rather have the soviets they have no bomber fleet to speak of their subs are noisy and easy to detect and more than threefourths of their missiles sit in vulnerable landbased silos or would they rather be in the american position half our missiles are in invulnerable submarines more than onefourth are on intercontinental bombers and we lead the soviets in warheads 9 000 to 7 000 the russians are not 10 feet tall we do a great disservice to our defense posture when we claim we are weaker than the soviets the fact is we have more than enough firepower to reduce the soviet union to rubble they know it we know it the american public knows it and it is about time the administration knows it the administration claims that our resolution cannot be verified that is not true a freeze and reduction in both sides nuclear armaments can be verified so each side be confident that violations affecting our national security would be detected in fact verification would be much easier if we freeze now and reduce the stockpiles than if we heat up the arms race and try to negotiate reductions as the administration proposes if we have a massive arms buildup as the administration advocates we will end up with more nuclear weapons that will be harder to verify when we go to the negotiating table the administration claims that our resolution undercuts the negotiations in europe that is not true both the soviet union and the united states have b en playing to the gallery in their neg aiations over a few thousand nuclear weapons in europe meanwhile the question of how we cut back on the 50 000 warheads stockpile worldwide remains ignored obviously the brezhnev proposal for a freeze in intermediaterange missiles in europe is inadequate but instead of rejecting that proposal out of hand as the reagan administration has done we should challenge the soviets to freeze and reduce all nuclear arms finally we now hear that the president plans to endorse a socalled freeze resolution in the senate sponsored by senators jacason and warner that is not good enough mr president the jacksonwarner resolution calls for a longterm freeze in other words it says let us build just a few thousand more weapons then lets talk about freezing the arsenals let us deploy the mx the b1 bomber and groundlaunched and sealaunched cruise missiles then well stop it is the same old tired line the american public has been hearing from its leaders for the last three decades just let us complete the arms race and then we will talk about disarmament it will not wash the arms race can never be completed when we build more they build more when we mirv they mirv when we build the cruise missile they will build the cruise missile and the arms race will never end the american people are tired of excuses they are tired of being fed this baloney that we must arm to disarm they are afraid of all this talk from the reagan administration about nuclear waring shots about nuclear proliferation beizlk none of our business and about a limited

administrations budget forces mr kemf in particular said a number of favorable things about the caucus budget yesterday andi i want to congratulate him on his remarks i recall that my colleague from

reagan administration who is calling for more tax equity and reform of a tax code that everyone knows presently is grossly inequitablethe cbc or the reagan administration who is demanding basic cuts

colleague from new york to answer these questions i would add a personal observation is there any one in this body who really thinks the reagan administration lattagramm budget is contributing to national unity and social consensus i would like to hear it frankly the greatest tragedy of the administrations budget plan is that it may become the single biggest factor of divisiveness and social

prizewinning economist and authority on economic structures at new york university and dr lester thurow of mit in the last few months have all voiced the strongest doubts about the economic viability and desirability of the reagan administrations defense program i notice yesterday as reported in the washington post today the mormon church and its leaders ii a very rare comment on national policies came out in opposition to the mx missile system their statement of opposition it should be noticed by my colleagues went far beyond the mx missile the mormon church leadership squarely attacked the basic assumptions behind the unitedstates military establishment the soviet military establishment and the frightening global arms race that both superpowers equally are contributing toward referring to the terrifying arms race that~ has to be halted spencer w kimball president of the mormon church stated we deplore in particular the building of vast arsenals of nuclear weaponry history indicates that men have seldon created armaments that eventually were not put to use 0 with the most serious concern over the pressing moral question of possible nuclear conflict we plead with our national leaders to marshal the genius of the nation to find viable alternatives the mormon church leadership is referring to the deadly world arms race that is draining nations of their resources and revenues that otherwise would be spent on economic and social develolimentspecifically which last year exceeded 500 billion dollars and which the reagan administration in its budget proposal is contributing mightily toward i believe there is a growing sense in this body that the defense budget will undo~whatever good might resultfrom administration economic policies and i say this as one who is highly skeptical about the administrations policies if the congresssional black caulcus and a handful of socalled house liberals alone had challenged the reagan defense budget it likely would have been dismissed summarily but the caucus is not alone in its criticism of the transfer of some 50 billion in additional budget authority to dod next year we are joined by leading churches in the land by highly respectable economists and financial leaders the simple truth is that the defense budget that the administration is proposing will intensify inflation because inflationary costs in the defense sector have been running at twice the rate as in the economy overall intensify inflation because of the widely acknowledged shortages of pro may 6 1981 duction in the defense sector and in the shortages of its labor force intensify inflation because of the widely reported monopolistic practice among defense contractors the lack of competitive contract bidding at dod and the widespread lack of pentagon control over its own budget intensify inflation because in the aggregate boosts in defense spending add income but not consumer goods and services and therefore add to the class inflation of too many dollars chasing too few goods and shift badly needed investment capital away from the civilian sectors of the economy that are mnost in need of revitalization i detect among my colleagues especially on the opposite side of the aisle a growing uneasiness about the administrations and the latta0ramms defense budget that uneasiness is understandable no one has come up with a convincing argument why an additional 50 billion in defense is needed other than the ageold shibboleths about national security and the russians are coming this morning i went over some comparative figures on the relative strengths of the unitedstates defense establishment and the soviets in termsa of defense spending during the last 10 years the nato allies have outspent the warsaw pact by 207 billion according to londons international institute for strategic studies in terms of strategic nuclear warheads the best measure of relative numerical strengths the united states has 9 200 warheads as compared to 7 000 on the soviet side of equal importance the united states has far greater command control flexibility and survivability in relation to its ability to fight a nuclear war than has the soviet union for example only 25 percent of our strategic warheads are land basedand relatively vulnerableas compared to 80 percent of the soviets warheads and because of our triad of strategic forceslandbased seabased and airbasedthe united states has a wide advantage over the soviets for example 48 percent of our strategic warheads are either at sea alert or in bombers on alert as compared to 3 percent of the soviets warheads there is a shocking orthodoxy in this chamber about the need for a stronger defense establishment despite the facts and figures despite the questionability of ever winning a nuclear war however limited or of needing any more nuclear arms than we presently have as the mormon church leaders observed my col leagues especially on the other side of the aisle still cling to the panacea of more defense spending as if it were a reflex action that arises when no other solutions to our economys problems and the worlds problems are in sight i think we ought to debate many more hours the role of defense spending in the administrations budget and in relation to economic recovery we ought to debate many more hours the assumptions behind the reagan lattagramm budget and the alternative that the congressional black caucus is proposing i would now like to touch briefly upon a matter which in terms of dollars may be considered relatively insignificant in relation to the overall federal budget however it is a very important matter because of its direct bearing upon the quality of justice in this country i speak of the legal services corporation when the congress enacted the legislation establishing the legal services corporation in 1974 it made findings about the need for such a program the congress specifically found that first there is a need in this country for equal access to our system of justice second there is a need to provide highquality legal assistance to those who are unable to afford it third providing legal assistance to those facing an economic barrier to obtaining legal help serves the ends of justice fourth the availability of legal assistance has reaffirmed for many people their faith in our government of laws pifth a legal services program should be kept free of the influence of political pressures and sixth attorneys who provide legal assistance under such a program must have full freedom to protect the best interests of their clients just as other members of the bar have full freedom to protect their clients interests those findings are as valid and accurate today as they were in 1974 and the need for a legal services corporation today is as great as it was in 1974 continued funding of the corporation is essential if we are to keep this countrys commitment to equal justice under the law the need for the continuation of the legal services corporation has been widely recognized in addition to numerous individual private attorneys district attorneys judges state attorneys general and state governors many national organizations have called for continued funding of the corporation including the american bar association the american association of retired persons national association of retired teachers the aflcio the american coalition of citizens with disabilities the childrens defense fund the friends committee on national legislation the league of united latin american citizens lulac the lead ership conference on civil rights the national bar association the national council of churches the national council of senior citizens the national committee against discrimination in housing the national mental health association the national farmers union the national council on aging the national urban league the national legal aid and defender association the united states conference of mayors the united states catholic conference and rural america one of the announced goals of this administration is a reduction in what it refers to as unnecessary and inefficient federal regulations continuation of the legal services corporation will not frustrate that goal the legal services corporation does not engage in any substantive regulation and it is not a part of the federal bureaucracy in addition the corporations programs are locally controlled the corporation has been soundly managed and its programs have been costeffectiveit expends only 1 8 percent of its funds on management and administration and another 1 8 percent for field monitoring and evaluation continuation of the legal services corporation has bipartisan support just last monday the judiciary committees subcommittee on courts civil liberties and the administration of justice unanimously reported an authorization bill for the corporation that bill authorizes 200 million for the corporation for each of the next 2 fiscal years in addition the bill addresses some of the criticisms that have been leveled at the corporation such as in the area of class action suits and lobb ying i urge all of my colleagues to support this bipartisan effort to continue the important work of the legal services corporation"], [0.0031424760818481445, 0.9968575239181519, 1, "i want to report on hearings held recently by the house small business oversight subcommittee which i cha r on todays business failure epidemic and the devastating toll it is taking on small business the subcommittee invited leading experts from the academic business and bankruptcy worlds to testify to find out why so many businesses are failing and what it means for our economy the hearings were held against the backdrop of the gravest crisis faced by american business since the great depression this is what we see capital investment by companies is off sharply data resources inc forecasts that business investment will be off 8 percent this year over last year despite the massive tax incentives to invest enacted last year aftertax profits of corporations in the first quarter of 1982 were almost onethird lower than a year earlier the sharpest drop in the postwar period the new york times reported earlier this week that corporate profits have reached the lowest levels in perhaps 5 years many companies are saddled with heavy shortterm debt the ratio of shortterm debt to total debt is at a new high business balance sheets and corporate liquidity are more fragile than at any other time in postwar history since the first quarter of 1981 industrial output has dropped more than 7 percent our nations factories ran at a dismal 69 8 percent of capacity in june of this year 15 percentage points below the rate at which capital goods makers start getting orders for equipment to add capacity small business proprietorship income is expected to be nearly 15 percent lower this year than in 1980 according to data resources inc and businesses are failing at a rate not seen since the great depression todays figures as reported by dun bradstreet the business information concern are truly alarming the failure rate today is almost 90 per 10 000 listed companies just short of the failure rate of 100 per 10 000 companies recorded in the great depression year of 1933 put another way 11 businesses are failing right now for every hour of the business day business failures have only become a serious problem since 1981 looking back over the postwar period we find that business failures ranged between 1946 and 1980 from a low of 5 per 10 000 listed companies in 1946 to a high of 64 per 10 000 in 1961 the business failure rate average for those 35 years was 40 3 per 10 000 listed companies beginning in 1981 however business failures began to shoot up in 1980 l11742 companies or 42 per 10 000 companies failed in 1981 the figures jumped to 16 800 or 62 per 10 000 companies for 1982 the prediction is 25 000 or 88 per 10 000 listed companies the average for 1981 and the first half of 1982 is 75 per 10 000 companies an 86 percent increase over the 194680 average in the past 2 years the business failure rate has jumped 110 percent the second largest 2year jump since 1920 the only time it was higher was in the 2 years immediately after world war ii when business failures returned from the depressed war level to normal todays figures are indeed grim we should remember that the dun bradstreet figures cover only failures which involve losses to creditcs the number of business failures today is really much higher since thousands of businessmen simply decide to close their businesses because they see only an unprofitable future these business closings which are really failures reflect a lack of confidence in the business environment and are not reflected in dun bradstreets statistics as president reagans recently released report on the state of small business tells us the dun bradstreet figures are a valuable indicator of business distress the hearings looked at this distress not only in numerical terms but in human terms what we are seeing today is a great human tragedy we must not forget that business failures mean lost jobs ruined lives and dashed dreams they mean lost pensions lost life savings and lost tax revenues they also take a human toll in the lost selfesteem felt by those directly affected they mean an end to the american dream of opportunity and owning ones own business that has been such a powerful art of this nations dynamism last march when it was becoming clear that 1982 would see a record number of business failures i wrote to 2 dozen unitedstates bankruptcy judges and trustees to find out why this was happening i wanted to hear directly from them because they are seeing every day what is happening why it is happening and what needs to be done to end this terrible spiral of failure i received 19 replies from throughout the nation which i included in the hearing record this is the picture that emerged from the letter business are failing in all sections of the country and in every economic sector large and small businesses and young and old businesses are failing business are failing in record numbers and the failure rate continues to rise the business failures experienced today are much worse than those experienced during the last severe recession of 19741975 business are failing today because of high interest rates and the deep recession the revised federal bankruptcy code is not a cause of the increased number of business bankruptcy filings let me read a few of the responses unitedstates bankruptcy judge peter m elliott of los angeles wrote i would say that the major cause of small business failures is high interest rates unitedstates trustee william p westphal sr of minneapolis wrote the two primary causes for the increase in bankruptcies generally as well as for small business in particular are the extremely high interest rates and the length of the current recession unitedstates trustee scott h bush of dallas wrote the tentacles of the current recession reach to all communities at all locations even the glorious sunbelt has not been insulated the current recession is much more severe than the 19741975 recession unitedstates bankruptcy judge charles b mccormick of chicago wrote the increase in small business bankruptcy filings must i feel be blamed on the common elements of high interest tight money inflation the loss of jobs due to plant closings and the farming out of work to foreign countries and the other ills that greet one in the media every day unitedstates bankruptcy judge william l norton jr of atlanta wrote i do not see incompetency or mismanagement or dishonest actions in individuals or businessmen which some credit grantors or others ascribe to debtors in the bankruptcy court as being the cause of prevalence in bankruptcies i see the overwhelming number of individual and business debtors in this court who sincerely and honestly want to pay their debts and have been and are attempting to pay such debts i see many businesses and persons in my court who i feel there but for the grace of god go i as the letters i received show high interest rates and the prolonged and deep recession are placing an extraordinarily heavy burden on all businesses and small budinesses in particular this is the same message we heard from our academic witness at the hearing according to edward i altman a professor of finance at new york university and a leading expert on predicting business failures the devastating effects of reduced profits and high interest rates that have remained around 20 percent or more for several years are continuing to reduce the ranks of our smaller firm population because of high interest rates pro fessor altman continued businesses today pay more than 40 cents of each dollar of cash flow for interest charges up from 20 cents of 4 years ago no wonder so many marginal firms are succumbing to the economic reality of bankruptcy he said this is unfair small business relies almost exclusively on banks for financing they cannot shop around or bargain for the best interest rates as can large corporations many small businesses are paying at least prime rate or above prime for their loans that means close to 20 percent interest what makes these rates even more crushing is that the real interest rate is at least 10 percent the highest in recent memory the impact can be seen everywhere joseph w duncan the chief statistician for dun bradstreet presented to the subcommittee his firms latest business failure figures they showed continuing and sharp increases throughout the nation and in all industries the sun belt and mountain states are as hard hit as the farm states midwest and midatlantic region the failures touch not only the weak manufacturing wholesale retail and construction sectors but also the previously strong service industries what does the future hold only more grim numbers and more tragedy the subcommittee was tdid unless the economy improves and interest rates decline significantly i am afraid that the already staggering number of business failures will swell to levels comparable to the early 1930s the normally cautious professor altman predicted in 1932 the nadir of the great depression 31 822 businesses failed for a catastrophic failure rate of 154 per 10 000 listed companies the risk he added is that increased business failures will lead banks to tighten credit further and thus accelerate the business failure spiral if banks ration credit to only the most creditworthy firms professor altman said the marginal firm will stand little chance of surviving it is also probably true that the marginal firm is oftentimes also a small firm todays problem goes beyond high interest rates the problem stems from the mix of economic and fiscal policies currently being followed that have driven our nations economy into the worse recession since world war ii and created the severest liquidity crisis for business since the great depression as professor altman warned the real risk is not whether the economy will turn around and stage a recovery but how long the recovery will last if the turnaround is relatively short like the one we experienced in late 1980 then thousands of firms particularly smaller ones will not have sufficient time to get back on a positive cash flow basis the consequences are obvious and ominous we will see a ripple effect throughout the economy as failing large companies topple small firms doing business with them thousands of people will lose their jobs this is happening right now unitedstates trustee james eichstaedt of los angeles told the subcommittee that the bankruptcy last april of the wickes cos the large retail chain has cost several thousands jobs and seriously squeezed the small firms that did business with wickes with so many large unitedstates companies in such desperate financial straits we can count on it happening again and again and again if new economic and fiscal policies are not adopted that will bring interest rates down to affordable and stable levels and encourage the economy to grow e"], [0.0031464695930480957, 0.9968535304069519, 1, "i commend my chairman the delegate from the district of columbia for bringing forward a constructive alternative to this budget io the jones proposal and lest we forget there are other alternatives that have been proposed and yet we have heard very little mention of the congressional black caucus constructive alternative mr fauntroy the chairman of the congressional black caucus has already pointed out to you that we offer the only budget that is in surphits encourages increased jobs and productivity and relieves the american people of a growing tax burden above all the budget the cbc proposes shares theburden of austerity among the rich as well as the poor and it does so without necessarily cutting back vital social programs i note as an additional recomnmendation the analysis of the democratic study group which says that this budget takes the boldest step of any proposals being offered to the house to deal with the federal deficit as to the cbc tax proposalwhich many have said provides no tax relief at allthe dsg report says that it offers the largest and fairest tax cut of any proposal before the house this is indreed a strong recommendation since this is accomplished while at the same time providing for increased defense spending and for those vital programs from energy conservation to community development to income security programs which the administration proposals would sacrifice but without which the communities we represent would not survive i want to draw your attention in particular to the functions of the cbc budget that deal with energy one of the most critical considerations of the nation as a whole and one that most seriously affects the poor of this nation it seems to me that this is one aspect of the social safety network which the administration purports to preserve and guarantee but which has been grievously overlooked the reagan administrations energy budget proposals are a complete reorientation of the federal gloverniments role in energy programs as described by the house budget committees summary and analysis the reagan budget would suggest a near total dependence on market forces for making societal transitions from an inexpensiveenergy past to a very expensiveenergy future this approach leaves unanswered two important questions to what extent must market forces be supplemented to bring about the development of new energy supplies and conservation techniques and to what extent should the federal government assist citizenisparticularly those with low incomeswith conservation and weatherization to adapt to higher energy costs th6 contradictions become clear the administration exalts virtues of unconstrained market forces and yet it was under the free play of market forces in the past that the nation became vulnerable to the oil threat of opec nationswith its derivative adverse effects it was the free play of market forces that made it possible for only those large and rich firms with easy access to capital to develop alternative energy technologies and suppliesclosing off the field to innovative and competitive small businesses and in fact the budgets endorsed by the administration clearly favor big business at the expense of smalleven though there are not necessarily economies of scale and it is small business that will generate the most employment above all under the free play of market forces families with low incomes had no recoursethrough conservation and weatherization assistance to adapt to higher energy costs which were thrust upon them these are flagrant contradictions to what the administration budget purports to do to its allegation that it is preserving the safety net that it is minding the best interests of the nation most flagrant of these contra dictions while the poor are sacrificed to untrammeled market forces special interest groups would preserve their agriculturalsubsidies addressing these concerns the congressional black caucus budget proposal focuses on alternate energy development and conservation it specifically restores funds to the energy areas which would encourage the development and research for alternate fuel sources thereby lessening our dependence on opec oil the crc budget goes forward with a program of energy conservation which is both practical and humane and allows for protection against the elements for those who can least afford to fend off the ravages of winter where the reagan budget would remove the lowincome weatherization program from the department of energy and drop it into a community development block grant somewhere in hud which is funded at a 466 million reduced budget authority the cbc restores full funding for this program and where the reagan budget would eliminate more than half of the funding of the economic regulatory administration the congressional black caucus budget restores funding to this agency to allow it to collect the 3 billion in petroleum overcharges which would go uncollected under the reagan budget by item the cbc budget restores 0 7 billion in budget authority and 0 4 billion in outlays in fiscal year 1982 for energy conservation cbc restores 0 1 billion in budget authority and 0 1 billion in outlays in cuts to the solar bank which would allow for loan supplements for solar residential use primarily cbc would restore 0 7 billion in budget authority and 0 8 billion in outlays to the nonfossil energy supply such as geothermal energy impact assistance environmental and hydro power programs it must be remembered that the cbc energy budget is reduced even greater than the reagan proposed budget some of the major reductions which cbc made to the reagan proposal were of 0 3 billion in budget authority by delaying the gaseous centrifuge uranium enrichment plant crcs budget calls for doe charging fair value prices for uranium enrichment thereby saving 0 2 billion in budget authority and 0 2 billion in outlays the cbc budget further identified 1 5 billion saved in budget authority and 1 5 billion in outlays by reducing the strategic petroleum reserve funding and allowing for private funding in an instance when it is far more valid finally cancellation of the clinch river breeder reactor is a budgetary salvation of 0 3 billion in outlays the congressional black caucus total energy budget equals 5 4 billion in budget authority and 6 0 billion in outlays the congressional black caucus energy budget comes in 3 5 billion less than reagans in budget authority and 3 5 billion less than reagans in budget outlays we have identified for you programs which would serve to rescue america from the brink of the ugly future with which this administration and its followers would harness us this adminis11h1839 tration has targeted for elimination or severe reductions those programs and thus those people who have no grand lobbyists to waive their flag who have no gargantuan sums of money to keep their concerns in front of you though these concerns may often be a real matter of life and death such as in the weatherization and low income fuel assistance programs which cbc would fund fully the cbc would speak for those people who have no voice like the small businessman who had relied on this governments promise to fund his small alcohol fuels plant but now faces losing his home and all he owns because this government has not come through with the promised funds to match those which he had mortgaged his home to get for initiali expenses the people created the government to serve the people the people created the government to look out for those too weak too young too old to look

i move to strike the last word fully understanding that this amendment hias been withdrawn one of the concerne that i have in this continuing argument over elk hills is the assumption that we have an immediately usable strategic petroleum reserve in elk hills the whole purpose of the salt domes in texas was to be able to extract that oil in a relatively short period of time at elk hills you simply cannot d9 that in addition we have a tremendous amount of drilling going on in elk hills and elk hills happens to be in my district in california one of the things that the sale of the elk hills oil has done is to continue to spur additional drilling in the surrounding areas of the elk hills producing a tremendous increase in the quantities of heavy crude the elk hills oil has been used in blending the heavy crude to increase california production a simple example of that is that currently kern county one county in california produces better than 600 000 barrels of oil a day this includes the portion from elk hills if we subtracted the kern county portion of oil from california kern county that single county would be number three in the united states in oil production of states behind only alaska and texas so while we certainly ought to be filling the strategic petroleum reserve so that we can extract that oil in a very quick manner and certainly we should be making sure that elk hills has the potential to produce whenever we need to to its maximum capacity one of the things i think many members of congress really ought to do is come out to my district and take a look at the amount of oil that is actually available and the amount of oil that continues to be discovered in the immediate proximity of elk hills largely because of the stimulus provided by the elk hills oil for blending purposes so when we consider the picture of what to do with elk hills i urge my colleagues to look at the entire picture in terms of the amount of heavy oil being produced that would not be produced without the benefit of the blending possibilities from the elk hills crude so when we look at this picture of petroleum of energy and of the strategic petroleum reserve we have to also look at it in the terms of elk hills ability to stimulate the production of oil in the surrounding area"], [0.9838815927505493, 0.9838815927505493, 0, "as managers of the conference on the
