sides are developing more and more sophisticated weapons that will be harder and harder to control in a crisis both sides are poised to heat up the arms race it all adds up to one frightening conclusion as far as the piublic is concerned we are on the verge of blowing ourselves off the face of the earth the overkill the superpowers have amassed is mindboggling more than 50 000 nuclear warheads are stockpiled on both sides it would take no more than several hundred of those war heads to effectively destroy life as the united states and the soviet union now enjoy it and now the united states plans to build more nuclear bombs17 000 more bombs the largest expansion in warhead production this country has seen in 20 years the next generation of united states and soviet nuclear

of 24 billion a year to social security recipients a substantial part of the cuts come through a sharp reduction in benefits to those who retire at age 62 this is a particularly cruel cut since most early retirees are forced out of the market by poor health and layoffs in a sagging economy in some cases apparently early retirement has been locked into longterm collective bargaining agreements and similar contracts the administration proposal would reduce these recipients to a subpoverty level no one questions that the social security program needs to be examined closely and that there must be

the 1978 kidnaping of prime minister aldo moro and also to many vicious attacks on italian police they first made their criminal debut when they fought a gun battle with police outside the railroad

any formal presentation to be held i hope that this resolution will be a significant symbol of gratitude from the people of america the dozier rescue symbolizes more than just good solid police work

clarification is needed of a potential ambiguity relating to the allocation of research and experimental expenditures under section 861 of the internal revenue code i understand that section 223 of the act provides that for a 2year periodwhile treasury studies the impact of its section 1 8618 regulations on research and development in the united states and on the availability of the foreign tax creditall expenditures for research conducted in the united states shall be allocated and apportioned only to the unitedstates source income although i could not obtain time under this unusual procedure to question the chairman it is my understanding from conversations with members of the committee that during this 2year period existing law regulations and regulatory authority provided to the secretary as under 861863 will continue to govern the allocation and apportionent of expenditures for research conducted outside the united states in addition last week during floor consideration of the bill i indicated my strong objections to provisions contained in both packages to give new tax reductions to the oil industry these costiy incentives to win the support of undecided legislators in my view is a dangerous departure from the original mission of congress and administration to arrive at comprehensive and fair tax revisions i did not beieve and still do not believe that these tax reductions for the oil companies have any place as expensive afterthoughts in a multibilliondollar tax package i hope we have the opportunity for an up or down vote on the question it had been my hope that the conferees would act responsibly and adopt the less costly senate provisions pertaining to the oil industry unfortunately the conference committee opted to provide the oil companies with an 11 8 billion break instead of 6 6 billion in the senate bill the oil industrys influence on the world economy demands that these tax benefits be viewed with special care if new cuts can be justified let them stand the test of separate scrutiny by the congress yet despite this view the members of this body have continually been denied a separate vote on this matter furthermore the panel dropped two tax breaks important to the northeast and midwest regions of the nation these provisions the wood burning stove credit and a 1year home heating credit would directly aid consumers in meeting rising energy costs i am extremely disappointed that the conferees agreed to give excessive tax breaks to big oil while denying the average consumer two opportunities for minor tax breaks i trust this is not symbolic of the attitude toward the northeastmidwest region during the entire consideration of an economic recovery plan i have voiced my concerns over the problems faced by the northeast and midwest

want to commend the gentleman from ohio for his patience and leadership on this legislation and alsothe staff who worked very hard the legislation now before us represents a great deal of work by the interior committee to perfect and fine tune a bill which authorizes federal aid in the reconstruction of the filene center theater at wolf trap farm park in virginia the filene center was orginally built over a decade ago with private funds it and the land upon which it sits in excess of 100 acres was donated to the federal government and is now a unit of our national park system operated by the national park service as the wolf trap farm park the wolf trap foundation works in close cooperation with the national park service and the foundation is principally responsible for providing the programs scheduled for the center the entire arrangement represents a close cooperative relationship between the government and the private sector after the catastrophic fire of last april which totally destroyed the center the administration proposed legislation which embodied a partnership in cost sharing between the government and the wolf trap foundation the center would be rebuilt on a 5050 cost sharing basis h r 6875 as initialy introduced embraced this costsharing approach the legislation before us while embodying a totally new text preserves that 5050 costsharing approach however the current bill text is much more detailed in the provisions of how this partnership will work it endeavors to more precisely define responsibilities timetables construction and performance standards and later operational arrangements for the overall park including the new center itself this bill is designed to provide the best working arrangements between the government and the foundation and hopefully protects with sensitivity and care the governments financial investment a great deal of credit for the wellthoughtout details of this bill is deserved by the chairman of the subcommittee on public lands and national parks the honorable john seiberling and particularly by his staff person loretta neumann the hearings and further staff investigations brought forth a great many details of concern and the bill provisions represent an effort to deal with these matters while i believe that both the bill and the committee report quite comprehensively address most matters related to the rebuilding there are a number of matters which i believe deserve further comment a significant concern has developed with regard to possible extraneous noise intrusion problems coming upon the center and adversely affecting the performances emanating from the nearby dulles road corriderairport access and yettobe constructed toll road in order to minimize that type of problem and also to minimize the extent and cost of mitigation effort to be undertaken by the highway interests it is crucially important that the site chosen for the reconstruction of the center be located in the best location within the park to separate it as far as possible from highway noise several alternate locations have been considered but the long favored choice of the foundation is to return to the original site some 300 feet from the existing highway corridor the alternate sites are farther distance from the corr dor there has been some concern that the foundation may desire a return to the original site more on a basis of sentiment than on a basis of it factually representing the best choice with regard to the most freedom from extraneous noise conflict it is crucially important that the federal investment here be amply protected by assuring that the most noisefree site be chosen unless the difference from other sites is only marginally better and or other factors such as increased cost strongly override such a choice the language of the bill section 4 d which gives final reconstruction decisions to the secretaryparticularly as to location and designwas strengthened by the full committee to emphasize this very concern and the feeling of the committee is strong and absolute that the secretary fully and purposefully exercise his authority here to assure that the final decision as to location and design for the center is made by him with total assurance that it is in the best interests of maximum reduced conflict with extraneous noise and maximum beneficial internal acoustical properties it well may be necessary for even more noise measurements analysis and evaluations to be made beyond those already completed in order to totally assure the proper conclusion as to the best location and design the department of transportation and the federal aviation administration should check this matter very closely as well as their interests have much at stake in the final center location and design decisions they will have to arrange and pay for necessary mitigation from unacceptable noise and they should help assure the minimization of such potential conflict and difficulties by assuring that the final reconstruction site is the best correlated to minimal noise conflict the final point i wish to make has to do with the cooperative relationship between the national park service and the wolf trap foundation which is so essential for the optimum operation of the overall park the bill provides for a cooperative agreement to constitute the basic document for setting forth this relationship and such an agreement is already in place at the moment and is working among other essential ingredients it is important that any new agreement address such subjects as both entities keeping each other totally informed of the others septemberf0 1982 planned public activities for the park in a timely manner the disposition and handling of food service and similar typically concession type operations the responsibility of all operational costs for all aspects of the park and the proper financial separation of the foundations parkrelated operations from its nonpark operations as it relates to the overall wolf trap farm park operation in regard to the latter it is important that the foundations operation of nonpark properties such as the barns be properly financially and otherwise separated from its governmentrelated wolf trap farm park operations to the extent there are current questions or problems related to these types of matters the current cooperative agreement should possibly be amended as i have already said i believe this is a good and responsible bill i urge my colleagues to lend their support to its adoption by the house i

privileged to chair filed its final report on the deaths of president john f kennedy and dr martin luther king jr at the time most peoples attention was focused on our conclusions that these two men most likely died as a result of conspiracies in fact our work went well beyond the conspiracy question and we made a series of important legislative and administrative recommendations it is in light of those recommendations that i now rise to introduce along with my colleagues mr edgar mr ford of tennessee mr fithian mr mokinney and mr fatyntroy the violence control act of i know that you do not need to be reminded that this sunday will mar the 18th anniversary of president kennedys assassination sorely a pivotal event in american history more than any single murder since that event changed our world and our perception of it though others were victims of brutal homicides in the following years that murder uniquely made america seem less green less full of promise less full of hope for it seemed as if amer ica lost its youth when the young president died it is ironic too that a child born on that tragic day in dallas would be 18 years old this sundayan adult in americas eyesold enough to vote and participate in a responsible way in the public aspects of our life in common in what sort of world has that child become an adult sadly it is increasingly a world more violent than the day on which he was born in 1960 thrs nation suffered 9 000 murders by 1980 that figure had risen to 23 000an increase of inore than 156 percent though our general population had grown but 22 percent while it is of course true that the violence prone age bracket15 to 24increased faster than the general population oier those years the increase was only 72 percent the increase in violence that our society has experienced over the past 20 years is not some statistical mirage as some editorial writers or academicians would have us believe it is all to real for all too many people in fact the data showing an increaseobtained independently from police and coroner recordsunderstate the true extent of violence for a remarkable improvement has taken place over these years in the quality of emergency medical treatm~ent and facilities particularly in urban areas many attacks that would have been murders yesterday go down as aggravated assaults today witness only one recent examplethe shooting of presidential press secretary james brady twenty years ago it is unlikely that he would have survived these homicide statistics therefore document only part of the tragedy of violence in our society today in 1960 this nation saw 150 000 aggravated assaults by 1980 the figure has risen to 650 000an increase of more than 330 percent the impact of this rise in personnel violence has been repeatedly documented a recent national survey found that 4 out of 10 americans were highly fearful and felt unsafe in their own homes at about the time of the assassination attempt on president reagans life a harris survey showcd a dramatic rise in the number of americans who felt that the crime rate in their area was increasing with 68 percent saying that crime was on the upswing compared to only 46 percent saying so in 1978 additionally 48 percent of the adult population reported that they personally feel uneasy not only in their hones but on the public streets up from 40 percent who felt that way in 1978 the american people too express a sense of futility with law enforcement they feel according to the harris survey a growing sense that the present system of law enforcement does not discourage criminal activity a viewv now held by a shocking 79 percent of adults nationwide and the peoples perception is not wholly wrong the statistics show a steady decline in the percentage of all offenses that the police feel they solve through arrest that parallels the increase in the volume of offenses murder clearance rates for example have dropped from 92 percent in 1960 to 73 percent in 1973 aggravated assault rates from 76 to 59 percent the police are in short being overwhelmed by volume and the people are being left helpless and frustrated there are other more personal ways of stating the stark facts an american male born today is more likely to die by murder than an american soldier in world war 11 was to die in combat in fact 1 out of 186 live born white males are expected to be murder victims in their lifetime murder is the leading cause of death for black males age 15 to 24 in fact 1 out of 29 live born nonwhite males will be murdered in their lifetime a particularly disturbing aspect of the violence that has characterized our society in recent years is assassinations not only of political leaders but also of public figures in the 150 years since 1835 when richard lawrences pistol misfired as he shot at president andrew jackson there were 12 attacks on presidents or presidential candidates four presidents were killedlincoln garfield mckinley and kennedyi out of every 10 men to have held that high office in the first 100 years there were 15 attacks in the past 50 years there were 7 attacks since 1963 there were six attacks indeed three o ut of the last six presidents have been the targets of assassins and onepresident fordwas attacked twice it we look beyond the office of the presidency and include attacks on public figuresmen such as dr martin luther king jr malcolm x john lennon and most recently vernon jordan jr it appears that we are running an assassination attempt rate of at least one per year how long our social fabric can withstand the pressures that these attacks create only history will tell what i do know is that assassination is more than a deadly assault on another human being as our final report observed of an assassination it is an attack on the foundations of democracymajority rule due process of law consensual decisionmaking individual rights and liberties it undermines the political system by deterring qualified people from seeking public office or exercising leadership it produces fear among the citizenry a seige mentality and often leads to the creation of vigilante groups civil disorder and other counterterrorist activities i we must be frank with one another and with our constituents there is not a great deal that law enforcement can do directly to control personal violence murder and aggravated assault are largely societal problems beyond the direct control of governments fiftytwo percent of the victims of murder in 1979 were acquainted with their assailants and 1 out of 5 were related by blood or marriage to the offender fortytwo percent of the murders grew out of arguments over romantic triangles alcohol or drug property or money or similar issues only 22 2 percent of the murders were in fact felony homicides that is murders committed usually between strangers during the course of other crimes such as robbery narcotic dealings or sex offenses no system of law enforcement can protect individuals from their family and friends we know too that highmurder rates are significantly correlated with the presence of illiteracy young males without education broken homes with female heads of households and poverty increased education more stable family life and increased and more meaningful jobs will in short do more to lower the murder rate than criminal legislation of any kind that too is a fact we must be frank on another score the federal government does not and cannot be expected to play a large role in controlling that part of violence on which law enforcement can have a direct impact historically the federal government has not had jurisdiction over commonlaw type offensesmurder aggravated assault rape robbery and the like and the federal government does not have the personnel to do much more than it is doing now currently it employs 75 000 persons and spends 1 9 billion in the law enforcement prosecution courts and correction areas yet state and local governments employ more than 620 000 persons and spend more than 11 1 billion in similar efforts were all of the federal effort in short focused in this area and none of its uniquely federal responsibilities were met it is doubtful therefore that its impact would significantly increase the level of public safety iv recognizing our limits and the limits of law itself is not to counsel despair or inaction we must do what we can dean roscoe pound of the harvard law school identified the four chief factors influencing the quality of american justice as personnel administration procedure and the substantive law it is evident too as pound conlcuded that these factors must be ranked in that same oider of relative importance personnel and administration have been left to others our job therefore must be to guarantee that procedural and substantive law are the best that can be fashioned by the minds and hands of creative men and women it is in that spirit that my colleagues and i are introducing today the violence control act of my colleagues and i are introducing this legislation as a study bill none of us are necessarily committed to any provision of the bill as presently drafted it is introduced to serve as a vehicle on which to hold hearings i am hopeful however that when hearings are held that a consensus will emerge on the issues raised by the bill and that legislation will quickly reach president reagans desk for his signature following the recommendations of the select committee title i of the proposed legislation codifies and reforms the law of federally cognizable personal violence title i draws on the work of a number of distinguished groups including the american law institute and the national commission on the reform of federal criminal law in addition it draws on the able work already done in the house and senate in the past 10 years or more to codify revise and reform the federal criminal law it has long been suggested that the federal criminal law is in need of a thorough reorganization unfortunately our criminal statutes are currently spread in haphazard fashion through most of the 50 titles of the united states code and in many cases they are conflicting contradictory and imprecise the result is that there is not only confusion but there are illogical and often unfair discrepancies present in the application of the law over 10 years ago congress called for a complete reexamination of the federal criminal justice system and after years of hearings studies and successive bills this congress is again working on revising the criminal code with s 1630 which has the administrations support h r 4711 introduced by congressman conyers and h r 1847 1 am hopeful that the legislation i introduce today with my colleagues can be considered along with or in addition to the major codification efforts for if the general codification effort again becomes mired in controversy i would hope this much needed legislation can be processed separately title i of the proposed act also faces the delicate issue of capital punishment and resolves it not by increasing the level of violence in our society by state sanctioned deaths but by authorizing a new concept of imprisonment in federal law life without release only the presidents constitutional power to pardon could serve as an avenue of release for a person convicted of murder title ii draws on other recommendations of the select committee some of its more important provisions wouldmandate contingency planning by the department of justic6 to deal with assassinations authorize federal autopsies and create trusts for victims of federally cognizable violence this last provision requires particularly close study testimony before the select committee indicated that efforts were made to insulate the widow of dr martin luther king jr from the funds james earl ray hoped to realize from the sale of media rights to the facts around the assassination to deal with just that sort of reprehensible conduct a number of states12 at last counthave moved in the last 4 years or so to discourage profiteering by criminals through the sale of their life stories they have taken as their lead the principle followed in riggs against palmer an 1889 new york decision in which the court ob~served no one should be permitted to profit by his own fraud or to take advantage of his own wrong 0 or to acquire property by his own crime these maxims are dictated by ruablic policy and have their foundation in universal law administered by all civilized countries i recognize of course that criticisms have been leveled at these laws on the first amendment grounds that they are an impermissible burden on the free speech rights of criminals nevertheless i am hopeful that the hearing process will be able to develop some workable compromise in this area between the rights of the wrongdoer and his victims title iii of the proposed legislation goes beyond the recommendations of the select committee the need for it however is dramatically illustrated by the attack on president reagan on march 30 here in washington john hinckley jr shot at the president gravely wounding the presidents press secretary and seriously wounding mr reagan and others as i previously noted it was only good luck and a fine hospital facility so close at hand that prevented the nation from losing another president to the bullets of an assassin john hinckley is of course now standing trial in the district of columbia and his attorneys have been seeking to have him found not guilty by reason of insanity nothing that i say here today should be construed as an effort to affect those proceedings but should hinckley go free i note that he will still have to receive under federal law applicable to the district of columbia medical treatment in the form of therapy butand this is my pointhad hinckley shot at president reagan in alexandria va and been found not guilty by reason of insanity in a federal trial for the attack he could have just walked out of the door of the courtroom and never have to receive therapy as hard as it might seem to believe there is in fact no general provision of federal law applicable outside of the district of columbia requiring that those found not guilty by reason of insanity in federal courts undergo medical treatment richard lawrence as i noted earlier fired at andrew jackson in 1835 and was committed to a hospital where he remained until his death in 1881 john schrank a saloon keeper shot theodore roosevelt during a campaign visit to milwaukee in 1912 and was committed to a hospital where he remained until his death in 1943 nevertheless congress had never moved to guarantee that this procedure must be followed in all cases i believe we have waited too long to remedy this defect title iv of the proposed legislation also goes beyond the recommendations of the select committee i expect too that it will be controversial for it makes provisions for the registration and licensing of handguns while this provisionmodeled after legislation supported in the senate by senator ted kennedywas not considered by the select committee it mayr well be the most significant part of the proposerl legislation i over the past two decades firearms have consistently been the weapon of choice in more than 60 percent of the homicides handguns have been the weapon of choice in more than 50 percent of the killings presidential or other federal groups or commissionsat least seven in numberhave repeatedly called for strict handgun controlthe national commission for criminal justice standards and goals the commission on crime in the district of columbia the commission on law enforcement and administration of justice the commission on cause and prevention of violence the national advisory commission on civil disorders the national commission on the reform of federal criminal law and most recently the attorney generals task force on violent crime those who oppose meaningful restraints on the use of handguns rely on six tired arguments that are almost as old as the republic first opponents of handgun control insist their right to bear arms is rooted in the constitution the argument is then extended to claim that gun control deprives them of their right to pursue happiness with guns free of government limits but in fact the courts have said that the constitution does not interfere with the power of the government to regulate deadly weapons since we mean to enact legislation that will halt the abuse of the handguns of those who find happiness in such weapons they will just have to subordinate that pleasure to the right of all americans to live free from the death and violence that the american gun mania has brought us second many people make the argument that because lawless citizens will feel no obligation to be bound by gun laws gun controls will simply disarm those who abide by the law i am convinced however that strict enforcement of licensing and registration laws will serve to isolate precisely those individuals who flaunt the law and subject them to prosecution for gun violations before they commit other crimes with their guns third critics of gun control insist that laws cannot control access to guns yet the records show that even the limited provisions of the 1968 gun control act have severely altered the flow of one kind of weaponthe imported handgun in addition the national firearms act of 1934 essentially eliminated civilian access to machineguns sawed off rifles and shotguns mufflers and silencers gun control in short is in fact possible fourth a common refrain against handgun control is that guns dont kill people do but a careful examination of the statistics tells us that it is when guns are in hand that twothirds of the people who attack each other act in a deadly fashion for rarely does an attacker make a deliberate c4 oice of a gun over a knife because the fatality rate of knife wounds is about onefifth that of gun wounds using a knife instead of a gun might well cause 80 percent fewer deaths attacks may not decline but deadly attacks surely will fifth modern critics of gun control express outrage at the vaulting gun crime rate insisting that we do not need more gun laws instead they say we should enact longterm mandatory penalties for crimes committed with guns even if our penal system were not already overcrowded this proposal could be counted upon to produce undesirable results penalties do not deter an angry person from reaching for a gun and if penalties were in fact made much stronger the extra punishment might well encourage the armed robber to leave no witnesses thus it is likely that high mandatory penalties would in fact cause more gun deaths than they would prevent sixth the greatest number of those who protect gun control legislation apparently believe that the administrative requirements for registration would be too cumbersome and inconvenient such requirements are thought to be unfair and punitive in that the persons really affected so adversely are law abiding citizens who pursue shooting as a hobby or as a form of recreation to these people i can only say how thoughtless you are when you value your own inconvenience over the lives of others this recitation of the arguments on handgun control includes the core of the objections vehemently raised and expertly used by the national rifle association and other gun advocates to force the justice department and the department of the treasury to turn the current administrations attention away from serious efforts to do something about violence but i say that if there is any issue that congress understands it is the matter of strong handgun laws each member of the house is awareor ought to be awarethat seven commissions or national study groups have recommended stronger gun laws to reduce gun killing in 1966 the commission on civil disorders recommended that all state and local governments should enact gun control legislation the final report asserted thatwe believe that federal legislation is essential in order to make state and local laws fully effective and to regulate areas beyond the reach of state government in february 1967 the commission on law enforcement and administration of justice reported that strict controls by state or city are nullified when a potential criminal can secure a firearm merely by going into a neighboring jurisdiction with few controls or none at all in 1968 the commission on the causes and prevention of violence concluded that the only sure way to reduce gun violence is to reduce sharp ly the number of handguns in civilian hands in this country we recognize this will be a massive and expensive task but the price is one that we should be prepared to pay in 1971 the commission on reform of federal criminal laws called fora ban on the production and possession of and trafficking in handguns with exceptions only for military police and similar official activities and registration of all firearms in 1973 in its report to president nixon the national advisory commission on criminal standards and goals recommended that each state take the following action the private possession of handguns should be prohibited for all persons other than law enforcement and military personnel manufacture and sale of handguns should be terminated existing handguns should be acquired by states handguns held by private citizens as collectors items should be modified and rendered inoperative most recently the attorney generals task force on violent crime called for stricter handgun controls how long are we going to lack the courage to do that we know is right i hopenot long i ask unanimous consent to include the following materials in the record at this point first a sectionbysection analysis of the act second four

difficult and critical problem facing the united states the decline in productivity growth i said then that congress had to focus its efforts on putting the puzzle together and launching a comprehensive strategy to improve productivity although productivity was at that time already a buzzword on capitol hill little was being done about it and the outlook was not encouraging unfortunately i am afraid the same can be said today there has been so much talk on the subject of productivity that perhaps it is worth reminding ourselves why prompt action in this area is so important as i see it there are at least four reasons why improved productivity must be a top priority for the federal government first and foremost i believe productivity is the neglected longterm key to our fight against inflation it is obvious that when the costs of labor raw materials and physical plant increase those higher costs will be translated entirely into higher prices for goods and servicesunless productivity is improved the second point is closely related low productivity growth is contributing to the weakening of the dollar by reducing the competitive edge of american products and thereby undermining the balance of trade third steady productivity growth is important to expanding employment here the relationship is perhaps less obvious and may contradict the assumption among rmany people that productivity simply means fewer people doing the same amount of work but as we should learn from the current discussions of supplyside economics more costeffective production is the key to business expansion and thus to expanded employment finally these benefits add up to a social or political argument for a strong productivity policy as we have progressed through successive antiinflation policies in the last few years americans have been asked repeatedly to make sacrifices i believe the country is willing to make those sacrifices but only if there is a visible and realistic path toward improvement ahead to date there has not been a comprehensive and coherent policy for improving productivity can provide that crucial glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel when i addressed the house a year ago on this subject the economic report of the president for 1980 had just been released that report was rather fatalistic on the question of productivity since it is difficult to identify a single cause for a slowdown in productivity growth the report declared the immediate prospects for improvement in productivity are not good the attitude of mr carters council of economic advisors eventually improved the final economic report of president carter released in january abandons last years gloomy prognosis and asserts unequivocally that a program to stimulate productivity growth must be a keystone of economic policy intentions however have yet to be transformed into reality the sad fct is that there is no federal program to foster productivity improvement several federal activities scattered among various agencies and amounting to more than 2 billion do contribute to private sector productivity but the closest the federal government has come to establishing a productivity program which might coordinate these disparate activities and set clear productivity improvement goals is a deservedly obscure entity known as the national productivity council established by president carter under an executive order in october 1978 the record of that productivity council is a travesty upon its very name since 1978 the council has convened on exactly four occasions and has garnered a barely fulltime staff of two people with no funding last year i characterized the council as an interagency group which rarely meets and accomplishes little this year i am spared the embarrassment of repeating myself since the general accounting office in a thorough evaluation which has just been released has provided its own assessment the gao notes that the key responsibilities assigned by the president to the productivity council were first coordinating and supervising productivity activities throughout the federal government second identifying for the president and the congress key issues pertaining to productivity improvement and third serving as a focal point within the executive branch for productivity issues with special liaison to business labor and academic leaders on this subject the gao report concludes that the national productivity council has not effectively accomplished any of these functions in other words as a government and as a nation we have been wasting our timetime which we cannot afford to lose the councils inactivity has coincided with a 2year period of national productivity declineonly the secondand now the longestsuch period since world war ii the councils poor performance would be less discouraging if it were an isolated event unfortunately it is the fifth unsuccessful productivity group to be formed at the federal level in the past decade against that background of past failure i welcome president reagans determination to make a fresh start i am particularly pleased that the president has given productivity a high priority in his recent statements and i look forward to working with him toward that end i am today reintroducing legislation which i first offered a year ago which would create a statutory visible fully funded and fully staffed national productivity council this proposed council is fashioned upon recommendations of the general accounting office and i believe it can succeed where its forerunners have failed this council would be assigned specific and important responsibilities which the gao has concluded on the basis of its past experience will be essential to a successful federal productivity effort these responsibilities will include first the formulation and annual revision of a national productivity improvement plan second analysis of those federal activities which hinder or encourage improved productivity in the private sector third legislative and regulatory recommendatiods to the congress for enhanced productivity fourth consultation with representatives of business labor and academic institutions on the subject of productivity improvement and fifth coordination of various federal activities related to productivity why do we need this council above all because when we have 2 billion worth of independently evolved programs affecting productivity we need to have some coordination of them we need to analyze the effectiveness of our total effort to assess where the gaps are in that effort and to discover what more could be done for example in its recent report the gao found that current federal expenditures in the area of productivity were not evenly distributed among activities related to productivity less than 2 percent is spent for improving human resources through programs for skill training hiproved labor mobility job security and labormanagement cooperation the report found i believe that an active forceful and respected national productivity council could help to redress such imbalances by calling them to our attention and by suggesting corrective measures the council could similarly restore a balanced perspective to the current obsession with business investment as the total cure for lagging productivity certainly increased capital formation is an important component of any effort to improve productivity but investment alone is not the answera fact which we are in danger of forgettiog today we are poised on the brink of accepting a multibilliondollar tax cut for accelerated business depreciation which has been promoted as a panacea for declining productivity growth yet as even business weeks analyses have shown the capital cost recovery act has a highly differentiated effect on various industrial sectorssome benefit greatly others benefit very little as we well know there is already a considerable range of productivity growth rates within the private sector the proposed tax benefits of the 1053 legislation do not always correspond to the sectors in need as pat choate and gail schwartz point out in a recent book on sectoral revitalization we need to know whether acrosstheboard tax incentives would encourage the flow of capital into those vital industries that need it the most in order to modernize and ultimately become more productive the historical precedents would suggest the opposite faced with such crucial policy dilemmas i am convinced the existence of a professional national productivity council could be extremely helpful we need a neutral third party whose sole concern is the federal impact on productivity and to whom we can turn for reliable advice in short we need an unrelenting spokesman who will keep the issue of productivity uppermost in our minds and make us aware of how federal policies affect it there is of course considerable hostility today toward any proposal to create a new government organization not surprisingly some of that antagonism was directed last year toward my proposal for a new productivity council let me assure those critics that i share their skepticism and their concern about government bureaucracy moreover i fully acknowledge that the crucial decisions affecting productivity growth will be made in the private sector nevertheless we must face the fact that we live in a mixed economy and that a federal government which spends more than 22 percent of gross national product and whose taxing and regulatory policies broadly affect the private economy ought to have some agency within it that attends to the nations no 1 economic problem governments of other industrialized nations such as japan and west germany are much more involved with labor and business in developing a consensus policy for maintaining high productivity growth we would do well to take our cue from their success my proposal for a statutory productivity council would not add to the burden of government but rather would respond to a serious weakness in governmental performance as the recent gao report noted all key economic decisionmakers in recent years have recognized the importance of productivity growth to our economic strength yet when economic policies are made productivity concerns seem to be given low priority the new productivity council would not be an economic deci sionmaker but would participate in economic and budgetary decisionmaking to ensure the presence of a productivity perspective naturally some members will not be persuaded that spending 5 million on a productivity council to oversee 2 billion in current productivity programs is a worthwhile investment to these colleagues let me offer a more compelling costbenefit analysis as a 1978 report of the council on wage and price stability observed the effect of slow productivity growth since 1967 has been to reduce total real incomes by some 20 percentmore than 300 billionfrom what they would have been if the pre1967 productivity growth rate had been sustained clearly we cannot afford not to invest in a more productive future last summer the retiring chairman of the house subcommittee on economic stabilization scheduled 4 days of hearingswhich i chairedon the problem of lagging productivity growth and what the federal government should do about it in my opinion those hearings were very useful in sharpening our understanding of this issue in particular they reinforced my conviction that something like a statutory productivity council is needed in the executive branch i would like to take a few moments to share with my colleagues some highlights from those hearings which in my view strengthen the case for the legislation which i am reintroducing today during the initial hearing testimony was given by an associate director of the office of management and budget omb on behalf of the current productivity council ombs presentation revealed a startling devaluation of the productivity problem high inflation and energy problems which dominated the 1970s omb testified must be solved before the productivity growth rate can be restored to its previous level when during quistioning of the witnesses i suggested that this statement reflected a disturbingly passive approach to the productivity issue 0mb simply reaffirmed its view that productivity growth will result when the economic policiesof the administrationtake hold this determination to put the cart before the horse says a good deal about why the existing productivity council has been such an abysmal failure most experts in this field i think would agree that lagging productivity growth is a major component of inflation rather than the other way around no productivity council worthy of the name can succeed when it is a captive of ombs perspective on this point one of our subsequent witnesses economist lester thurow from the massachusetts institute of technology saw the issue much more clearly productivity is obviously the countrys number one problem when productivity is going downhill it doesnt make any difference what is happening to inflation or enemployment you are going to have an economy thats going downhill although the public opinion polls havent put productiv ity in the number one slot 1 think the congress ought to put it in the number one slot at one point in the discussion i asked mr thurow whether he thought the united states would benefit from some kind of independent group that might be perceived as a little less partisanthan the congresssuch as a national economic commission or a national productivity council professor thurow largely concurred i certainly think there is a lot of value in information especially in the productivity area productivity is one of those kind of background things whiph doesnt make the headlines well we are not going to address the productivity problem until the american people in fact decide that it is an important problem that they have to address one of the traditional barriers to productivity efforts on a national level has been the opposition from many sectors of the labor movement which feared from past experiences that productivity was just another name for speedup or reduced labor force thus some of the most instructive and encouraging testimony received by our subcommittee came from mr donald ephlin a vice president of the united auto workers in his opening statement mr ephlin underscored his own unions willingness to tackle a tough issue we recognize that the only reliable basis for improving the purchasing power and access to leisure of american workers is the increase in the economys capacity to convert a given amount and intensity of work into ever more output in keeping with that recognition the uaw has explicity pledged not to oppose the introduction of productivityenhancing laborsaving technological advances on the specific subject of my legislation to create a statutory productivity council mr ephlin observed that the uaw is in strong support of objectives mr ephlin went on to make a crucial point with respect to a productivity councils potential effectiveness the national productivity improvement plan that the council is directed to develop will not be regarded as authoritative and viable unless it incorporates the agenda of labor and business by including them in the proposed council a tripartite committee would be created the parties would have the opportunity and the responsibility to find a common ground between often conflicting sets of goals as a public official who has been involved in the labormanagement cooperation movement for many years i have seen what it can achieve in the area of productivity and i wholeheartedly agree with mr ephlins tripartite proposal the legislation i am introducing today does create an advisory board to the productivity council whose members are to be selected entirely from individuals with experience in business labor and academics the bill does not take the further step of placing such individuals on the council itself but i am quite open to that possibility and will be exploring that alternative structure in the weeks ahead appearing on the same panel with mr ephin dr richard rahn vice president of the unitedstates chamber of commerce endorsed the same notion of tripartite communication among business labor and government but added i dont think there is a need for a formal government intervention in this process fortunately not all of the probusiness community seems to feel the same hesitation for example the american enterprise institutes committee to fight inflation chaired by former federal reserve board chairman arthur burns recently issued a ninepoint antiinflation plan i was pleased to note that in one of those points the committee urged congress and the president to actively encourage labormanagement councils in individual shops offices and stores throughout the country so that workers and managers will jointly seek ways of improving productivity perhaps the most persuasive testimony from any witness last summer was the presentation from the american productivity center this private nonprofit organization based in houston tex has done pioneering work with numerous businesses to improve productivity the organization is chaired by c jackson grayson former head of southern methodist universitys business school and was represented at last summers hearings by one of its directors mr william usery former secretary of labor mr usery had this to say on the productivity council legislation which i am sponsoring although i and the american productivity center believe that h r 6462 may not go far enough in its particulars we believe it is a most important step toward a firm commitment by our government to improve productivity efforts within the private sector have proved successful but are limited by the relative absence of government commitment to implementing solutions one might expect a private organization like the american productivity center to dismiss a government productivity group as intrusive and unnecessary on the contrary however mr usery explained in some detail the benefits which the center anticipates would result from a federally formulated productivity improvement plan the federal government would be helping to bring together elements of the business labor and government communities such a friendly meeting of the minds would be beneficial to america and certainly beneficial to productivity the concept of a national productivity policy has many advantages over other economic measures we have already tried other measures such as cutbacks controls regulation spending subsidies protectionism the result has been in most cases a failure a successful productivity program promises to avoid the problems inherent in these other actions no one expects that a national pro ductivity council by itself will reverse the deceleration in americas productivity growth productivity is an enormously complex issueone which must be addressed simultaneously on several fronts certainly the diverse testimony we heard last summer confirmed that point but paradoxically a productivity council might help us make some progress by reminding us of that very complexityby insuring that congress does not attempt to solve our productivity problems by seizing upon on simplistic cure in my statement on productivity a year ago i outlined four general areas each encompassing several policy issues where i thought our efforts could be profitably focused first improving the use of human resources second enhancing capital formation third expanding the commercialization of advances in knowledge innovation and fourth reforming the regulatory process i can only look back over those remarks today with acute frustration if a national productivity council were monitoring congressional progress in these areas we would not receive high marks for achievement during the past year in the absence of that kind of thirdparty neutral assessment let me take my remaining time this afternoon to list some of the legislative objectives which remain unfulfilled i will not take time as i did last year to discuss these measurses relevance to productivity but i do believe each item forms a part of the puzzle"],

competition from foreign uranium imports i do not believe that section 23 could accomplish what its sponsors apparently hope for it is not addressed to the root causes of the domestic uranium industrys problem while it is true that foreign uranium enjoys a natural competitive advantage over domestic uranium the fundamental reason for the current de pressed state of the uranium industry is the decline in demand for electricity in the past nuclear plant owners such as tva have been large purchasers of uranium faced with declining demand for electricity and the increasingly prohibitive costs of building nuclear plants tva and other electric systems have canceled many nuclear plants in the last few years in addition many of these electric systems already had purchased substantial amounts of uranium to fuel these now canceled plants and simply do not need to purchase more uranium at the present time for example in 1973 tva believed that it would need 86 million pounds of uranium between 1979 and 1990 to fuel its projected 17 nuclear generating unaits during the seventies tva purchased less than half of that amount canceled or indefinitely deferred plans to build eight of these units and now has a uranium inventory and supplies under contract sufficient to last it at least until 1988 many of the nations other electric systems are in a similar position section 23 does not address nor could it provide any remedy for the overall decline in uranium demand to the extent that foreign competition is garnering an increasing share of the meager domestic uranium market it is doing so because of its natural competitive advantages many foreign uranium ore bodies contain high quality easily accessible reserves which cost far less to mine than uranium found in this country for example a good unitedstates mine produces 3 to 4 pounds of uranium concentrate per ton of ore mined whereas the ore bodies in saskatchewan average approximately 27 pounds of uranium per ton of ore the response proposed by section 23 to this natural competitive advantage is both inequitable and shortsighted it is inequitable because it will have a disproportionate impact on electricity consumers across the nation for the past decade those consumers have borne the burden of everincreasing fuel costs and dramatically higher electric rates electric systems have a responsibility to turn to the lowest priced uranium availablewhich may well be lowcost foreign uranium reserves when section 23 makes it impossible for electric systems to purchase these foreign reserves their consumers will have to pay the penalty in even higher electric rates further uranium producers have claimed that the formation of the international uranium cartel in 1972 was encouraged by this kind of domestic industry protection policy tva and its electricity consumers were significantly injured by that cartel and have taken the lead in suing its members for their antitrust violations we do not think that uranium producers should now have section 23 as an excuse to repeat that history the approach taken by section 23 also appears shortsighted from a national security standpoint after all uranium is not a renewable resource by forcing electric systems to purchase domestic uranium section 23 simply would implement a deplete america first policy in addition the largest bodies of lowcost foreign uranium resources are heavily concentrated in countries which are our current alliesaustralia and canada no one can say with certainty however what the future will bring after we have used up domestic resources and are forced inevitably to turn to foreign sources for supply for example we already have seen australias labor government preclude development of uranium mining during the midseventies and canada has implemented a policy to insure that the needs of its own utilities are met first before uranium is exported thus the united states might well be better protected in the long run without any limitations on current purchases of foreign uranium i urge my colleagues to support the action to strike section 23 e"], [0.003268718719482422,

voluntarily a place of employment he is not qualified for unemployment compensation benefits yet if section 2405 stays in this bill we are going to treat the serviceman differently than the private employee by allowing him unemployment compensation benefits when he voluntarily leaves the service it is bad policy to create this difference in treatment when we used to have draftees i guess one could rationalize the law being that way on the grounds that we were involuntarily plucking a man or woman out of their employment and putting them in the service of their country and perhaps we should do something for them when they leave we do not have that anymore now we have a voluntary military people go into the military knowing they are going to leave at a certain time most of them are
