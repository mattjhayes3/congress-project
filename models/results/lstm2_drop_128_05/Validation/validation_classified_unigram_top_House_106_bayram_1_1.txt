and voluntary for all seniors and against the bill the leadership has brought to the floor today the democratic plan will provide a meaningful prescription benefit that is available to all seniors

seniors to reduce costs through competition and it will help low and middleincome seniors afford prescription medicine i am particularly pleased that the democratic plan contains an amendment i suggested which will ensure that the medicare prescription drug benefit will fit within a fiscally responsible budget specifically the democratic plan requires that we stay on a course to take the medicaid trust fund off budget and eliminate the debt held by the public by 2012 in addition despite what some of my colleagues on the other side have stated the democratic plan would provide a catastrophic benefit in 2003 if congress and the president work together to enact reforms to strengthen and modernize medicare several supporters of h r 4860 have said we need to reform medicare but unlike the democratic plan h r 4860 does not call for action on medicare reform relying on private sector plans to deliver prescription drug coverage as h r 4860 would do will not provide a meaningful benefit which is available to all seniors including those in rural areas it will not be cost effective for private plans to offer coverage in rural areas which will result in expensive government subsidies to attract plans to rural areas rural seniors should not be forced to pay higher premiums or have less generous benefits simply because they live in areas that are not financially attractive to private insurance companies i am not hostile to private sector solutions but we understand the role of the private sector is to make a profit meanwhile the role of the government is to provide benefits in situations of great need that go unanswered by business over the past decade crop insurance for farmers has shown not only that private insurance sometimes fails to provide a guaranteed safety net in necessary situations but also that it can become enormously costly even though the republicans prescription drug bill is tallied at 40 billion today i have no doubt that just like crop insurance its costs would multiply many many time as we have to come back to provide higher and higher subsidies over the coming years and still seniors would be left without the guarantee of prescription drug coverage seniors deserve certainty about getting help with their prescription drugs they deserve to be treated equally regardless of whether they live in rural communities like my district or big cities like dallas they deserve to have their government supporting them with their most basic life needs they deserve to have a medicare program which is modernized in a way that

same republican voices were being raised in this room maybe not the same individuals but the same philosophy and they said just extend the welfare program and take care of those most in need they were opposed to medicare in fact you remember it was only a short while ago that bob dole was bragging about how he was one of a few people to stand up and oppose medicare and speaker newt gingrich was in this very room and he was boasting of the need to let medicare wither on the vine they do not really believe in medicare and this is a way to start the concept that we just need a welfare plan for those most in need i think medicare and social security have been two of the best programs this congress has ever devised under democratic leadership over republican opposition and over continued republican efforts to undermine those programs i believe if we go with a welfare program for prescription drugs that is really what the focus will be the second very important point the gentleman

thank the gentleman for taking the time today and giving the blue dog democrats and perhaps others hopefully on both sides of the aisle the opportunity to engage in this debate before we get into the political debate of tomorrow it is difficult to be perceived as being against a tax cut particularly when you agree that the marriage tax penalty should be corrected but it is not difficult to oppose a bill that not only corrects the marriage tax penalty but also gives a marriage bonus to those that are currently getting a bonus i am sure in the limited time tomorrow we will not have an opportunity to fully debate that but the real purpose for which we take this hour today is to talk about why paying down the debt should be the number one priority for this congress and why some of us on this side of the aisle feel so strongly that not following the regular order of determining the priorities of the congress is a drastic fiscal mistake we now have the opportunity to pay down this debt we all talk about if and this is one of the big questions if the projected surpluses materialize that is why we and the blue dogs have been saying now for quite some time let us not spend projected surpluses as if they are real money surpluses that may or may not occur in 2007 2008 2009 2010 is that conservatism are we going to go back to the same fiscal policies that we followed in the 1980s when we borrowed over 3 trillion pursuing a fiscal policy that did not quite work out unless you perceive that borrowing money by the federal government taking that money away from the private sector is a good investment we do not we happen to believe that paying down the debt and the fact we are now going to be in our third year of seeing our federal debt that which the federal government is borrowing be reduced is good fiscal policy and has contributed to the fact that we now have the longest single economic recovery period in the history of our country economic expansion that unemployment has now hit and gone below 4 percent that we have more people working in america than at any other time in the history of our country we think that is the result of something that we have been doing right and that is that we have been living since 1993 on a course that has gotten us into the position now of actually being able to debate what we are going to do with projected surpluses to those that suggest that we start out with a tax cut you are in fact saying that the plight of rural hospitals is of secondary importance the fact that we have over 250 representatives from rural communities all over the united states in washington as i speak begging us for additional investment in hospital care in rural areas that that is of secondary importance and we are not even going to discuss that until later and perhaps never get there because when you make the argument of a 1 3 trillion tax cut you will find there is no money available in the budget for additional investments and needed investments in any program to those that suggest that we should start with a tax cut you are saying that we do not need to invest any further in the defense capabilities of this country that thereis no need for us to do anything but freeze defense spending for the next 10 years at current levels and anyone knows what that will do to the ability of the united states to defend ourselves against what might happen in the next 10 years why are we not debating what the priority investments should be along with how we shall deal with our tax code it is no secret we have real problems in rural america in the farming sector the president has proposed putting into the budget debate an investment an expenditure if you please of taxpayer dollars should that not be debated and if the majority of this house feels that is not a prudent investment have it voted down should that not be considered in the budget process when we talk about spending we have those that believe and sincerely believe that all federal spending almost is a waste of money they choose to close their eyes to the fact that we the congress in a bipartisan way over the last 4 5 or 6 years have done a pretty darn good job of restraining discretionary spending a pretty darn good job can we do better yes should we do better absolutely but can we do it in a way in which we say we are going to freeze and continue cutting in the area of defense of agriculture of health care i repeat if we cannot find it in our wisdom to recognize that rural areas are being substantially penalized to the degree that we will have to close hospital after hospital after hospital unless we can find it in our hearts and in our judgment to increase spending in this area then we have to be prepared to suffer the consequences now i do not think that is what the congress will do but my question is simply this to the leadership why did you choose to come with the first bill of the year with a tax cut that is politically attractive why do you choose to ignore the budget process that we all say we believe in and in which we will make tough choices why do you short circuit it unless it is as some suggest a politically attractive way to get to the 1 trillion tax cut without anybody ever having to face up to the realitfes of what we are talking about i think we are making a bad mistake when we do that as members before me have said today i support dealing with the intricacies of the tax code that penalize couples for being married that is ridiculous let us fix that part but let us do it in the context of a total budget approach that will not jeopardize the economic recovery we have been in now for the last 7 years and that we have all indications we can continue if we just manage to stay on course i want to repeat again and then i will yield back we are in danger if we choose this road that we start tomorrow we are in danger of saying to our rural communities i am sorry but there is no money left for investment in health care in rural communities that is the choice we are in danger of saying there is no money to be used for increasing the durability and longevity and strength of the defenses of this country which most of us agree need to be done why are we not having that argument first that is our question we will have a motion that will provide that we can do everything everybody talks about if it is possible to do it within the context of a budget and tough decisions one of those needs to be being a little conservative with our first bill out of the box i hope that we will find a way to do that one last point i get real concerned when i see the leadership of the house of representatives continuing continuing to ignore the need of making changes in our social security system and our medicare system for the future i get very concerned when i continue to hear the finger pointing of the house of representatives leadership towards the administration for not dealing with social security and medicare and medicaid when everyone knows we can do it in the house of representatives why have we not spent one second talking about the future needs of social security in the context of the budget if we are going to fix social security for the future so our children and grandchildren will have the same benefits that we have today those on it today it is going to require some changes and it is going to require changes that will cause the need of utilizing some of those surplus dollars we are talking about but we completely ignore that and i think that

100 per barrel or even more by the year 2000 congress passed purpa to encourage conservation and promote the use of renewable fuels to generate electricity it did this by establishing a special class of power generators known as qualifying facilities ofs and it required utilities to buy all the electricity that these facilities wished to sell at a price determined generally by federal regulators and specifically by state regulators congress sought in drafting purpa to ensure that customers would pay no more for purpa power than they would have to pay for other power it did this by providing in purpa that the maximum price for electricity from qfs would be the cost that the purchase utility would have incurred if it had generated the electricity itself or had purchased it from a source other than the qf unfortunately this has not proven to be the case because govemnment projections of utility avoided costs have been seriously in error one recent study estimates that purpa is costing electricity consumers nearly 8 billion a year in excess power costs since over 60 percent of purpa contracts will not expire until after the year 2010 consumers will continue to pay these excess costs well into the future purpa also stands in the way of a more competitive electric industry by granting special status to some electricity generators but not others purpa encourages the creation of

situation still remains today the same as it did then the question is and we get into this debate and we get so focused that we sometimes cannot see the trees for the forest we say class size reduction as if class size reduction is the most important part or we say teacher quality as if teacher quality was the most important part i come from a different perspective that i believe that both are i guess we do not all keep up with the studies and i am not too sure that i rely on studies all the time but more recently in just the last couple of weeks there was a study that came out that showed that class size reduction in and of itself does a great deal of good for students because there is that oneonone ability and remember this that the target area is that k through 6 to begin with and we would like to expand it beyond that but k through 6 and as i remember when i went to school the teachers thatwere certified to teach k through 6 were generally certified teachers that have been through the training that was necessary to become qualified teachers and they taught all subjects we did not have and we still do not have by and large in most places in the country in k through 6 a segregated class for math and a segregated class for science and a segregated class for this and that and the other these teachers are teaching all subjects to the classes but more importantly they are developing cognitive ability for those students so that when they get into the grades when those classes are separated and i think we ought to remember that when those instructional classes math science and the rest are in individual classes they are in the upper grades we are not talking about that here we are talking about those earlier grades with the certified teachers more recently a study showed that class size reduction and where those students were in that smaller class size whether or not that teacher was qualified in any particular subject that those students benefited as

federal travel practices second the bill would also eliminate a december 31 1999 sunset date for a provision in the federal property and administrative services act that authorizes the transfer of surplus federal real property at no cost to the state and local governments for law enforcement and emergency response purposes in a moment i will yield to the gentleman from california to explain the portion of the bill that would amend the federal property and administrative services act of 1949 first however let me say that the bill before us contains a number of provisions that are designed to improve federal debt collection credit management and travel management as the subcommittee on government management information and technology learned at its june 15 1999 hearing on federal debt collection at the end of fiscal year 1998 the federal government was owed more than 60 billion in delinquent nontax debt such as student loans and housing loans more than 49 billion of this 60 billion in delinquent nontax debts was delinquent for more than 180 days to facilitate collection of this enormous amount of nontax debt congress passed and the president signed into law the debt collection improvement act of 1996 this bipartisan legislation in which the gentlewoman from new york was the ranking member and joined me in authoring this legislation this bipartisan legislation established significant new debt collection authorities and enhanced existing ones h r 1442 as amended builds upon the debt collection improvement act by providing the federal government with additional authorities to improve its collection of delinquent nontax debts the bill would prohibit federal agencies from writing off delinquent nontax debts prior to initiating collection procedures the bill authorizes the offset or withholding of social security benefits to recipients who owe pastdue child support to a state currently social security benefits can be intercepted to offset a recipients debt to the federal government this bill would assist states in their efforts to collect the billions of dollars in unpaid child support billions of dollars in unpaid child support according to the congressional budget office this added offset authority would recover 17 million each year in pastdue child support to help eliminate waste fraud and error in federal benefit and credit programs h r 1442 as amended would authorize federal agencies to bar delinquent debtors from obtaining a federal permit license or from receiving financial assistance in the form of a loan or loan guarantee until the debt is repaid the bill also focuses attention on large debts it would require agencies to report annually to congress on their high value delinquent debts of 1 million or more h r 1442 as amended promotes the sale of new and delinquent loans by federal agencies loan sale programs would benefit the federal government in a number of ways loans that are sold in a competitive market could yield substantial proceeds reduce administrative costs and allow agencies to focus their limited resources on other programs an agency with guidance from the office of management and budget could exempt any class of debt from the sale provisions of this bill if it were determined that the sale would interfere with agencies programs or mission for example certain performing loans requiring specialized services provided by the federal departments and agencies could be exempt from the sales provision of this bill by the agency head in consultation with the director of the office of management and budget provided that the sale would interfere with the mission of an agency and be not in the financial interests of the united states the bill as amended also includes provisions to improve federal employee travel management the administrator of general services would be required to develop a mechanism to ensure that employees of executive branch agencies are not charged state and local taxes on travel expenses relating to official business h r 1442 also includes a provision that would remove a december 31 1999 sunset provision in the federal property and administrative services act of 1949

the courage and cooperation of president hugo banzer in bolivia now colombia has for the last several years become a source in fact it is now producing the statistics we heard when we visited these areas last week it is now producing more coca and more cocaine than any other region in the world colombia now why did colombia suddenly become a source of narcotics what is interesting again if we look at the history of what took place this administration has blocked consistently any assistance to colombia to eradicate drugs at their source to go after drug traffickers and to stop the production of drugs so what has happened is they are now becoming producers the gentleman from indiana myself the gentleman from illinois the previous chair of this responsibility when the republicans took over the congress we went down to colombia some 4 years ago four years ago there was almost no heroin being produced in colombia they told us then unless the administration freed up the constraints on sending ammunition helicopters eradication resources into that country there would be a flood of poppies and heroin produced guess what that is exactly what has happened an incredible amount of heroin is now being produced and it is now flowing from colombia look at this chart into miami some came through puerto rico because the administration cut the coast guards budget the coast guard protects the air around puerto rico they cut that in half so it came into puerto rico it came into miami and came into central florida and also is coming in through a weak link in the chain which is mexico this is the new pattern that we see mexico has approximately 60 to 70 percent of the hard narcotics coming into the united states coming in through mexico transiting through mexico now we have a new development in addition to a failed policy in colombia which this administration over the objections of congress the new majority in congress we repeatedly sent letters requests we passed resolutions we did everything we could to get them to give general serrano the head of the national colombian police and others the resources and ammunition eradication equipment to do away with drugs at their source costeffective when they get into our streets into our schools and law enforcement in this country tries to go after narcotics that is the most expensive solution to an expensive problem the problem is now a quarter of a trillion dollar problem and that is just the dollars and cents not the lives lost the families destroyed and the terrible scourge again of illegal

problem now again one would think that they would learn let me tell what is in this first of all they have one of the most clever charts i have ever seen in my life it is i guess clintonesque in its explanation but last year this congress appropriated 17 9 billion for the war on drugs now they managed to develop a chart that showed us going from 17 9 billion to 17 8 billion a net decrease of 109 million and show it on a chart as an increase now that is clever in its presentation but it is disastrous in its effect where do the cuts come in let me tell you where these cuts are that disturb me

scared about it but she got a job and needed to have some child care and that is a mothers primary concern which it should be and we all admire mothers for that that is why in the welfare reform bill there was 20 billion in child care for people like sue and dan williams for their children 20 billion in addition to that when the senior citizens and their family have to live with them there is dependent care a tax credit for families like that there is social services block grants there is child care to states and entitlement programs to the tune of 8 8 billion in federal support for the child care programs through the year 2001 these programs are strongly strongly supported by congress on both sides of the aisle programs such as head start even start the campusbased child care idea services for preschoolers and infant programs for after school i have been to some of these afterschool programs these children are learning things they are learning life skills they are learning to work with each other they are learning play acting and things that build their selfesteem these are very good programs the chairman of this committee has worked hard to support this stuff he has gone out in the field he has not stayed in the ivory tower of washington and waited for the white house to hand down some irresponsible number some risky scheme from the goreclinton administration he has gone out and said how do these programs actually work how do they affect real people this is not a matter of political rhetoric this is not a matter of well we are going to spend more money than them itis a matter of sue and dan williams and their children and their parents and caring for them i think the committee and the chairman of the committee have done the right thing on this what i would say to my colleagues across the aisle we keep hearing how well if we have to have more money well maybe we do but maybe we ought to look at the efficiency of these programs as well is it possible under the clintongore model that too much of the money is being squandered by wasteful washington bureaucrats is it possible that a lot of that money never leaves washington d c and if we go down to hud or if we go down to some of these federal government agencies we can find the money on the sixth floor third office down to our right because it never gets out of that bureaucrats hands and to the streets where it can help the children of the williams that is what the committee mark is all about the committee has made a significant commitment in this and will continue to think about head start

efficient but he has also said we have got to help as many children as possible and he has done it in the best interest of americas kids it is sad to me that people would come up with arbitrary numbers to irresponsibly use children as a pawn in some political chess game it upsets me because they know in their heart of hearts this money comes from social security it does not come from some other area if they want to spend this money irresponsibly they have to go home and tell our seniors well do you know what we did we did what we did for 40 straight years we dipped back into that social security trust fund and they should not be doing that because social security should be handled on a bipartisan basis it is not a matter of democrat versus republican it is a matter of putting our seniors first that is why i do not think we should just irresponsibly and arbitrarily come up with numbers to increase programs for political purposes we have to do what is best for children we

it is an absolute outrage that in 1998 the department of energy completed and announced a 2year study on regional storage facilities they then buried the study because it indicated that it would be good for not only the northeast but for the entire country if a reserve was established in the northeast it would be cost effective to keep a government stockpile of some heating oil in the northeast and it would benefit not only the northeast but other parts of the country particularly the midwest i personally think that had that stockpile been established and had the president acted promptly to release some reserve that opec would have been motivated to reduce its cut in production far earlier and we would not have had those months of shortage that helped send prices up while i am well aware that opecs decision was not the only factor in that constraint of supplies and that increase of prices nonetheless it was a significant one and we were not in a position to be able to rapidly deal

going to be developed north of yellowstone that might affect the watershed let me tell my colleagues the rest of the story for 2 years an environmental impact statement had been going on and

was designated an area in jeopardy so if that is what the gentleman from minnesota thinks is a good job i certainly would have to disagree with him i do agree with him however on the fact that what this argument boils down to are these transboundary issues as far back as 1818 the united states supreme court ruled in the united states v bevins that a states right to control property within its borders was an essential part of its sovereignty and i think that h r 883 is yet another affirmation of that principle what was done when this designation was made around yellowstone was it virtually built a buffer zone around yellowstone it is something the administration had been trying to do for a long time but they could not get it done legislatively even though it is clearly legislative

no research grants for a year people who are waiting for cures praying for cures know that this bill will not help them as a former scientist i can tell you research cannot be conducted that way a delay of a year could be a delay for a lifetime research delayed is results denied results which might help save a life or improve the quality of life for our fellow americans i have tremendous admiration for the gentleman from illinois the subcommittee chairman he has been a champion in so many ways and his intelligence competence and compassion will be irreplaceable when he retires at the end of next year i really believe that in another place and time he would have brought a much different bill to the floor but in this time and place the laborhhs bill cannot pass on its own and so the majority relies on procedural shenanigans to slip it through the other side will argue it is really just a cut in office supplies and travel budgets and maybe coffee money really well how about a 184 million cut in veterans medical care or 2 7 billion cut in defense which would mean eliminating jobs for tens of thousands of men and women in uniform the top military official in the united states has warned that this approach could seriously impair our military readiness but the majority here will be arguing office supplies and travel budgets i do not blame the american people for finding this hard to believe i find it hard to believe earlier this year this same majority said it had 892 million for a tax cut using up the social security money now it says it has to cut back on head start and child nutrition a retroactive cut in bills which have already been signed by the president is a new wrinkle for us and that has happened for several of the appropriations bills it is very much like the contractor who builds a house and then comes back the next morning and breaks the windows the rule is objectionable because it condones the highly unconventional process under which we consider this underlying bill and the bill is objectionable for reasons too numerous to fully address in the time allotted for any of us but i solemnly urge defeat of both"], [0.021522849798202515,

laborhhseducation appropriations subcommittee mr porter for his work and dedication in support of biomedical research at the national institutes of health nih i believe it is essential that congress move forward in its commitment to double the research budget at the nih currently scientists at the nih are developing cuttingedge treatments for hundreds of diseases including cancer alzheimers and diabetes increased funding for medical research and development will allow millions of americans to lead healthier lives i therefore rise in support of efforts to provide a 15 increase for nih in fy2001 this increase will mark the third installment of the plan to double the nih budget over a period of five years each and every day researchers at the nih succeed in making important discoveries about the human body and the diseases that may effect it these scientists work tirelessly to develop cuttingedge technologies that push the envelope of human capacity for fy2001 the nih have developed four critical initiatives these include 1 genetic medicinethis involve the mapping of the human genome and the subsequent gene therapy advances in the treatment of cancer chronic illness and infectious disease may be possible through this work 2 clinical researchthis initiatives reinforces the goal of tuming the results of laboratory research into treatment for patients 3 fostering interdisciplinary research and 4 eliminating health disparities these four areas of scientific research present incredible opportunities that have the promise to generate tremendous benefits in the future providing increased funding for biomedical research today will allow millions of americans to lead healthier lives tomorrow with this in mind i urge each of my colleagues to support funding the full 15 budget increase for the national institutes of health"]]}
