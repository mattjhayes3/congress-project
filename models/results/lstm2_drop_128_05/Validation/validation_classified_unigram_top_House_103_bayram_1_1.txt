theme empowering afroamerican organizations present and future africanamerican organizations such as the naacp national urban league and the southern christian leadership conference have worked together with the primary goals of achieving social and economic equality during the 1960s these groups attempted to reach these goals by removing the legal struclure that supported racial discrimination and segregation and by developing the unanimously accepted view that overt acts of racism are not morally tolerable in american society even after these monumental achievemerits africanamericans did not gain social and economic equality today the goals of achieving social and econoric equality remain the same only the scope has been expanded africanamerican organizations now unite to address critical social conditions such as drug abuse crime poverty health care and education in addition to working through legislation and litigation they also focus on selfhelp approaches through education drug rehabilitation and job training programs i am fortunate to represent californias eighth congressional district in ivuhich local africanamerican organizations actively work to improve conditions of africanamericans in the community i would like to take this opportunity to commend a few of the many at work in our san francisco community including first father jim goode

that africanamerican organizations must involve society as a whole in combating conditions adversely affecting all american families and impacting on black families in a very disproportionate manner while local organizations work at the community level and national organizations focus efforts to serve the africanamerican population through education job training and drug abuse programs we the

three major provisions first it would extend the life of the martin luther king jr federal holiday commission for 5 years through fiscal year 1939 second the bill authorizes 300 000 for fiscal year 1995 and increases that amount by a modest 50 00 each year through fiscal year 1999 finally h r 1993 authorizes the corporation for national and community service to make grants for planning and

by president clinton it is being supported by all of the living former presidents this morning a letter was circulated from all 10 living former secretaries of commerce supporting the north american freetrade agreement for a very simple and basic reasons they have all come to the conclusion that the north american freetrade agreement is in the best interest of the united states of america one of the things that has happened over the past several weeks and months is that the people have been led to believe that implementing the north american freetrade agreement is somehow a sellout of unitedstates interests actually nothing could be further from the truth in fact the opposite is the case when one looks at nafta i happen to believe that as we look at the challenge of the future nafta is in our best interest in fact as we listen to people who regularly stand here on the floor of the congress we listen to people out there in the country debating on television and radio programs the north american freetrade agreement we regularly hear horror stories about mexico about the flow of united states jobs from the united states of mexico 0 1930 we hear about problems that exist on the border we hear about the problem of illegal immigration which certainly affects my state of california our taxpayers in my state have to shoulder a 3 billion annual cost for illegal immigration we hear about the wave situation that exists in mexico we hear about human rights violations in mexico we hear about a lack of political pluralism in mexico we hear all these things and one would conclude that every one of these problems is taking place why because of nafta well nafta does not exist nafta is an agreement which will be struck among the three countries canada the united states and mexico and is proposed to go into effect january 1 1994 and be phased in over a 15year period so as we listen to the horror stories of united states jobs going to mexico as we listen to the horror stories of environmental problems on the border as we listen to the horror stories of human rights violations which have taken place in mexico as we listen to all these problems illegal immigration and all we have to realize that all these things have happened not because of nafta because there is no nafta i happen to believe that while every single one of these problems does exist the best way for us to counter these is by implementing nafta so basically the conclusion that i have drawn is that the north american freetrade agreement is about the future and not the past what we need to do is realize that we have some very serious economic problems right here in the united states i am privileged to be able to represent part of los angeles county here the unemployment rate in los angeles county is between 9 and 10 percent the unemployment rate statewide in california is right around 9 percent i happen to believe that the north american freetrade agreement is not just in the best interests of the state which i am privileged to represent here in the congress it is in the best interests of this country why because we desperately want to create job opportunities here in the united states all over the country the best way for us to do that is to realize that finding new markets for unitedstates manufactured goods and services is the best way to do that how do we do that by breaking down tariff barriers and that is what nafta is all about you know those who oppose the north american freetrade agreement do not offer a jobcreation strategy oh yes they say things with which i agree that we should reduce the capital gains tax rate here in the united states to create a business friendly government outlook here but we have this great opportunity 3 weeks from tomorrow when on november 17 we cast our vote on the north american freetrade agreement frankly if we pass this opportunityand there are many who have predicted defeat of the north american freetrade agreement i think we have a great chance to narrowly wth it i have said many times that if this were a secret ballot it would probably win by 75 votes why because as i have talked to colleagues on both sides of the aisle democrats and republicans they say they know it is in the best interest of the united states u america to pass nafta but they feel political pressure at home and for other reasons they do not think they can vote for it in fact more than a few have said to me they hope it passes but they feel they do not want to vote in support of it so clearly we have to look at the consequences of a potential defeat of nafta let me tell you basically what happens there is no doubt whatsoever that someone will export products like cars computers medical equipment telecommunications to mexico with nafta if we put it into place it will be the united states of america we will be the ones manufacturing automobiles telecommunications medical equipment computers other things to send into mexico without nafta it will just as likely be japan and the european community i have said many times that i am not one who likes to engage in bashing japan or the european community but i am the first to acknowledge that japan and the european community have benefited greatly since we played a role in rebuilding their economies their societies in the postwar world and what has happened is they would very much like to have the chance to get into the mexican economy there are 88 million consumers in mexico and if we defeat nafta they will have in mexico little choice other than to look towards japan the pacific rim and the european community for opportunities to trade why because the united states will have said to the neighbor their neighbor with which they share a 2 000mile border to the north the united states will have said forget it we dont want to do this now i have always said that as my friends talk about not this nafta we want to create a north american freetrade agreement i believe that is slightly disingenuous why because while this is a 2 000page agreement and i do not like every aspect of it and i am supporting nafta in spite of not because of the side agreements i am convinced they do not jeopardize unitedstates sovereignty as some have said but as we look at this package that is phased in over a 15year period and the reason it is so long is that the tariff structure is so great today that we need to work to bring it downbut as we look at those who say not this nafta we need to negotiate another nafta i say strike an agreement that will have the support of ross perot and pat buchanan jesse jackson jerry brown lyndon larouche ralph nader these people who came out and opposed nafta said there should be another nafta the aflcio i am hardpressed to believe that an agreement could be struck that would have all of the support of the aflcio and pat buchanan and at the same time jesse jackson so the fact of the matter is while it is not perfect and i realize i am the first to admit there is going to be some job displacementthat is what happens with free markets the free flow of goods and services that is the way it works i am convinced while this one is not perfect it clearly is far superior to the status quo and it does create an opportunity for the united states of america to have a tremendous tremendous advantage over the japanese and the european community let me explain why first of all we look at the tariff structure that exists today i would like to ask you to focus on these charts right here so that our colleagues most of whom are not here but i realize they may be seeing this in some other spot the tariff structure that exists today as a tariff that ranges between 10 and 20 percent for chemicals united statesmanufactured chemicals going into mexico where the united states tariff on chemicals from mexico is between zero and 4 percent under nafta for the united states and canada that tariff will be completely eliminated what we will see is we will see this tariff barrier of 10 to 20 percent maintained not for the united states but for the japanese and the european community look at pharmaceuticals on an average a 15percent mexican tariff is charged on united statesmanufactured goods going into mexico the average tariff that we impose on mexican pharmaceuticals coming into the united states is only 3 5 percent under nafta that is totally eliminated brought down to zero but for the japanese and the european communities it is still a 15percent average tariff barrier that wall will still be up giving the united states a greater advantage over our friends in japan and the european community in the textiles and apparels area 14 to 20 percent on average the mexican tariff that is charged a tax basically on united states textiles and apparel going into mexico6 percent is the average tariff that we have on mexican textiles and apparel coming into the united states this 14 to 20percent average tariff remains for japan and the european community but it comes down for the united states creating an opportunity for us to gain ancess to those 88 million consumers creating a chance for us to create jobs here in the united states and expand export opportunities for us so it seems to me we need to realize that nafta is clearly in the best interests of the united states let us go further industrial machinery on average a 10 to 17percent mexican tariff on united statesproduced industrial machinery going into mexico zero to 2 percent is the united states tariff on mexicanmanufactured industrial machinery coming into the united states what happens under nafta if nafta is implemented both sides are brought down to zero but remember japanese and european community manufacturers of industrial machinery will still face this 10to 17percent mexican tariff household appliances on average 17 1 percent is the mexican tariff on united statesmanufactured household appliances going into mexico less than 1 percent 0 8 percent is the average tariff charged on household appliances manufactured in mexico coming into the united states under nafta a total elimination of these barriers but 17 1 percent average tariff will be maintained for the japanese and the european community steelmill products on average 10 to 15percent mexican tariff on steelmill products coming from the united states into mexico 4 percent is our average tariff charged for mexicanmanufactured steelmill products coming into the united states under nafta totally eliminated but the 10 to 15percent mexican tariff will be maintained for the japanese producers and the european community flat glass the average tariff is 20 percjnt on flat glass coming from the united states into mexico the tariff that the united states charges on mexicanmanufactured flat glass coming in is threetenths of 1 percent this tariff brought down to zero totally eliminated except for the japanese and the european community that 20 percent tariff is maintained so the united states creates a tremendous advantage over the japanese and the european communties bearings 12 percent mexican tariff 7 percent the average united states tariff goes down to zero under nafta and what1 happens maintained at 12 percent for the japanese and the european community machine tools thirteen percent average mexican tariff that is charged on united statesmanufactured machine tools going into mexico 2 percent is the average unitedstates tariff on mexican machine tools coming into the united states under nafta it comes down to zero free trade yet the 13 percent average is maintained for japan and the european community look at automobiles which is the item that is often discussed here and for the life of me as my friend the gentleman from florida chairman of the trade subcommittee says regularly he cannot understand why auto manufacturers and the workers would not support nafta why the tariff that mexico charges for united statesmanufactured automobiles a tax imposed on us to get our caft into mexico is 20 percent the united states tariff charged for manufacture of automobiles inmexico coming into the united states is only 2 2 percent under nafta it comes down to zero projections from the big three automakers are that we will see a 60 fold increase in the first year right now we export 1 000 automobiles from the united states into mexico under nafta the projections are that in the first year we will see an increase of 60 000 automobiles manufactured why because of the dramatic production that takes place and ultimately that tariff will be down to zero but m speaker the 20 percent tariff right here that mexico charges for automobiles coming in will be maintained for automobiles manufactured in japan for automobiles manufactured in germany for automobiles manufactured in italy or france or other countries but for the united states of america and canada under the north american freetrade agreement it will be zero so we will have a tremendous opportunity which is much greater than japan or germany to sell unitedstates manufactured automobiles to the 88 million consumers in mexico light trucks again 20 percent tariff that mexico charges right now for the united states to send light trucks into mexico our average again our tariff is 2 2 percent that we impose on mexican light trucks coming into the united states under nafta it comes down to zero free trade dramatic increase in our opportunity to export from the united states into mexico but the 20 percent tariff is maintained for japan and the european community auto parts 13 1 percent tariff is what the mexicans charge for united statesmanufactured auto parts going into mexico fourtenths of 1 percent you can see here is what is charged for mexicanmanufactured auto parts coming into the united states under nafta it comes down to zero but for japan and the european community it remains at 13 1 percent for auto parts so with these figures you can see very clearly that there is a tremendous benefit that is accrued to the unitedstates worker which will enhance opportunities for us to have this grand strategy of creating jobs let us look at computers i have often pointed to this and said as i will say again this evening that computers is something that is of great concern in my state of california we have a 10percent figure here but actually the tariff on computers manufactured in the united states going into mexico goes up to 20 percent it is 10 to 20 percent and the united states tariff on mexicanmade computers coming into this country is between 3 7 and 3 9 percent as you can see on this chart well what happens is under nafta we bring that tariff down to zero a great big zero nada but the tariff of 10 to 20 percent remains for japan and the european community now the specific example that i have cited in the area of computers i would llke to share again as we talk to the people in the coinputer industry the chief executive officer of ibm the international business machines has said that if nafta is defeated ibm will have no choice other than to move operations to mexico why because it is the only way that they can gain access to those 88 million consumers in america but if we put the north american freetrade agreement in place we can keep the jobs right here in the united states why because under nafta the tariff will come down to zero so that united states workers can continue to manufacture computer systems products software and export into mexico tariff free under nafta so i would like to see ibm keep its jobs here in the united states and with a zero tariff export into mexico now if we pass nafta remember that 10 to 20 percent tariff on computers which will be eliminated under nafta if we pass it will be maintained for computers coming from japan and the far east other countries in the world the european community so what happens the north american freetrade agreement is a great boost for the united states of america the unitedstates worker and it will clearly create more job opportunities for us here computer chips 10 percent right now we have zero tariff no tariff on computer chips from mexico coming into the united states they charge us 10 percent that tariff that 10 percent tax on the unitedstates worker going in under nafta both will be eliminated you can see there is obviously a humongous difference that exists today we have no tariff and they have a 10 percent tariff it goes down to zero computer chips from the u~ited states will go in ibm tandy other operations will not have to shift from the united states and open up their manufacturing operations in mexico but and once again this 10 percent tariff that is there for computer chips is maintained for japan the european community and other countries throughout the world in the area of electronics 2 6 percent average tariff on electronics that they charge on our goods coming in 2 4 percent on mexicanmanufactured electronics equipment coming into the united states it will go down to zero that 2 6 percent average will be maintained for taiwan singapore hong kong korea and japan and other countries which would desperately like to have access to the mexican market they would love to get to mexico so that they could use it for a staging ground an export platform if you will to send goods into the united states but i believe that we in this hemisphere should unite together recognizing that the wave of the future is to reduce barriers now let us look at the export industry here in the united states we found that on average workers here in the united states who manufacture items for export earn 17 percent more than workers here in the united states the workers here in the united states are compensated for items that are simply for domestlc consumption here in the united states so it is a 17percent wage improvement for those people who are in the export industries we also know that contrary to the argument that we regularly hear that the poor mexican people cannot afford to buy united states goods the middle income wage earner in mexico there are 20 millionof them almost the entire population of canada and these are the people who are desperately seeking the opportunity to purchase united statesmanufactured goods and services so it seems to me that we need to do everything we possible can to expand these opportunities for us to create jobs right here in the united states now as we look i mentioned a few minutes ago the people who oppose the north american freetrade agreement it consists of i mentioned all the defeated presidential candidates ross perot pat buchanan jesse jackson jerry brown ralph nader lyndon larouche all these people have run for president of the united states and they strongly oppose the north american trade agreement let us look for a moment at the people who support the north american freetrade agreement last month actually on september 1 all 12 of the living american nobel laureate economists joined with 264 other economists in sending a letter to president clinton in that letter the likes of paul samuelson milton friedman and others robert solow and james tobin who have received the nobel laureate in economics strongly supported the north american freetrade agreement in their letter and i have got it here it says and i quote specifically the assertions that the north american freetrade agreement will spur an exodus of united states jobs to mexico are without basis and i think that the points that i have made with these charts point to that now i should explain that let me say that as we look at other support i remember when we went to the white house and president clinton had former president ford former president bush and former president carter join in a ceremony with him he stood up and he talked about his experiences as a governor he had told me on other occasions that as a governor he knew of people that under the present situation had seen their jobs go to mexico and he said that as a former governor he knows that every single person who lives in a governors mansion of the 50 in this country wakes up in the morning and the first thing he or she thinks of is how am i going to create jobs for the people in my state people expect their governors to create jobs for them in their states and that is really their top priority and 41 of the 50 governors in this country democrats and republicans support the north american freetrade agreement and i think that as those who are out there here in washington members of congress talking about how jobs are going to be lost one cannot help but ask the question why is it that 41 of 50 governors all of whom have as their top priority every morning when they wake up creating jobs for their states why is it that 41 of the 50 strongly support the north american freetrade agreement the reason is very simply that they know that nafta is going to create jobs in their states and i say to my colleagues if you look at the past several years exports for all but two states in the union have increased from between 100 and 300 percent already even with the tariff structure that exists and that is how we have been able to go from what was a nearly 6 billion trade deficit in 1986 to what we had last year a 5 4 billion trade surplus the mexican consumers were buying 5 4 billion more in goods from us than we from them now i know that opponents say that so many of these goods simply go down to mexico and then are manufactured and then turn around and come back to the united states but 83 percent of the items which go from the united states to mexico stay in mexico and they are there for the mexican consumer i mentioned the fact that all 10 of the living commerce secretaries who here at the federal level have as their responsibility economic growth creating jobs spurring on the economy all 10 living former commerce secretaries have today signed this letter which strongly supports nafta democrats and republicans so as we look at this issue it is clear that we need to do everything that we possibly can to expand these opportunities mexico is our third largest export market and it is the 13th largest economy on the face of the earth and it is one of the fastest growing and we need to realize that while we have had slow economic growth in many parts of the united states mexicos economy is growing and so are the economies of other countries in latin america the other countries in latin america desperately want to see us pass the north american freetrade agreement and i believe that if we try to stick our heads in the sand and simply say that the united states of america can stand alone that we will actually be hurting ourselves more than anyone can imagine there are some very dire predictions as to what might happen if we do not pass the north american freetrade agreement and the best one i believe is h 8504 c that which i was referring to with these charts we extend an invitation to japan and the european community to come to mexico and utilize mexico as an export platform to embark on freetrade agreements with other countries in south america they ultimately want to join with us and i think that as we look at the cause of freedom and the fact that during the past 15 years we have seen incredible advances in technology we have seen incredible advances in our ability to communicate worldwide the natural step is to work to reduce barriers to the free flow of goods and services i say regularly that i do not believe that i as a member of the unitedstates congress have a right to say to the people whom i represent in california you cant buy the best quality product at the lowest possible price i think that we should be able to do that i believe that we should do everything that we can to increase unitedstates productivity i am convinced that the american worker is by far the most productive it was united states productivity that led general motors and the united auto workers to make a decision to move a plant from mexico back to lansing mi creating a thousand jobs right here in the united states why because the united states auto worker is actually nine times more productive than the mexican auto worker so as we look at these issues which are of concern i hope very much that our colleagues will do everything that they possibly can to look at the details and the facts on this i recognize that it is a tough political issue out in southern california i suppose i enhance their efforts by saying this but there are more than a couple of people many of whom are not actually constituents of mine but know that i have been in strong support of reducing trade barriers trying to increase export opportunities for the united states but these people have gone out and picketed and protested almost daily in front of my office in los angeles and i certainly welcome them i mean i know that some of the people in my office may not welcome them but i support their first amendment rights their right to free speech they have a right to stand there and voice their opinions on this but i believe that as we look at the facts on this that it is in the best interests of the united states to look toward the future and not the past and that is what i am trying to do and i hope that 3 weeks from tomorrow on november 17 that a majority of our colleagues in the unitedstates house of representatives will join with a majority of our

thoughtful resolution that i think expresses and embodies our hopes as well as our concerns about the upcoming election in mexico when mexicans go to the polls in what is expected to be record numbers on august 21 the electoral process will reflect a confluence of political will presidential vision for reform compromise by the major political parties and insistence on integrity in the electoral process by mexican voters significantly more than 90 percent of the eligible population is included in the new electoral registry and an estimated 22 to 27 million voters are expected to go to the polls on the 21st of this month all signs indicate that this election will likely result in the largest voter turnout in mexican history the reform and modernization of mexicos political process is of particular importance to the united states because of our geographic proximity our strong ethnic and cultural ties our economic bonds and a common aspiration for democracy i believe house concurrent resolution 250 as amended reflects our respect for the breadth of electoral reforms already undertaken by the salinas government and our expectations of an honest fair and transparent process house concurrent resolution 250 recognizes the significant reforms which have been made such as broadening the impartiality of the federal electoral institutes general council screening for accuracy in the voter registry list protecting the right of fair media access and reforming the criminal code to add teeth to anticorruption initiatives president salinas should be applauded for the commitment he has

will be marked by a plethora of firsts the universal use of transparent ballot boxes the most accurate and meticulously prepared registry list the most candidates who are seeking the presidency the largest number of election officials television debate among the presidential candidates and extensive press coverage of the elections the mexican electorate has understandably raised its expectations of a transparent and fair electoral process with transparency at all levels and they must determine whether or not the outcome reflects the voters will on july 12 the presidential candidates from eight of the nine political parties signed a historic agreement for civility harmony and justice only the democratic revolutionary party decided it would not sign this accord the agreement recognizes that democracy is a system that guarantees our unity as a nation without undermining regional diversities or the ethnic religious political and cultural pluralities that identify and enrich us the political parties committed themselves to proceed with strict adherence to the law to ensure greater access opening objectivity and impartiality from the media coverage of the election and to encourage open and pressurefree participation by the electorate the document recognizes that it is not through violence that democratic progress will be accomplished the establishment of democracy can only nuture itself through the improvement of institutions in the republic and as a result of broad participation by society the election is likely to be one of theif not the most important in mexican

house together and help us get a good crime bill i thank him for participating let me turn just for a few moments to the health issue i am fortunate also to have the gentleman from hawaii here who comes from a state where they have universal coverage where we have seen that it is possible to cover all citizens i am going to begin with just a few comments on the matter of senior citizens and how senior citizens fare in the health reform debate i think that all of us know and i have a special interest in this area going back to the days when i was codirector of the oregon gray panthers at home we know that medicare which was enacted in 1965 was just half a loaf it did not cover prescription drugs and longterm care and eyeglasses and hearing aids and many needs of the senior citizens in fact health costs have gone up so dramatically that now many senior citizens pay more outofpocket for their health care than they did when medicare began in 1965 this is especially the case because prescriptions a substantial number of seniors millions pay more than 1 000 out of pocket each year for their pharmaceuticals and millions more need longterm care cannot even get decent care in their own homes i think it is especially important in this health reform effort that any bill and particularly the bipartisan bills which in my view are so critical to getting this job done right adequately address the concerns of the nations senior citizens the majority leader the gentleman from missouri has taken an approach which i think has a strong consensus behind it what the majority leader is saying in his approach to dealing with the concerns of the elderly is that there are savings to be found in the medicare program there are areas where we can make the program more efficient without harming existing medicare services what the majority leader the gentleman from missouri seeks to do is to take those dollars saved by making medicare more efficient and in effect reinvesting them in new benefits and new services for seniors such as longterm care and prescription drugs i happen to think that that makes a great deal of sense and i have heard the majority leader to his credit indicate that he is very open to hearing suggestions from members of congress of both political parties on how that might possibly be improved upon there is another approach that is being discussed it is the one that was drafted and developed by our colleague the gentleman from georgia i have served with the gentleman from georgia on the health committee for a number of years and a more decent and caring individual in my view simply cannot be found than the gentleman from georgia but i think we have to do better for our senior citizens than the approach that is being offered in the rowland bill what the gentleman from georgia and a number of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle propose d6ing in their bill is in effect taking a substantial portion of the medicare trust fund more than 60 billion and simply spending it on matters unrelated to the elderly so here we are in a situation where we have a very rapidly growing aging population the demographics are relentless we will have many more seniors in our country yet the approach offered by our colleague the gentleman from georgia simply takes 60 billion out of the medicare trust fund and spends it on unrelated matters instead of taking the approach that our colleague the gentleman from missouri has taken who wants to find medicare savings and reinvest them in longterm care and prescriptions the approach offered by the gentleman from georgia takes the 60 billion out of the medicare trust fund and at the same time offers not one dime for prescription drug coverage and not one dime for longterm care as far as i can tell the only reason one would go and take money out of the medicare trust fund and not use it for prescriptions and longterm care is you basically subscribe to the theory that willie sutton gave for robbing banks as you will recall willie sutton said thats where were going to look because thats where the money is i can see why someone might offer that kind of theory but i think we can do better on a bipartisan basis for our countrys senior citizens i think we can do better by our elders who so often are getting clobbered by these rising prescription drug bills by longterm care costs and the key to doing better is to build on the efforts of the majority leader who is saying lets find savings in the medicare program there are efficiencies to be found and in order to help our nations seniors when we find those efficiencies we will take those dollars and plow them back into the medicare program to provide some relief to vulnerable seniors faced with crushing longterm care and prescription drug bills what i would like to do and wrap up if i might is describe a situation where we have one of the nations senior citizens who currently receives coverage through the medicare program describes how she would fare under the approach taken by the majority leader the gentleman from missouri and describes how i think it would be possible for us in the kind of spirit that the gentleman from connecticut has brought to the house this evening work together to kind of build a coalition in both political parties to make sure that in health reform our na tions senior citizens get a fair shake under the proposal offered by the majority leader the gentleman from missouri the nations senior citizens would continue to get coverage through the medicare program so right away we have a plank that i think both political parties can support there is no need to frighten the nations elderly no need to tear up the sidewalks and cause confusion but to start as the majority leader does by in effect building on the medicare program the second part of his effort is to make sure that our senior citizens continue to have a choice of plan with unrestricted choice of physicians or a managed care program this too is exceptionally important this too is something that i think members of congress of both political parties can support because i think if there is one thing the american people agree on it is that senior citizens and others in our country must have access to a widespread range of providers and plank no 2 that mr gephardt pursues in his legislation is also an effort in my view to try to bring together a consensus to make sure that seniors are well cared for the third area is the matter of prescription drugs under this legislation the majority leader tries to balance the need for concern about cost with making sure that our seniors start getting some relief from the skyrocketing prescription bills his proposal would add approximately 8 50 per month to a senior citizens premium so that there is going to be an additional cost but never again would a senior citizen have to pay more than a thousand dollars a year on prescription drugs i would like to emphasize how important i believe this benefit is because i remember from my days with the gray panthers constantly seeing instances where senior citizens could not afford their pharmaceuticals and seeing very detrimental health effects as a result many have heard the phrase that seniors are choosing between food and prescriptions i found in my years working with senior citizens is what was more likely to happen is not that senior citizens would have to give up all of their meals to cover prescriptions but what would happen is they could not afford to take all of their pills and their prescriptions in a timely way so if a physician told them to take three pills for example for 2 weeks maybe they would take three pills for the first 3 days of the prescription but faced with the prospect of not being able to afford their pharmaceutical bills after 3 days they would then have to cut back to two pills and then eventually to one pill because pharmaceuticals can be so cost effective in terms of a treatment arrangement when senior citizens are in that kind of situation not able to take their prescriptions in a timely kind of way what is very likely to happen is that their health problems will get worse some may eventually need hospitalization and it is simply not cost effective to ignore the need for some prescription drug relief for our nations senior citizens so i am very hopeful in the days ahead on a bipartisan basis the congress will build on the third plank of the majority leaders piogram for senior citizens and that is to ensure that is a fiscally responsible way a prescription drug program is started for our elderly the majority leader in his plan goes on there is coverage for annual mammographies there is mental health benefits there is not a total limit on the amount senior citizens would have to pay beginning in the year 2003 all of these in addition to the slowdown in the part b premium are i think very welcomed and measures that members on both sides of the aisle can support and support enthusiastically but i think it is also important to focus on the last part of the proposal for seniors offered by the gentleman from missouri and that is the creation of a new home and communitybased longterm care program for seniors i emphasize this again as much out of personal experience as anything else during my years of codirector of the oregon gray panthers i had a chance to work with seniors for many years in developing what i think has come to be regarded as really one of the nations finest longterm care programs at home in oregon we have a program known as project independence it is a program designed to keep our seniors at home as a result of this program we are saving money we are saving money while at the same time having one of the lowest rates of nursing home stays in the country we have in effect revolutionized geriatric care revolutionized health care for seniors in effect turned the system on its head by putting such a strong emphasis on costeffective home health care what this legislation does the legislation offered by the majority leader is in effect build on the model developed in oregon the oregon project independence program the majority leader did not start from scratch the majority leader did not make this up out of whole cloth he is effect looked to the models across this country like we see at home in oregon through project independence and that is what he modeled his home health care program around so i am of the view that if the congress and members on both sides of the aisle look to a new home and communitybased program build around what we have done in oregon and now a number of other states have come up with other very sensible kinds of models we will have a chance to do the best in health care for our seniors which is to do more of what they want which is to stay at home and be in the community and do it at a price tag that is less than what we face today when seniors are unnecessarily institutionalized in nursing homes so let me wrap up by saying it seems to me we are in effect presented with two kinds of alternatives one is the approach that we have from dr rowland which in effect takes 60 billion over the next 5 years and takes it out of the medicare trust fund at a time when we are going to have many more seniors at a time when the demographics are so clear it takes 60 billion out of the medicare trust fund and instead of spending it on prescriptions and longterm care it spends it on matters unrelated to the concerns of the elderly that we are discussing tonight on the other hand we have the approach that the majority leader has zeroed in on which is in effect to find costeffective savings in the medicare program find savings in the medicare program that can be routed out without in any ways cutting existing medicare services the majority leader has said let us take those savings and reinvest them in the home and communitybased services for the elderly and prescription drugs i am very hopeful that in a bipartisan way as the gentleman from connecticut has done for us tonight on the crime bill i am very hopeful that i and the gentleman from hawaii and other members of congresd can work together in a cooperative kind of fashion in a bipartisan fashion so that we can make sure that our seniors have a dignified retirement so they are not wiped out by the crushing costs of longterm care and prescriptions and we do this in a bipartisan way as the country wants and we do it in this session of congress i yield to the gentleman from hawaii who has been such a strong advocate of health care reform because i know he believes it in his heart but also because he has seen it work day in and day out in his home state i am happy to yield to my friend"],

expense reductions it sounds harmless but when we take it down to the individual agency level let me give some examples what it means for the social security administration is that they would have to lay off 2 000 fte equivalents which because we are already halfway into the fiscal year means they would have to lay off about 4 000 people those are people who are supposed to process all of the claims under the social security administration do we really want to slow down that process further do we really want to erode the service that we are providing to seniors and fdisabled people do we

administrative budget for the department of education has already been cut by 30 percent 30 percent this amendment means that we are going to have to postpone the implementation of the new direct loan
