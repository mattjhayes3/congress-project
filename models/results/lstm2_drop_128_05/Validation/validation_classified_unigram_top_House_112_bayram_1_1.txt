40 cents from a year ago and about 20 cents from just 1 month ago citizens are suffering and they need relief it is important to point out in this context that when president obama took office gas prices were at about 1 85 per gallon now that they are up to about 3 75 per gallon we can see a steady increase over this 38month period of time of his presidency so far gasoline prices have risen an average of about 5 cents per gallon per month this is staggering when we think about the fact that if he is reelectedif he serves out the rest of this term and if he is reelectedthat is a total of an additional 58 months with that increase gas prices will be up at around 6 60 per gallon this is a lot of money it is staggering it affects everything we dofrom the miles we drive to the products we buy at the grocery store everything gets more expensive when the fuel we use to transport ourselves and our products becomes more expensive now to some extent one could suggest this was not only foreseeable but it was actually foreseen to some it was considered a desired outcome lets consider for example that in 2008 dr steven chu who now serves as president obamas energy secretary said somehow we have to figure out how to boost the price of gasoline to the levels in europe well mr chu it looks as though we are headed in that direction and if we continue to follow this administrations energy policies we may get there as a member of the senates energy and natural resources committee i was somewhat surprised when a suggestion was made just a few days ago that there are some who believe there is no relationship between unitedstates production of petroleum and the price of gasoline in the united states that simply is not true and it cannot be true with oil being the input ingredient into gasoline it is the precursor for gasoline anytime we do anything that cuts off or restricts or limits the supply that is necessarily going to have an impact on the price and it does the fact that it is indisputable that there are other factors which also influence the price of gasoline makes it no less true that we have to produce petroleum at home in addition to buying it from other places in order to keep gasoline prices at reasonable levels we have to produce more there are some things we can do in order to help improve that trend for example we could open anwr for drilling we could open our countrys vast federal public lands to development of oil shale it is a little known fact that in three rocky mountain states a small segment of rocky mountain statesutah

significant degree because that oil shaleespecially in my state the state of utahis overwhelmingly on federal public land and it is almost impossible to get to it to produce it commercially on

good news however is they were prosecuted and they were convicted in a federal court pursuant to the james byrd hate crime law and im honored to tell you that that law passed here in this congress in 2009 and was signed into law it is properly styled as the matthew shepard and james byrd jr hate crimes prevention act it was supported by many people and organizations expressing goodwill the naacp supported it the adl supported it a good many members of this congress supported it and many others supported this law this law allowed the prosecution to take place in a federal court when these three men would have been charged in a state court and if convicted faced misdemeanor charges in this the greatest country in the world no one should have to fear for life or liberty simply because of who you are simply because of your race your ethnicity your gender your sexuality it shouldnt happen in this country the truth is that in this case there was some testimony with reference to one of the defendants having dated a person of african ancestry there was testimony that he did not appear to be the kind of person that would be considered a white supremacist but here is another truth that we have to deal with the truth is that there is confusion about the hate crime law theres a misunderstanding this law does not allow you to impose dastardly deeds upon persons simply because you are of the same race as the person that you are assaulting the truth is that if you assault and target a person because of race it doesnt matter what your race is and you are committing a hate crime the truth is that you can be of the same race and commit a hate crime the victim and the perpetrator can be of the same race and you will still have a hate crime we need to rid ourselves of this foolish notion that this law was passed in some way to assault persons who are of an ethnicity or a race that we have traditionally in this country found to be engaged in some of these kinds of activities its not targeted at any given race its targeted at people who commit crimes against other people simply because of who these people are i remind you that an injustice against any one of us is a threat to justice for every one of us and we all have a duty to make sure that we dont send out some silly notion that this law was designed for one race of people this law was designed for every person who would commit a hate crime against another person so im saddened to say this morning that the bad news is mr johnson had to fight off several persons stood his ground for 10 minutes but indicated that he thought he was going to die as they assaulted him thats the bad news the good news is that the law has worked that this law is bringing new meaning to the notion of justice for all this law will

originally passed the public safety officers benefits act psob in 1976 this program evolved from concern that state and local public safety officers and their families were not being provided with adequate death benefits and that the low level of benefits might impede recruitment efforts and impair morale originally the psob program provided only death benefits to the survivors of officers killed in the line of duty it was later expanded to provide benefits to officers disabled in the line of duty and education benefits to the spouses and children of officers killed or disabled in the line of duty congress has amended the psob program many times since its inception some of the changes have resulted in inconsistencies within the law or have unintentionally resulted in a delay in the psob benefit process for example each psob claimant must be examined by an impartial medical examiner who then advises the justice department regarding their decision to award benefits but the psob statute and its regulations require that the medical examiner be hired from the city where the officer was killed or injured this causes significant delays and adds expense in processing psob claims and in administering the overall program the department spends significant time and resources to find a medical professional who is familiar with the psob program and its requirements that medical professional must also be available and agree to perform the necessary medical exam this process can take weeks if not months to complete this bill provides a solution to this inefficiency it allows the department to develop and draw from a pool of trusted qualified medical professionals to perform the necessary examinations across the country this is similar to how the psob program authorizes their hearing examiners this simple change saves valuable time and taxpayer dollars it also ensures that the public safety officers and their families receive these muchneeded benefits more quickly h

end in the terrapin athletic program as our successful coaches of basketball and football have left the school i want to take this opportunity therefore to honor coaches gary williams and ralph friedgen for all they have meant to the maryland community both on and off the court and field both of them are good friends of mine gary williams was my neighbor for a number of years gary retired as marylands basketball coach after 22 hardworking successful college years in college park and 33 years in college coaching ranks at his retirement gary williams ranked as the fifth winningest college basketball coach in america with 668 wins stretching over his remarkable career he is also the third winningest coach in atlantic coast conference history behind two legends dean smith and mike krzyzewski gary williams inherited a struggling program and turned it into a perennial national contender under his guidance the terrapins reached the ncaa tournament 14 times 11 times consecutively won three acc regular season titles and an acc tournament championship made seven sweet sixteens two elite eights two final fours and in a memory that all terrapins still treasure and i had the opportunity of attending in atlanta won the national championship in 2002 coach williams was honored as national coach of the year in 2002 and as acc coach of the year in 2002 and 2010 but numbers alone do not capture his impact on the lives of his players or on the life of the maryland community where he stood out as a leader and as a philanthropist marylands athletic director kevin anderson correctly summed it up best when he said gary williams is a legend that is true terrapins will also miss our football coach ralph friedgen who coached his last game with the program on december 29 fittingly it was a decisive wina 5120 victory in the military bowl in washington dc the fridge as he is affectionately known also took over a struggling program and led it to notable success he guided maryland to the acc championship in his very first year as coach and of the 10 years in his tenure 7 of them ended with postseason appearances in both his first year as maryland football coach and his last he was named acc coach of the year coach friedgen won 74 games for the university of maryland brought new energy to our football program and left a lasting mark in college park he was respected by his players and looked to as a role model i was proud to call him a friend as well he too will be missed by all who love maryland who love football who love basketball and who live the principles that sports teaches both gary williams and ralph friedgen are good men and outstanding leaders and while i know that the maryland athletic program will build on the proud foundation they laid their shoes will be tough to fill good luck thank you and godspeed to gary williams and ralph friedgen"]], "top_unsure": [[0.0011623501777648926, 0.5011623501777649, 1, "i thank the gentleman for his

buy something pay for it we havent done that thats what creates debt taxing doesnt create debt spending doesnt create debt if you pay for it spending creates debt only if you dont pay for it the revenuestaxesare what you pay for things that you buy we are buying things and were not paying for them and your children and mine are being put in debt as a result so this debate is really about what are we going to pay for how much do we want to do and if we want to do it we need to pay for it the gentleman knows my side very much believes that we had two tax cuts in 01 and 03 we didnt pay for it

sunsetted they sunsetted this december 31 that was planned it was planned because of a scoring issuenot because i think your side really believes they ought to sunset but because of a scoring issue

sequester ought to take place in the way that its planned to do so so what im saying to the gentleman is everything thats going to happen on december 31 weve planned weve put in place weve sunsetted

stabilization program this program is a good program and no matter what may happen here today the record should reflect the benefits of this program this program was good and the amendment offers

of the bill is very clear that we only rescind unobligated funding if the funding has been obligated then it continues to move forward so as to the list that was read those will be funded the amendment before us directs the gao to determine the number of physicians who will be trained by this program if funds are not kept mandatory i oppose the general premise that a program must have mandatory funding in order to be effective this type of thinking has led us to massive budget deficits as far as the eye can see during the debate on the continuing resolution i can remember more than a few members complaining that reductions in discretionary spending would have little impact on the deficit there is some truth to the fact that discretionary spending which congress has more control over comprises an increasingly smaller share of the federal budget it seems to me that some peoples solutions to reining in the discretionary ledger of our federal budget is to simply shift programs from discretionary to mandatory and let the spending cruise on auto pilot that is not responsible governing in a time of 1 5 trillion annual deficits we must make spending priorities however setting priorities involves tough choices the people that oppose this bill do so because they are unwilling to make the tough choices on what programs the federal government should fund and what they should not so lets review what happened certain programs for training were made mandatory in the health care act and others were subject to future appropriations listening to the debate today it is apparent that some believe any provision in the health care act that authorized a program subject to appropriations is essentially meaningless and did nothing at all i have heard members extol the virtues of dental education programs or training for nurse education contained in the health care act but they are subject to further appropriations where was the amendment to the health reform bill that asked gao to look into how the lack of mandatory spending in section 5305 of the health care act would affect geriatric education there wasnt one and not a single member of the other side brought the issue up the reason the other side didnt bring it up is because the programs were constructed in a way to go through the normal authorization and appropriations process the underlying bill simply puts teaching health centers on equal footing with a myriad of other programs i also oppose the amendment because it is a waste of federal resources we are asking the gao to conduct a study that is almost impossible for it to complete the gao cannot determine the number of physicians that will be trained because so much of the program is under the discretion of the secretary in fact the contours of the program have not yet even been set the health resources and services administration does not even anticipate issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking on the teaching health center graduate medical education program until december under my bill supporters of the program will continue to be able to make the case on an annual basis that the program is not duplicative it is effective and warrants

you hang your christmas tree lights up with christmas tree lights made in china it will be at 17 trillion were borrowing money from china where there are 25 catholic bishops under house arrest and hundreds of protestant pastors under house arrest and were doing nothing about it were borrowing money from saudi arabia that funded the radical madrassas up among the afghanpakistan border that led to 9 11 and that led to where we are quite frankly with regard to afghanistan when i go into every high school in my district i ask the young people is the social security system sound and will it be there when you retire in the last 3 years not one has raised their hand the seniors in my congressional district know more than this congress and they know more than this administration the president has walked away and has failed and the congressboth political partieshave walked away and failed i commend my friends mr cooper and mr latourette and ask for a yes vote on the simpsonbowles commission mr chair nearly six years agoduring the last republican house majorityi introduced legislation to create an independent bipartisan commission to address the deficit i called it the safe commission short for securing americas future economy everything would be on the table for discussionentitlements all other spending programs and tax policyand like the brac process congress would be required to vote up or down on the commissions recommendations my colleague and good friend jim cooper of tennessee joined me in sponsoring this legislation in 2007 and in subsequent years it ultimately became the blueprint for the presidents national commission on fiscal responsibility and reform more commonly referred to as the simpsonbowles commission the simpsonbowles commission produced a credible plan that gained the support of a bipartisan majority of the commissions 18 members called the moment of truth the commissions report made clear that eliminating the debt and deficit will not be easy and that any reform must begin with entitlements mandatory and discretionary spending also has to be addressed as well other sacred cows including tax reform and defense spending had just three more members of the simpsonbowles commission supported the recommendations this plan likely would have passed the congress and be law today i was disappointed that the president and his administration walked away from the commission the president failed the country leadership on both sides of the congressional aisle has done no better this town is dysfunctional if the plan had advanced we would already be on our way in getting our nations fiscal house in order over the past year and a half i have repeatedly said that while there are some changes i would make i would support a budget proposal similar to or based on simpsonbowles if it came to a vote on the house floor i want to commend mr cooper and mr latourete today for offering this substitute amendment which was drafted using the bipartisan principals of the simpsonbowles commission simpsonbowles provides the framework for the most comprehensive and realistic solution to our nations fiscal problems i have submitted the preamble of the simpsonbowles commission report for the record which i believe is a worthy read as we debate the cooperlatourette substitute every member of congress and the president know the dire economic situation facing our country a debt load over 15 5 trillion annual deficits over 1 trillion and unfunded obligations and liabilities over 65 trillion on the books to pay for programs such as social security medicare and medicaid were borrowing this money from nations such as chinawhich is spying on us where human rights are an afterthought and catholic bishops protestant ministers and tibetan monks are jailed for practicing their faithand oilexporting countries such as saudi arabiawhich funded the radical madrasahs on the afghanpakistan border resulting in the rise of the taliban and al qaeda we always say we want to leave our country better than we found it and to give our children and grandchildren hope for the future just today noted historian niall ferguson testified before my subcommittee and said that if we do not change course the debt burden will not only crush our children and grandchildren but also the current generation in the very near futu re according to the congressional budget offices long term estimate every penny of the federal budget will go to interest on the debt and entitlement spending by 2025 every penny that means no money for national defense no money for homeland security no money to fix the nations crumbling bridges and roads no money for medical research to find a cure for cancer or alzheimers or parkinsons diseases we have to find a solution to this debt crisis failure is not an option congress and the president must be willing to support a plan that breaks loose from the special interests holding washington by the throat and return confidence to the country congress and the president also need to be honest with the american people and explain that we cannot solve our nations financial crisis by just cutting waste fraud and abuse within discretionary accounts the real runaway spending is occurring in our outofcontrol entitlement costs and the hundreds of billions in annual tax earmarks until we reach an agreement that addresses these two drivers of our deficit and debts we cannot right our fiscal ship of state i amand have beenwilling to make the hard choices to ensure a better future for our children and grandchildren every two years i take an oath to support and defend the constitution i do not sign pledges to lobbyists or special interest groups if the cooperlatourette substitute does not pass today i will vote to support the ryan budget proposal so that we may move the budget process forward and continue the necessary discussions to address our nations financial crisis but i hope this substitute passes it is a balanced and ambitious roadmap to address our deficit it also is the only truly bipartisan plan that is being offered and i believe the only plan that has the opportunity to be approved by the senate more important this proposal calls for difficult decisions by finding savings to completely turn off the budget control acts looming sequestration which could devastate our defense capabilities as i mentioned earlier i do not agree with every recommendation in the simpsonbowles plan nor do i support every part of the cooperlatourette substitute for example i fully support efforts to repeal and replace the patient protection and affordable care act and regret that cooperlatourette is silent on the need to address this issue i am also concerned about the instructions proposed for the committee of jurisdiction over the federal workforce this could impact workers including the fbi and cia agents serving in afghanistan cbp agents stopping illegal immigrants coming across our borders the va doctors caring for our veterans and the nih medical researchers working to develop cures for cancer diabetes alzheimers and autism however the cooperlatourette substitute is the kind of bipartisan cooperation that we must have it is the kind of forthright realistic conversation about our nations fiscal future in which we must engage across the aisle across the capitol and down pennsylvania avenue if we are to have any hope of coming up with a credible plan to protect the future for our children and grandchildren every member should support this substitute preamble throughout our nations history americans have found the courage to do right by our childrens future deep down every american knows we face a moment of truth once again we cannot play games or put off hard choices any longer without regard to party we have a patriotic duty to keep the promise of america to give our children and grandchildren a better life our challenge is clear and inescapable america cannot be great if we go broke our businesses will not be able to grow and create jobs and our workers will not be able to compete successfully for the jobs of the future without a plan to get this crushing debt burden off our backs ever since the economic downturn families across the country have huddled around kitchen tables making tough choices about what they hold most dear and what they can learn to live without they expect and deserve their leaders to do the same the american people are counting on us to put politics aside pull together not pull apart and agree on a plan to live within our means and make america strong for the long haul as members of the national commission on fiscal responsibility and reform we spent the past eight months studying the same cold hard facts together we have reached these unavoidable conclusions the problem is real the solution will be painful there is no easy way out everything must be on the table and washington must lead we come from different backgrounds represent different regions and belong to different parties but we share a common belief that americas longterm fiscal gap is unsustainable and if left unchecked will see our children and grandchildren living in a poorer weaker nation in the words of senator tom coburn we keep kicking the can down the road and splashing the soup all over our grandchildren every modest sacrifice we refuse to make today only forces far greater sacrifices of hope and opportunity upon the next generation over the course of our deliberations the urgency of our mission has become all the more apparent the contagion of debt that began in greece and continues to sweep through europe shows us clearly that no economy will be immune if the unitedstates does not put its house in order the reckoning will be sure and the devastation severe the president and the leaders of both parties in both chambers of congress asked us to address the nations fiscal challenges in this decade and beyond we have worked to offer an aggressive fair balanced and bipartisan proposal a proposal as serious as the problems we face none of us likes every element of our plan and each of us had to tolerate provisions we previously or presently oppose in order to reach a principled compromise we were willing to put our differences aside to forge a plan because our nation will certainly be lost without one we do not pretend to have all the answers we offer our plan as the starting point for a serious national conversation in which every citizen has an interest and all should have a say our leaders have a responsibility to level with americans about the choices we face and to enlist the ingenuity and determination of the american people in rising to the challenge we believe neither party can fix this problem on its own and both parties have a responsibility to do their part the american people are a long way ahead of the political system in recognizing that now is the time to act we believe that far from penalizing their leaders for making the tough choices americans will punish politicians for backing down and well they should in the weeks and months to come countless advocacy groups and special interests will try mightily through expensive dramatic and heartwrenching media assaults to exempt themselves from shared sacrifice and common purpose the national interest not special interests must prevail we urge leaders and citizens with principled concerns about any of our recommendations to follow what we call the becerra rule dont shoot down an idea without offering a better idea in its place after all the talk about debt and deficits it is long past time for americas leaders to put up or shut up the era of debt denial is over and there can be no turning back we sign our names to this plan because we love our children our grandchildren and our country too much not to act while we still have the chance to secure a

preferences program should also not stand expired and importantly it is inexcusable that the trade adjustment assistance that we improved on a bipartisan basis in 2009 has stood expired since february
