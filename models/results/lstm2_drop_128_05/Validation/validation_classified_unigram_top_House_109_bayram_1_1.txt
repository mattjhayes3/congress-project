remind us that it is a war in which we can never yield and about which we have no choice they also remind us that iraq has become a recruiting ground for those international terrorists that iraq has become a proving ground for those international terrorists and that iraq has become the motivation for many of those international terrorists none of which existed before the presidents choice to go to war a war not of necessity a war that was unjustified based upon falsified intelligence in fact we see the new cia director said that intelligence that the administration used to make the case for war was wrong inaccurate and misleading there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq and there was no connection between 9 11 and saddam hussein the administration used fear to scare this country into war based upon those lies he refused to properly prepare for the war and its aftermath and now our soldiers our families and our nation are paying an enormous price for this presidents tragic blunder two thousand five hundred americans soldiers we are informed today have died in iraq 19 000 american soldiers have been wounded many of them missing limbs and suffering other very serious debilitating injuries that will afflict them the rest of their lives the war has cost almost a half a trillion dollars in taxpayer money and americas international reputation and respect in the world has been severely damaged the president often says that he makes decisions about the future of iraq based upon what the generals say but when the time came to listen to the generals prior to iraq the president refused to listen to them he refused to listen to them when they questioned the force structure that was available to us to go into iraq at that time but he went anyway he refused to listen to them when questions were raised the day after we seized baghdad what we now see is massive national chaos for which our soldiers were not trained not given any instructions on how to deal with and certainly did not have sufficient numbers to deal with the president sent the troops into that war with that poor planning that poor structure and that poor understanding of what would take place afterwards the american public had to witness soldiers being forced to buy their own body armor have their families buy it because we did not have a proper supply prior to going into that war many men and women were sent into battle with unarmored old humvees that were used for flood control in the california rivers before they showed up in iraq and those soldiers died because of that inadequate equipment and because of the roadside bombs that are the number one killer in iraq we see the torture of detainees was approved at the highest levels in the pentagon and this again has led to an undermining of our position in the world our moral position in the war in iraq and the war against terrorism this is a policy blunder of historic proportions by this president and it is very important that we understand that we are paying a huge price for these mistakes by this administration tragically we stand here on the floor of this congress today 3 years after the beginning of this war but for 3 years questions were not raised in this congress about that force structure about that preparedness about the detainee policy about these actions that have so severely undermined us yes we saw the taking of zarqawi and what do we have there we have the real use of smart intelligence on the war against terror as you pointed out they are not going to come after the 130 000 troops they are not going to come after our strengths but that is what people have been saying for a long time that is what people have been writing about at the military schools about the networking of terrorism and how you had to go after it we went after it exactly the wrong way in exactly the same way as people who made these historic blunders throughout history when confronting this kind of force yes we should provide the special ops yes we should provide the surveillance yes we should provide the intelligence and we should work together in the case of zarqawi we saw once the jordanians were insulted enough by the attacks on their land they put their intelligence sources to work combined with ours and zarqawi was run down and we provided the 500pound bombs we provided the special ops that is not what is

failures in iraq the republican congress has acted like a rubberstamp for president bush rather than the elected representatives of the people of america republicans in congress have hid their heads in the sand and refused to question the president instead sheepishly pretending success is around the corner as a result iraq is engaged in a civil war that threatens to consume the country congress has done nothing to stop the civil war in iraq nothing to hold the president accountable for the failures in iraq and nothing to put our troops on a safe and speedy path toward home or to other parts

my house colleagues and i look forward to the support of this entire body for the resolution in todays vote as the congressional representative of the largest vietnamese community outside of vietnam it is a great privilege to bring this legislation to the floor today on their behalf the gentleman from california is right the vietnamese community here in america has done an incredible job they are hard workers they are business owners they are in the top universities they are getting educated they are beginning the political process having now been elected in many of the areas in orange county and also in texas and i believe in virginia it is great to see the strides that they have made as an immigrant community here in the united states but the truth of the matter is that the people especially people back in orange county and around here that are vietnamese americans are still worried about the situation in vietnam we know that the people of vietnam awaken every day under a very harsh and repressive regime and events such as the vietnam freedom march remind those of us here in washington that even 30 years after the fall of saigon there remains much to be done before the vietnamese people can enjoy the freedom and the liberty that we here in america often take for granted i hope that my colleagues will work with me and with the vietnamese community of the united states to work on the human rights issues still left there in vietnam they came here because they were seeking freedom and liberty we fought and we lost 58 000 americans in that war trying to find

gentleman for yielding i rise to oppose the legislation which is the congressional response to the supreme court decision kelo v city of new london by enacting this legislation we are undermining the states rights and assuming the role of a city council we should not change federal law every time members of congress disagree with the judgment of a locality when it uses eminent domain for the purpose of economic development we were elected to the united states congress not to local city councils mr chairffian it is impossible for congress to draw a bright line principle separating those cases in which economic development is appropriate for a particular area and when it is not the constitution does require that the taking be for public use it is the role of a city council to weigh the needs of a particular community and consider when the government should use eminent domain sometimes that might mean taking property for the purpose of economic development sometimes it may not sometimes we will agree with the judgment of the locality sometimes we will disagree i cannot think of a more fitting example of the quagmire this bill presents than the situation we have right here in washington d c where they are trying to build a baseball stadium i find it ironic that at the same time we are marking up the bill washington d c is using eminent domain to build a baseball stadium the debate on this bill has already exposed the shortcomings of the legislation for example we found that if a stadium were built and owned by the city at taxpayer expense it would clearly be allowed under the bill on the other hand if the owner offered to build a stadium at his own expense that might not be allowed the bill requires public access to the stadium as a matter of right does that mean that the skyboxes must be put to public auction or can the owner pick and choose which businesses can acquire rights to skyboxes anybody who surveys baseball or football stadiums around the country will find all kinds of public and private and joint publicprivate ownership combinations could some use eminent domain while others be prohibited from using eminent domain based on the fact that they want to limit access to skyboxes or how the title of the stadium is held the world trade cen ter and lincoln center in new york the baltimore inner harbor even president bushs baseball stadium in houston texas were all made possible by eminent domain takings for the purpose of economic development and although we might agree or disagree with the wisdom of these projects most would agree that they should not have been illegal these are political decisions that ought to be left to the localities within the confines of their state legislatures parameters if congregs cannot leave eminent domain to the states then we should focus on the real issues involved in eminent domain we should require for example that just compensation should include replacement cost not just technical appraisal value we should require that relocation expenses be paid to owners and tenants as written the bill does nothing to ensure that displaced individuals receive reasonable compensation for the replacement value and relocation expenses the bill does nothing to ensure compensation for loss of goodwill of a business nothing to ensure that due consideration is given for the length of time a family or business has been at a particular location nothing in the bill deals with the fact that the poor and minorities are usually the victims of eminent domain abuses let us put some protections in the bill so that those who are relatively weak politically can be protected from unfair use of eminent domain i would like to place in the record at this point letters from the national league of cities the national conference of state legislatures and the national association of housing and redevelopment officials i believe that the decisionmaking power of eminent domain should remain at the state and local level and that congressional attempts to define when eminent domain is reasonable and when it is not will cause more problems than they solve therefore i urge my colleagues to oppose

representative loforen we are writing to express our support for changing federal policy on human embryonic stem cell research to allow an expansion in available cell lines as you probably know a vote on legislation that would alter current policy is expected in the coming weeks and we urge your yes vote embryonic stem cells hold the potential for new cures and therapies for an array of lifethreatening diseases affecting millions of americans across the nation this potential will be enhanced by the bipartisan stem cell research enhancement act introduced by representatives michael castle rde and diana degette dco and cosponsored by more than 200 members of the house of representatives the castledegette bill would expand current policy to allow federal funding for research with stem cell lines discovered after the mandated august 9 2001 cutoff date as well as lines derived in the future with regard to future stem cell lines the bill applies only to lines derived from daysold blastocysts that otherwise would be discarded from in vitro fertilization clinics but that instead are voluntarily donated to research by consenting individuals without compensation further this legislation would ensure the development of ethical guidelines for research with embryonic stem cell lines california has moved ahead by establishing the institute for regenerative medicine which will devote 3 billion to embryonic stem cell research over the next ten years the provisions within h r 810 are more restrictive than those of the california initiative however h r 810 is crucial because it will make a significant difference to nationwide federal research programs this expansion in policy will further facilitate and accelerate the research conducted in our state when the current federal embryonic stem cell research policy went into effect in 2001 the notion was that 78 cell lines would be available for research currently only 22 are actually available to researchers many others have been found unsuitable furthermore a number of the available lines are entangled with commercial interests making the cells too expensive or impossible for nihfunded investigators to obtain for these reasons the existing embryonic stem cell lines do not provide a sufficient supply to advance the research to its full potential embryonic stem cells offer the potential to reverse diseases

including the following an assessment of the number of troops it will take to secure the peace and how those troops would be rotated key measures of political stability such as ratification of a national constitution and permanent national elections now scheduled for next year the estimated strength of the iraqi insurgency and the extent to which it is composed of noniraqi fighters the

measured by unemployment levels utility availability and oil production rates the fact is that our longterm presence in iraq will only give our enemies in the region a greater ability to recruit

kind of a tough act to follow but i would like to state for the record that the judiciary committee because it has such a vast jurisdiction and an awful lot of controversial legislation that by working with mr conyers and the members of the minority and having the majority and minority staff work together we knew that there were some philosophical differences on many of the pieces of legislation that could not be bridged without a vig orous debate and votes both in committee and on the floor of the house of representatives but the cooperation and the respect and the trust that we had across the aisle were able to narrow those differences so that what we did debate were true differences in approach and true differences in policy i keep on telling the high school classes that i talk to about what really goes on here that 95 percent of the bills that we pass are worked out in committee and the debate and votes on the floor merely ratify decisions that have been made earlier in committee the problem is that compromise agreement and i would even submit accomplishment do not get any media attention it is allegations of misconduct actual knock out drag down fights in those areas that we do have disagreements on that really monopolize the news media e 1615 as a result people get the wrong impression that all we do out here is fight and argue amongst ourselves and while we do a lot of that and i think the framers of the constitution intended the congress of the united states to do that the tremendous work product of the committee over the last 6 years i think has been due in large part by the trust and respect and agreement that we have had in working across the aisle and while i was sitting here listening to the debate i was going through the calendars of the house of representatives looking at the number of committee reports we filed and i think it is somewhere in the 90 to 100 number range during this congress and a lot of these reports were really on controversial and complicated legislation where we needed to have a committee report to explain what the intent of congress was and that type of cooperation allowed us to have that tremendous output

consideration of the foreign relations bill it firmly establishes the precedent that this house will not consider legislation on the floor if it exceeds the levels established by the budget resolution this choice will not make us heroes it will not win us accolades in the washington post but it does show that we will stick to our budget disciplines and rise to commend chairman dreier and the rules committee for this very important decision by way of explanation as originally reported by the committee on international affairs the bill increases mandatory spending by 103 million over 5 years specifically the bill as reported would allow the state department to automatically spend leftover funds on other purposes without further legislative action traditionally these transfers are subject to appropriations but the reported bill eliminated that requirement as a result the bill converted discretionary spending to mandatory at a time when we are trying to restrain mandatory spending this increase in mandatory spending breaches the spending limit or allocation established for the ir committee in the budget resolution in technical terms this violates section 302 f of the budget act which precludes the house from considering a bill that exceeds the 302 a allocation of the committee that reported the bill now the rules committee could have let this slide the rule could simply have waived the budget act restriction and let the authorizing committee fix the problem through a floor amendment after all many will say it wasnt really a large amount of money to worry aboutand hardly anyone would have noticed anyway while that step might have fixed the problem with this particular bill it would have done it the wrong way the principle underlying the congressional budget process is that we should not consider bills on this floor until they comply with spending limits established in the budget resolution in other words the burden is on the committee reporting the bill to comply with the budget before the measure reaches the floor if compliance were left to a floor amendment or a subsequent point of order it would cost budgetary commitment to the winds of the momentwhich is no commitment at all chairman dreier and the rules committee have shown the appropriate kind of leadership they have upheld this important principle of fiscal discipline once again i commend chairman dreier and the rules committee for enforcing the budget resolution and upholding the integrity of the budget process we may not win any medals for this we wont get to brag about it to chris matthews

referendum in october right on schedule on october 15 millions of citizens from iraqs eighteen provinces stood together to vote on a document that will guarantee and protect their rights and serve as a blueprint for their nations future in this latest vote 63 percent of iraqs 15 5 million registered voters once again defied the threat of terrorist attacks and voted the result 78 percent of voters

come to the meeting several report that they were shot at in total about 130 women were in attendance these women were thankful i told them that the folks back home want to know if the iraqis appreciate what america has done they do and they also realize the price that many americans have paid they said that they are mothers and wives themselves and they know that mothers in america have lost sons and wives have lost husbands the military has seen its share of successes as well these successes began with the swift removal of saddam hussein from power and his ensuing capture and have continued through the creation of iraqi security forces one by one iraqi army battalions have stood up and joined the fight to defend their homeland by the end of october a total of 206 500 iraqi
