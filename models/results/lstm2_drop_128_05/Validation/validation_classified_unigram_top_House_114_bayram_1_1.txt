iran from developing a nuclear weapon the agreement will shut irans pathways to developing the necessary fissionable material for a nuclear bomb for at least 15 years the inspection and verification procedures against illicit plutonium production or uranium enrichment are airtight the questions that have been raised about inspection proceduresthe socalled side deals the alleged selfinspectiondo not relate to the central issue of production of fissionable material and without fissionable material you cannot make a bomb even after 15 years when some of the restrictions will be eased we would still know instantly about any attempt to make bomb materials because the inspectors and the electronic and photographic surveillance will still be there the options available to a future president for stopping iran then would be better than the options available now if the deal is rejected because we would have more access instant intelligence and more knowledge of the iranian program the argument that if we reject the deal we can force iran back to the negotiating table and obtain a better deal is a fantasy it is not a viable alternative the other countries that have joined us in

fighting the disease it has a deep and lasting impact on family friends and communities currently more than 100 different types of cancer exist but in my humble opinion none is more wicked than breast cancer this is most likely because breast cancer is one of the most common and deadly cancers among women in fact one in eight women in america will be diagnosed with breast cancer in her lifetime breast cancer can be a cruel disease it tears mothers from their children wives from their husbands and daughters from their parents in 2015 it is anticipated that in our country alone more than 40 000 women will die from breast cancer while women are most at risk we must remember that this disease does not just affect women while less common in the united states 2 350 men are diagnosed with breast cancer each year in the past 20 years there have been incredible advances in the research and medicine surrounding breast cancer but there is much left to be done we cant rest until we can prevent or cure this horrible disease again we have already made huge strides in the fight against breast cancer death rates due to breast cancer have been declining since 1989 and women younger than 50 are now less likely to get breast cancer than ever before this is largely due to the awareness that has been raised on the importance of selfexams and yearly doctor physicals however currently 29 percent of insured women are still not receiving mammograms and for women without health insurance the percentage is even higher with 68 percent not receiving mammograms it is extremely important that we continue to place an emphasis on early detection so that we can catch this disease as early as possible and have the best shot at beating it while there are factors like genetics and age that can make someone more susceptible to the disease breast cancer does not discriminate against education upbringing or wealth from ceos in new york city to a stayathome mom in small town minnesota this disease knows no bounds i expect that just about everyone who walks these halls and too many to count across our country have been impacted by breast cancer in some way i am no exception fifteen years

the people making more of our transportation decisions i dont think anyone is going to sit here and claim that the transit and highway system as it is done up here in washington is being done well it is chronically underfunded we are using all kinds of budget gimmicks in this bill we are doing the strategic petroleum reserve again to quote unquote pay for this somehow you are taking oil at 50 a barrel and you are projecting it to be sold for 85 a barrel so we know we have been through this a lot here i think part of the problem is if you look at our infrastructure needs most of them are intrastate not necessarily interstate and while the interstate system is very important and it needs to be maintained expanded where appropriate most of the needs that we have in a state like florida can be done at the county level or at the state level i would note that since we have had the highway trust fund since 1956 florida has paid a lot in taxes and we received about 88 cents on the dollar back so i am trying to figure out why we would want to perpetuate a system that is not fiscally sustainable and that puts more power in washington think about it most of your needs are done countywide citywide and statewide and yet people in a state like florida will pay their gas taxes that will be shipped up to washington people will fight over it politicians lobbyists and interest groups and then the money that comes back is 88 cents on the dollar i would like to send the gas tax to washington that is going to fund the actual interstate system but then leave a portion of the gas tax for state legislatures to spend or for people in local governments to spend i think you would be able to do it cheaper i think it would be more accountable to the taxpayers and i think it would be better for motorists and people who are using our transportation system so all this does it is not binding i wish we could have done something binding but there are different budget rules what it does is lay
