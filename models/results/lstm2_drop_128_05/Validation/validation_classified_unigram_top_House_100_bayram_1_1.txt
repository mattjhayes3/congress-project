accordingly the president included this bill to require reporting of foreign ownership in a list of matters which would force him to veto the trade bill accordingly to avoid the veto house resolution 5410 in substance was dropped as an amendment to the trade bill we are here today because of a strong feeling by a majority of the members of the house that it is time that we begin to address

significant foreign investment in the united states to give us the kind of data we need to be able to tell us where we stand every other nation in the world requires this data and much more most of them also require preclearance requirements put limitations on investment and all sorts of restrictions on foreign investment we do not propose that here today we simply say in this bill we need basic data on which to base the decisionmaking with regard to foreign ownership in the united states we do not have it today the bill does not duplicate existing law existing law has been proven and is regarded by all observers to be completely inadequate in terms of giving us any type of inventory regarding foreign ownership the bill simply says that owners of a significant interest of more than 5 percent in a unitedstates business or real estate property valued at over 5 million must report basic information about who they are where they are from the size of their percentage with regard to companies in which a controlling interest of over 25 percent is bought if that company is worth more than 20 million they then have to report more extensive data which even then is far less than publicly held companies now have to report to the securities and exchange commission this is a reasonable approach we badly need it we have a debate underway in this country with regard to what i said

thinly veiled attempt to kill the mx or any other type of weapon system that might be deployed in a rail garrison basing mode what is wrong with the rail garrison concept the answer is nothing as i have said in general debate we have tried for a long time to come up with a successful survivable basing mode for unitedstates icbms we considered the multiple protective system to hide a number of icbms in a large number of holes in the ground mps failed for political reasons we considered the racetrack basing mode racetrack also failed the list goes on and on we have presently put our mx missiles in minuteman iii silos which are fixed identified targets for political reasons this is the best that we could come up with we continuously hear that opponents of mx oppose it because it is vulnerable in a fixed silo so why not harden it the fact is you cannot adequately harden missile silos because improvements in missile accuracy will overcome silo hardness every time you cannot adequately harden a silo against a direct hit or a near hit of a nuclear weapon just as we have increased our missile accuracy so too have the soviets so we know we must have a more survivable system to reiterate the defense department has been attempting to develop such a survivable system they came up with an idea of housing it in and launching it from an airplane this idea fell by the wayside they came up with the idea of burying missiles thousands of feet under ground so that when the shooting was over it could dig itself out and be launched we have considered numerous schemes some good some bad at present the administration has come up with a basing mode similar to that the soviets are using on their ss24s the soviets have built and are in the process of deploying a rail mobile ss24 missile system they do not worry about public opinion in the soviet union so their mobile systems are not even stationed in garrisons but as the soviets realize and our own intelligence experts tell us there is no way you can target all rail mobile systems you cannot be sure where they all are all the time this is what we are proposing to do with rail garrison except we will station them in garrisons until such time as there is a threat rail garrisoned missiles will not be roaming the rail network during peacetime rail garrison is similar to how we dis perse our aircraft in times of an alert and similar to how we plan to disperse our small mobile missile when deployed in the event of a soviet nuclear attack we will have some warning time and it does not make any difference if we can only disperse them 5 miles 50 miles or 500 miles you have built in an uncertainty factor and a survivability factor so that a potential enemy could never be sure that a first strike will be successful this is what congress asked and the scowcroft commission recommended the defense department to dobuild a more survivable system the money is in here because the members of the committee thought it the responsible thing to do we are going forward to develop the concept although the mx will fit on it the small mobile will also fit on it as will any followon missile but we are only developing a concept and the committee has approved 250 million for this which incidentally is a reduction of about 250 million from what the administration requested we would like to develop the concept in no way is rail garrison a threat to the small mobile missile in fact the small mobile missile could ultimately be deployed on this rail concept please do not deny the department of defense the capability of developing this concept this is a research and development program to develop the rail garrison concept so that in time of crisis or even war we could disperse a percentage of our icbms as we would disperse the small mobile missile our bombers and the other strategic systems rail garrison makes sense it is what we have been working toward it is less expensive than the alternatives that have been

gen draza mihailovich general mihallovich first fought the nazi invaders from 1941 until his country was overrun by the soviet union at the end of the war he then was captured tried in a communist show trial and later executed this was not because he was a collaborator but becasue he stood up and fought for freedom he not only opposed the nazis but he saw the evils of communism as well it is quite remarkable that during the war he received next to nothing from the allies yet still remained an ally during the war years from 1941 through 1945 he distinguished himself by saving the lives of over 500 allied airmen who had been shot down over enemy territory furthermore mihailovich and his chetnik fighters were reportedly responsible for decimating 22 nazi divisions in the serbgreece area

available for reporting to the public through the routine information provided by the national weather service of noaa our local weather reporters could then voluntarily choose to report the average weekly acidity of rainfall this information on rainfall measured by the ph of wet deposition is currently collected by noaa and other federal agencies on a weekly basis at over 200 sites across the country since taxpayers are paying for the collection of this data it is the intentioh of this amendment that the public be informed on the results again i wish to emphasize that the federal government is collecting this information now on a weekly basis and my amendment does not authorize noaa to do any additional data collection there is precedent for this amendment as an earlier version of it was offered in 1984 by my predecessor from new hampshire former congresman norman damours and accepted by the house of representatives rainfall ph reporting is already done on a daily basis by our fieighbors to the north in canada in many cities across the country our local weather stations already report the air quality index or smog index since the federal government is collecting this data where does this information go right now why isnt it available right now the data is centralized at the department of energy pacific northwest laboratory and complied and correlated on a yearly basis as part of the 10year national acid precipitation assessment or napap program it is available to the public upon request which is fine for research purposes but the average american probably would not be aware of this information what other agencies besides noaa which is a cochair of the napap program are collecting this data ph is being collected at over 200 sites across the country run by noaa epa department of agriculture and the national park service my amendment would require these agency sites to notify the weather service offices in their regions by phone each week to report the ph measurement collected for that week november20 198 c b as i mentioned earlier in my remarks an earlier version of this amendment passed the house back in january 1984 what happened to the damours of new hampshire amendment well first the damours amendment differed from the one before us today in two significant aspects first the damours amendment required daily ph reporting my amendment requires this to be done weekly consistent with our collection efforts second the damours amendment required reporting of dry deposition data as well as wet deposition data the damours amendment passed the house but was dropped in conference with the senate to be consistent with the work currently being done i have worked directly with noaa in ironing out the language of this amendment the agency has informed me that there is no significant cost and no technical problems in implementing my amendment simply the cost of a phone call i believe publication of this information would be helpful for purposes of public education like air quality and smog levels rainfall ph is a useful index of environmental awareness this is valuable information we are taking the

secretary is in question i believe that phone number as you know is now the law of the land because it was voted on obediently by the members on the other side of course i will have to say this to my friend from michigan they learned having voted for grammlatta which they regretted and which they lost seats over in 1982 they are not voting for any more presidents budgets you know in the 7 years i have been here the presidents budget has come up twice on the floor no republican has ever offered ronald reagans budget beginning in 1982 mr gray offered the fiscal 1987 budget last year the vote was 312 to 12 against it seventyeight republicans voted present in 1984 our late colleague not late as a human being just late as our colleague the gentleman from colorado who has now gone to the senate he offered the presidents budget and it lost 401 to 1 i do not know who the one republican was who stood by his man in 1984 because that was an election year so they were a little nervous about that the republicans have abandoned the presidents budget they no longer want to have anything to do with it by the way it is not because it does not have enough spending one of the arguments that we have got is that the president portrays himself as the person who is preventing congress from spending more the fact is that since ronald reagan became president congress has appropriated virtually the exact amount that ronald reagan has asked for virtually the exact amount in most years we appropriate marginally less in a couple of years more there is 1 year out of the 7 when there was a significant a statistically significant difference for fiscal 1983 at a time when we were in a deep recession congress voted 12 billion more than the president asked at a time when the budget was about 500 billion so 12 million out of 500 billion about a 2percentplus increase that is because we thought we should respond to the misery of the recession and the president thought you would respond to that in a different way other than that more often than not congress has underappropriated and the totals for the 7 years of ronald reagan sending in budgets including up to this year with supplementals and everything else are virtually identical there is no question the president honestly believes that he has sent in lower budgets and congress has voted more than he has requested focusing on detail we are told is not one of ronald reagans great strengths that is an enormous understatement focusing on the facts is not one of ronald reagans moderate strengths he does not i think understand i do not think he consciously misleads but the fact is indisputable the amount appropriated by the congress half of which of course was republican during his first 6 years but the amount appropriated has been essentially what he has asked for the totals are minimal according to the table i have here from the appropriations committee the presidents budget requests came to 3 572 289 000 000 and we appropriated 3 557 000 000 000 so we are talking about a 15 billion difference where congress voted less the only year where congress voted significantly more statistically more was fiscal 1983 that was a vote taken in early in 1982 in the middle of tough recession so congress has voted less than the president asked for why are we in such a difficult situation probably because of the unprecedented defense buildup but we are in a particular problem right now with regard to grammrudman deficit targets because ronald reagan said the economy would grow by about 4 percent per year and he has simply been wrong and that is a sad fact i wish it were not the case i wish we had economic growth so that there were not unemployed people in the big cities and we did not have the misery we have on the farms we did not have people who are hurting the way they are but we have it to pretend that we have that revenue when we do not is a mistake we have a 39 billion gap in revenue by the way the president then says well we are never going to raise taxes he is going to raise taxes he calls them a little bit different the president in his budget to reach his 108 does include increases in money that people pay the government to the tune of about 7 5 billion in new fees or increased fees 2 4 he says in increased tax enforcement he is looking for the people to pay the government 10 billion more than they otherwise would have he does not want to call them taxes i understand that when he released a russian spy in return for nick daniloff he did not want to call that a swap when he sent arms to the iranians in the hope that they would let some hostages come forward he did not want to call that a trade ronald reagan does not like to call things by their names he is a man of great semantic delicacy if in his hour of travail that gives him comfort who are we to deny him that comfort the fact is that he is asking the public to cough up another 10 billion now some of us have suggested maybe we could cough up even a little bit more maybe up to 18 to 20 the republicans have said in one level no but there was an interesting thing in their treaty proposal actually i think we i was surprised that it was the gentleman from ohio mr latta who was approaching mr gramm i would have thought they would have sent us max kampelman or general rowney these people have not been able to get any agreements with the russians and so there would have been no danger of getting any agreement with the chairman of the budget committee see i do not think they wanted an agreement remember again where we are we have a budget deficit target of 108 billion in grammrudman overwhelmingly supported by the republican side it came out of the republican senate it was always a difficult target to hit it has been made virtually impossible to hit it by the reagan shortfall in economic growth so the president sends us a budget which he says meets the target and nobody believes him cbo says is off by a factor of about 25 percent or more the republicans show their respect for their president by refusing to offer the presidents budget it is the absent actor in this scene you know there is a sherlock holmes novel i always like to be accurate on the floor in this piece of fiction at one point watson says holmes how did you know that such and such happened holmes says it was the dog watson and watson in his usual idolatrist incredulity says but holmes the dog did not do anything and holmes in his kind of superiority said ahha the fact that the dog did not bark was significant that is how he solved the crime well we apparently have some selfstyled fiscal watchdogs on the republican side and here came the presidents budget and guess what nobody barked we got the presients budget and he says i have got the solution to the 108 billion it has not been offered in the budget committee maybe it is going to be offered on the floor but if history is our guide it will not be because the republicans have never offered the presidents budget on the floor since i have been here and only 12 of them voted for it the last time they thought it was a dirty trick so that is where we are with regard to their own view of how they do things the question now is how do we deal with this particular budgetary problem the question some of us have raised is well maybe we should have more revenues the president asked for the public to pay 10 billion more he also says he is going to get an additional 10 billion and i think one of my colleagues the gentleman from florida is going to address this by asset sales asset sales in which you exaggerate the amount of money you are going to get you damage the future income stream of the government you do a lot of shortterm gimmicry these asset sales make very very poor fiscal sense and the president is talking about them then we have the republicans have well they have sent two letters they sent a march 18 letter to mr gray and then apparently they renegotiated among themselves and they have a new condition here and this is interestingly worded no provision in the budget resolution provides for any adjustment in individual or corporate income tax rates well you know there are a lot of other taxes that are at the individual and corporate income tax rates we are not hearing too many proposals for raising the corporate tax rates right now there was a proposal made to raise the income tax rates at the highest level but there are other things that can be done we could raise cigarette taxes i think a lot of people would like to see cigarette taxes raised apparently the republicans say that is absolutely out of the question we can close loopholes when the republican party says absolutely no tax increases except the 10 billion the president asked for and you see what happens is when the president asks for them they are no longer tax increases when the president says make old people on medicare pay more for their medicare that is ok that is not a tax increase 0 1550 he talks about repealing some of the gasoline tax exemptions that some people have he wants to make state and local employees pay more for medicare even though they may never get medicare he has got an increased tax on tips on coal production he has other small tax increases here and there he would particularly increase the amount you have to pay if you want to get government help buying a home at a time when home ownership is too high so 10 billion of what the president wants to do comes from more money from the public from us 10 billion of its comes from asset sales which are kind of phony by the way those account for the 108 billion that is the way he gets to the 108 billion even with those he is still way off but i guess the question i would ask the republicans when they say no tax increases at all i guess dynasty is a relevant literary analogy here maybe the tax debate of last year was a dream and we are all going to wake up and emerge from it we passed a tax bill last year which i voted for in the end it had large bipartisan support but even its most enthusiastic supporters have never argued that it got rid of all loopholes what the people who tell us no taxes at all are saying is that we have a perfect tax code you do not have to increase equity that is nonsense there continued to be everybody knows that there are all kinds of deals and trades that is the nature of this process there are all kinds of places in that tax code where without raising tax rates on the average person or on the average business you could easily raise 15 billion to 20 billion only those who believe we have a perfect tax code people who think raising cigarette taxes is going to be a terrible idea i think most americans think the other way around there was a little special deal that was put in voted by democrats the former chairman of the committee the gentleman from louisiana on the senate side where if you give money to a employee stock option plan you do not have to pay any taxes that was done in a rather poor fashion and it could cost us billions of dollars we could knock that one out we could close that one out that is not going to hurt the economy there are tax loopholes that can be closed all these things will be difficult to do we have a deficit to which all parties have contributed the president the senate the house we have overspent in some areas where i like spending we have underspend in some areas where i do not like spending we need a serious effort to collaborate we are not getting it one reason we are not getting it may have been indicated by pat buchanan pat buchanan was one of the presidents chief strategists he is the man who said that the greatest political vacuum in america was to the right of ronald reagan and that he was going to full it for awhile until i think he realized how happy the democrats were at the prospect but what he says is he just wrote this in newsweek that the president should not compromise with us because a fight is the best way to keep iran and nicaragua off the front pages we have a situation where the president is somewhat embarrassed and his top people are embarrassed by the revelations of the tower commission the revelations yet to come of the two special investigating committees of the special counsel now called the independent counsel which by the way the justice department will not tell us if it thinks it is constitutional we have something that has been on the books since 1978 the president signed a revision of it in 1982 the president signed it and we have asked the justice department if it is constitutional and they are a little bit offended to be asked these people who have prescribed fairly specific personal regulations for most americans appear to consider it an invasion of their privacy for the congress of the united states to ask them if they think this statute that they signed into law in a revised form in 1982 is constitutional they will not tell us why will they not tell us we know why it is because they think it is unconstitutional but they are embarrassed to say it is unconstitutional while so many of the presidents closest friends are under investigation"], [0.0011253058910369873, 0.498874694108963, 0, "let me just briefly say with respect to the photographs that were shown earlier today in the 1minute that there need to be a distinction made between those types of photographs that indicate clear signs of torture before they were ultimately killed and those that were victims of being in a combat zone because i would suggest that before we come across with these types of photographs suggesting that the contras have gone out and somehow systematically killed folks that we ought to be very careful because the truth of the matter is that it is impossible to engage in any type of war without there being innocent victims can my colleagues imagine for a moment what would have happened if just after world war ii or worse yet during world war il unitedstates news correspondents had shown on the evening news or just in the newsreels in the various movie theaters the bodies of individuals that were victims of our bombing germany and other places during world war ii we know for a fact that individuals when there is a war are going to be casualties but what bothers me is the suggestion that somehow these individuals were not in the areas for example one of the photographs this morning was from an airstrip an individual in a military target was killed i would have to say that when an individual goes into a known combat zone they certainly assume the risks i am just troubled by the fact that we are somehow separating these photographs and the suggestion of these photographs from the reality of what is going on in central america if my colleagues go back to the american revolution they will find that there were undoubtedly americans that were killed as part of a war war means that it is regrettable but the point here is there is war in central america not because of american intervention because let us remember under the carter administration we pumped over 100 million into the sandinista government before we learned that they were avowed communists at that time i think that they were the equivalent in terms of our policy with the philippines today we are doing exactly the same thing there has been a successful revolution we aided those individuals in their revolution and now we are seeking to help them establish a legitimate democracy we did exactly the same thing and it was not until the soviet union through their puppets whether it is the east germans or the cubans began the massive military buildup that caused even president carter to withdraw further aid and our president our current president to say we are not going to not only aid them any further we are going to try to help these individuals many of whom were original sandinistas who wanted a revolution who wanted to have free elections who wanted to have a free press who wanted to have freedom of religion all of whom quickly saw through daniel ortega and his communist friends and they left the ruling junta they left the communist government and they established the contras so the contras exist not because of american interventionalism in a military fashion but because of soviet interventionalism just as certainly as we saw the interventionalism in afghanistan i think that is a very critical point because somehow we want to ignore that very relevant period of history where the soviet union intervened in this area contrary to the monroe doctrine contrary to the truman doctrine and now suddenly we are blaming ourselves because of what the

evil and it cannot be supposed that any private person has more wisdom or a greater desire to serve his country than the executive of the united states it is very important to think about that what

consider h r 1720 which was passed by the house as its version of how the social security act should be amended with respect to aid to dependent children and the senate bill s 1511 which was passed in the senate these bills are radically different radically different not only in the amount of money that will be made available to implement the program with the house being almost twice the amount as the senate but also step by step in each central provision the senate bill represents a far different concept with respect to reform than the house bill it is very important that we take a close look at what is developing and what is lik r{ to develop in the conference crinmittee process in addition to tll senate bill being regressive and punitive and oppressive in addition to the senate bill wiping out benefits that have existed for 50 years and ignoring major problems that exist with respect to social security the social security of children the senate bill also has another important force behind it the president of the united states keeps making it quite clear that he will veto any bill that is not to his liking he is very concerned about even more punitive measures than the senate bill has he wants to spend even less money than the senate bill has this h r 1720 which many of us reluctantly voted for because we felt that there has to be reform at least this represents an ap proach which has a hunane intent at the center of it an approach which will emphasize jobs an approach which will emphasize education and provide the money for jobs training and education we voted for h r 1720 and h r 1720 is in danger of being wiped out completely and s 1511 instead will be the replacement s 1511 has another very important factor going for it the house of represen ativcs voted last week by a substantial margin to instruct the conferees to accept the amount of money in the semite bill as the amount of money that would be attached to the ultimate welfare reform bill so we have president reagan and we have the majority of the house even those members who voted for 1720 who decided that they wanted to save money above all we have a thousand ways to save money in this congress but we do not look to those ways we have a 1 billion ship in the persian gulf that shoots down the wrong planes and we could save money by bringing them home we could also save our own foreign policy we have fbi agents who are cruising libraries looking for spies we could save money by taking the fbi agents out of the libraries we could take the same fbi agents and assign them to the pentagon and more rapidly end the corruption and the waste there which is a multibilliondollar corruption and waste we can save billions of dollars but we do not prefer to look at those obvious ways of saving money we do not prefer to look where the money really is we are not as smart as willie sutton when he was asking why he robbed banks he said that is where the money is we do not look in the congress to the places where the money really is we look instead at those programs where people have no power the people who have no power will be closely scrutinized they will be investigated again and again but where the money really is in the pentagon for example we have to have a blunder we have to stumble upon the fact that there is massive corruption in the pentagon that they are selling plans and secrets on a wholesale basis somebody stumbled into that and an investigation got going what they have revealed already is what has been happening in the pentagon to waste our money which has been going on since the very beginning of this administration and that a very highlevel person is probably connected with it we are willing to put all of these things together and recognize that if we want to save money take the fbi agents and put them on the trail of the people who are selling pentagon secrets take them out of the libraries the fbi agents in the libraries cannot really discover much because all of the material in the libraries is available to the public the libraries purchase that material on the open market so the russians or whoever wants to get our secrets technological secrets whatever the fbi has determined they are looking for can go and buy them on the open market it appears also that they can go also and buy our secrets our most cherished secrets in the pentagon on some kind of market black market consultant underground market and that is where tile fbi should stop the flow of our secre s and save us money in the process the whole bidding process the whole corruption that goes on every time there is an obvious scandal we hear speeches being made by the people in charge that we definitely need reform they are now trying to get ahead of everybody else and say we always told you we need reform it is impossible with these processes to be constructed as they are and there not be waste and there not be corruption but we are not preoccupied with that in congress we do not have any bill to deal with that there has been no aggressive attack we do not even use the right language nobody calls it stealing over and over again we hear them talk about the misconduct in the pentagon nobody has talked about a threat to national security because of their selling secrets to each other they are not necessarily going to confine their selling to the people who are most patriotic they will sell to the highest bidder we are in the process of not speaking and acting honestly about the things that we say we consider most important saving money is most important when the welfare reform bill is on we want to squeeze it down to the last penny and save every penny but we are not concerned about saving money when it comes time to look at where the money really is in the pentagon we had a base closipr bill which was debated for quite a long time because in 10 years we have not closed a single military base where we obviously could save money but when it comes to people who are poor the recipients of afdc who have no power we are ready to beat up on them and squeeze as much as we can out of them the people who were the target of this amendment to the social security act the dependent children are grossly discriminated against what we have not talked about as we consider this welfare reform amendment to social security is the fact that there are nearly 7 million children who are recipients of aid to dependent children and who have in the last 10 years received a cut in their allocations in terms of buying power of the money they receive and they have gone down 33 percent that is 7 million children who are covered by aid to dependent children in the social security law on the other hand here is another group of children who are covered by the social security law those children covered in the social security law in the survivors benefits insurance program they are the same american children as the children covered in the aid to dependent children law they have received increases in the last 10 years tip 53 percent it has gone up 53 percent so that now the children who are covered under the social security survivors insurance are getting more than 350 a month about 390 a month average for children under the social security survivors insurance law while on tie other hand under the aid to dependent children they receive an average across the country of 150 150 versus 390 these are the same children they are all americans what is the difference most of the children under the aid to dependent children are children who are black or hispanic minority children they have no power they have no power i think the first step in any welfare reform which generally is interested in justice would be to address itself to the discrepancy between the amount of money received by children in one part of the social security act and the amount of money received by children in another part of the social security act but this is not on the agenda gets no consideration whatsoever as we go to the democratic convention also it might be interesting to note that in the platform of the democratic party there is not much attention being paid to what is happening to welfare reform not much attention is being paid to some other issues that relate very directly to the ability of poor people to survive on the minimum wage bill we have been talking behind the scenes for quite a number of weeks about a minimum wage bill that would increase the minimum wage just 50 cents between now and january 1989 for this paltry 50 cent increase we are not able to guarantee enough votes to guarantee passage if we really want to talk about welfare reform let us look at the fact that once we put people to work and that is the theme of welfare reform let us put people to work get them off the welfare rolls would they then make enough to survive the minimum wage is not enough to survive the minimum wage does not bring home enough for a parent with a child to survive we also have a bill called the abc bill which is for day care a massive day care bill which would actually provide child care for those women who do want to go out and work but do not have anywhere to leave their child we have a parental leave bill which has completely disappeared there is no discussion of it now anywhere in any significant circles in terms of putting it on the floor of the house and yet that would provide mothers with an opportunity after children are born or when children are sick to be able to take care of them better of course we have a plant closing bill that does at least begin to talk about treating people humanely when you throw them out of work but in general there are a number of issues july 13 1 988 that relate to the survival of the people on the bottom who need help from their government which are not being discussed at all no instead we are focusing on it r 1720 and s 1551 which are talking about ways in which we can squeeze this group of people who receive aid to dependent children how can we squeeze them and show the public that we are saving money how can we perpetrate in essence a fraud on the public because if we really wanted to save mloney there are other places to save money but this group has a great emotional attachment to them everybody wants to see people get off welfare and go to work everybody wants to see that happen the governors of the states of this country have talked for quite a long time now and they have pushed very hard to get welfare reform as a priority on the agenda of the congress and the president they have worked very hard in fact il r 1720 represents the best of the thinking of the governors of the country they pushed very hard because it is a highly visible political issue and they want to save money if they really wanted to save money and have more money for their states again the governors ought to organize their own committee to oversee the way in which the pentagon contracts are awarded or i can give them 15 or 16 other places in our government and our bureaucracy where they can look for where the money is to save really large amounts of money the governors know this is a highly charged and emotional issue you can win votes by screaming about putting people to work who are on welfare let us take a look step by step at what is happening between h r 1720 and s 1511 let us look at the benefit improvements first at the start of the 100th congress we were told that there was an emerging consensus on welfare reform and in that consensus liberals would accept more draconian working requirements and conservatives would accept improvements in the criminally low afdc benefits that are offered in most states let me repeat that there are criminally low afdc benefits offered in most states human beings cannot survive on the money offered in most states per child that is the reason why we have the great discrepancy between the children on afdc who receive an average of 150 a month and the children who are on social security survivors benefits the social security survivors benefits are paid directly by the federal government at a level which has been determined will guarantee the survival of a child provide enough food clothing and shelter we do not care what happens to the 7 million children across the states who are being forced to survive on criminally low benefits the conservatives said that they did care they would be willing to yield as the process has progressed however the already stringent work requirements have gotten worse the liberals in other words have agreed to more draconian work requirements but the promised benefit improvements have gone from the meager to the meaningless the conservatives in other words have not yielded at all in terms of steps to increase the amount of money that children have to survive on it is not clear that any bill enacted this year will not include any significant benefit improvement at all they will not be in any bill enacted this year any bill enacted this year will have the worst kinds of draconian work measures and the least benefits because it is under the pressure that i talked about before it is under the pressure of the white house our president says he will not sign a bill unless it has draconian the most punitive work requirements and also has the cheapest price tag that is the kind of pressure that the conference committee is laboring under they also have a vote which was taken in the house which says we want to come back closer to the senate figutre regardless of what that means il terms of human misery the whole process the whole discussion of a national minimum benefit a benefit similar to the one in the survivors insurance section of the social security act has been dismissed when the house welfare reform bill was first introduced and discussions first started it included a provision which established a national minimum afdc benefit level that all states would be required to meet this is needed to not only address the dramatic erosion in benefitsthe benefits have dropped an average of 33 percent in value since 1970 as i said beforebut also the wide disparity in benefits from one state to another a mother with two children in tennessee receives 4 54 a day 6 48 a day in kentucky and 12 26 a day in kansas however the federal poverty guidelines say that a mother needs in order to take care of a child 24 25 a day that is necessary in order to meet the minimum needs of the child 24 25 a day versus what tenncssee gives at 4 50 kentucky at 6 48 a day and kansas the most liberal i have cited here 12 26 a day a national minimum benefit would still give states wide latitude in setting their own benefit levels but it would assure lhat no state fails to meet the minimum basic needs of families with children who depend on afdc benefits to survive my colleagues know we have children out there who are wards of the government and they are receiving not enough food to provide for their proper growth and development and they become various kinds of problems later on the idea of a national benefit is not a wild radical idea that has just been proposed during the 1970s president nixon pressed for and he won enactment of a national minimum benefit for food stamps and ssi for the elderly and lhe disabled in response to widespread concern about the inadequacies of these benefits in some states that was under president nixon in 1970 those folks who say that poor people certain categories of people who have no one else to go to except to the present democratic party platform and who look to the democrats for progress should take note there have been some unusual things happening for the people on the bottom in prior administrations that were not necessarily voted in by those people in 1979 the house passed a 3 billion afdc benefits improvement bill that would have set a minimum afdc benefit though it had the support of such conservatives in the senate as john danforth and then senate majority leader howard baker the bill was not acted on by the senate in 1979 i think my colleagues know the democrats were in control of the senate this congress was supposed to be the congress in which the bold step would be taken and a minimum benefit would become law that was one of the ways they sold the whole idea of beginning the discussions of the welfare reform legislation but it did not even make it out of subcommittee the provision was deleted from h r 1720 and was replaced by some modest financial incentives to encourage states to at least make sure that afdc benefits did not erode any further and kept pace with inflation so the child who must survive in tennessee on 4 54 a day will receive if this legislation passes some assurances that the 4 54 a day which is already way behind the 24 25 a day that is necessary will be increased in accordance with inflation the senate on the other hand did not even try to include this token effort although many senators talked a great deal about how shamefully low afdc benefits are they did nothing in their bills to address this problem so you have a pressure on in the conference where even this protection for that erosion of the 4 54 a day will not be guaranteed because of the fact that the senate bill the cheaper bill is the one that is likely to be the model and have most of its features retained after the conference effort is over let us talk about another issue coverage of the unemployed twoparent family we talked about this for quite a number of years in 24 states unemployed twoparent families cannot receive any afdc benefits no matter how poor they are the only way these families can get any help at all from the government meeting their needs is for the father to leave home and for the family to break up in communities across the nation fathers who are laid off from their jobs and cannot find work after they have used up their 26 weeks of unemployment benefits have been forced to abandon their wives and children in order to have their wives and children fed everyone from stuart butler of the rightwing heritage foundation to the national council of catholic bishops agree that this is a destructive antifamily policy which must be changed in the 1979 benefits bill and again in 1985 and 1986 the house passed legislation requiring all states to extend afdc to unemployed twoparent families without controversy the senate and the white house at that time refused to go along the welfare reform bill passed by the house last year again called for extended afdc assistance to all twoparent families leaving it up to the states to decide how poor they must be to qualif y for aid or how much aid they could receive the senate welfare reform requires states to extend afdc to unemployed twoparent families for just 6 months just 6 months of the year and only if one of the parents works off the benefits in a workfare job states that now offer unemployed parent benefits without any work requirements would also be required to force all of their unemployed parent recipients to work off their benefits the senate bill in other words does not improve the benefits it is worse than current law it is more punitive than current law let us take a look at mandatory work requirements under current law all able bodied mothers of children ages 6 and up must participate in a job training program or they must work off their benefits in a workfare job in order to receive aid to dependent children most do not most of the able bodied mothers of children ages 6 and up do not participate in such a program why it is not because they are lazy it is because the federal government and the state governments have refused to provide enough money to serve even a majority of the mandatory participants in many states even those who actively seek job training cannot get help the house bill changes this law to require that mothers of children ages 3 and up and even down to age 1 if the state wants to do it must participate in training or take a workfare job for up to 20 hours a week in order to receive afdc or for their children to receive federal help mothers of schoolage children will be required to participate full time at the same time however the house recognizes the fact that as of right now and in the past the problem has been that there has been no money for job training or for jobs workfare jobs for these participants the house bill provides unlimited matching funds to the states for training and work programs that is for every afdc recipient the mother has to go to work there will be a program there will be an education program there will be a job training program paid for on an entitlement basis that is going to be provided the senate bill on the other hand expands the mandatory participation requirement still more mothers of preschool children and those down to age 1 if the state wishes will be required to participate for up to 24 hours a week in a training program or a workfare job and full time in an education program but unlike the house bill the senate bill sharply limits what can be spent on education and training programs to between 500 million and 1 billion while at the same time imposing participation quotas on every state every state must have a certain number of people participating requiring the states to enroll up to 22 percent of their mandatory participants and 100 percent of their unemployed parent participants in training activities or workfare jobs by 1993 what the senate bill means is that fewer resources will have to be spread over many more people fewer dollars must serve many more people and that insures that no recipient will get the kind of meaningful education or training that they need to find work there are jobs available jobs are available for people with certain skills who have certain kinds of education and training but in this senate bill the money will not be provided reluctantly i voted for hi r 1720 when it passed the house i saw the opportunity to have a backdoor jobs bill we had been unable in the last 7 years to get a meaningful job bill passed but this could be a backdoor jobs bill we could provide jobs to people through this entitlement provision it would allow for the financing of education programs job training programs and even some onthejob training programs that would be getting through the back door of welfare reform what we have always felt was necessary and will be very useful the job training program now the senate has wiped out that provision there will be no significant amount of money no impetus for job training programs mandatory participation is based on a selfserving lie we continue to put forward and perpetrate this lie that the unemployed do not want to work and will not work unless they are forced to do so half of the afdc recipients stay on welfare for less than 2 years less than onesixth stay on for the 8 years which is often cited many of those on it if provided with a job will be happy to get off as has been demonstrated in case after case when jobs are provided by forcing the afdc recipient the poorest of the poor to work off their benefits we require them to do something we do not ask anyone else who gets federal help to do we spend more on direct payments to farmers to keep them afloat than we do on afdc benefits but we do not ask farmers to work off their benefits we are going to spend 15 billion almost twice the amount of money we spend on afdc to bail out the texas savings and loan industry but we are not going to ask the bankers to work off the money when we in fact do not even require convicts in federal prisons to work off all the money we spend for their room and board but we want money which goes to children the parents of those children to work off the benefits mandatory participation will harm those whom afdc is designed to help children it is not possible to punish parents who refuse to work the myth that you can take away a portion of the benefits which are provided for the parent taking care of the children and not hurt the children is just that a myth it is not possible to punish parents who refuse to work by cutting welfare benefits and not also hurting their children for political reasons we continue to pretend that when a parent is santioned and monthly benefits are cut it really does not affect the children because the grant is only reduced by the amount of need that is supposed to go to the parent this is idiocy if you cut aid to a household you hurt everyone in it a sanctioned parent who decides whether the child gets food or not a sanctioned parent does not suddenly stop eating that parent will not deny herself food the likelihood is that for the duration of the sanctions that parent will give less food to the child a sanction does not stop a landlord from evicting the entire family when they do not have the money to pay the rent the entire family goes as a result the children definitely suffer the children will go hungry the children will be denied necessary shelter and will be denied clothing whatever that money was to buy the parent is not going to just cutwill not abide by the rules and only cut what they were losing as a result of sanctions in most cases these sanctions will be imposed for no good reasons the theory is that benefits will be cut only when someone absolutely refuses to participate but in the real world they are more often imposed as a result of misunderstandings letters lost in the mail and other bureaucratic foulups for example since just 1985 30 percent of the people required to p rticipate in new york citys welfar work program have been sanctioned f this 30 percent 98 percent of thtwe sanctioned were later put back on the rolls because they admitted they had made an error the sanctions were unjustified or the sanctions were as a result of an error hearings were held and they determined in those hearings that the bureaucracy was at fault and not the people who had been sanctioned the senate welfare bill also does not offer any meaningful training mandatory participation might be acceptable if meaningful job training and education programs were going to be offered it is now clear however that any reform bill enacted this year will not offer that kind of help instead it is going to hurt the afdc recipients by not giving their parents the training take education for example lack of education is the greatest obstacle to selfsufficiency for most welfare recipients in new york city an estimated 17 percent of afdc recipients read at or below eighth grade level onethird read below the fifth grade level but only a fraction of those who want to enroll in an education program are able to do so at this time there are enormous waiting lists of welfare recipients who want to enroll in educational programs but the money is not there to provide for the programs though education is definitely the greatest need we all admit from liberals to conservatives we all iinderstand it is the greatest need of welfare recipients this is the problem which receives the least attention from new york and almost every other state in the nation the house bill tries to correct this problem it tries to correct this inexcusable lack of attention to education it requires that states offer every participant who does not have a high school diploma the opportunity to participate in an educational program which addresses their educational needs before they are required to enroll in any other program in other words education needs must be met first you cannot pretent that there are jobs out there which exist for a person who cannnot qualify for those jobs you must meet their educational needs first and the house bill requires this and provides the money for it the senate bill on the other hand differs little from the present law it requires that states offer some kind of educational service to participants without a diploma but only if the participant is under age 22 most adult welfare recipients are not under age in requiring that this be offered it is only if the state has an available slot in an existing educational program even then only if the state decides that it is appropriate for these people to go to school and if a participant does not do well in school the state can force them to drop out and take a workfare job or do something else instead in other words under the senate bill a state can offer educational services to only 25 participants at a time and still comply with the law someone who cannot even read or write can be forced through this method into a workfare job for years while they are waiting for an educational slot to become available to become vacant let us take a look at the workfare program what they call community work experience under current law states can force afdc receipients to work off their benefits in unpaid government jobs for as long as they remain on welfare only nine states now have such programs however we only have nine states for one important reason they find it does not work it does not help anyone find a real job all of the research on this workfare program community work experience program all the research tells us that the program does nothing to help get people off welfare states have tried it and they have abandoned it in many cases workfare assignments are demeaning make work jobs such as handing out flyers on street corners filling soap dispensers and wandering around parking lots washing cars in many cases they are more effective at humiliating people rather than building the skills they need to find a job in other cases the state and local governments have used the workfare program to displace and to undercut the wages of state and local government employees by forcing the workfare participants to perform jobs usually performed by civil servants and for which they should be paid a regular salary such as in new york city where the civil service jobs of pest control aides and custodians are now being done for free by workfare participants the best example of the fundamental unfairness of workfare is the case of one michigan man who lost his job making 13 000 a year as a dog catcher when the michigan city had to make a budget cut he lost his job but he got his job back under ceta for 9 000 a year and then after ceta was eliminated he was ordered to do the same job once again under the workfare progam and this time 6 000 was his annual welfare payment in other words this man is now doing the same work he has always done only now he is receiving less than half the pay he went from 13 000 a year down to 6 000 under workfare we should take a close look at what we are doing and consider the words involuntary servitude when we have programs of this kind we can enslave our own population when we have programs of this kind the ilousc bill reforms workfare to eliminate some of these abuses in the program and it tries to insure that it is only used in ways which help recipients to build skills that they will need to get a real job an ongoing regular job dead end make work jobs are prohibited every workfare assignment must develop marketable skills or be integrated into a regular training program which does provide for those skills in tho house bill only those recipients who really need some kind of work experience would be assigned to workfare those who already have some work experience but need job training or education or help in locating a real job could not be forced into a workfare assignment but instead job training and education or job placement would be provided workfare assignments would no longer be open ended and would be limited to a maximim of 3 months for 30 hours a week or 6 months if the number of hours of work was based on the size of the grant in the holse bill the weak protections against the use of workfare to steal the jobs of regular workers would be significantly strengthened along the lines of the kind of protections which now govern work experience and onthejob training provided under the job training partnership act equal pay would have to be paid for equal work if an afdc recipient was assigned to do exactly the same job being done by a regular employee he would have to be paid the same wages the senate bill on the other hand takes a completely different approach rather than reforming the one program we know does not help afdc recipients achieve selfsufficiency it expands this program it expands workfare whereas only nine states have found that it works and found that it is worth keeping and a minority of counties and cities in other states now use it the senate bill would essentially require every state every county and every city to immediately establish large workfare programs there would be no limitations on these workfare programs workfare assignments would not have to develop any skills they could be any deadend makework assignment the bureaucrats can think of the jobs could go on forever there would be no time limits an afdc recipient could take a job from a regular civil servant they would not have to be given equal pay they could sit side by side with a regular government employee doing exactly the same work but get far less in wages there are numerous organizations that supported h r 1720 the bill that passed the house and those organizations are opposed to s 1511 those organizations are opposed to a conference process which is going to guarantee that s 1511 is the kind of bill we get we are going to get the provisions of s 1511 and not the provisions of h r 1720 the organizations i refer to include these acorn afscme american civil liberties union american friends service committee catholic charities united church of christ office for church in society unitedstates catholic conference womens economic agenda project of california womens equity action league and the ywca the list goes on and on numerous organizations have recognized that some reform might be useful that some changing of the social security act would be in order reluctantly they went along with h r 1720 they accepted the fact that it did not really live up to the promises of providing more benefits in exchange for accepting more punitive work requriements they went along with it they went along with the fact that the child care provisions were not as strong as they wanted them to be they went along with the fact that the education provisions were not as strong as they wanted them to be the benefits were far too little the total amount of money available even in the house bill was far too little but they went along with it they tried to cooperate but now we see a far more regressive bill in s 1511 and while we are sleeping while we are off at the democratic party convention while we are praising the democratic party as being the party of the people the party for justice all of these abuses arc going to be codified and all of these abuses are going to be for the first time in 50 years placed in the social security act we are going to lose benefits and provisions for assistance that have been available for people for 50 years in a process that goes on without our attention we must strive in every way possible to avoid the passage of any welfare reform bill in this congress this congress should not go along with a process which guarantes that the most regressive kind of bill is the only bill we are going to be able to get with the president pressuring us and insisting he will veto any bill that does not have the most punitive work measures and supporting one with the least amount of money we are bound to get a bill very close to s 1511 we should not turn our backs on the people who make up a large constituency of the democratic party we should not turn our backs on the people for whom the social security act was written people in dire need should not be pushed around and moved toward a new kind of involuntary servitude we do not want the social security act to be multilated in that manner and the best way to avoid that is to stup the process let us not have a welfare reform bill in this congress let us wait for a new administration let us think more about the problems we have not dealt with and the gross discrimination about 7 million children for we provide far less for them in our social security act than we provide for others let us think more about the fact that our minimum wage is far too low people can survive better on welfare than they can on minimum wage because the minimum wage is too low let us consider the problem of homelessness because there is not enough affordable housing and people on welfare or on minimum wage cannot afford the housing that exists there are numerous questions that ought to be woven into the process of considering a humane and legitimate amendment of the social security act we have not done that s 1511 is a horror it is a disaster we should strive not to have the imprimatur of the president or this present administration on any welfire bill that sets back so many people for so many years we should strive i o just not have any
