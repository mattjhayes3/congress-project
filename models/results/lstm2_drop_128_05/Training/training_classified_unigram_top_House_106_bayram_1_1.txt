the unitedstates congress was also from the virgin islands and that was doctor governor and congressman melvin h evans who served from 1978 to 1980 before becoming ambassador to trinidad and tobago although women of african descent have been providing health care in our communities in this country from times of slavery it was not until 1864 that rebecca lee crumpler became the first woman to be awarded a doctorate of medicine in the united states she was a graduate of female medical college dr rebecca cole was the first black woman to graduate from womens medical college and by most accounts the second black woman physician in the united states she worked for a time with elizabeth blackwell who was the first white female physician in this country dr cole was soon followed by susan smith mckinney steward and sarah loguen fraser dr susan smith mckinney steward graduated from new york medical college in 1870 and was the first woman doctor of african descent in new york state and went on to be cofounder of the womens hospital and infirmary in brooklyn sarah loguenfraser who in 1876 received her md from syracuse university college of medicine was also one of the early african american women in medicine in this country there are so many outstanding women in medicine not all of whom are doctors and let me just tell you of a few more of them from the 19th century before talking about some of the outstanding women of this century the first african american woman to earn a doctor of dental surgery degree in 1890 was dr ida gray nelson rollins who was a graduate of the university of michigan dental school and she practiced in cincinnati and in the hometown of my colleague in chicago mary eliza mahoney is reported to have been the first black professionally trained nurse in the united states born in roxbury massachusetts she was employed as a maid at the local hospital before entering her training in addition to ms mahoneys notable activism within the field of nursing she was also a fervent supporter of womens suffrage and is said to have been one of the first black women in boston to have registered to vote i am a member too of the national medical association as my colleagues know and it has had several outstanding female presidents the first was dr edith irby jones who was the first african american to enter the university of arkansas school of medicine she graduated from that institution with an m d in 1952 and servedas the national medical association president in 1985 dr irby jones was later followed by dr vivian pinn in 1989 in that year the board was also chaired by a woman dr yvonne chris veal of new york who later went on to be the first woman to serve in both capacities when she became president of the nma in 1995 dr vivian pinn was also the first permanent director of the office of research on womens health at the national institutes of health where she still serves in that capacity in 1991 dr alma rose george of michigan became thethird woman to head this prestigious organization which represents theafrican american medical community two other of the many notable black women physicians are dr joycelynn elders who served as unitedstates surgeon general from september 1993 to december 1994 her mission was and still is to change americas thinking about health by emphasizing prevention she initiated programs to combat youth smoking and teen pregnancy as well as to increase childhood immunizations she advocates public health over private profits and health care reform openness over censorship and sex education and rehabilitation over incarceration in the war against drugs another outstanding woman physician is dr mae jamison who was the first african american woman to participate in the space mission aboard the 50th space shuttle flight in 1992 she continues to share her knowledge through speaking engagements and teaching at the university level these individuals are representative of the many women and men

very important issues for the people of guamthe future return of federal excess lands on guam and the expansion of the islands economy h r 2462 puts into place a process wherein the government of guam is given first consideration in the return of federal excess land as chairman of the resources committee during the 103rd congress we passed legislation authored by mr underwood which identified 3 200 acres of federal excess lands no longer needed by the federal government for return to the government of guam to benefit the people of guam this was the first step in helping to address the very unique circumstances of guams history and the federal acquisition of 1 3 of the island after wwii for purposes of national defense currently the return of excess federal land is governed by the general service administrations land return process which can completely prevent guam from regaining the land in favor of other federal interests h r 2462 builds upon the success of our work during the 103rd congress and establishes a process in which federal property no longer necessary for the continuing operations of the defense of our nation is returned to the government of guam for uses consistent with benefitting the islands community h r 2462 also contains a novel approach to increase investment into guam by allowing the government to match the withholding tax rates of foreign investors to equal the same rate offered in unitedstates treaties for foreign investors doing business in the 50 states guams unitedstates mirror image tax system was instituted with the passage of its organic act in 1950 the internal revenue code requires a withholding tax rate of 30 percent on foreign investors with the exception of withholding tax rates negotiated in unitedstates treaties with foreign nations these rates are often lowered to encourage foreign investment into the united states it is often the case however that the definition of the united states does not include guam or the other unitedstates territories the exclusion of the territories has for better or worse penalized guam in this instance since the majority of their private sector development has come from foreign sources amending guams organic act to equal the withholding tax rate under unitedstates treaties will boost their attraction to foreign investors and benefit the islands longterm private sector

of course african american men should be tested at an even earlier age i serve on m d anderson hospitals prostate cancer advisory committee and i would say that the best celebration and commemoration we could give to our fathers across the land no matter what their ethnic background is to encourage them to get early testing and to not be afraid to go to the doctors i also support the passage if

diseases i would offer my support for the resolution dealing with prostate cancer i would ask all my colleagues to heartily support us in our fight to end this deadly disease i stand here today with the men of this house to urge public awareness of prostate cancer prostate cancer is the second most common form of cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death education and regular testing

than the rates for white men african american men have higher incidences of prostate cancer than any other ethnic group in the world since this disease is rare in asia african and south america my

testing this resolution will help some live the incidence of prostate cancer increases as men agemore than 75 of all prostate cancers are diagnosed in men over 65 thus it is crucial for men to have regular checkups for early detection men over age 50 should have tests done every year african american men should be tested at an even earlier age the federal government has an important role to play in raising public awareness about this disease we must continue to support research and treatment efforts to improve the chances of survival for men diagnosed with prostate cancer we should also encourage more efforts to improve access to care for men particularly lowincome traditionally underserved patients i support these efforts to battle this deadly disease prostate cancer will kill 37

prostatespecific antigen psa blood test every year men who are at high risk for prostate cancer african americans or men who have a history of prostate cancer in close family members should consider

bill that will help farmers through some of the most difficult times that they will face in decades for more than a year now farmers have been excluded from the robust economy that the rest of this country has enjoyed while many citizens debate whether or not to roll over their iras farmers are just trying to figure out how they can survive and put food on the table until this crisis has been turned around we have to take action to make sure that they survive and they have an opportunity to prosper if we do not consumers will want to know why the grocery store shelves are empty and food prices are so high while farmers are left to pick up the pieces we have to act now yesterday secretary glickman came to a farm breakfast in my district more than 300 farmers showed up for breakfast that is twice the number that normally come in any given year from the commcnts of what those folks said at that breakfast they are hurting and hurting badly these loans will determine whether or not some of those farmers and their families and their neighbors can stay on the farm i am glad we are taking action to help farmers make it through the dire straits that they now face and that we will act today our small farmers are a vital part of our economic fiber in this country they are important to the character of rural north carolina and america and we cannot afford for those small farmers to cease to exist i am proud of what we are doing this afternoon and i want to make sure that this important program is available to farmers as they approach the critical spring planning season this is the first as you have already heard in many steps including crop insurance reform and supplemental funding for this year as we look at the 1999 year that this congress must take to strengthen the safety net for our farmers i urge unanimous passage of h r 882 and i look forward to working with my colleagues on the committee on agriculture and others in this congress to make sure that we provide a safe and secure future for american farmers so the rest of us might enjoy a safe and secure future and good food"], [0.611870676279068, 0.388129323720932, 1, "i yield myself such time as i may

airconditioned building welllighted and comfortable and they are out in hot fields their lives on the line as he said and he put it correctly we are having a family fight i am not going to get in the middle of this family fight i am going to let my colleagues all fight it out but i hope my colleagues will settle it because this bill has a significant impact on the farmers in my state and the

do not get a program in place we are going to quit lending money if that should happen i pray to god it does not but if that should happen it will not happen with my vote i trust the majority party will come to their senses and make sure it does not happen with their vote either because we have been fortunate in america we have been blessed as no other country in the world to have a bountiful food supply oh sure there are children that do not have as much food as they should have but over the years we have tried to do a good job we have not done as much as we should to make sure that they

majority here that says the democrats are spending the social security money when in fact the media coverage based on the congressional budget office shows it is the gop spending bills based on the gop budget after all they are the majority party in the body if anyone is raiding social security it is the majority not the minority we do not have the votes if we wanted to and we do not want to second they accuse the democrats of jeopardizing social security when this same crowd running the chamber has not offered a proposal and debated on this floor any ideas relative to strengthening the trust fund i think it is terribly unfortunate that we cannot work together democrats and republicans to strengthen this program because it is not a democrat program or it is not a republican program it is americas program and in the middle of all this political smoke i hope americans keep one thing in mind the way to evaluate whether anything is happening or not on social security is to look at that 2034 date the date at which the trust fund goes bust if that date is not addressed those benefits are going to fall by 25 percent and the prospects of our children and grandchildren getting a meaningful social security benefit are greatly reduced even though they definitely face the prospects of significantly higher taxes so has the trust fund been strengthened the answer not by anything they have done so far this year and that is a deep disappointment to me and i am sure the american people joining me is the gentleman from arkansas from little rock arkansas well from the state of

begin with a shameful story about the men and women we count on to protect us members of the united states armed services they are prepared to die for us but did you know that some of them must stand in food lines to help feed their families again i quote from the transcript it is a shocking sight to see proud american soldiers accepting charity and federal aid just to get by the show also featured a 26yearold computer operations specialist who has served 6 years in the navy but makes only 18 000 a year to care for his wife and three children he said and i quote ive talked to managers at fast food restaurants who make more money than i do and im prepared to die for my country if necessary and sometimes that seems really unfair a reported 600 000 enlisted troops almost half the entire military base make a base salary of 18 000 or less on may 21 of last year cbs this morning did a profile during its eye on america on the state of our military families the reporter interviewed a church volunteer and former military wife by the name of pat kallenbarger who works to help our military families in need she said and i quote its not unusual for me to find a family sleeping on the floor for lack of beds and eating on the floor because they dont have a table and chairs and they dont have the money to either buy them or rent them i further quote i find babies in cardboard cartons theyd be in a dresser drawer except the family doesnt own a dresser this is shameful these are our military families in fact i introduced a bill h r 1055 a year ago that would help give these men and women on food stamps a 500 tax credit i am urging our leadership both republican and democrat this year to please make sure before we end this session in october that we have spoken to this issue of our men and women on food stamps i have before me a marine this marine is holding in his arms his baby daughter named bridgett and the young lady standing on his feet is his 3yearold daughter named megan this marine is getting ready to deploy for bosnia the sad part of all of this this marine represents all of our men and women in uniform and represents those 600 000 that are making under 18 000 we must remember that these men and women that are willing to die for this country 60 percent of them have families i think about this little girl megan because you can see in her eyes a concern and maybe that concern even at that young age is the fact that her daddy might leave and never come back i do not know but i do know this as a member of this congress that those of us on both sides of the political aisle we have an obligation and in fact i think it is deplorable and unacceptable that we have not begun to help those men and women in uniform on food stamps so i urge my colleagues we have about 80 members of this house both republican and democrat on this bill and i encourage my colleagues to please join me in this effort to make sure that this year before we leave that we do something

incredible discussion about a problem that faces the gentleman in his district there is no doubt i am sure to any of the seniors in the gentlemans district that he is definitely on their side and fighting every day for them i am also happy to be here with my colleague from arkansas we come from very different kinds of districts but there is one important thing that we have in common and that is that our senior citizens are struggling just the same every single day to try and pay for their prescription drugs the next time anybody goes to the pharmacy to pick up a prescription i would suggest that they look at the people who are waiting there to get their prescription and try and pick out the person who is paying the absolute top dollar for their prescription one might think well it could be that welldressed business executive who is going to be paying the most or that kind of upscalelooking young working woman who is going to be paying the most but the truth of the matter is one has to pick out the oldest the frailest the poorest looking person in that line probably a woman and that is the person that is going to be paying the most for prescription drugs and that is simply not fair that is based on a very conscious decision by the wealthiest industry in the world the pharmaceutical companies to figure out how to boost their profits they are going to go after the people who need those drugs the most those medicines the most and who are going to do everything they can to try and pay for them those are the people they are going to try and squeeze out the most money from seniors make up about 12 percent of the population but they use about a third of the prescription medication so it is of course a logical target group the most logical prey for the pharmaceutical industry most of them have little or no insurance or their insurance is inadequate so that means they do not have anybody on their side to bargain for them for lower prices the gentleman referred to a study that was done under the auspices of the committee on government refotm on which i sit and i did that study in my district i found that uninsured uninsured for prescription drugs uninsured senior citizens were paying on average 116 percent more than the most favored customers of the pharmaceutical companies the hmos the veterans administration those were paying 116 percent less than our senior citizens were then we did another study we looked at what about if they went to canada or to mexico and just as the gentleman said earlier in my district just like in the gentlemans district or in arkansas or in any district around the country it was about 80 percent less for those same drugs that they need to save their lives to enhance their lives to extend their lives if they went there they would pay 80 percent less then my dog bo and i did a press conference together bo sat down next to me he is a good old dog i said that a drug one of the drugs actually that i take vasotec for high blood pressure that same drug for bo and it is a drug that is used on animals would be about 58 percent less if i could send bo to the drugstore to get the drugs i would be better off too that is not right i did the press conference at a senior citizen center and they were offended by that and they should be offended by that this is not because there is less research done on the drug for bo this is not because it is a different drug that is cheaper it is because they charge what the market will bear and they know that the seniors are going to have to pay more for those drugs if they do not want to have a stroke the drug companies say to us look if we are not allowed to charge these prices then we are just not going to be able to do the research and development and you are simply not going to have the drugs again as the gentleman pointed out if that money is so scarce for research and development then tell me why we can hardly turn on the tv anymore without seeing one after another an ad by the drug companies for a drug they are spending far more on their advertising budget than they are on their research and development budget let me just end with this one of the ads that they have they used to have i do not know if she is on tv anymore i have not seen her lately is this nicelooking elderly woman called flo she looks very fit flo goes bowling she ends up her ads we want to keep government out of our medicine cabinet is what flo says no no government program to lower prices i would like to just tell the gentleman that i have worked with seniors for years and years i was executive director of the state council of senior citizens in my state before i ran for public office i have been talking to senior groups ever since i have been a public official i have never once heard a senior citizen tell me keep government out of my medicine cabinet it is the opposite they are saying please representative help me do something government has to be part of the solution here i love my medicare but it is not helping me when it comes to prescription drugs i need you now they need us now we have to come up with an answer the answer is having a prescription drug benefit under medicare giving affordable accessible prescription drugs for our senior citizens i appreciate the gentlemans leadership in getting us there"],

coloradans we are glad to share its beauty with the nation and we invite the world to experience it and the world is doing just that at least in part because of its designation as a biosphere reserve the national park service tells me that many visitors say that they learned of the park because it was included in the man and the biosphere program and that is what made them want to visit it as one who believes there is a benefit to every visitor to special wildands like rocky mountain national park i am convinced that that is reason enough to keep the park in this program but it is also true that tourism is a very important part of colorados economy and that is another reason to keep the park in the program which my amendment would do let me be clear adoption of my amendment will not make
