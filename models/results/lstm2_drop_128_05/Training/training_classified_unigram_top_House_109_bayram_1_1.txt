welfare of our country we expect them to work we ought to pay them we ought to pay them a wage that does not leave them in poverty we could do that because 250 of us would vote for such a bill but unfortunately once again we are playing a game this bill was referred to as an estate tax bill not a minimumwage bill minimum wage is included in the estate tax bill but that is the reason you put this bill on the floor to pass a bill you have already passed but cant pass the senate or at least has not passed the senate therefore attaching the minimum wage which 48 of your republican colleagues say they want to be for is to design a process for failure not a failure for us none of us work for the minimum wage but a failure for 6 6 million people and indeed some 12 million more people who rely on help from those earning the minimum wage to support themselves and their families how sad how sad that a 250member majority of the house of representatives cannot summon the will or the courage or the good sense to offer simply a bill which does what we want it to do to raise from 5 15 the minimum wage over three increments to 7 25 if a minimumwage worker was earning now what he or she earned in 1968 they would be earning 9 05 an hour this bill simply has an increase to 7 25 the bill that we proposed now we will have that available in a motion to recommit along with the

surplus 160 billion for this year alone on tax cuts to the wealthiest americans instead of being an engine of growth this budget and its deficits will put the brake on job creation do not take it from

deficits in future years unless this trend is reversed at some point these deficits would cause the economy to stagnate or worse a missed opportunity because instead of being a blueprint of positive initiatives for the future this budget is an assault on our values the budget calls for 10 billion in medicaid cuts maybe more despite the fact that both this house and the other body explicitly rejected such cuts that is a cut that is deeper than was even originally proposed by the president republicans must explain to the american people who oppose medickid cuts by 4 to 1 why they insist on slashing funds for sick children seniors in nursing homes and the disabled governors across the country both democrat and republican oppose these cuts because they know the devastating impact they will have on americans more than 1 million of whom will likely lose their health coverage the reckless republican budget does not stop with cuts in medicaid and social security its wrong priorities mean cuts in education medicare student loans and changes in the pension guarantee program which will cause american workers to lose their pensions democrats have a better idea during the last years of president clintons administration the entire social security trust fund surplus was saved and we were on a budget path to continue saving that money we were on a path of 5 6 trillion in surplus

the lines of the interpretation of information that was received that led us into the war in iraq what i am talking about is the april 26 national emergency that was declared by president bush on that day he issued an executive order to freeze the assets of those suspected to have been involved in the october 1 2004 assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri and 22 others on the

have to ask ourselves are there some other motives involved in the issuance of this executive order the reason i say that is because of the language that is used in the executive order it says that this executive order applies to persons involved in any other bombing that implicates the government of syria or its officers or agents now the keyword is implicate because that means that you are talking about bringing into intimate or incriminating connection well i remember and i was not in this body in 2003 but the president chose to invade iraq in 2003 because we were told that iraq was implicated in possessing weapons of mass destruction that iraq was implicated in the tragic events of september 11 we now know that both of those implications were false but that is after nearly 2 500 young men and women from these shores have been killed countless thousands others have either mangled bodies or addled minds as a re sult of the shock and the shell shock and the presence in the theater of war how many tens of thousands of iraqis are now dead as a result of the implications that the american people were told and then action taken on those implications now once again the

strong opposition to the central american free trade agreement it is a small treaty economically but it has enormous implications for our country i oppose cafta because it is a step backward for workers in central america and a job killer here at home as a californian and there are many of us in the chamber this evening we all know full well the significance of our close ties to central america my own city of san francisco is blessed with large populations of central americans including those who sought sanctuary from el salvador and those fleeing decades of civil war in guatemala our fate is tied with our neighbors in the hemisphere president john f kennedy recognized this in 1961 when he announced the alliance for progress calling for vast multilateral programs to relieve the continents poverty and social inequities the alliance for progress included both economic cooperation and called for economic reforms as conditions of participation just as we call for stronger labor and environmental standards today as the reasonable condition for trade agreements i wish that the cafta bill we are debating tonight were an agreement that opened markets included basic labor standards and protected our environment this type of agreement would have lifted the economies of both the united states and central america it would have attracted support from a large number of democratic members who have long histories of supporting free and fair trade including recent trade agreements with australia singapore chile morocco jordan vietnam and cambodia unfortunately that is not the type of trade agreement before us tonight instead we are considering a trade agreement that protnotes a race to the bottom that hurts unitedstates workers that turns back the clock on basic internationally accepted worker protections and fails to protect the environment as a result the republican leadership is having a hard time convincing its own members to vote for this bill we have heard our colleague earlier the gentleman from ohio talking about twisting arms until they are broken into a thousand pieces the new york times today the gentleman referenced the new york times so i will too said that a white house official said that the last votes are likely to be won with the most expensive deals we should be able to pass good fair trade agreement treaties on their merits instead the administration is trying to persuade people with side bars side letters and side deals they have never worked in the past they are just a con and i hope that our colleagues will not fall for the con in their desperation to win votes the president and the republican leadership in the house have also proclaimed that cafta here tonight will promote unitedstates security and democracy in central america the truth is if we want to improve our national security and promote democracy there we should heed the words of pope paul vi who said if you want peace work for justice trade alone devoid of basic living and working standards has not and will not promote security nor will it lift developing nations out of poverty our national security will not be improved by exploiting workers in central america here at home this cafta threatens unitedstates jobs by making it harder for american businesses and farmers to compete with countries that have excessively low wages and deficient working conditions i repeat here at home cafta threatens unitedstates jobs by making it harder for american businesses and farmers to compete with countries that have excessively low wages and deficient working conditions we have lost 2 8 million manufacturing jobs since president bush took office cafta does not solve the jobs problem it only digs the hole deeper these downward pressures create a race to the bottom that needlessly threaten unitedstates jobs nothing in this agreement will help raise substandard wages in central america or help create a strong middle class that has the disposable income to buy unitedstates goods democrats understandthe need to help our central american neighbors reap the benefits of increased trade but the cost of this cafta are too high with too little to justify this agreements deficiencies we must have basic worker protections which ensure that our trading partners abide by the most fundamefntal standards of common decency and fairness the cafta we are debating today fails to promote these basic measures of decency and fairness and in fact takes a step backward from current law because it removes the requirement from these countries to abide by the workers rights standards of the international labor standards when it comes to the environment democrats believe that environmental principles must be a central part of the core trade agreement cafta will do absolutely nothing to improve environmental protection in central america and it will open up our own environmental laws to attack by foreign corporations my colleagues this cafta allows multinational corporations to sue governments including our own for compensation if the environmental laws reduce the value of their investment or cut their profits i repeat cafta allows multinational corporations to sue governments including our own for compensation if an environmental law reduces the value of their investment or cuts into their profits cafta places no value on the environmental health of the americas moreover the enforcement provisions of this cafta are virtually nonexistent it merely calls for cafta countries to enforce their own laws enforcement in these areas must be written in to cafta if they are to be effective they are not democrats believe that to keep america in the lead the nation must adopt a bold new and sustained commitment to technological innovation and educational excellence that commitment would ensure that our country remains competitive and vibrant against formidable international competition generating highquality jobs throughout the 21st century we are committed to addressing challenges of increasing competitive global market our economic future rests on our ability to innovate new products and to create new markets for those goods and services we insist that this administration revisit its flawed trade policy and work with democrats so that we can pass free trade agreements including a new improved cafta that will expand markets spur economic growth protect the environment and raise living standards in the united states and abroad that would allow us to move forward with our other priorities american families are facing serious challenges rising health care costs record gas prices climbing college costs and massive job layoffs they are worried about the direction of our country instead of addressing the serious issues that directly affect americas families and coming up with real solutions repgblicans have abused their power and focused on the wrong priorities pursuing an energy bill that does nothing to lower gas prices or a social security privatization plan that weakens the safety net for americas elderly sadly this trade agreement and the way it has been pursued by the administration has become yet another example of those misplaced priorities and missed opportunities again president kennedy said in 1961 that the united states and latin america are firm and ancient friends united by history and experience and by our determination to advance the values of american civilization we must support all economic integration which is a genuine step toward larger markets and greater competitive opportunity it was true then it is an inspiration now i urge my colleagues to send this cafta back to the drawing board the administration can negotiate a new cafta that will open new markets include basic labor standards and protect the environment such an agreement would attract strong bipartisan support this cafta does none of the above it does not protect the environment it does not grow the economy in our country it does not lift the living standard in central america and it does not have my support vote no on this cafta"], [0.0015607476234436035, 0.9984392523765564, 1,

us a little later if i could just take a moment here to let the members know that the great debate took place here on this floor a number of amendments were proposed to make sure that we pass a budget that is just and fair for every american but i must bring to the members attention because i think members do not realize what is happening or if they do realize what is happening i want to make sure that it is in the record that they know we talk about debt a lot in our 30 something working group and talking about debt and doing something about debt are two different things the republican

like to cut it back a quarter or what have you but i just want to make sure that folks understand that there was an article written on tuesday of this week entitled another possible bump to the debt ceiling 2 7 trillion budget plan pending before the house would raise the federal debt ceiling by nearly 10 trillion less than 2 months after the congress last raised the federal debt borrowing limit the provision is buried on page 121 of a 151page blueprint it serves as the backdrop for congressional action this week i think it is important and i usually have my letters here from the secretary of the treasury but i think it is important that the american people and the members of this house understand that what they are doing to this country recordbreaking debt i just want to make sure before we start off and then i am going to be kind of quiet here tonight because i know that we have a lot to share it is almost too much to share but i just want to share this with the members one more time we are talking about who are we borrowing from we are borrowing from japan at 682 8 billion china 249 8 billion the uk 223 2 billion the caribbean 115 3 billion taiwan 71 3 billion opec nations

breath in our bodies we are going to share with the members of this house that we will not allow this to be a back room with the lights off in the middle of the night proposition for the american

cannot have it both ways you cannot vote for draconian cuts in april and disclaim responsibility when those cuts are enacted in november at a time when we should be striving to make american schools and american students the best and the most competitive in the world this bill insures that our nation falls further and further behind unconscionably this conference report cuts the federal

stirring appeal for the preservatioh of the union ending his address by saying i am loathe to close we are not enemies but friends we must not be enemies though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection the mystic chords of memory stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone over this broad land will yet swell the chorus of the union when again touched as surely they will be by the better angels of our nature nevertheless in april fort sumter was attacked and the war began for 4 years lincoln was consumed with winning the war and salvaging the union and as the war finally neared its end in march 1865 lincoln focused on healing and reuniting a ravaged nation instead of rebuking or punishing the confederacy lincoln chose instead to offer a united vision of a healed country during his last inaugural address he said with malice toward none with charity for all with firmness in the right as god gives us to see the right let us strive on to finish the work we are in to bind up the nations wounds to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan to do all which may achieve and cherish a

absolutely blown away by the things that congresswoman maxine waters just said she reminded nus that the french and the americans and the canadians which i did not realize that the canadians were involved in this they all got together to oust a duly elected president but now let me just tell you that from 2000 in florida this president was not duly elected i will say that because the election was stolen and we all know that the election was stolen and it is interesting that you would use invalid ballots blank ballots this is the same mechanism that was used to disenfranchise black people in this country in 2000 in the presidential election and so now of course they surface again in haiti invalid ballots blank ballots but the people of haiti took to the streets they demanded a fair vote count and they got a fair vote count and they got a president i want to thank my sister congresswoman for joining me on the house floor but also for those strong and powerful words because she is absolutely right that it is our responsibility now that the peoples voices have been heard and so now we have to respect that we need to respect that i want to shift gears for just a moment and i do not think this poster should present a surprise to anyone as to what i am going to talk about now and that is hurricane katrina i want to remind people of these images that went all over the world the black person who is trying to go through the water for food is looting that is what associated press writes that is what associated press wrote the black person was looting agence francepress saw these white people and they were finding bread and soda blacks loot whites find there is nothing more stark this is the beginning of the hurricane katrina story and this is the way hurricane katrina was portrayed to the american people and throughout the world we need to question all of the press images from not just associated press but every newspaper and on television what were our administration leaders doing as new orleans was filling with water the president was on vacation in texas at the ranch the vice president was on vacation in wyoming he was fly fishing the secretary of state was visiting new york city and even in the midst of what was happening in new orleans she got booed so the press reports tell us because she took in a play and then after she took in a play she went shopping for ferragamo shoes and bought 7 000 worth reportedly of ferragamo shoes and then after that she decided to play a little tennis donald rumsfeld took in a padres game in san diego and michael chertoff who is the secretary of the department of homeland security who is charged with taking care of the united states in a time of great trial and stress and catastrophe stayed at home so as a result the select committee that was formed by this congress to investigate the governments preparations for and actions during hurricane katrina issued a report yesterday the name of the report a failure of initiative it is a huge report the bottom line is that secretary chertoff needs to resign it is amazing to me to see the secretary on television through the powers of cspan doing an intellectual dance trying to defend the indefensible what happened to the people of the gulf states region and what is happening to them today is indefensible and if thousands of families are being kicked out of their temporary homes their temporary housing which was the hotel rooms that is the responsibility at the end of the secretary of the department of homeland security who said okay we will let fema go ahead with that call of course the president bears responsibility too and he has accepted responsibility but i have not yet heard secretary chertoff accept responsibility another sad fact about hurricane katrina and its aftermath is that in the metropolitan atlanta area we have about 60 to 70 000 katrina survivors they want to go back home many of them but there is so much uncertainty because as the congresswoman from florida said earlier there is still uncertainty as to how the hurricane katrinasurvivors are going to be treated i have introduced legislation that will force the epa to look at tests and make public the environmental circumstances under which people will be returning in particular to new orleans it is a shame that we would have to have legislation in order to get the epa to do its job but right now structures are being tested for habitability on their structural soundness but not on their environmental soundness and we have that toxic sludge that is everywhere so i would ask that this congress look at the omnibus piece of legislation that was dropped in and signed by all of the members of the congressional black caucus which addresses all aspects of the problem faced by those katrina survivors in addition i find it curious that the panel that produced this what some people are calling scathing report was boycotted by the democrats well it was boycotted by the democratic leadership i chose to participate in it because there is one thing about participating in congress we are elected we come here we write and we speak and everything that we write and speak for vive as long as there is a congressional record and academicians and scholars lawyers can search the congressional record to understand the environment within which certain actions were taken certain legislation was passed attorneys and judges all well as scholars and academicians and historians and archivists so the power that must not be thrown away i participated in the hearing and my remarks are included in the panels report but the leadership was suggesting that instead we needed an independent commission like the 9 11 commission i do not have a problem with an independent commission but to use the 9 11 commission as a paragon of an example of how you ferret out the truth and find out what actually happened in a tragic event i think is not appropriately stated because yesterday in the armed services committee we had three people who appeared before the armed services committee in n able danger hearing able danger is the data mining program that has been in the newspaler a lot because of the persistence of thb gentleman from pennsylvania one of our colleagues these experts from the military and from intelligence said that if they had been allowed to do their job their work product could quite possibly have prevented september 11 it provided the american intelligence community with the tools necessary to understand what was happening to our country in real time but the program was shut down and when efforts were made to brief the 9 11 commission on what this able danger work product had demonstrated and had shown their work was denigrated their work product was denigrated and they were not given an opportunity to present theirfindings to the commission as directly it has been said in public statements that their work was historically insignificant yet we have three people in open session yesterday say to us that if they had been allowed to do their job to do their work that quite possibly september 11 could have been prevented and instead of grasping on to this information the staff of the 9 11 commission said that these people were not credible and that the results that they touted were historically insignificant and therefore this program was ignored now i do not know why it was ignored but the gentleman from pennsylvania has had a lot to say about able danger and what it meant to our country and why it was shut down i would encourage people to pay attention to able danger and the hearings that7 the house armed services committee is having also there was one otaer thing very sad that came out of the hearing that we had yesterday and that is poor whistleblower treatment in fact whistleblower mistreatment and all kinds of allegations were made against average ordinary americans who had extraordinary jobs that put them in a position to know something and because they saw something was wrong and they tried to inform the higher ups that something was wrong they were personally mistreated at the workplace and away from the workplace even comments made about their peysonal and private lives e 1330 what that says to us is that we have got to do a better job in this place of allowing the truth to come out i remember when i was in congress during my previous tenure and at that time we were working very hard on unitedstates foreign policy in africa we wanted the truth to come out about the real events surrounding the rwandan geno cide it seemed that everybody who was associated with not telling the truth or making sure that we didnt get access to the truth got a promotion i have become fond of saying it seems that it is only in washington dc where you can be incompetent and get a promotion anywhere else in america if you are incompetent you lose your job but not so here in this country as we contemplate the enormity of what the able danger panelists told us in open testimony yesterday as we contemplate as a country the enormity of this revelation let us also weigh it against what is happening now what is happening now is that the war drums are beating once again i have a constituent who is over the age of 40 and he has been told he has got to report for duty to go to iraq over 40 the drumbeats for war are sounding not just against iraq now but also against iran and syria in the face of these beating drums the backdrop is that this administration is being investigated this administration being investigated has two februtry 16 2006 ongoing investigations the department of justice just opened another one today which makes this the third investigation the third investigation on wiretapping this administration is being investigated and has drawn indictments and a guilty plea the vice presidents former chief of staff lewis libby has been indicted and lawrence franklin who is being investigated by paulmcnulty has been sentenced for 12 years for passing classified material over to another country this administration is being investigated on how we got into the first war and now they want us to go to a second war to open another front on this war it is about time that we say no more war no more war mr bush i also want to as i remember the gentleman in my district who is over 40 years of age who has been told that he has got to report for duty in iraq remember kevin benderman whose wife frantically contacted my office asking for help for her husband kevin benderman went to iraq one time he was asked to do things that he thought as a human being went against his conscience we know that collateral damage is not just a number 100 000 200 000 it is people it is little boys and little girls it is women kevin benderman said i am not going t6 kill innocent people dont ask me to do that i have done it once once is too much he decided that he would apply for conscientious objector status well kevin benderman is in the brig because he did not want to kill innocent little girls and little boys and women and men in iraq he is in the brig last weekend there was an action to free kevin benderman its a shame i didnt expect to take all of my time but i was pleased that my sister from california chose to come down and say a few words of congratulations to the people of haiti and to the new presidentelect rene preval i was clicking around on the computer and i came across a very interesting article written by thom hartmann and it can be found on common dreams at commondreams org the title of it is rumsfeld and cheney revive their 70s terror playbook basically what they say in this article which i am going to submit for the record is that when they were in office before this dynamic duo decided to cook up an idea of soviet military dominance to frighten the american people and justify huge defense contracts or the huge defense budget which then would result in defense contracts let me just read they said that the soviets had a new secret weapon of mass destruction they succeeded in recreating an atmosphere of fear in the united states and making themselves and their defense contractor friends richer than most of the kingdoms of the world trillions of dollars and years later it was proven that they had been wrong all along and the cia had been right rumsfeld cheney and wolfowitz lied to america in the 1970s about soviet weapons of mass destruction and the soviet supersub technology but the cold war was good for business and good for the political power of its advocates from rumsfeld to wolfowitz to cheney who have all become rich in part because of the arms industry i am going to place this into the record because it appears that america has been through this before"], [0.9733350239694118, 0.02666497603058815, 1, "i yield myself such time as i may consume i too rise in support

thieves are using spyware to harvest personal information from unsuspecting americans criminals are even using spyware to track every keystroke an individual makes including credit and social security numbers spyware also adversely affects the business community who are forced to spend money to block and remove it from their systems in fact microsoft has stated that spyware is at least partially

i am proud to be a party to h r 744 this bipartisan measure because it identifies the truly unscrupulous acts associated with spyware and subjects them to criminal punishment this bill is unique however because it focuses on behavior rather than technology it targets the worst forms of spyware without unduly burdening technological innovation why is this important we know that innovation goes

the money and we are going to do just what we have been doing since they have been in charge and then we are going to increase our indebtedness to the chinese and to the japanese everybody knows this

us give you the record it is the polar opposite after acknowledging the importance of keeping the trust fund secure they have raided every single cent of the trust fund in the fiscal year 2002 budget

republicans spent every cent of the social security trust fund surplus in 2004 they spent every cent of the socfal security trust fund surplus and in 2005 they intend to spend every cent of the social security trust fund surplus so over these last 4 years the republicans budgets have spent 635 billion of the social security trust fund on huge tax cuts for the wealthiest among us only in washington

failing his fiscal policy with record deficits by the way this is from a republican party that at one time spoke to fiscal rectitude it is failing politically because the american people who are paying attention and they all are are rejecting the social security trust fund because they know the trust fund account has been raided by the majority party we know we will have to do some

swiftly passed legislation that is now pending in the senate and so we expect the fcc to do whatever it can nowand to move expeditiously once the truth in caller id act is signed into law not long ago i was like most americanscompletely unaware that is was so easy for someone to alter their caller id caller id spoofing is not your grandfathers prank call this technology has limited uses that i find legitimate such as for law enforcement and protecting battered women this technology has unlimited uses that i find completely unacceptable this technology enables people to pretend to be a bank a doctors office a court house or even a member of congress nefarious people are i say are using this technology to get a hold of private information and engage in identity theft the telecommunications and internet subcommittee of energy and cbmmerce held a hearing on this matter we heard stories of people recefing phone calls from their local court houses saying they had missed jury duty and that to confirm a make up the caller needed the persons social security number well who wouldnt be flustered when seeing a local court house phone number on the caller id and being told you had missed jury duty so these innocent people gave out their social security numbers we heard of people make fake calls to police departments claiming to be victims of home intrusion and being held at gun point the newark star ledger reported on july 12 2005 that mr wadu jackson plead guilty to placing a fake 911 call that drew dozens of police sharpshooters to a new brunswick home in march in a mistake belief that a teenage girl was being held hostage i know of three of our colleagues in the house who have been victims of caller id spoofing not in the personal lives but in their professional lives as members of congress they have had people call and leave obnoxious messages that indicate the call is coming from the members district office i can only believe that this was an early effort at testing this technology to interfere with the electoral process of our nation i think we do a service to our constituents today by highlighting and alerting them to this problem i urge the adoption of this amendment"], [0.006036877632141113, 0.5060368776321411, 1, "i thank my friend the gentleman from massachusetts for yielding me time and i rise in strong support of the amendment offered by the gentlemen from new jersey and the gentleman from new jersey and before him my other colleagues from massachusetts have stated i think clearly what is at stake here new jerseyans were surprised to learn that the federal highway administration recently withheld 260 million in highway funds because new jersey had taken the very important step i think the landmark step to protect the integrity of contracts paytoplay had become something that clearly had to be stopped and the effort to bring integrity in public contracts by limiting political contributions is something that new jersey is not only within its rights to do but is something that should serve as a model for the nation new jerseyans were surprised to find that the highway administration ruled that new jersey could not do that or else they would take the highway funds away this amendment would clarify the propriety of new jerseys action it would preserve the ability of states to protect the integrity of public contracts and it is not just new jersey as the gentlewoman has heard it would be i think to the benefit of west virginia and a number of other states there are plenty of precedents as the gentleman from new jersey has pointed out to support the adoption of this amendment the sec the securities and exchange commission currently has what we call a paytoplay ban in place prohibiting contribution by bond traders and that has been upheld in the courts so this amendment makes sense it is entirely proper it would benefit many states and it would niake clear that it is not the role of the federal highway administration to decide what is and what is not ethical political procedure furthermore as my colleague the gentleman from new jersey has pointed out this would probably save money there is too much money allocated in contracts for reasons that are not based entirely on cost and efficiency so i strongly urge the support of the pascrellmenendezlobiondo amendment"], [0.006047964096069336,

know going over there you cannot fly up at night you have to go by the roads but we made that choice and i am so glad because it gave me the experience of a lifetime as we were in camp victory in baghdad and we were gathered there and this soldier came up and was just hugging me i was hugging him tears falling down his eyes tears falling down my eyes and we were just squeezing each other he said something to me i will never forget he said congressman scott when i am hugging you it is like hugging a piece of home i almost get choked up every time that happens i am so glad that god gave me that experience i am so glad we went there and like other soldiers a while later that soldier died that is the kind of sacrifice and i went over there and looked in the eyes let me tell you another experience when i was in afghanistan and i went over there to afghanistan at the time when you remember the debate was over that if we had had this kind of body armor that several thousand marines that have died or got wounded or would have been saved that story came out the pentagon had given that report 0l 2315 so that was fresh on my mind when i was sitting there with this one unit and in each one of the squads there is a sniper there i an armor guy an artillery guy but each one has a sniper who the whole troop depends upon and i started asking about the body armor and they started going around saying yeah we have all our armor on but our sniper here he will not wear the neck armor to protect himself from a head wound or a neck wound that would be almost fatal and i asked him i said why he said i wont wear that because it hurts my agility to be able to move my head to protect my troops we have had many snipers that kind of valor that kind of oourage that is the kind of sacrifice that we are talking about at a time when we have not asked others in this nation to make that sort of sacrifice"], [0.006727725267410278, 0.4932722747325897, 0, "i thank the chairwoman it was my hope to emphasize a point which you raised in your rather enlightening remarks today and i thought i would best be able to do that through illustration with a map we often hear people wonder what the united states policy is currently in the middle east in terms of our military and in turn how it affects our national security why does iraq matter i will not use this occasion to dwell upon the past because as you have quoted churchill if i may myself winston churchill pointed out that if we seek to open a quarrel between the past and the present we will lose the future we are where we are so let me explain when you look at a map you see iraq right here in the heart of the middle east surrounding iraq are syria and iran two state sponsors of terror if we allow what happened in the 1930s to happen here you will see syria continue to assist the insurgency in iraq iran continue to assist the insurgency in iraq al qaeda continue to infiltrate iraq and should iraqs efforts towards democracy fail you will see all three countries linked the crushing weight ofputting iraq back into the terrorist and the jihadistfascist camp will have enormous ramifications because the sheer combined weight will immediately press upon the kingdom of jordan it will lead to the destruction finally with a counterattack by hezbollah in the south to the cedar revolution in lebanon it will have enormous adverse effects in egypt through the muslim brotherhood it will also lead to the destabilization of saudi arabia and eventually what iran has professed the destruction of the state of israel itself again a historical parallel with iraq at the present time can be drawn between the nazisoviet nonaggression pact of the 1930s which ultimately sparked the war where they had germany on one side the soviets on the other and poland sat in between and in their nonaggression pact they carved that country to pieces iran and syria now have a mutual defense pact we have seen its ramifications within lebanon and we are experiencing its ramifications within iraq itself the alternative to seeing the unholy alliance between syria iraq and iran that are run by terrorist sponsoring states that are run and shielded by a nuclear powered iran is quite simple to grasp over here you have afghanistan which is struggling for democracy here you have iraq which is struggling for democracy you have the moderate kingdom of jordan you have egypt you have saudi arabia which is trying to strive toward reform and you have turkey which is a moderate a relative concept but a moderate democracy muslim democracy if iraq becomes democratic and afghanistan becomes democratic the pressure then is no longer on the people who seek their own liberty within these countries it becomes a pressure point for iran and a pressure point for syria to explain to have these despots explain within their own nations how they can oppress their citizens and why they do not deserve the type of better life that they have in hopefully a democratic iraq and a democratic afghanistan as they do in turkey and elsewhere this is not going to be easy to achieve for what we see in iraq basically is a counterattack after the initial removal of the hussein regime you had infiltrations of insurgent support from syria infiltrations of insurgent support from iran you had al qaeda come into iraq because they know that if iraq goes democratic history could very well and i believe will repeat itself one of the things we face in the middle east today is the threat of world war ii of an inherently invidious ideology jihadist fascism which in many ways more closely resembles a death cult than any governing philosophy combined with the approach that won the cold war i repeat that we face the threat of world war ii and we are addressing it with the solution of the cold war as you recall what ultimately ended the cold war was when the berlin wall fell and eastern europe was freed and it was after freedom swept through the satellite states of eastern europe that eventually the soviet union collapsed not from a nuclear exchange or other military exchange with the united states and the west but from the aspirations of the russian people themselves for a better life and a life of liberty when we look at this map when you can see an afghanistan that is democratic and free when you can see an iraq that is democratic and free when you can add that with turkey with the kingdom of jordan with the reforms in egypt with the reforms in saudi arabia with the successful resolution and triumph of the peaceful cedar revolution what you will then see is serious people demanding to share the lifestyle and the freedoms that are enjoyed by their fellow muslims in the world you will see iranians many of whom are under the age of 30 many of whom are not opposed to westernized ideas or at least pluralism and tolerance and you will see the iranian people demanding their freedom this will never happen if this goes back to being a terrorist state sponsor h6826 co and for thos6 who are rightly concerned that in this period in our nations history we could face war without end i ask you this question if you disagree with my scenario with my analysis that a democratic iraq combined with a democratic afghanistan will eventually put pressure on syria and iran whereby they will collapse from within if you disagree with that find me a better solution because i assure you that if iraq goes back to being a state sponsor of terror and iran gets a nuclear weapon that scenario is far more likely to produce the war without end than will be the liberation and emancipation of people throughout that region and the demands of syrians and iranians for the freedom that we here so often take for granted

policy here in the house we are always being told that things are getting better but they are not getting better this policy has failed as an antidrug policy it has failed as a human rights policy and it has failed to have any impact whatsoever in reducing the availability price or purity of drugs in the streets of america in fact illegal drugs are cheaper today than they were 6 years ago and 4 billion ago and yet we will hear again today from supporters of plan colombia that everything is just rosy in colombia that we are winning the drug war and respect for human rights is flourishing not true it makes no difference whether you are looking at the united nations numbers the unitedstates office of national drug control policy numb6rs the colombian national police or the cias it all adds up to the same picture compared to where we were in 1999 right before the start of plan colombia coca cultivation in colombia has declined by only 7 percent and in the andean region by only 9 percent and the growing of coca did not decrease at all in the year 2004 on top of that the u n and the colombian national police agree that opium growing in colombia did not decrease at all in 2004 you have to twist yourself into a pretzel to make something good out of these numbers you do that by deliberately ignoring where we were 6 years ago before plan colombia and picking and choosing bits and pieces of statistics like starting your comparisons in 2003 well that only works because you ignore the huge increases in coca production in 2000 2001 and 2002 but ultimately the most damning numbers come from our own department of justice which states that cocaine remains readily available on the streets of america with wholesale and retail prices for cocaine and heroin at an alltime low and purity at or near historic highs congress was told that we had to support plan colombia we had to pour billions and billions of unitedstates tax dollars into the colombian military to stop the surge of drugs in america well what a waste of money it has been six years ago the rand corporation told us that every dollar we spent trying to wipe out coca in remote areas of colombia would be 23 times more effective if we spent it right here at home on drug treatment prevention and education and on local law enforcement but congress chbse to ignore that good advice and here we are 6 years and 4 billion later now we may have thought our policy was tough on drugs but it sure was not very smart so how about human rights is colombias human rights situation any"]]}
