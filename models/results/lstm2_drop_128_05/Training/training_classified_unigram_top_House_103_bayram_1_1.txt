too long for this measure for too long working americans have had to choose between their jobs and their families and health in every single major industrialized nation except the united states family

your job when you are forced to take a brief leave for a legitimate family or medical reason a simple guarantee that you will not lose your health insurance benefits just when your family needs them

not believe it made good economic sense to give americans a brighter economic future in 1990 we did not believe that that plan that was put forward that increased the size of the federal government and taxed americans more would create jobs in 1990 and we fought our president with passion our president we do not believe that same plan the clone of the 1990 budget act will work now whether it is mcgrawhill or deanwitter or goldmansachs or the national association of manufacturers they have one bottom line on this plan that bottom line is the loss of jobs for americans what republicans offer today is defeat this plan we will sit down with you we will craft a 1year plan that will bring significant reduction to the deficit and economic growth to america we stand ready willing and able to be constructive to engage with you to reshape government to reform washington to downsize the operations of the federal government and to stay out of peoples pockets i would just like to say at the onset to my democrat colleagues who are concerned about where we go from here i can tell them that the members of the house committee on the budget republican members we want to work with them to help america to fix the crisis we are currently in on this deficit and to create a brighter economic future for all americans so americans can be assured that they will be working their kids will be working and tomorrow will be a brighter future for everybody with a higher standard of living"], [0.9471993371844292, 0.05280066281557083, 1, "madam chairwoman i thank the gentlewoman for yielding me this time madam chairman i would like to point out that it has been basically a onesided debate that has occurred on the house floor over the course of the last 45 minutes or so because the committee on banking finance and urban affairs has not been allowed on the house floor to be able to make its case in terms of the alternatives that have been supported in the committee on banking finance and urban affairs to deal withs the very serious problem of insurance relining first and foremost i have heard members mention that we cannot go from zip code to census tract because of the cost the fact of the matter is that many of the insurance companies around the country already use the zip code 4 category which suffices to get the information that is required to make the determination it is very clear that you cannot make the determination as to whether or not redlining exists if you only take zip codes zip codes in many cities around the country involve urban areas that are in many cases very very poor that extend out to wealthy suburbs and therefore simply because an insurance company happens to write policies in a zip code does not tell you whether or not racial discrimination is taking place certainly you can get bipartisan support for such a bill because it does not do a darn thing if we are really interested in finding out whether or not racial discrimination exists in the insurance industry you have got to take it to a point where you are finding out whether the prejudice exists in terms of the cost the fact of the matter is the cost of these programs if you buy the cdrom is a very very inexpensive proposition in many cases first of all i should point out the banking industry already does this at the censustract level second the fact is that the information that we have gotten from both software companies at our committee hearings as well as from the industry itself indicate the cost to this industry will be minimal and it basically requires a computer programmer to punch a button on a computer screen to convert it from census tract to zip code i appreciate the fact that there is not a lot of racial discrimination in the state of north dakota and the fact is we had a member here who mentioned the fact that this was not something that he felt was particularly a big problem but north dakota does not have the same kind of problems that we have in boston or in philadelphia chicago or detroit or in places like los angeles where the problem of insurance redlining exists obviously there may be costs to straightening out an industry that has been racially prejudiced in terms of how it is writing its policies that might in fact mean some discomfort for the insurance industry in north dakota i am sorry for that discomfort the fact of the matter is the insurance commissioner in north dakota currently has changed since the gentleman from north dakota has left north dakota and now requires the information we are asking for in this bill so i am pointing out that if we are really interested in getting the kind of information that will allow us to make these determinations we need to have census tract versus zip code we need to ask for information on race and gender of course if you do not ask for information on race and gender certainly you get bipartisan support because it does not tell you anything if you want to find out whether or not it exists you have got to ask for information about race and gender if a minority or someone or a woman does not want to tell you or a man does not want to tell you their race or gender fine then they can exempt themselves from having to write the information but it allows us to ask the question if we are serious about getting to the point whether there is discrimination we need to have information on loss data the insurance industry is obviously going to tell us that the reason why they do not write policies is because the blacks are bad risks well my goodness let us at least find out whether the information we have gotten from the various insurance regulators who have come before our committee are telling us the truth when they tell us that in fact the minority community gets charged higher rates and has less losses i also would like to point out that in the amendment that the committee on banking finance and urban affairs is offering in order to deal with some of the paperwork burdens we exempt many of the small companies that does not exist in terms of the committee on energy and commerce version this is fundamentally when all is said and done a question of whether or not we are going to get at the root cause of racial discrimination in the policywriting of insurance companies in america and whether or not in your opinion if you think that the energy and commerce committee has taken enough of your committees jurisdiction then i would suggest you vote for the energy and commerce version if you think they have had enough then vote for the banking committees version"], [0.9464371204376221, 0.9464371204376221, 0, "i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time i rise against this amendment which would eliminate all federal funding for the

orders which the state or locality must comply with in order to participate or to receive federal funds it will cost the state of colorado 794 million this fiscal year alone to comply with these mandates one of the most outlandish areas of federal abuse comes in health care and we are about ready to take up this particularly whole new issue again recent changes in federal social service programs have nearly doubled the cost of medicaid coverage for some while certainly causing dramatic cost inflation in nearly all categories unfortunately congress found a real taste for dishing it

ohio and the gentleman from michigan as the house is aware this amendment would prohibit the federal bureau of prisons from allowing prisoners under its jurisdiction to engage in any activities designed to increase their physical strength the amendment would ban free weights and all types of defensive and bodybuilding training in prisons within the federal prisons system this is a very simple amendment but it just makes common sense which may be why congress hasnt done this sooner it is appalling to think that someone who has been convicted of a violent crime could use the taxpayers money and resources to become even more capable of violent acts in addition i am aware of incidents in the gentleladys home state of ohio and in new york in which prisoners used weight lifting equipment as riot weapons why should we give those who have violated the safety of our communities additional resources to wreak havoc we need to make sure that individuals in prisons spend their time learning not to break the law again not getting themselves puniped up at taxpayers expense certainly i know and my colleagues acknowledge that this one measure will not solve our nations crime problem but i dont see any reason for us not to take all the steps we can while we have the chance i thank congresswoman pryce for her work on this measure as well as the work done by my colleague from michigan congressman stupak congresswoman pryce is a much valued member of the law enforcement caucus which congressman stupak and i cochair with this proposal we can show our commitment to helping our nations law officers i urge the house to adopt this measure"], [0.0034356117248535156, 0.5034356117248535, 0, "i thank the gentleman for yielding this time to me i would like to congratulate the gentleman from wisconsin dave obey and the gentleman fromlouisiana bob livingston on a job well done this is not a popular or easy bill to write and within the limited resources available they have done a fine job i offered an amendment at subcommittee to increase funds for the eximbank the bill report now includes language detailing that 125 million of the russian aid account will go to exim and other credit export programs i believe that helps take care of a difficult problem and i commend both dave and bob for their continuing efforts to find more money for exim at the conclusion of these remarks i would like to engage mr obey and mr livingston in a colloquy at subcommittee markup of the bill i also offered an amendment conditioning aid to the newly independent states of the former soviet union and warsaw pact countries to their halting arms sales to terrorist nations in addition the amendment conditioned aid to these nations on presidential certification that they were not selling components that could lead to the development of ballistic missiles or weapons of mass destruction i offered this amendment as an expansion of a provision in last years bill in which congress required negotiations with russia to reduce arms sales to iran at the request of chairman obey i withdrew the amendment and working with committee staff and the state department developed report language the report language in the bill requires a report to congress on the types and amounts of arms and component sales to terrorist states by any former soviet republic or warsaw pact nation most importantly the report requires an assessment of how these sales effect regional strategic balances for the united states and its allies i am concerned about how these sales could eventually effect regional strategic balances for example it is reported that ukraine has sold sunburnclass antiship cruise missiles to iran this was part of a larger three way deal that also included russian tanks and planes for those of you unfamiliar with the sunburnclass missile it travels at mach 2 5 15 feet above the water our navy has no defense against such a missile interestingly the washington post reported on sunday that the department of defense is trying to buy 600 million of these missiles so they can learn how to defend against it i want members to know that i support aid to the former soviet union because it is in our nations best inteiest to help these countries make a successful transition to a market economy however it is not in our national interest to give any country foreign aid money that destabilizes a region with arms sales to terrorist nations i know the state department has been hard at work on this problem so far the russians have been willing to discuss this problem the report language in the bill allows congress to measure the progress of negotiations between the united states and russia among others if progress is not made we will revisit this issue next year with stronger measures the people of the former soviet union and warsaw pact nations must make a determination of what is in their own national interest the shortterm gain of weapons sales to nations which support terrorism or the longterm benefits of a market economy and help from the west i suggest they take note of our concern and end these sales sooner rather than later in closing i want to urge my colleagues to support this bill it is easy to bash this bill to vote against it because it makes you look like you are doing something about the deficit this bill is small in relation to our entire budget less than 1 percent of what we will spend this year but it is huge in the amount of good it does for our longterm national interest in russla for allies like israel and for the numerous programs to help suffering people all over the world this bill represents the best of the american spirit our ability to reach out and help others even when times are tough here at home i hope this house will strongly support this bill at this time i would like to engage the chairman of our committee the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey and our ranking minority member the gentleman from louisiana mr livingston in a colloquy if i may first of all to the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey in the report accompanying this years bill we encourage the transfer of 125 million from the russian aid account to the exportimport bank and other export credit programs i commend both of you for working within the tight constraints of this bill to find additional funds for these very important programs is it the intention of the committee that the transferred funds are to be used solely for programs in support of unitedstates exports to the new independent states further given the nature of exims mission when does the committee envision the transfer of funds to take place"], [0.004069209098815918, 0.4959307909011841, 1, "i yield myself such time as i may consume i rise in support of the conference report on h 2401 the national defense authorization bill for fiscal year 19m4 this report this conference report will provide 261 billion for defense some 2 billion below the presidents request s32 billion below the housepassed bill i believe my colleagues can support this conference agreement for several reasons first it puts people first by funding a 2 2percent pay raise second it provides a significant installment on american economic seenrity by authorizing 2 9 billion for economic conversion and third it reallocates operation and maintenance spending to improve force readiness the agreement also reshapes tactical aircraft modernization and improves major procurement programs for example the conferees agreed to end the debate between the b2 and the b1 by providing the necessary funds to allow the b1 to become fully operational and to cap the b2 at 20 aircraft at 44 4 billion in exchange for the cap the conferees agreed to use this conference report as the second vote to authorize additional aircraft in my humble opinion we have finally come to the end of the debate on the b2 bomber it is this gentlemans considered opinion that the conference agreement entered into will also end the discussion of the fur ther need for the procurement of any additional bombers for the foreseeable future in addition the bill authorizes the continuation of the 017 aircraft a program as you well know that was in significant difficulty we did so at a production rate of no more than six a year four this year with the ability for two more if certain production and test milestones are met there are a number of other limitations on this program as you well know it is a program in great difficulty we asked the department of defense to come back and give us their program for how they would put this program on track and how they would deal with the issue of airlift into the foreseeable future they did that the house agreement the conference agreement is an installment on the pentagons effort to get a handle on that program the conference agreement allocates approximately 197 million for a shipbuilding initiative and about 10 billion for environmental cleanup the conferees also agreed to establish a commiselon on the roles and missions of the military and a presidential study on controlling nuclear arms prolferation in research and development the conference report funds the ballistic missile defense formerly known as sdi at 2 7 billion a reduction of almost 1 billion from the presidents request the conferees are particulary upset over the amount of earmarking that has taken place in the past and frankly continues to take place therefore agreement was reached to urge the ad ministration to use competitive and costsharing procedures wherever possible in this years bill it is permissive it went from shall to may however the house and the senate agree strongly that we would jointly sponsor legislation next year to require that contracts and grants be awarded on the basis of merit based upon competitive procedures and to prohibit legislation earmarking the awards it is this gentlemans hope that not only will the committee on armed services come to gripe with the issue of earmarking but all authorizing committees in this house will come to terms with the issue of earmarking it is a practice that has to be behind us it is not in this gentlemans opinion good government in operations and maintenance the conference report authorizes 388 billion including 3900 million in readiness enhancements there were also two other provisions one that passed the house overwhelmingly known as the andrews amendment an amendment that would provide for a prohibition against using defense conversion funds to support weapons sales abroad however there was also as we went into conference an amendment offered by the other body known as the kempthorne amendment this provlefon on defense export funding known as the kempthorne amendment would have provided the president authority to allow the department of defense to guarantee loans for the sale of defense products 0 frankly this was not palatable to this gentleman and many of us in the conference there were three options available to us one option was that the other body would recede to the house on the andrews amendment a meritorious and noteworthy amendment that would not allow defense conversion funds to be used for the purposes of promulgating arms sales and that this body would recede to the other body regarding the kempthorne amendment the position that we took was that this was too high a price to pay in order to maintain support for the andrews amendment there were two other options one was to throw both amendments over the side and agree to come back next year frankly that was an option that this gentleman would have preferred in my opinion the kempthorne amendment does violence to the whole concept of arms proliferation something that we need to get our hands on the problem was that in the context of the dynamics between this body and the other body that option was not available because members of the other body felt strongly that some compromise version of the kempthorne amendment should be in this bill which then led us to the third option and that was on the one band the mcceptance of the andrews amendment and some compromise version of the kempthorne amendment the conferees agreed to incorporate a house provision using defense conversion funds to support weapons sales abroad into a provision authorizing the president to provide 325 million in loan guarantee in support of commercial weapons sales under certain conditions because the administration opposed such authority and frankly because we oppose such authority the conferees agreed in the spirit of comity between the two bodies to make the funding contingent upon the presidents certification to congress that one he intended to exercise the authority and two that such authority would be exercised with specific reference to the arms export control act and three the exercise of such authority would be consistent with the policy of the united states in the areas of conventional arms sales and counterproliferation efforts the president would have up to 180 days to make such a certification before any funds could be utilized and if the president did not so certify the authority would elapse i might point out interestingly enough that the other day when this body passed the conference report on appropriations for the department of defense they did not appropriate one dime for this provision it is this gentlemans hope that that would be the way that this provision eventually gets dealt with finally in other areas the bill also authorized 310 6 billion for military construction and family housing 12 billion for the department of energy defense activities on balance the conference report reflects a wellreasoned and prudent approach to funding defense programs for the coming year it has turned a very significant corner has put significant dollars into economic conversion significant dollars into environmental restoration bignificant dollars in the hands of milltary forces by virtue of family qualityoflife issues pay raise issues roms we have gotten a handle on tactical air it seems to me we finally put a cap on the b2 bomber it is this gentlemans hope we have ended the debate on the bomber so we can use funds for other purposes there are a number of goods things in this bill i think worthy of support with those comments i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.004849135875701904, 0.5048491358757019, 0, "i yield myself such time as i may consume members of the house this member rises today to speak in favor of his amendment to hi r 4 this is a simple and straight forward amendment that provides for an acrosstheboard freeze in funding for the national institutes of health at fiscal year 1993 appropriation levels we are all in favor of health programs and health researchthis member has been a strong supporter of research efforts including womens health projects over the years however h r 4 is not just about health research legislation it is a spending issue in what is said to be a new congressional era of fiscal responsibility we know that the time has come to make the tough decisions necessary to begin to balance the budget in light of the increasing deficit it is imperative that we hold the line of spending in every possible area this reauthorization bill approves large increases in spending for example the cbo has just provided me with their preliminary estimates and they estimate that this reauthorization bill is 1 7 billion over existing appropriation levels that is not including what has happened in here tonight with the amendatory process 1 7 billion while health research is important we must ensure that we do not increase the deficit by writing a blank check in the name of research in fact as you know on monday night democrat members of the house budget committee agreed to a freeze on all domestic nondefense discretionary spending this amendment is certainly consistent with that decision this member knows that this is an unusual way to freeze spending and this member knows that it is unusual to freeze spending on an authorization bill rather than appropriations however since appropriation levels are based on authorization bills it is entirely appropriate that we first take a stand to cut spending on this authorization legislation it is very difficult to compare funding levels under this bill since nih has not been reauthorized since 1990 for purposes of comparison this member is contrasting fiscal year 1993 appropriation levels with the authorization levels listed in this bill specifically in this fiscal year 1994 reauthorization 3 2 billion would be authorized for the national cancer institute the 1993 fiscal year appropriation for the national cancer institute was 1 99 billion this is a 1 2 billion increase in authorization level over appropriated dollars likewise the national heart lung and blood institute would receive a 300 million authorization increase the national institute on aging would receive a 99 million authorization increase over the current appropriation level the national library of medicine would receive a 48 million authorization increase over current appropriations under the legislation by freezing funding for only these four programs perhaps 1 6 billion can be saved just think how much more could be saved by an acrosstheboard freeze on all nih programs in fact i now have i will reiterate the cbo estimate we are talking about 1 7 billion les excuse me a larger authorization level than the current appropriation level it is a 1 7 billion message and commitment i ask you to make here tonight in closing this member would like to urge his colleagues to think seriously about our no 1 priorityto stop runaway spending and promote fiscal responsibility i urge an aye vote for the bereuter amendment i reserve the balance of my time"]]}
