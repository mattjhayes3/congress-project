avoiding our responsi bility as legislators to make the hard choices necessary to reduce the federal budget deficit however the main rationale for restoring the trigger was to put pressure on the president to face the deficits which have accumulated during his presidency having restored the trigger we have also committed ourselves to producing a responsible reconciliationbill and appropriationbills which in the aggregate will prevent sequestration if the house passed the reconciliation bill which is now before us we will have taken a positive step toward giving the american people and the president a choice between acrosstheboard mindless budget cuts and a reasoned package which combines responsible spending reductions and prudent revenue increases let us be clear about the significance of todays vote a vote against this reconciliation bill is a vote in favor of sequestration a vote against this reconciliation bill will undermine the budget summit and send a very negative signal to our financial markets as chairman of the committee on ways and means i would like to describe the spending reductions and revenue increases which were developed by the committee and are contained in titles ix and x i the total deficit reduction reported by the ways and means committee is 14 billion in fiscal year 1988 and 62 billion for the 3year budget window the committee has more than met its outlay reduction instruction under reconciliation and has satisfied the revenue requirement placed on the committeeby the passage of house joint resolution 324 to avoid sequestration for fiscal year 1988 these totals break down to 1 6 billion in outlay reductions and 12 billion in revenues for fiscal year 1988 through 1990 the outlay reductions are 8 billion and revenue increases are equal to 53 bllion let me discuss each of these packages separately title ix of the recon ciliation bill contains the committees spending cuts the committee on ways and means was assigned savings in the medicare program of 1 5 billion in fiscal year 1988 and 8 7 billion over 3 years the medicare provisions of the committee package together with the provisions of the recently enacted debt ceiling bill reduce spending by 1 6 billion in fiscal year 1988 and 9 0 billion over 3 years the medicare provisions are carefully designed to achieve the assigned savings targets in a balanced fashion the committee distributes the reductions fairly amonghospitals and physi clans and does not affect beneficiaries in fact a committee provision that strengthens the participating physician program should reduce outofpocket health costs of the elderly and disabled by increasing the payment differential to 5percent the committee hopes to encourage more physi cians to agree always to accept the octber29 1987 h 9168 october 29 1987 coi medicare reimbrusement as paymentinfull partricipating physicians now provide over 40 percent of medicare physician services the medicare provisions of the reconciliation bill are immeasurably preferable to a grammrudman sequester under a sequester all hospitals would receive an increasein medicare payments in fiscal year 1988 equal to 0 3 percent under the committee package hospitals generally receive a 1percent increase and hospitals in large cities and rural areas receive a 2 percent increase moreover the reconciliation legislation blocks administration changes in capital reimbursement bad debt payments and outlier case policy all of which could reduce payments to hospitals significantly in order to improve the financial solvency of the pension benefit guaranty corporation the committee agreed to increase the annual insurance premium charged to single employer defined benefit pension plans and to impose a variable rate premium on underfunded plans the committee also agreed to recommendations relating to the minimum funding standards for underfunded plans employer access to plan assets in overfunded plans and the termination of underfunded plans the committee on education and labor has also reported recommendations regarding the pbgc while these provisions differ from those reported by the committee on ways and means the differences will be worked out in conference title ix also provides a 2year authorization of appropriations for the unitedstates international trade commission the office of the unitedstates trade representative and the unitedstates customs service at levels which will allow these agencies to effectively carry out our trade laws the authorization for the unitedstates customs service would not only restore the administrations proposed cut of 2 000 customs personnel but would add 800 new positions for commercial operations to be funded out of the customsuserfee account this increase in

centers around our health care system while the growing elderly population expected to total well over 30 million by the year 2000 places greater demand on our current system home care agencies have

measure before us which would amend s 999 the passage of this measure is truly a landmark for the first time in many years important provisions of law regarding veterans employment training counseling and state approving agencies are being revised and improved these amendments are very effective blending of three measures h r 1504 amended which passed the house on june 30 1987 and was amended and passed by the senate on august 4 1987 hr 3460 amended which passed the house on october 27 1987 and s 999 which was passed by the senate on december 4 1987 there was a great deal of give and take between the house and senate veterans affairs committees regarding this measure but i believe the amendments we are considering include the best provisions of all three bills the joint explanatory statement which will cover the agreedupon compromise in detail will be included in the record following my remarks there are a few provisions however which i would like to briefly discuss section 2 of the proposed house amendments to s 999 would clarify the role of the assistant secretary of labor for veterans employment and training as the official in the department of labor with primary responsibility for veterans employment and training programs it would further establish the responsibility of the assistant secretary to ensure that veterans are fully served under all dol employment and training programs the assistant secretary must be an integral part of all decisionmaking processes within the department of labor that affect employment and training opportunities for veterai including decisions regarding the deveopment administration and implementation of future programs section 2 of the proposed amendments also contains a provision which requires the secretary of labor to assign to each region for which the secretary operates a regional office a representative of the veterans employment and training service to serve as a regional administrator for veterans employment and training a similar provision wr s contained in h r 3460 when it fist passed the house and in s 999 is passed by the senate as pointed out in house report 100387 which accompanied ii r 3460 this position is necessary to strengthen the managerial operational activities and responsibilities of vets section 3 of the proposed house amendments would require that necessary funds be made available for use in each state to support the required number of disabled veterans outreach program specialists and to support 1 600 local veterans employment representatives nationwide lver funding in recent years has been plagued by arbitrary budget reduction proposals resulting in reduced services to veterans congressional intent that these positions be fully staffed will be accomplished with the enactment of this provision although the original housepassed bill would have used a formula to establish the required number of lvers the senate provision in s 999 which we accepted effectively accomplishes our goal of stabilizing lver staffing levels section 4 would require each state employment agency to develop and apply standards for the performance of dvops and lvers which are consistent with the statutory duties and functions of dvops and lvers it is our expectation that development and implementation of performance standards will standardize the provision of veterans employment services thus eliminating the differences in dvop and lver functions which now exist from state to state section 7 of the proposed house amendments would expand the responsibilities of directors for veterans employment and training most importantly this section would clearly establish the responsibility of directors to functionally supervise the provision of services to eligible veterans and eligible persons by the employment service system and es staff i want to stress that the purposu of this provision is to clarify and strengthen the mutually supportive relationship which should exist between federal and state officials responsible for the delivery of employment services to veterans section 8 would establish the national veterans employment and training services institute this provision would codify this very effective training program which was established administratively in 1986 by the assistant secretary of labor for veterans employment and training the honorable donald e shasteen the purpose of nvetsi is to provide training to dvops lvers and other personnel involved in the provision of employment job training counseling placement or related services to veterans as of april 23 1988 nearly 2 000 state agency personnel who provide employment services to veterans had been trained at the institute this training program is an example of the joint federal state responsibility for provision of veterans employment services functioning at its best and veterans seeking employment assistance will reap the benefits of this strengthened relationship i am particularly pleased that the house amendmentssection 11contain provisions which would extend the deadline by which a veteran must apply to participate in an onthejob training program approved under the veterans job training act to september 30 1989 and extend the deadline by which a veteran participant in vjta must be enrolled in a job training program to march 31 1990 additionally this section authorizes 60 million for the program for fiscal year 1988 and an additional 60 million for fiscal year 1989 vjta has been a uniquely successful program assisting over 60 000 longterm unemployed veterans in their efforts to find permanent employment the program is further strengthened by other provisions included in section 11 including the requirement that to the extent feasible counseling services be provided for veterans who encounter difficulties during their vjta training additionally a program of jobreadiness skills development very similar to that which was contained in h r 1504 is included in this section many veterans need assistance in the fundamentals of finding applying for and successfully participating in a suitable program of job training under vjta such training would be provided under this program section 13 of the proposed amendments would revise the funding process for state approving agencies saas and provide for tha establishment of qualification and performance standards for agency personnel we are particularly pleased that new funding approach which was contained in h r 1504 is included in the compromise amendments under this provision the saas which have experienced severe budget cuts in recent years will achieve a level of adequate funding based on their reasonable and necessary expenses the reduced level of funding under which the saas have been operating has seriously threatened the ability of these state agencies to adequately perform their approval function the funding process contained in section 13 would establish a reasonable funding level which will allow the saas to perform their duties with their usual high level of skill and professionalism i want to thank the chairman of the full committee my

we are lucky and our decislonmaking efforts are completed during the next 4 months before the national conventions we will not have a lameduck session this would demonstrate that a 2year budget process can work this has a lot of merit the committee on the budget today has made the greatest progress that i have seen in my 11 years in congress again i want to congratulate both budget leaders i

effort to restore some balance to the spending priorities at the department of energy the congress has consistently favored balance while the administration has just as consistently attempted to gut solar conservation and fossil energy programs while protecting only nuclear programs i commend the committee both in this bill and the interior appropriations bill for seeking to maintain some balance the reagan administration has also been shifting the balance of spending at the department of energy from civilian programs to weapons programs weapons spending at the department has increased by over 4 billion per year since the president took office in 1981 meanwhile spending on civilian energy programs has decreased by more than 2 billion dollars per year put another way military programs that once made up onethird of the departments budget now constitute twothirds of the budget if we are looking for answers to why the administration has failed to develop a coherent national energy policy we should consider the deep cuts in civilian energy programs which have been replaced by more military programs the appropriations committee has provided 500 million for the nuclear waste program the report restricts the use of the funds by prohibiting the sinking of shafts at first round sites and limiting funds for the second round eastern sites to the amount requested by doe which cannot fund sitespecific activities no funds are provided for monitored retrievable storage which has not been authorized having thoroughly restricted progress in the program the committees report calls upon the authorizing committees to restore consensus on the program i can empathize with the committees dilemma with this program the secretarys decision in may of last year to suspend work on the second repository apparently for political reasons destroyed consensus on the program it is now difficut to restart the second repository without administration support but the postponement of the second repository has destroyed support for characterizing the western firstround sites and so we have restrictions on that program as well the administration has stated that it will commence sitespecific activities on the eastern sites unless legislation is passed to enact their proposed delay this legislation does not do that i share the interest of the appropriations committee in seeking to reestablish a consensus in the meantime however all we have is the nuclear waste policy act and until that is amended or repealed that is what doe must follow i commend the committee for deleting funds for the monitored retrievable storage facility the mrs has not been authorized there have been a number of questions raised about the need for that facility at recent hearings before our subcommittee and until they are resolved it would be unwise to commit billions of dollars the committees report language on uranium enrichment suggests that congress has not authorized the repayment to the treasury of revenues in excess of costs while it is true that the congress has not legislatively established the total debt to be recouped it has specifically endorsed repayment to the treasury in the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1985 section 7502 of that law entitled repayments to the united states treasury requires that during fiscal years 1986 through 1988 all revenues in excess of expenditures must be deposited in the treasury that section also requires the secretary to seek to achieve at least a 150 million repayment notwithstanding any report language in an appropriation bill this section remains law and must be followed the report language accompanying the committees appropriation for the nuclear regulatory commission notes the committees endorsement of the proposed nrc rule on emergency planning that view is not shared by the energy and commerce committee which shares legislative jurisdiction over the commission with the interior and insular affairs committee during the consideration of the nrc authorization bill which will reach the floor later this year an amendment designed to retain the current emergency planning rules failed on a 21to21 tie vote it will likely be considered again when the bill reaches the floor or on other legislation therefore the nrc should not assume that the remarks of the appropriations committee reflect

the liability insurance group to protect people offsite if they have a disastrous escape of radiation for example the second level is the one that goes up to 7 billion or 8 billion that to me is chernobyl i do not know about the property values in the soviet union system but with the number of people that were killed and wounded by radiation and otherwise probably you would have damages in the 7 billion or 8 billion or 9 billion or 10 billion range because the industry wanted it that way they decided to pick up the tab for the more serious accidents under the plan of charging each working reactor the retrospective premium of 10 million an annual amount of 10 million until they have paid six times and then they would have reached that limit the third layer is the disaster layer let us say the indian point nuclear plant in new york has a meltdown or some very serious matter affecting whole cities and regions we could not decide whether that ought to be 20 billion or 50 billion or 100 billion or what so we decided that third layer will be determined by a commission appointed by the president and given 2 years to come up and say how we should handle claims above the 7 billion or 8 billion obviously you would have to have a large amount of money and it should not be the ratepayers of the nuclear utilities who paid for the first two levels we believe and so wrote the bill that the third level will come from ratepayers everywhere and taxpayers everywhere and the commission will tell us in advance how we ought to finance this and set it up and distribute the

which recognizes the legitimate elements of the central arizona project but which also sacrifices an exceptionally controversial dam i frankly had sought to eliminate funds for cliff dam environmental groups through the national coalition to stop cliff dam had pledged to marshal all of their resources to stop this particular dam cliff dam faced countless budget and legal challenges years and years of battles over its construction confronted all interested parties the arizona delegation wisely realized this situation and worked out a compromise the distinguished chairman mr udall and my friends mr kolbe and mr rhodes performed outstanding service the amendment we consider today embodies the principles of their efforts as a first step the amendment prohibits of any funds in the fiscal year 1988 energy and water appropriations act from being used to construct or study cliff dam the amendment also clarifies that the other elements of plan 6absent cliff damare a suitable alternative to orme dam within the meaning of the colorado river basin project act of 1968 once the secretary of the interior acts to implement the negotiated agreement and modifies previous decisions by removing cliff dam from the approved plan for the central arizona project the national coalition to stop cliff dam will drop its lawsuit against cliff dam and plan 6 once this lawsuit is terminated the arizona delegation has agreed not to pursue any future funding for cliff dam or for any similar water coser vation storage feature on the verde river i therefore urge the secretary of the interior to act promptly to implement this agreement so that the necessary work on plan 6 can proceed expeditiously the amendment under discussion also provides funds for several fish and wildlife studies i want to emphasize my belief that these studies have independent utility the studies should not be construed as an intent to resurrect or to fund cliff dam in the future throughout the history of the central arizona project flood control issues have been of primary concern the amendment currently under consideration addresses these flood control concerns specifically if flood damage reduction measures are to be taken at two other dams in plan 6the bartlett and horseshoe damsthe measures would be developed in consultation and cooperation with the secretary of the army and the secretary of the interior i am confident that during this process all alternatives for flood damage reduction on the verde and salt rivers will be examined including downstream reaches below their confluence as well as above earlier in my statement i mentioned the many hours of talks that went into this agreement i would be remiss however if i didnt comment upon the fine work of the general accounting office and the department of the interiors inspector general it is through these federal offices that many of the problems associated with cliff dam were brought to our attention the reports of these offices clearly demonstrated the need for congressional action to correct cliff dams problems in conclusion i want to state that the cost financing mechanism and the environmental issues surrounding cliff dam helped lead to its demise but there are positive results which will be realized through the elimination of cliff dam the statutory cloud surrounding plan 6 will be lifted once cliff dam is deleted from the approved plan the overall cost ceiling for the central arizona project as contained in the 1968 enabling statute will not be breached if cliff dam is eliminated and the necessary water project

families this bill i believe is also an important step towards seeing that this never happens again the internment policy represents a dark day for our country wartime hysteria leading to this policy ran counter to many of the principles embodied in our constitution most of the basic liberties guaranteed to americans were taken from a select few each of whom were loyal citizens of this country our constitutional celebration is a celebration of the principles outlined in that document therefore it is fitting that we formally recognize the internment policy as wrong and we now try to correct that policy as best we can i only regret that we cannot compensate those thousands of japaneseamericans who have already died let us not wait any longer"], [0.0031350255012512207, 0.4968649744987488, 1, "i

important purpose i think every member of the house regardless of party affiliation wants this administration to be able to successfully conclude a euromissile treaty dealing with the soviet and western missiles that are now stationed in europe everyone knows however that a concern that has been expressed is where that will leave some of the nato allies and in the mind of the nato allies whether such a treaty could conceivably leave them in a decoupled position in terms of their defense this is not time i would submit for us to send anything other than a very strong signal that the unitedstates congress recognizes that we need particularly if we succeed in achieving the treaty on theater nuclear arms we need to bolster our conventional capability on a natowide basis and that america needs to make its contribution to that we stipulate i stipulate i think the gentleman from new mexico who offers the amendment stipulates that nato itself is going to have to bolster conventional forces as well but we need to do our share particularly in order to make this missile agreement stick"]]}
