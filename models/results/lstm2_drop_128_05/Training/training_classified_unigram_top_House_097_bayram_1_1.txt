are talking about almost doubling it in the year 1986 to shock the members in a different way in the decade of the 1970s this country and many of us served in the house during the seventies we spent 1 trillion on the military function in the first 5 years of the 1980s we are anticipating spending between 1 3 to 1 5 trillion with cost overruns and what have you it is conceivable in the first 5 years of the 1980s our military budget expenditure could exceed 2 trillion if we project that out to the year 1990 it is clear by most con~servative figures that this country will be spending between 2v2 trillion and maybe 2 7 trillion or 2 8 trillion so in a 10year period we are talking about more than doubling close to tripling the military budget now the qu tion that the average citizen in this country ought to be asking is how do you finance this large substantial sustained increase~ in the military budget members of the committee there are really only three ways you can do it either you go to the american people and you say that the nature of the world is so frighten ing so dangerous so unstable that we must now askthie american people for new taxes in order to finance this incredible burden but not one politician in this body the other body or down at the other end of pennsylvania avenue is actually advocating levying new taxes to finance this increase so let us throw that out as an option the second alternative is to engage in substantial budg6t deficit spending but this administration has trapped itself in the rhetoric of the balanced budget it cannot insult my intellect nor the intellect of the american people by suggesting that a democratlc party budget deficit is inflationary and a republican party deficit is not inflationary we know that is absurd so to engage in deficit sepending is a travesty they have t6 show by the next election that they had moved toward a balanced budget or they have lost credibility so they cannot engage in deficit spending for any substantial period of time to finance this incredible increase in this military budget to 367 lbillion by fiscal year 1986 so what is the third alternative the third alternative is to reach into the nonmilitary side of the budget and engage in substantial cuts in order to finance this incredible increase in the military budget and that is the assertion that i make on the floor this afternoon this administration suggested a budget authority cut of 48 4 billion on the nonmilitary side and led the american people to believe that we are reducing federal expenditures a couple of weeks later you make a budget schedule that increases the military budget by 53 3 billion that has to be a wash the argument that i assert aggressively is that these budget cuts are not designed to fight inflation our own congressional budget office indicated that cutting 2 5 billion from the budget would only reduce the inflation rate by between 0 1 and 0 2 of 1 percent so what is this all about it is about financing an increase in the military budget which becomes the least politically risky and the safest way to do it because levying taxes has political implications engaging in continued budget deficits has political implications but ripping off the poor ripping off workingclass people ripping off senior citizens ripping off the children and middleincome citizens of america is becoming the safest way to engage in financing military budgets the american people need to desperately understand that is what this is all about so the question then becomes is there a rationale for the expenditures and for this incredible amount of money i do not believe so and later in this debate we will be making a significant argument that challenges the assumptions of those who perceive the prob lems of the world as being military problems that can be solved in a military fashion there are those of us in this body who frankly and legitimately believe that the problem of the 1980s bring new imperatives call for new policies there are 160 nations in the world many of them eager for freedom and to simplylook through the narrow confines of the parochial prism of united statessoviet ideological relations is an absurdity we have to begin to look at the economic social and political realities of human mnisery in the world and that does not dictate this incredible expenditure of the military budget to rip off millions of human beings who have a right in a free and open democratic society to believe that their government would not abandon them should not be the people upon whose back we build an incredible military machine there have been a number of economists who have pointed out that there are really only two ramifications for going down this road either we bankrupt this nation by moving more and more of its resources into a smaller and smaller segment of economy and the bottom drops out from the sheer weight of this"], [0.4893191456794739, 0.5106808543205261, 1, "i

enterprise pilot programs which have shown themselves worthy of continuance the bill amends section 8 a of the small business act by extending through september 30 1982 the army pilot program and the bond waiver pilot program which were created as a part of public law 95507 which i authored and which was signed into law by the president in late 1978 when i authored that legislation it was my intention to make both of these programs permanent in conference with the senate however it was felt that only by operating these programs on a pilot basis could the determination be made as to whether these programs should become a part of the annual authorization as a result of that decision the general accounting office was due to monitor the progress of the programs and report to the congress by june 30 1980 as to their effectiveness qao through no fault of its own will not be able to submit that report on time i believe very strongly that it is important to keep these programs going until such time as gao can submit its final report the small business administration was very slow in getting these programs started the agency did not publish its proposed rules for the bond waiver pilot program until april 4 1980 some 19 months into a 24month pilot program by the time final regulations are published the original 24month period will nearly have passed obviously this pilot program must be extended in order to carry out the congressional intent to determine the validity of the program the army pilot program suffered from a similar delay the president was required to designate an agency for the pilot program within 60 days after the effective date of the statute the president designated the army on january 10 1979 75 days after the bill became law late in may 1979

following in december and the last on january 31 of this year nothing approaching a systematic implementation of the program has been seen until just recently however the contract already awarded as well as those now under negotiations indicate that the pilot program can attract the more sophisticated and high dollar value contracts into the 8 a program it must be given a chance to fulfill the

residents of the northeast the midwest our east coast region and the ohio valley i am equally sure that ultimate provision for some regional reserve along our west coast and in hawiil may also in time prove an attractive option the idea of regionalizing a portion of our national strategic petroleum reserve is not new earlier consideration in 1978 of the merit of such a reserve has already created a track upon which such a study as is called for in the legislation can proceed facilities for location costs benefits user groups and the like can be and in some cases have been identified other benefits may also surface as those who will conduct this proposed study undertake their task i would urge that upon passage today of h r 6337 that the house conferees bear in mind the increased

of 1981 as reported by the ways and means committee lays the foundation for robust economic growth it will set the tone for the economic policy of the 1980s the bill is designed not only to lower tax burdens equitably but also to rebuild the economy from farm to factory by stimulating greater productivity savings and investment it is the largest tax cut bill in our history yet is structured to meet responsible fiscal targets and to protect against higher inflation and interest rates the ways and means committee bill has two principal goals first to provide equitable tax relief and second to reorient the taxation of business and investments to promote economic growth i believe that the committee bill achieves bath of these goals what is an equitable tax cut in 1981 the social security tax rate for employees rose from 6 15 to 6 65 percent and the amount of a workers taxable wages increased by 1 500 more than was necessary to keep pace with inflation in addition inflation is pulling taxpayers into higher tax brackets and causing their income taxes to rise at a faster rate than inflation the most reasonable standard for a fair tax cut is that it at least compensate taxpayers for these increased tax burdens so that the proportion of income paid in individual income and employee social security taxes is reduced below its 1980 level for the vast majority of american households this is what the committee bill is structured to achieve this is what the conable substitute is not structured to achieve instead that substitute much more than compensates the very affluent and does not compensate the many american taxpayers whose income is below 15 000 yet another requirement of tax equity is that the tax entry pointthe level of income at which a family begins to pay income taxbe adjusted so that it stays close to the poverty level this has been national policy since 1964 when the minimum standard deduction was introduced it makes no sense at all for us to define a family as being poor and then to impose an income tax on that same family currently for a family of four the tax entry point is 8 626 the committee bill raises the tax entry point to 9 958 in 1982 close to the poverty line which is t pected to be 10 083 in contrast the conable substitute would barely increase the 1982 tax entry point to just 8 727 we have already enacted billions of dollars of spending cuts whose burden will fall on the working poor must we also make them pay income tax as well for these reasons the commidttee bill is structured to provide greater tax reductions for persons with incomes below 50 000 than would aformula of proportional rate cuts this is accomplished not only by lowering tax rates but also by raising the zero bracket amount the earned income credit and the child care credit as a result the committee bill targets the greatest tax relief to middleincome americans earning between 15 000 and 50 000 that is 54 percent of american taxpayers a family with two children and 30 000 of income gets a 515 cut from the committee bill in 1982 compared to only 405 in the conable substitute the committee bill works toward important reforms that improve itax equity it will reduce the marriage penalty significantly this penalty is the increase in tax liability that occurs when persons having relatively equal incomes marry the committee bill contains provisions to curb abuses in certain commodity straddle transactions which enable persons with high incomes to avoid or greatly reduce their taxes this reform is accomplished without impairing the proper functioning of the commodity markets in addition the committee bill contains many provisions that improve tax administration and thereby improve tax equity in designing tax reductions to stimulate greater savings investment and productivity the ways and means committee attempted to address the diverse needs of the american business sector this magnificent network of production has many different parts capitalintensive and laborintensive industries large and small businesses enterprises struggling to develop new technology and others struggling to adjust to it broadly based economic growth that will last over the long term requires that all of these parts be sound no one sector no fortune 500 group of big businesses can carry all the rest the committee bill therefore through a number of provisions reorients the taxation of business and investments so that the incentives for economic development effectively reach every type of productive enterprise ti1e committee bill accelerates the depreciation of equipment and plant for tax purposes the current system of cost recovery and that of the conable substitute spreads depreciation deductions for the cost of equipment over a term of years due to fluctuating rates of inflation the real value of these deductions is unpredictable both to the investor and to the government to keep the present system is to risk inadequate cost recovery inadequate profitability and inadequate incentives for investors to undertake modernizations which are needed to increase the productivity and international competitiveness of capitalintensive industries however to adopt a depreciation system that guarantees at least full cost recovery at any conceivable rate of inflation would be to guarantee that most of the time taxpayers would have incentives to make wasteful investments ones that would not be profitable in a world without any tax system at all that is the serious flaw in the 1053 plan in the conable substitute it is serious because it would tie up resources in uneconomic projects that are needed urgently for economic growth due to the interaction of the investment credit and depreciation deductions contained in the conable substitute a businessman would get back more in deductions and investment credits than his actual investment at a time when we are being asked to make large cuts in spending programs that directly affect millions of individuals i think that it is unfair to subsidize business through the depreciation plan contained in the conable substitute another major problem with the conable substitute is that the depreciation proposal is so generous and will create such large deductions that it could genbrate a flurry of corporate mergers and takeovers to solve these problems the committee concluded that an expensing system combined with coriiorate rate cuts would provide stronger investment incentives be much simpler and would be more evenhanded across industries throughout the economy thus the committee bill permits taxpayers to expense the cost of moat equipment in the year it is put in service this simple procedure provides the maximum acceleration of depreciation deductions and will be of great benefit to increasing investment and productivity expensing also assures full recovery in dollars of constant value another advantage of expensing is that it is the only feasible depreciation system which is sure to give no effective tax preference for investing in less productive assets instead of more productive ones the depreciation of buildings is also much accelerated and simplified by the committee bill fortune magazine recently asserted that when it comes to depreciation of business equipment the democrats have the better idea that publication is notgenerally known for hostility to business tax reduction and capital formation a new tax incentive is needed for the rebuilding of some major american industries that temporarily are economically distressed it would be a sad irony to provide for an upgrading of the nations industrial base only through accelerated depreciation when these accelerated deductions would be worthless to the heavy industries most urgently in need of modernization we cannot walk away from these distressed industries and expect a solid economic recovery nor should we the committee bill contains a provision targeted to their revitalization likewise the committee concluded that a newi tax incentive is needed to promote research and experimentation and to assist the growth of firms which specialize in the development of new technology since small businesses service corporations high technology firms and many other kinds of businesses that are not capital intensive are expected to benefit less from accelerated depreciation the committee bill reduces corporate income tax rates and widens corporate income tax brackets these cuts carry the stimulus for economic growth evenhandedly to all industries when combined with an expensing system these rate cuts give a more powerful stimulus to immediate investment than does 1053 cuts in the corporate income tax rates are also necessary to reduce the inequity of double taxation since income from investments made by incorporated business is taxed once under this tax and again under the individual income tax when shareholders receive dividends or sell appreciated shares the committee bill is a bill for all businessesit is designed to rebuild american industry from farm to factory the bill provides decidedly more relief to small business 27 billion from 198186 compared with 6 2 billion under the substitute for the same time period the committee bill permits small businesses to immediately write off up to 25 000 of investments per year effective in 1981 this campares with 5 000 of expensing effective in 1981 phasing up to a maximum of 10 000 in 1986 contained in the conable substitute an essential fact is that 86 percent of all businesses make less than 25 000 of investments per year and would be permitted to expense these investments immediately under the committee bill in addition the committee bill provides 12 billion of small business rate cuts on the first 200 000 of taxable income compared with a modest 2 4 billion of rate cuts on the first 50 000 contained in the conable substitute the committee bill reduces the income tax burden on savings greater savings are required to fund increased levels of investment for economic expansion and to do so without provoking higher interest rates in addition participation in individual retirement plans should be encouraged for these plans are an important part of the retirement system the bill therefore provides incentives for individuals to make greater contributions to private retirement accounts and to a new type of savings certificate it also extends tax incentives for individual retirement accounts to many more taxpayers the committee bill substantially reduces the burden of estate and gift taxes after years of inflation more transfers of property are being subjected to these taxes than congress ever intended the impact has been especially disruptive on the traditional transfers of farms and small business reliable and important areas of high productivity the committee bill also reduces windfall profit tax burdens to encourage oil production and improve the equity of this tax these are the major reasons for the provisions of the committee bill before i list these provisions in greater detail i wish to discuss the important question of the appropriate size of the tax cut it is important because it may determine whether the one opportunity we have significantly to revive the american economy through tax reductions succeeds or whether it is overwhelmed by the stifling effects of bigger deficits and higher inflation and interest rates on this point comparison of the committee bill with its principal alternative the conable substitute is inevitable in 1982 and 1983 the two bills are roughly the same size however in fiscal year 1984the year for which the president has promised us a balanced budgetthe conable substitute is 24 billion larger than the committee bill that 24 billion could very well be the difference between a balanced and unbalanced budget after 1984 the revenue differences between thdtwo bills widen considerably the conable substitute is 135 billion bigger than the ways and means committee bill if the thirdyear cut is not triggered and 50 billiofi larger if the third year is triggered the conable substitute is 42 billion larger than the administration bill introduced on june 9 and 38 billion larger than the tax cut reflected in the administration midsession budget review submitted on july 15 in 1986 alone the conable substitute involves tax cuts 75 billion larger than the committee billa total tax cut of 268 billion in that year committing ourselves at this time to such large tax cuts is dangerous the administrations program to balance the budget in 1984 hinges on two key assumptionsfirst that congress will enact additional unspecified spending cuts of 45 billionover and above those adopted in grammlatta iincluding major cuts in social security benefits and second that inflation and interest rates will fall sharply if these assumptions prove false the deficit in 1984 could easily reach 100 billion if the conable substitute is enacted there is much uncertaint which surrounds the economic forecasts of the administration i have serious doubts about the stockman economic scenario earlier this year the secretary of the treasury came before our committee and testified that interest rates would decline sharply instead they have risen to record levels he testified that the economy would slow down in the first quarter of the year instead it grew at a 9percent rate how can we trust the administrations forecasts 3 years out if they have been wrong in the last 3 months in view of the fact that the conable substitute involves a larger tax cut than that included in the midsession budget review further cuts will have to be found in order to maintain a sound budgetary posture and finance increased spending for national defense where are we to find additional spending cuts of 45 billion needed to balance the budget before locking in outyear tax cuts of the magnitude contemplated by the conable substitute every member of congress and the american~ public are entitled to know where these as yet unspecified cuts will be directed to date the only recommendation or outyear cuts made by the admini tration has been in the area of social security i am not willing to commit myself to cutting social security benefits in order to balance the budget in 1984 the ways and means committee decided for a more prudent approach the committee bill includes a thirdyear tax cut for 1984 but makes that tax cut contingent on achievement of certain economic assumptions contained in the administrations own midsession budget review the consumer price index must be below the level forecast by the administrationan annual inflation rate of around 7 2 percent between 1980 and 1983 the treasury bill rate must be below the rate forecast by the administration 7 2 percent in 1983 and the fiscal year 1983 budget deficit must be below the level of 22 9 billion forecast by the administration there has been some concern that the deficit condition in the trigger is too strict because we may end up with a tax cut bill with a fiscal year 1983 revenue loss in excess of the administration assumptions let me respond to this by promising that if the committee bill is adopted we will bring back a bill from conference which keeps the fiscal year 1983 revenue loss at a level consistent with the administrations assumptions this pledge is similar to a pledge made by the chairman of the finance committee in a recently adopted sense of the senate amendment in the other body this will give the trigger a fair chance to go offif the administrations own economic and fiscal projections are accurate let me now summarize the major provisions of the bill title i of the bill contains the broadly based individual income tax reductions these cut rates in all tax brackets increase the level of income at which people become subject to tax increase the earned income credit and reduce the marriage penalty these provisions are designed to reduce personal taxes equitably and to increase incentives for additional work and savings at every income level the tax rate cuts average 1 percent for 1981 10 percent for 1982 16 percent for 1983 and 22 percent for 1984 there is a more thian proportionate cut in the tax rates which affect the great number of american taxpayers those whose incomes are between 15 000 and 50 000 the top rate is lowered from 70 to 60 percent in 1982 and to 50 percent in 1983 this will reduce the top tax rate on longterm capital gains from 28 to 24 percent in 1982 and to 20 percent in 1983 to provide insurance now against a possibly untimely cut in 1984 the 1984 individual income tax reductions will be triggered only if the budget deficit consumer price index and treasury bill rate in 1983 are at levels consistent with the administrations current forecasts so that lower income persons do in fact experience a tax cut and not merely the rhetoric of a tax cut the bill increases the zero bracket amountthat is the first dollars of income that are not subject to taxin two steps from 2 300 to 2 500 for single persons and from 3 400 to 3 800 for married persons who file jointly these amounts will increase to 2 600 and 4 000 respectively if the 1984 cut is triggered in addition the earned income credit is raised to 11 percent of the first 5 000 of earnings phasing out between 8 000 and 12 000 of income if the 1984 cut is triggered this credit will be increased to 11 percent of the first 6 000 of earnings phasing out between 9 000 and 14 000 of income another important structural change made by the bill is relief from the marriage tax penalty a married couple will be allowed to deduct 10 percent of the first 50 000 of earnings of the spouse with the lesser amount of earnings a provision which on average cuts the marriage penalty in half the bill also increases the child care credit and the exclusion of certain income which individuals earn abroad title ii restructures the taxation of capital income to accelerate depreciation deductions reduce corporate income tax rates stimulate research and development and encourage redevelopment of economically distressed industries these provisions reduce the taxation of income from investments and promote the capital formation that is essential for modernization innovation and increased productivity the bill replaces the current system of depreciation for costs of most business and farm equipment so that these costs can be expensedthat is written off entirely when the assets are placed in service expensing accelerates capital cost recovery by the maximum amount and because of revenue considerations must be phased in until 1990 the regular investment credit would be phased out as expensing phases in however other credits will continue to apply all businesses can expense up to 25 000 of equipment every year without regard to the phase in recovery periods for longlived public utility assets are shortened to 10 or 15years the depreciation of structures is also simplified and accelerated by the bill which provides for recovery on a composite basis over an auditproof life as short as 15 years the present 10percent investment credit for rehabilitating nonresidential structures will be replaced by a graduated creditwith reda~ction of basisof 15 percent for buildings between 30 and 40 years old and 20 percent for buildings 40 years old or more a 2opercent credit will be allowved for the rehab~ilitation of certified historic structures to assure that tax reductions for economic expansion reach small businesses ligh technology firms and the many other enterprises that are not capital intensive the bill provides for reductions in corporate income tax rates the top rate is scheduled to fall in steps from 46 percent to 34 percent by 1987 corporate tax brackets are widened and tax rates below the top rate are lowered in stages so that after 1983 the following schedule will apply fifteen percent of income up to 50 000 20 percent of income between 50 000 and 100 000 25 percent of income beteen 100 000 and 150 000 and 30 perum~t of income between 150 000 and 4 200 000 to address jpecial problems of economic growth in certain industries the bill provides a 25percent credit through 1985 for rosearch and experimentation expendturesother than overhead and depreciationwhich exceed the averr~ge of the taxpayers expenditures for this purpose in the 3 preceding years the bill also allows the carryback of unused investment credits against all regular tax lability incurred since 1962 in six distressed industries autos steel paper railroads mining and airlinesprovided that these tax savings are used for additional investment title iii of the bill reduces the income tax burden on savings these provisions are intended to increase personal savings and thus release the substantial resources required to finance investment for economic growth the bill raises the maximum deduction for contributions to an individual retirement account ira to the lesser of 2 000 or 100 percent of compensation and extends eligibility for this deduction to active participants in qualified pension plans the maximum deduction for contributions of individuals to a selfemployment retirement plan is increased to 15 000 in addition the bill allows an individual to exclude from income as much as 1 000 2 000 for a joint returnof interest on all savers certificates issued by banks savings and loans mutual savings banks or credit unions which use a portion of the new deposits for residential or agricultural loans these certificates may not have an interest yield greater than 70 percent of the treasury bill rate another new savings incentive permits taxpayers to exclude up to 1 500 a year 3 000 for a joint returnof dividends received from public utility corporations if the dividends are reinvested in stock of the utility the excluded dividends will reduce the taxpayers basis in the stock and thus will increase the capital gain treatment when the stock is sold title iv provides for substantial reductions in the estate and gift taxes which after several years of high inflation are being levied on transfers that congress did not intend to tax these provisions include increases in the unified credit equivalent to an exemption increases from 175 000 to 600 000 by 1987 exemption of all gifts and bequests between spouses an increase in the annual gift tax exclusion from 3 000 to 10 000 per donee plus a complete exclusion for gifts to pay school tuition and medical expenses and liberalization of the current use valuation of farms and real estate title v places restrictions on commodity straddle transactions to curb abuses whereby taxes are deferred and ordinary income or shortterm capital gains are converted into longterm capital gains the committee bill requires capitalization of interest and carrying costs for straddles involving the actual commoditywlth a special rule for commodity futures tradersprovides that treasury bills are to be treated as capital assets requires dealers to identify investment securities on the day of acquisition and specifies that taxable dispositions of capital assets result i a capital gain or loss title vi of the bill contains numerous provisions relating to the windfall profit tax among these are a credit for royalty owners for the first 2 500 of windfall profit tax paid in 1981 and an exemption for amounts which begin at 1 barrel per day in 1982 and increase to 3 5 barrels per day by 1986 all producers will be allowed exemptions for up to 500 barrels per day of new oil and 100 barrels per day of old and stripper oilincreasing to 350 barrels per day by 1986except that the aggregate exemption will be limited to 500 barrels per day a new income tax credit of up to 2 000 is allowed for builders of homes that have passive solar energy systems title vii contains provisions for improving tax administration such as the annual adjustment of the interest rate on deficiencies and overpayments to 100 percent of the prime rate a requirement that estimated tax payments of large corporations be at least 80 percent of the current year tax liability additional penalties for filing false w4 forms and an increased exemption from the estimated tax penalty for individuals from 100 to 500 phased in over a 4year period titles viii and ix contain a number of miscellaneous provisions these then are our essential differences the ways and means committee bill provides a fairer tax cut for middleincome americansthose with incomes of less than 50 000 significantly more relief to small business and is more prudent and responsible in terms of outyear budgets the substitute risks huge deficits and inflation unlass massive new spending cuts are proposed and enacted we have the right to have those cut spelled out in detail before committing ourselves and the american people to massive outyear revenue losses the task of rebuilding our economy is enormous this tax program must reach every type of business and every working person we have only one tax reduction of this size to enact it must work it must work fairly and it must work without provoking ruinous inflation and deficits the choice is clear the committee bill is consistent with our traditional values and concerns for low and middleincome persons for working families for small business and for responsible budgets i am confident that any member who looks impartially at the committee bill and the conable substitute will conclude that the comnmittee bill is more prudent takes fewer risks with the economy and provides more equitable tax relief than any of the alternatives the tax incentive act of 1981 is structured to do these things i urge the house to reject the proposed substitute and support the committee bill"]], "top_incorrect":

friendand he is my friendthe gentleman from texas for being very articulate being very persuasive and being very sincere but he is very wrong i have never seen a member speak more eloquently but less encumbered by facts than the gentleman from texas now the gentleman from texas came in and said as to the allowing of grants for research quoting his words it costs billions of dollars it allows theni to pour billions of dollars in without any safeguards and without anybody being able to know what the department of defense is doing in fact it is very simple ahd it is in the law that if the grants are approved the department of defense will be allowed to use grants for research the same as any other department of government with the same restrictions inhibitions guidelines and requirements it is just that simple the gentleman says that this is a sweetheart deal because we the armed services committee give the department of defense anything it wants well as a matter of fact the research and development subcommittee on which i sit as ranking member cut them 1 1 billion just this year we have cut out several weapons systems that the department of defense said it wanted and needed but we were not convinced this was so so the total budget was cut almost a half a billion dollars so we have had just one after the other of these statements that have been made and they are just not so we talked about the ofpp the office of federal procurement policy this is nothing new the uniform policy concept was fielded at least as early as 1972 it has been kicking around for at least 9 years and it is still kicking around and the gentleman from texas says lets not allow the armed services to conduct this business it is not their business let us put this thing off because we know more about it than anybody else let us institute an overall policy at some point down the road let me say first that if our bill passes if by any subsequent act of that committee they would like to institute a uniform procurement policy bill they can do that they can supersede thip but i say as to any additional requirements as to procurement by that committee or any other committee the ofpp or whatever it has been 9 years kicking around and it might be around for 9 more years we are talking about it here and now we are trying to do something about it and it is in this bill there are two things contained in this section there may be several others and maybe they will be considered in the same section one has to do with multiyear procurement and the other has to do with automatic data processing they are two separate things but they are both added by this particular provision of the brooks amendment from the committee on government operations so far we have only talked in any detail about multiyear procurement and i will limit my remarks as to that and hope that if the other matter gets into serious consideration we can cover that later i might say that the entire intelligence community with which i am familiar and with whom i have talked says that in the field of computers for satellites for intelligence gathering and very sensitive intelligencecollecting agencies in those areas we do not think we need to have this under gsa and have another layer of bureaucracy we believe that the department of defense is quite capable of making decisions on the most sensitive systems we have without the advice and consent of the general services agency mr chairman specifically in our bill under section 907 it would accomplish the following it would save 2 billion within 2 years of implementation and 3 billion within 5 years now where do i get my information for this the general accounting office estimate was put forth in the budget committee report in report

th6 committees of the congress itself and 2 weeks ago i am pleased that our body decided to take that opportunity to seize it and do what we can to reduce spending in the federal government at least when we have this onealbeit a smallopportunity to try to reduce spending first i would like to thank and commend the members of the house administration committee both democrats and republican alike

republican party in congress played an active role in seizing this opportunity and i am proud of the effort we made to convince our colleagues and members on both sides of the aisle of the importance of bringing fiscal responsibility to congress many of us feel as i do that it has been a long long time since congress has fplt the need to reduce spending some of us feel it has been 30 or 40 years

freshmen for taking the opportunity in the 1minute speeches to call for some action in congress we are frustrated that congress has not done anything yet but we are not asking for more laws as he alleged we are asking for less laws we ate asking most of all for one law the budget law to give us less spending in the federal government we cannot deliver to the american people that which they are desiring that which they are seeking that which they are pleading fora balanced budget lower taxes lower interest rates unless we recognize our opportunity to cut spending every chance we have my colleague the respected chairman of the subcommittee mentioned earlier in the day that we need this 40 million to run our committees because we have the responsibility of spending hundreds and

can get them to do more for less and we should take this opportunity to show that this is exactly what the american people want them to do one of the most troubling things i have heard in the debate

introducing a bill with mr rousselot aimed at tightening targeting and improving the fiscal management of the unemployment compensation and trade adjustment assistance programs several of the provisions amending the unemployment program and all of the provisions amending the taa program duplicate those in president reagans program for economic recovery i applaud the president for formulating a package to tighten up to the administration of these two programs however i feel there are additional reforms which need to be made these reforms are particularly important in assisting states to improve the solvency of their unemployment programs 6 billion is currently owed the federal government by the states for loans made to cover high benefit costs some of this debt is carried over from the last recession in 1975 the department of labor has estimated that loans for fiscal years 198085 could amount to 18 billion it is time the system by which states borrow from the federal government be examined and improved ithe bill includes several provisions to help states strengthen the solvency of their unemployment programs by meeting certain solvency requirements a state can qualify for a 0 9percent cap on the reduction of the federal tax credit incurred when a states loan remains unpaid for 2 years the bill also provides that interest wvill be changed for any future borrowing a sectionbysection analysis of the bill follows my remarks here but let me briefly outline the points of the bill along with the cap and iterest provisions just described the bill eliminates the national trigger requires an individual to have worked 20 weeks or earned wages equal to 20 times the states average weekly wage for covered employment to qualify for extended benefits and provides for recalculation of the insured unemployment rate iur the b rtl also allows a state the flexibility to set a higher optional state trigger than the 5 percent allowed under current law the trade adjustment assistance provisions included in the bill are designed to assure that assistance and employability services are more appropriately targeted to tradeimpacted workers by bringing the taa program more in line with the unemployment compensation program it will be possible to stop the alarming rate of growth experienced by the program in recent years the reforms included in this bill are necessary in order to improve the unemployment compensation program and the trade adjustment assistance program i hope my colleagues will look ovr and support the bill the sectionbysection

the bill there is 108 million rescission for payment in lieu of taxes now this payment in lieu of taxes is considered sometimes to be a western issue but let me tell the members of this committee that every one of the 50 states receives some money under this program the rationale under which this rescission is being promoted is that because of the windfall profits tax the income to the states will increase substantially the income to the states has increased by about 10 percent so that if we were being logical we would take 10 percent off the payment in lieu of taxes this particular rescission was riot recommended by the administration they talked about looking at the program for 1982 but for 1981 the need continued to be there there are cities and counties in every single state that receive money from this payment in lieu of taxes let me point out that the administration did not make the recommendation for rescission during 1981 they were making recommendations for 1982 and the appropriations commit tee jumped the gun and said if they are looking at it for 1982 we might as well move right on ahead with 1981 1 think it is a serious error on the part of the appropriations committee to include this rescission at this time there are some counties in my state that count on payment in lieu of taxes for 30 to 40 percent of their entire budget that is not peculiar to my

billion the on budget deficit for this fiscal year alone may exceed 100 billion by resorting to deficit spending congress has avoided accountability for its spending decisions just once in the last 20 years has congress balanced the budget such persistent fiscal ineptness has put our country on a roller coaster of high interest rates inflation and economic instability congress clearly does not have the intestinal fortitude necessary to bring deficit spending under control congress will not likely change its ways unless it is forced to do so the time has come to pass a constitutional amendment requiring the congress to enact a balanced federal budget the amendment most appropriate to this purpose is house joint resolution 350 it has four basic points first it would require that each fiscal year federal outlays be no greater than federal revenues deficit spending would not be allowed for any fiscal year unless expressly approved by threefifths of the congress i second total federal revenues would not be allowed to grow at a rate greater than the growth of the national economy this would help stabilize the relationship between the federal government and the economy that supports it it also would discourage congress from achieving a balanced budget through excessive tax increases any additional taxes for the fiscal year would have to be approved by a majority of the whole membership of both houses and enacted into law third congress would be prohibited from passing excess costs on to the states to circumvent the amendment states could not be required to engage in additional activities without compensation from the federal government equal to the cost of those activities fourth congress would be allowed to waive the provisions of the amendment when a declaration of war is in effect in essence then house joint resolution 350 would require the congress to balance the federal budget every year or else be strictly accountable to the public for increases in spending and taxes the vast majority of voters in this country have expressed a strong interest in reduced levels of overall spending and taxing the ability to live within ones means and

the same equitable treatment of former spouses of military personnel as is afforded to former spouses of civil service personnel specifically congresswoman schroeders amendment would permit the state

proceeding it simply defers to the state courts to make that decision on the basis of their own domestic relations law i support this amendment for two reasons first as chair of the subcommittee on compensation and employee benefits i object to the inconsistent treatment of persons serving this country whether in the military or in civilian service during the 95th congress we enacted legislation requiring the federal government to honor state court property settlements and court orders relating to civil service retirement system pensions it is only fair that we extend those same provisions to the military retirement system the schroeder amendment would correct this inequity against an individual group military personnel and their spouses second i suppnrt this amendment because our failure to act favorably on the issue will in many cases prolong the agony of divorce this is simply a cruel and unjust thing to do even congress cannot be that callous the supreme court has ruled that in the absence of a federal statute to the contrary a state court may not order a division of military retired pay in lieu of this many state supreme courts are delaying action on divorce cases awaiting some kind of action by congresq divorce proceedings are traumatic enough without the needless delay caused by congressional inaction after nearly 5 years of discussion and inaction on several pieces of
