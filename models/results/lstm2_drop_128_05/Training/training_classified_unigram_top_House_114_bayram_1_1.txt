who was practicing law in manhattan at a place called willkie farr and gallagher remember i had 15 minutes scheduled with him and left 2 hours later i told him that his writings going back to 1974 were as relevant today as they were when they were written they were timeless they were classics my favorite story is the one that he told about how he came to edit the book lincoln on democracy in 1988 governor cuomo met in albany with a delegation from the teacher section of polands solidarity union which was the leading advocate for bringing democracy to poland when it was under communist rule the teachers told the governor that they were building an archive of influential and insightful writings on democracy they asked if he could recommend writings by american thinkers that had influenced his approach to public service and democracy cuomo immediately identified abraham lincoln as his favorite source of wisdom the polish delegation said governor lincolns writings and speeches are not available in poland in fact they were banned cuomo promised to give them the speeches that they needed in order to appreciate what he had come to appreciate in lincoln cuomo says delegation come over here he pulled out the 378page index of the collected works of abraham lincolnnot one mention of democracy in those works so together with lincoln scholar harold holzer he wrote edited and published lincoln on democracy a book that to this day is essential reading for anyone wishing to understand the uniquely american approach to democracy and governance true to his word the polish version of the book appeared in warsaw in early 1990 before its english version was available in the united states mario cuomos gift was that he forced us to think for ourselves he forced us to consider our history and he forced us to recognize our responsibility to build a foundation that is better than the foundation that those who came before us built for us that is the true meaning of

michigan first i want to acknowledge many members of the michigan delegation led by flints representative congressman dan kildee who are fighting every day to bring justice to these families their work is essential to ensuring the people of flint have the resources that they need to recover the situation in flint is nothing short of a tragedy and a tragedy that could have been prevented michigan state officials sacrificed the health and futures of flints children in order to save a few dollars in water costs this really is a shame and a disgrace i have to ask would this have happened in a city where the residents had the advantage of wealth or do these gross breaches of public trust only happen in cities where politicians believe the residents are expendable sadly i think we all know the answer to that question after the incredible harm that has already been done to these families our elected officials are once again turning their backs on the people of flint these families deserve better the people of flint were already hurting before the water crisis the average family income in the city is just 24 834 a year no one can raise a family on that many of these courageous and resilient families struggle to find highquality child care access healthcare services and afford healthy food and now the costs of this crisis are mounting for families the schools and the entire community we can and we must do more for our fellow americans in their time of need two years since this tragedy began families are still relying on bottled water for daily life imagine using bottled water for everything from brushing your teeth to making a bottle for a hungry baby we can do better by these families they need support including health care nutrition specialized education and developmental care and we need to fix the root of the problem the degraded dangerous pipes and infrastructure that caused this tragedy the shortsighted dangerous actions of michigan officials have already caused unimaginable pain for these families we cannot allow congress to betray these families as well let me just say that i was part of a congressional delegation that traveled to flint michigan to listen to the residents regarding the horrendous impact of these government decisions that led to the poisoning of those children and families the environmental injustice in flint is an example of how many lowincome communities of color throughout our country not just in flint throughout the united states an example of how they are treated differently than affluent communities congressman dan kildee and members of the michigan delegation have introduced legislation that would help these families rebuild their lives and get the care they need for their children the families of flint act h r 4479 is a comprehensive plan to address their most urgent needs it would provide for critical investment in flints water system to replace the lead pipes that poisoned these families this legislation would also provide essential support services to the families of flint to help these children mitigate and overcome lead exposure these are simple commonsense measures for the people of flint addressing this tragedy really shouldnt be a partisan issue every member of this chamber should understand the need for urgent action it could happen in any of our communities yet congressional republicans have not held one single vote or even a hearing on this bill that is just simply outrageous and let me just say that flint is not the only public health crisis that congressional republicans have ignored there are 17 000 americansincluding almost 1 600 pregnant womenwho have contracted the zika virus the president submitted an emergency request of 1 9 billion for zika funding more than 6 months ago and the republicans have failed to act on it now if we dont act soon the cdc will be out of money to combat zika in a matter of weeks congressional republicans also failed to do their job on gun violence every day more than 90 million people die from gun violence this too is a public health crisis but congressional republicans once again have refused to take up any commonsense gun legislation even though 91 percent of americans support background checks to keep guns out of the hands of terrorists and criminals it is clear that the american people need

and make two points number one lets not let bondholders bleed puerto rico at a discount number two lets work together on what unites us not what divides us because the only way we will make any progress is if the people of puerto rico come together to make a plan and demand that the congress of the united states work with puerto rico on puerto ricos plan without consistent and persistent pressure from puerto rico washington will do nothing as both the administration and the congress are content to let the bondholders on wall street call the tune we all know washington should start with h r 870 the bankruptcy bill it is simply a bill that will allow puerto rico to declare bankruptcy and restructure its debt within the unitedstates legal system this would allow an orderly and fair restructuring of the debt in a court of law it is an important step but will not solve all of puerto ricos problems what puerto rico should do right now is demand to know what wall street vulture capitalists are paying for the bonds we hear a report that the bonds are selling for 15 and 20 cents on the dollar yet the bond owners want a full dollars worth of interest i say puerto rico should pay interest based on the price the billionaires actually paid and that they should disclose this amount just as a congressman does in this congress every time we make an investment then puerto rico can service its debt based on what was paid to buy the debt i came here to protect people not the profits of billionaires on wall street secondly and most importantly for the time being we must set aside politics and get away from the smokescreen of the status issue in puerto rico whether puerto rico should be a state an independent nation or remain a commonwealth cannot be the priority right now before this congress if everyone leaves puerto ricoand they are leaving by 5 000 a monthit will not matter what kind of government is left behind nobody should use the current debt crisis as an opportunity to score political points for their party at a time when the people of puerto rico must be clear precise and unified the status issue divides puerto ricans i read in the new york times the argument of the resident commissioner of the statehood party that the only solution to puerto ricos problems is to make it a state really that is going to solve the debt crisis the power crisis the public employees pension gap crisis the medicare advantage budget crisis we should be working together to figure out how puerto rico is going to pay teachers and honor their pensions how we will make sure health care is delivered to all and bridges do not collapse a statehood bill is not going to provide housing create a job or heal a sick child when members of congress ask me about puerto rico they ask me which is it is it statehood do you want a bankruptcy bill do you want more medicaid we have to prioritize we have to be clear and put aside the status issue please we need to work together i would like to use my remaining minute to restate my call to action in spanish english translation of the statement made in spanish is as follows politics and divisions could destroy the chances of forcing washington to help resolve puerto ricos debt crisis puerto rico must have a common plan that has support across all of the parties and most importantly across the island the governor must find a way to work with the resident commissioner and the resident commissioner cannot view this crisis as a campaign tool for higher office puerto rico will only be helped by this congress if and when there is a consistent and persistent call on congress by puerto ricans to act and puerto ricans need to specify what they expect congress to do the bankruptcy bill is only part of it if we still have the jones act and the same economy and economic prospects as we have now we will not advance the people must tell wall street that puerto rico is not some store to be looted and that the puerto rican people will not sit and starve as wall street counts its profits if wall street is buying bonds at a discount they should be paid at a discount but most importantly we have to work together for the betterment of puerto rico and we cannot let political divisions over statehood divide us i commit to putting aside my own passionate feelings about puerto ricos status and working with other puerto ricans in the congress and other leaders in both parties who will help us but we must first come together begin helping ourselves and have a clear plan la politica y las divisiones podrian destruir las posibilidades de obligar a washington a ayudar a resolver la crisis de la deuda de puerto rico puerto rico debe de tener un plan comdin que cuente con el apoyo de todos los partidos y sobre todo a traves de la isla el gobernador debe encontrar una manera de trabajar con el comisionado residente y el comisionado residente no puede ver esta crisis como una herramienta en sus campanias para un puesto mis alto el congreso s6lo ayudari a puerto rico siempre y cuando haya un llamado constante y persistente de los puertorriquehos exigiendo que el congreso cumpla y los puertorriquehlos tienen que indicar lo que esperan de parte del congreso la legislaci6n de bancarrota es s6lo una parte pero si todavia tenemos la ley jones y la misma economia y perspectivas econ6micas que tenemos ahora no avanzaremos el pueblo debe decirle a wall street que puerto rico no es una tienda para ser pirateada y que el pueblo de puerto rico no esperari a morir de hambre mientras wall street cuenta sus

observance of a truly remarkable organization that provided a great need at a great time imagine where we were 100 years ago in 1916 the world teetering on world war i boll weevil a lot of things happening just a matter of perhaps 50 years the south recovering from the civil war great devastation enter into this picture of great need comes farm credit when we celebrate this 100year anniversary we have to celebrate it right we have to let people know the importance and why this organization came into existence and i say that particularly in the south we might not have really made it as quickly in terms of our recovery as we did if it were not for farm credit on this 100th anniversary we have so much to celebrate so many fine people those who started it are gone but they built it on a solid foundation that had lasted agriculture is the single most important industry in the world it is the food we eat it is the water we drink it is the clothes we wear and it is the financial system that we have created the very commitment that chairman austin scott and i share was birthed out of thatthe commodities exchange the south didnt have everything it needed but it had the land and it had the crops it had commodities farm credit provided the liquidity that our farmers needed so there is so much to cherish in this time that we are celebrating there is something else too as we look at this as chairman scott said 72 percent of their loans are going to beginning new farmers now why do i say that is so important because the number one issue that we are faced with today is the age of the average farmer to me and to many of us in agriculture this is not only a farming issue it is a national issue that the average age of a farmer today is 60 years of age what other industry has that what other sector has that that is why we have to move aggressively that is why i appreciate farm credit so muchbecause they jumped out front seventytwo percent of their lending capacity goes to getting young beginning farmers in the other thing is they are partnering with our committee and going a step further there is so much we can do but it was the land grant colleges in the south that was the pivot the 1860s and the 1890s is what pulled this country and pulled the south together every 5 years we put a farm bill together in that farm bill we allocate badly needed dollars to these 1890 land grant institutions as well as to the 1860s i mention that because we have to get young beginning farmersafrican americans white all of americas people so what we are doing is to open up a new spending category in the farm bill for these 1890s that we will be able to give loan forgiveness and scholarships to young people who will go into farming that is how we solve this problem and farm credit has to template they are there with that other arm it costs 8 000 just for one acre of land you can hardly get a tractor for less than 50 000 it is neededwhen these young people graduate and they have that loan forgiveness there they have that debt in schoolin order for them to go and become farmers they have to pay 8 000 to start with just an acre and 50 000 but if we would be able to help them and say we will help your loan forgiveness i mention that because the people at farm credit said let me reach out a hand let me help fort valley state in georgia to partner with the university of georgia let me help florida a m university land grant to work with the university of florida a land grant let me help alabama a m university and tuskegee institute work with the university of alabama that is how we solve this problem that is why it is important for us to understand the foundation farm credit was developed out of a crisis need and here they are moving to help with another crisis need to get more young people involved in farming i say a national crisis because if we allow this to continue without addressing this highly escalating age of our farmers we will be in serious trouble for if we do not continue to be the leading agriculture producer in the world and have to depend on other nations to feed us that is a national crisis so on this 100th

of working on longer term solutions such as reauthorizing esea or working on job creation the majority is pushing its own education priorities on a local jurisdiction through this misguided

first authorized in 2004 has failed to improve student academic achievement as measured by math and reading scoresincluding among the students the program was designed to most benefit those from lowperforming public schools despite having numerous states vote down efforts to implement private school voucher programs republicans continue to use the district of columbia as a testing ground for
