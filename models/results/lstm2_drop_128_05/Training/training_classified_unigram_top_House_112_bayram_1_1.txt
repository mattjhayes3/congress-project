funding in this cr to 10 billion it should be enough to withdraw the troops but the argument was made that to reduce the funding is not to support our troops to rob them of the implements of doing their job but the fact is that the only power that congress has to effectuate the warmaking power to control whether we should be at war somewhere or another is the power of the purse we are not saying by adopting this amendment we would not be saying that we want our troops there with no weapons and so forth we would be saying use the funds to bring the troops home it is more supportive of the troops to bring them home from a war that they should not be fighting that is not vital to our national security it is more supportive to bring them home than it is to give them weapons to fight

good friend from vermont for yielding to me and i thank my colleagues for participating in this discussion there are so many things that are hard to understand with regard to what occurred today one is that the new republican majority tells us that jobs is their first priority this will generate about 4 million jobs around the country were toldand we can identify where they occur and so we wont create those jobs particularly in the health care professions we are told that another high priority of course is to reduce the budget deficit the nonpartisan congressional budget office tells us that this will save more than 1 trillion through an emphasis on preventive care by getting people out of the most expensive emergency care and into doctors offices and much more efficient delivery of care but nevertheless we wont save that money and we wont create those jobs one of the fascinating things is that im told by many of my friends on the republican side that they actually agree to eliminating the insurance companies ability to deny people due to preexisting conditions its just that theyre opposed to the individual mandate because its unconstitutional the fact is you cant have one without the other imagine how our car insurance system would work you have to have car insurance but theres no mandate so just wait until you get into a crash then go to the hospital go to your insurance company theyre going to have to pay it up i guess they think thats the way the health insurance system would workwait until you get sick wait until you have an accident go to your insurance company get your insurance coverage theyll pay for it obviously they wont pay for it because every insurance company would go out of business and so if you had preexisting conditions without an individual mandate then its the federal government that would have to provide health care to everyone when they got sick or when they had an accident because certainly no private insurance company would ever think of putting themselves in that position so you cant have one without the other it doesnt make sense but to my very good friend from vermont who gave us the opportunity to share a few comments tonight after this historic vote the thing that troubles me the most that i cant get my mind around is that before we took that vote to repeal health care reform every single republican member of this congress voted to say i want my federal employees health benefits plan i want my insurance coverage and then they went ahead and every single one of them voted against providing the same sort of coverage to their constituents thats what the recommittal was i dont know how many of them read ittheyre always complaining well we didnt have a chance to read it well it was as simple as could be if youre going to vote against providing health insurance for your constituents then dont take it for yourself because its basically the same plan but every single one of them old and new members alike voted to give themselves that very plan that they then turned around and voted against making available to their constituents so this may have been one of the most hypocritical days in the history of the united states congress i dont know how they explain it i dont know how i would explain it if i had to go back home sorry about that i took care of myself in one votethe very first vote of this brand new congressand then i voted to do just the opposite for you in the very next vote boy were off to a very interesting start i thank my friend for giving us the opportunity to share

when our state is facing an almost 27 billion deficit these are crucial moneys that can be used immediately to help school districts throughout texas let me give you a little history during the recovery act of 2009 texas received 12 billion of that 3 2 billion was supposed to be for public education our governor and the texas legislature used 12 billion instead of supplementing the current education funding they used the 3 2 billion in place of the current education funding the governor went all over the country getting books signed saying how bad the federal government is but they didnt give back that 12 billion they used it to plusup the rainy day fund thats over 9 billion right now and they dont even want to use it so at that time what the democratic members from texas said was that we want to make sure this 830 million goes to the schoolchildren of texas thats what this would do and thats what this law does it would make sure that that money would go to the schoolchildren it wouldnt get stuck in austin it would go down to my houston school district the galena park school district which is having to cut its budget right now because it didnt get that 3 2

their wrists and much worse now additional reporting by the washington post has revealed that unitedstates officials knew for some time about this torture of prisoners by afghan security forces so what did our top people in afghanistan do about these warnings apparently not a thing for years our special operations forces and cia officials had been in and out of these prisonsdropping off detainees meeting with afghan authorities taking advantage of the intelligence gathered there we paid to rebuild one prison with the cold and chilling name department 124 which sits behind a concrete fortress near unitedstates military headquarters in kabul it would be hardactually it would be impossibleto miss what was going on inside those walls but for a long time it was ignorednothing said no meaningful oversight exerted it wasnt until a few months ago when the u n made it clear they were releasing a report detailing the torture that our military commanders suddenly took notice and stopped sending prisoners to these facilities in a flash they instituted a monitoring program and human rights training its embarrassing but it seems like our leadership was more concerned about public relations damage control than adherence to human rights norms and international law the american people have sacrificed a lot for this war and in return theyve been fed a lot of highminded assurances that were doing important work that advances american values the name of this mission is operation enduring freedom but apparently were not practicing what we preach in afghanistan because torture has no place in free society no place in a campaign that professes to be about human dignity and the rule of law at a time when were considering major cuts right here at home in lifesaving domestic programs so that we can get our fiscal house in order how can we possibly justify spending billions of dollars every week on a military occupation that seems to be promoting and encouraging torture we cannot wash our hands of this we cannot avoid responsibility because this is happening on our watch torture whether were practicing it ourselves or just tacitly condoning it isnt just reprehensible

affairs the greatest currency we have is our moral authority but we continue to waste it by acting like outlaws instead of the greatest superpower on earth the time has come it is time we had a

until november 14 and yet we have had only 8 legislative days of work in that period of time i thank you for calling that dereliction of duty to the attention of the american people because we have work to do its not as if our work is finished as you have indicated there is critical legislation that is expiring that has passed even in the senate yet republicans have blocked the vote in the house whether its middle income tax relief postal reform violence against women the farm bill and then of course initiatives proposed by president obama to create jobs for our economy i was so pleased to hear what our colleague congresswoman schwartz had to say about medicare because our names are all on the ballot in this years election but what is really at stake is medicare medicare medicare medicare as you said mr hoyer they offered nothing except to raise costs to seniors for getting less as they phase out medicare i wanted to talk about another subject because its a larger issue as i hear this question bandied about you hear people say are you better off now than you were 4 years ago the republicans have the nerve to pose that question that when you look back to 4 years ago this very week you would know that we are indeed fundamentally and unquestionably better off as a country today this week 4 years ago september 18 to be exact but this week there was a meeting in my office when i was speaker of the democratic and republican leadership of the house and of the senate gathered together to hear a report from the administration that was very alarming mind you september 18 2008 the secretary of the treasury hank paulson described for us a financial system in imminent danger of total collapse chairman bernanke at that same meeting the chairman of the fed told us if we did not act immediately we would not have an economy by monday this was a thursday evening you remember mr hoyer you were there if we do not act immediately we will not have an economy by monday how on earth can people who perpetrated that situation on our country have the nerve to turn around and ask that question at the end of the meeting we all went out in a bipartisan way and spoke to the press i said at the time time is of the essence and that congress would act i was trying to lift confidence in our financial situation despite there being a presidential election 7 weeks away at that time it was no time for partisanship the crisis demanded that democrats and republicans work with president bush to rescue our economy from depression or as chairman bernanke said from our not having an economy 4 days later in the days ahead our country confronted the worst financial crisis since the great depression the costs were staggering more than 8 trillion lost in household wealth more than 8 million jobs lost and more than 4 million families losing their homes to foreclosure nonetheless the democrats voted with president bush to restore confidence in our markets and the republicans even walked away from their own president in the 2 years after that september 18 meeting we continued to take actions to reduce spending and to address what was inevitable from the policies of the 8 years previous to the november 2008 election when we took the majority and with president obama in office we took action to reduce spending create jobs keep people in their homes and passed doddfrank the toughest wall street reforms in generations with itthe most historic for the first timeprotections for american consumers in that bill all of it was fought vigorously against by the republicans now we have president obama and we have a republican congress under president obamas leadership we have added private sector jobs for 30 straight months compared to losing 700 000 jobs a month as he entered office the auto industry which was facing extinction and the loss of over 1 million jobs in that industry is again competitive and hiring and thriving the dow jones average which is one reflection of the security of tens of millions of american investors and pension funds has already doubled and housing prices are slowly rising again we need much more progress there imagine from that time the dow jones has doubled we still have work to do to continue the american recovery if the republicans had cooperated at all with president obama in the last 2 years we would be much farther down the road to recovery we cooperated with president bush but they would not offer an ounce of cooperation to president obama and our economy has paid the price we have reaped the benefits of some of what happened in the 2 years when we were in the majority and president obama was in the first 2 years of his term but so much more could have been done with some cooperation from the republicans we get back to the question are we better off this week in september than we were this week 4 years ago you be the judge i know americas families are hurting we want to do more to create jobs et cetera and we have to have bipartisan cooperation to do that the republicans have resisted that from that standpoint yes we can do better but from the standpoint of this country when there was a financial crisis we were on the verge of a total collapse where the chairman of the fed told us that if we did not act immediately we wouldnt have an economy by monday yes we are fundamentally as a country better off and therefore the prospects for the future are better for all of americas families and thats what we are here to work on the future too bad our republican colleagues have cut and run from town but we
