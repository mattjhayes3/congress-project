this proposal to put it to two tests the first test is does the policy work on the ground in nicaragua and is it likely to succeed this is a military action by soldiers that we are supporting and i think that as we think about whether or not they could militarily succeed putting aside the cia reports and even our own defense reports that say they are unlikely to overthrow the sandinistas it is important to review a little history of our involvement in nicaragua the united states has invaded nicaragua 12 times in history if you go the 1920s and 1930s it sounds an awful lot like the congressional record of today and if you look at the old newspapers from those periods you will see that the headlines remind you of the headlines of today so to the people of nicaragua the people that were involved in those times this is nothing new 1 1700 i think a second fact we must recognize is that in the late 1970s when this country underwent a revolution 50 000 nicaraguans lost their lives this is a country of about 3 3 million and if we remember in the vietnam conflict we lost about 50 000 people on almost any day you can drive by the vietnam memorial here and get a sense of what that conflict and that loss of life meant in this country so we can imagine what that meant in nicaragua when we begin thinking about whether or not a military solution to the problem is something that can work on the ground in nicaragua so i simply submit on the basis of that anecdotal evidence and the evidence we see from our own military and our own central intelligence agency that having a military policy and a military solution to our problems is not likely to succeed i think the next thing we should look at is this does the policy reach the goals and the vital interests of the united states on this point i think there has been some confusion because we have many different goals that are enunciated by the administration i think we should try to better articulate what our goals are i think there are two i think we have two vital interests in nicaragua the first is to reduce the foreign military influences in that country certainly soviet cuban libyan whatever foreign military influence is in this country and the second is to keep the sandinistas from interfering with their neighbors with many of whom we have treaties and obligations if we put this policy against that testwhat are our goals and are we reaching them i think members would agree with me that we are not previous speakers on the other side have said that we just cannot negotiate with communists certainly there are people in our country who have that view i do not think the president has that view if he did have that view he would not be negotiating with mikhail gorbachev and the soviet union if he did have that view he would not be negotiating with the chinese on a variety of subjects and i believe that the president has even said that the contras are in the field in order to put pressure on the sandinistas so that we can get to negotiations to resolve and reconcile our vital interests if that is our goal then what are the people in the region who are leading the effort and working to make this effort come about saying about contra aid president arias who is the author of the live and viable plan of the moment said when he received his nobel peace prize that president reagan knows very welland i quote that the contras are the problem and not the solution and yesterday the people who have been active n the contadora process said this we urgently call upon the countries with ties or interests in the region to halt unconditionally unilaterally and immediately any actions aimed at destablization or any type of aid to irregular forces as is established in the san jose declaration for the attainment of peace and democracy n central america in conclusion i would say let us give peace a chance let us give the people in the region a chance we have been trying the military solution for 6 years now let us give the other way a chance let us give life to the words of a great american uttered about his brother when he said we see wrong and try to right it we see suffering and try to heal it and we see war and try to stop it we have tried the military solution let us try something else let us give peace a chance let us not give this aid to the contras"], [0.01619088649749756,

year of statehooda time in which israe s commitment to democracy is being tested by her intransigent foes during recent months israel has had to muster all of her forces both military political and moralto carry out her painful responsibilitios facing a frustrated palestinian population on the west bank and gaza strip israel has had to deal with the results of arab unwillingness to recognize her existence for 40 years the arab nations surrounding israel have refused to meet with her at the bargaining table to even discuss the issues of the territories and the palestinians the only exception of course is egypt which signed the camp david accords with israel and the united states in 1979 the intransigence of israels neighbors predates israeli statehood arab countries sought to prevent the creation of a jewish state by opposing the u n partition resolution of 1947 which partitioned the british mandate of palestine into israel and palestinian statesand which backed by every major u n power had the arabs accepted this resolution there would today be a separate palestinian state celebrating its 40th anniversary alongside israel throughout her short history israel has made pleas for negotiations her countless offers to give up the west bank and gaza strip in exchange for peace continually received the arab response in the three famous no s of the khartoum conference of 1967 no recognition no negotiations no peace even prior to the six day war in june 1967 when the arab countries had in their possession the very same territories upon v tose return they now condition peace in the region they would not accept israel as a jewish state in their midst it is at this crossroad at this time when all parties to the conflict must make extremely tough choices that the jewish state pauses to consider its remarkable achievements over the past 40 years having weathered five wars internal conflict over fundamental issues affecting the state and external threats by countless nations

subcommittee began the first congressional investigation of the potential loss of over 1 million units presently available and affordable to low and moderate income tenants as sections 236 and 221 d 3 federally insured and subsidized rental housing projects reach their 20 year anniversary and owners consider repaying the mortgages and terminating rent and occupancy requirements faced with the spectre of this loss which is even more devastating because of the failure over the past 7 years to maintain a healthy assisted housing production program this conference report contains an interim solution the owners of housing insured under the national housing act can neither prepay their mortages or in any way change the status or the terms of the regulatory agreement without the secretary of hud approving a plan of action which must be designed to preserve as much low and moderate income housing as possible this conference report is also a tribute to the survival of the rural housing programs of the farmers home administration congress has rejected the administrations attempt to eliminate this key source of homeowner loans for lower income families in rural areas and has created a modest loan guarantee program for families whose income does not exceed 115 percent of rural median incomes whose access to financing is extremely limited particularly in the case of firsttime home buyers the conference report also addresses the critical problem of the loss of affordable section 515 rental housing units for low income families through a program of incentives and refinancing owners of these projects are encouraged to keep these projects in the rural low income inventory for another 20 years or to turn them over to local nonprofit or public agencies without penalty the conference report extends the cbdg program for 2 more years and sharpens the focus of that program the amount of funds thatmust principally benefit low and moderate income families is increased from 50 to60 percent while this change affects the total expenditure in a state or entitlement community up to a 3year period it has not changed the low and moderateincome threshold that individual projects must meet the conference report also strengthens citizen participation requirements and assures that low and moder ateincome families that are displaced from their homes as a result of cdbg or udag funded activities will be compensated fairly finally the conference report establishes a program of nehemiah homeownership grants designed to assist nonprofit organizations to help families whose incomes generally are no higher than the area median to purchase homes that are concentrated in lower income neighborhoods this neighborhood revitalization effort is modeled after a very successful program initiated in brooklyn ny and was the subject of hearings held by the housing subcommittee in 1984 given the reasonableness of the authorization levels the inclusion of a number of reforms urged by our republican colleagues to the public housing program the rural homeownership loan guarantee program the section 202 handicapped program the enterprise zone program and the permanent authority provided for the fha insuring programs i urge my colleagues support for the passage of this conference report the text of the statement of managers contains an error on page 201

reaching in agreement authorizing 299 6 billion for defense consistiint with last novembers budget summit agreement and the fiscal year 1989 budget resolution i am particularly grateful for the excellent work of the distinguished chairperson or the military personnel and compensation subcommittee mrs byron for her leadership in shepherding legislalion i introduced earlier this year h r 3975 which directs the secretary of defense to establish a permanent rental housing program involving military personnel and their civilian landlords this program will remove perhaps the largest financial burden on our military families this legislation will make permanent the pilot program which has been in effect at fort ord over the last 15 months the program has been implemented with a high degree of success resulting in the solution of problems with military residents with respect to payment and landlords obtaining guarantees on security deposit payments although the senate defense authorization measure did not contain a similar provision h r 4264s housing lease indemnity program was adopted by the senate with two amendments i support both amendments the first amendment clarifies the due process provlsions of the program regarding each participating service members obligation before reducing that members pay for breach of the lease or damage to the rental unit and the other amendment outlines the extension of this program to our service members overseas i would like to take a few minutes to describe what this legislation will do first of all it authorizes the secretary of defense to make the program permanent each military service would then have the option of whether and at which inst llations to institute participation in this program in the united states second civilian landlords who rent to military personnel would agree to waive security deposits when renting housing units to military personnel for the guarantee of rental deposit security from the military in return the military post would agree that if for any reason the service member leaves without making final payments for rent or damage the post would make such final payments these payments could not exceed the amount of an ordinarily required security deposit any outlays of the military post would then be deducted from the service members paycheck for example a service member wants to rent an apartment for 500 per month under this legislation the landlord would agree to accept only a first months rent without any required security deposit or last months rent right away we are saving the service member up to 1 000 if the service member if transferred to another post or is assigned to onpost housing and leaves his apartment without paying his last months rent the post to which he is assigned would meet the last months rent payment of 500 this 500 would then be deducted from the service members paycheck all of my colleagues are aware of the tremendous financial and emotional pressures inflicted on our military personnel and their families this already tense situation is made even worse during a permanent change of station move travel and relocation expenses come out of the pockets of our servicemen and women reimbursement comes later although in the past only 1 out of 4 spent on a pcs move has been reimbursed according to an air force study and when the military families arrive in a new location they must meet the immediate costs of security deposits first and last months rent utility deposits and more before you can even blink a military family can be thousands of dollars in debt and 2 years later the entire process is repeated it is important to note that no appropriation of funds is necessary because the service member would be ultimately responsible for meeting the costs of any damage or breach of lease i know that the landlords on the monterey peninsula have benefited from the pilot program the favorable comments from the civilian landlords show that the vacancy rate has dropped considerably in their particular apartment complexes since participating in the program also a housing referral office representative available when requested during moveout inspections provided the verification necessary to resolve any disputes or misunderstandings that arose at that time they realize the hardships imposed on the military family and they understand the progam guarantees payment for damages and breach of lease up to the amount of the usual security deposit this program gives landlords one point of contact for all their military tenants and a source of information regarding military personnel who may soon be transferred thus enabling landlords to prepare for a change in the lease soldiers have been very happy with the program because without it they could not afford a place to live and would therefore be forced to live apart from their families until onpost housing became available the program has also kept soldiers from getting into serious financial difficulties which is often associated with a pcs move this program should solve one of the major problems facing our military personnel and do away with certainly one of their largest financial burdens what is more no one loses in this program everyone wins landlords are guaranteed payment our military personnel are able to use their hardearned dollars for necessities and the services are guaranteed reimbursement for any outlays to landlords when the house voted in the 99th congress to accept many proposals to ease the burdens on our military personnel servicemen and women all over the world breathed a sigh of relief now this legislation will resolve one of the most pressing and financially disabling issues by making permanent this highly successful pilot program permanent so that one day our military men and women will not look on military service as a financially crippling experience again i want to thank the conferees

thoughtful moderate balanced statement and i would simply like to add to it i myself have been deeply concerned i could use a lot of adjectives such as horrified and shocked to describe my feelings about what appeared to be the unmeasured response of the israeli government to the violence on the west bank and the announcement by the defense minister that israel is going to use force and beatings as a matter of policy that to me was totally illconsidered there is no question that israel pays a formidable price in international good will and credibility when statements like that are made of all the governments in the world of all the peoples in the world to use excessive violence it is hard to think of a country wvhose history within recent memory four decades makes such action less appropriate and more offensive i have to say that in all honesty it has been a very painful process for all of us here who have a deep sense of commitment to israel who want to see her survive who want to see her maintain her special relationship with our country and who want to see her maintain the very special moral and ethical quality that has differentiated israel from all the governments in the middle east and most of the governments in the world it has been painful for those of us who care about those things to see what is going on and i hope very much that israel will cease the policy of public beatings breaking hands and breaking bones in response to arab violence i regret saying this publicly but congressman barney frank of massachusetts did bring up this subject and he treated it in a very thoughtful way so perhaps it is appropriate to comment on it i expressed these views privately in an hourlong meeting with the israeli ambassador to the united states about a month ago so here i am going public but let me just add a footnote that first of all these are very trying experiences under similarly trying experiences with comparatively untrained or insufficiently trained troops we had our kent state we had our my lai and we consider ours a moral and an ethical country but sometimes the training of troops and the training of national guard personnel is not sufficient for the extraordinary conditions under which they all of a sudden have to function and i suspect there was some degree of lack of training and lack of preparedness for these violent episodes on the part of the israeli troops they are trained soldiers and they are trained for combat they are not trained for civil disobedience and civil rebellion and it must be quite clearly recognized that these young kids these palestinian kids were not playing kids games they were not playing spih the bottle they were not playing mumbletypeg they were playing lethal games when you throw a molotov cocktail people get killed when you throw large hunks of rock and cement people get killed a young arab youth was killed by a hunk of cement that was thrown by a palistinian and we have seen pictures of both soldiers and television cameramen writhing on the ground in agony after having been hit by large rocks these are very serious lethal games that the palestinian youth are playing apparently these lethal games are not entirely spontaneous some kind of master hand is organizing them and guiding them and i think the israeli government has an absolute right in its own self defense to meet that kind of lethal violence with sufficient force to quell it and to control it it is very difficult to measure what kind of force is sufficie force as we have found out in our country let me also say that the israeli government for 40 years repeatedly has expressed the position that it is willing to sit down with the arabs and talk about all the issues the only arab chief of tate who took them up on that was president sadat and we all know regrettably the tragic history that ensured fi 9m his pattern of cooperation and hi openhandedness in dealing with the state of israel assassination has become an accepted means of political expression in the arab world and no doubt one of the reasons which gives king hussein pause at accepting a public posture of cooperating with the is aelis is the memory that he has frorm childhood of the vision of his grandflther being shot down in cold blood by arab extremists when there was suspicion that his grandfather was cooperating with the jewish agency of palestine of course this long precedes the establishment of the jewish state in 1948 and perhaps it was true that he was cooperating with the jewish agency for palestine in trying to bring some kind of common understanding some kind of consensus some kind of compromise and some kind of conciliation to the very troubled period in those days predating the founding of the state of israel tlpat policy of assassination for willingness to meet with the israelis halfway or even a quarter of the way has persisted there have been a whole string of political assassinations directed against the socalled arab moderate such as the massacre of syrian citizens in the village of horns by syrian troops those assassinations have no doubt had a very stultifying impact on tlhe willingness of arab chiefs of state or arab civilians andcivic leaders to express some willingness to meet israel at the conference table israel today has a clearly expressed position of being ready to sit down and negotiate with the arabs on every aspect of peace whether israel should agree to a process of trading land for peace is a decision that only the israelis are capable of making how much land for how much peace i could not define the land areas on the west bank or in gaza that israel could reasonably give up without having to face far higher security risks these are very sophisticated military and security decisions that i do not feel qualified to make i am not sure that many of the 535 members of the house and senate are qualified to make that decision either how much peace what does peace mean peace certainly means more than nonbelligerency israel gave up a very considerable portion of land in the sinai desert to establish peace with egypt yet they did not get peace what they got was a minimal level of nonbelligerency peace means far more than that peace means commerce peace means the exchange of students peace means the exchange of scientists peace means the exchange of business people peace means joint programs for development of all kinds peace meaiis joint telecommunications projects involving radio and telephone and television peace means joint projects affecting the environment such as the mutual joint exploitation of the scarce water resources in the middle east and peace means the exchanr e of cultural representatives even with egypt the one country in the middle east that has gone further than a status of total belligerency even with that country israel signed a peace treaty but did not get peace at the most they have gotten a begrudging arrangement for nonbelligerency that is a lot the absence of war is a heck of a lot better than a continuation of war but still israel paid a great price for peace and did not ever get what we normally think of as the full measure of peace and the blessings of peace they got a small measure of nonbelligerency nothing more so israel had to do some agonizing introspection on how much land will not jeopardize their security for how much peace how much can israel trust a signature an arab signature on a peace treaty i do not know the answer to that i suspect the israelis are far more sophisticated and far better equipped to make that decision of haw much land they are willing to sacrifice for a collection of arab signatires on a peace treaty i suspect that the israelis are far letter qualified to make the decision a to whether if the arabs ever had a viable military option they would not instantaneously take advantage of it no matter how many signatures were on how many peace treaties i cannot answer that question all of these issues have to be factored into the question of how much land for how much peace these are agonizing questions for all of us and i would state that our predilection for pushing israel against her better judgment into a posture of agreeing to make some sacrifices of land for some kind of peace is basically dubious proposition i know that president reagan and secretary shultz would desperately and urgently like to see some kind of resolution or at least the beginnings of some kind of resolution to these agonizingly complicated and emotion ridden anxiety ridden problems of the middle east it is only natural they would they would take legitimate pride in that accomplishment i give president reagan total credit for having been a friend of peace in the middle east and having been a stout and loyal friend of the state of israel i give secretary shultz credit beyond my ability to express in words he has been an extraordinarily talented thoughtful wise human being in his policies toward the middle east and i must say that when he was appointed secretary of state coming to that job from the vantage point of having been ceo or chief executive officer of the bechtel corp doing billions of dollars of business in the middle east i and some of my colleagues had some pretty profound reservations about him but they were quickly dispelled when we had a chance to hear him out discuss the issues with him and watch his performance he is an extraordinary man no matter what administration succeeds the reagan administration i suspect that secretary shultz will be sorely missed for his great qualities of heart his great qualities of intellect and his great qualities of integrity and decency that shine forth in every arena he is a remarkable human being but i suggest that we have to think about a whole long succession of presidents at least since world war ii almost every one of whom had the same conviction that they wanted to settle this agonizingly difficult problem of the middle east on their turf they have come up with one quick fix after another in the 40 years since world war ii the israelis have a long memory and they have to place all these individual efforts by individual presidents and secretaries of state to find a solution to the problem on their watch they have to view all of these successive efforts with a long and deep sense of history and perhaps they look around the world and see that some problems just cannot be solved by a quick neat solution we have problems with the soviet union that apparently although hopefully they are being reduced in order of magnitude now for 40 years since world war ii have been virtually intractable after all of the negotiations that have taken place over the 7 years of the reagan administration we and the soviets are each still spending 300 billionodd a year on defense hopefully we will gradually reduce that amount but we have not solved the basic problems between ourselves and the soviet union the british who are about as civilized a people as has ever populated this earth have still got agonizingly difficult problems with the irish the irish have agonhlingly difficult problems between irish catholics and irish protestants when you go to ireland and you visit with the protestant leadership in belfast and then you say what wonderful people they are they are intelligent they are thoughtful they are witty and they have got a rich history surely they can be expected to negotiate away these problems then you go to dublin and you meet with the irish catholic leadership and you say what marvelous thoughtful intelligent people these are why cant they get together well they have not gotten together these problems go back 400 years apparently they are virtually intractable there arc other places around the world the problems that the belgians have with nonbelgianspeaking groups and the problems the frenchcanadiansthe quebecquoise the levesque supportershave with the englishspeaking government in canada seem to be comparatively intractable as well so there are problems around the world which do not seem to be susceptible to a quick fix of easy rapid solutions it is just possible that the israelis thinkand i do not know this for a factthat there are not any quick fixes to the problems between arabs and israelis and that in all likelihood once they get into the business of territoryforpeace they are going to be under great pressure to make sacrifices of territory that are not in their best interests there are some israelis who have profound misgivings about the nature and quality of the land they gave back to egypt when they made a peace with egypt i think they expected a larger richer definition of peace than what they got so there may be some reservations about moving down that slippery slope of peaceforterritory or territoryforpeace i would respect their right to make those decisions and i would respect their right to tell us look we understand your tremendous eagerness your noteworthy praiseworthy eagerness to bring some kind of solace peace and reconciliation to the middle east but after the peace conference is over you all go back home and we are the ones who are left to live with these understandings we are the ones who have to evaluate over the years how much territorial sacrifice in terms of real security we made for how much of a peace what value do we place on that peace how much can we rely on that peace how much can we rely on the integrity of the arab signatures on that peace treaty there is no one who can make those decisions there is no one who can examine that calculus of factors other than the israelis themselves so i want to say how much i respect congressman frank for the very thoughtful way in which he treated this issue i want to say how much i respect the 30odd members of the senate for their bona fides and their real desire to contribute to world peace by the letter that they recently wrote to prime minister shamir but i think on the bottom line once we have made some suggestions and once as friends we have given whatever advice we choose to give the israelis on the way they have controlled the riotsand remember from their point of view it has to be considered gratuitous adviceonce we have given them our best judgment on adopting this policy or that policy or refusing to adopt this posture or that posture and explain that their decision may have a price tag and may cost them in good will military and economic aid and may cost them in credibility around the world then i think in all fairness we ought to let the israeli knesset the israeli military and security branches of their government make the hard decisions on into the actual process of reconciliation negotiation and compromise they have had the offer on the table ever since 1948 to talk what kind of preconditions we should impose upon them as to how and under what circumstances the talks get started is a very serious question i suggest that we should be very reluctant to force israel into any format into any system of negotiations that they feel may threaten their security they are a sovereign state we are a great friend of theirs we can give them advice and counsel and express the costs and the benefits to them of various alternative policies but when it comes to biting the bullet and making these critically important decisions involving the security of the region the peace for the region and the security of the state of israel i think we are going to have to let them think and decide for themselves i thank the speaker and yield back the balance of my time"], [0.02441573143005371, 0.9755842685699463, 1, "i rise in tribute to a true

the house has produced a bill which whil far from perfect will help to lower our staggering trade deficit and provide relief for the hundreds of thousands of workers in wisconsin and across the country who have lost their jobs due to imports the omnibus trade bill includes an important provision that would expand the federal governments commitment to workers who have been paying the price

increasing imports according to the wisconsin department of industry labor and human relations over 50 000 manufacturing jobs were lost in the state between the years 197884 in the years 198087 in racine kenosha and walworth counties nine plants have shut down or relocated resulting in almost 1 400 layoffs in those same years 20 additional companies laid off over 11 000 employees earlier this year the chrysler corp announced plans to shut down its stamping and assembly operations in kenosha by the end of the 1988 model year if chrysler goes ahead with its plans 5 500 workers will lose their jobs the kenosha plant first opened in 1902 it is the oldest auto plant in the nation the new worker readjustment program could mean a bigger pot of money available for programs to benefit chrysler workers in kenosha who may be laid off later this year and workers throughout the state who have lost their jobs because of foreign competition another important provision in the trade bill would expand and improve the trade adjustment assistance program this essential program provides training assistance and cash allowances to workers who lose their jobs due to imports currently taa training funds are provided on a cashavailable basis the conference agreement would make this portion of the program into an entitlement with an annual cap on payments of 80 million this provision would ensure that eligible workers receive training funds in the form of cash or a voucher unfortunately the conference agreement does not include the gephardt amendment this provision would have required countries which engage in unfair trade practices and have the biggest trade surpluses with us to reduce their surpluses by 10 percent annually the conferees adopted a much weaker provision but it would require the administration to enter into negotiations with countries which engage in unfair trade practices and to retaliate against countries which do not take steps to change their ways

these rights are being denied include rights of free association and collective bargaining minimum wage for child workers and minimum standards for occupational safety and health the trade bill has lost some teeth since it passed the house in april 1987 but its a good bill which will force the administration to take steps to eliminate unfair trade practices and it will significantly boost the

before us today the conference agreement on h r 5 represents one of the most farreaching education bills of the tecade and i commend the chairn n mr hawkins mr jeffords rnd our colleague from pennsylvania mr goodlin0 for their forward leadership h r 5 makes good on the federal promise to join with states and local school districts in enhancing the quality of our nations elementary and secondary schools it does so by offering a package of prograins that collectively reaffirm the federal commitment to access to quality education for disadvantaged students and other students with special needs i come to you today as a former educator and local school board member i am acutely aware that we must encourage and reward excellence in education and provide assistance to children who might otherwise never catch up with their more fortunate classmates h r 5 accomplishes that goal however i must reiterate my belief that the role of the federal government in education should be a limited one beyond my philosophical opposition to sending tax dollars to washington only to see 60 cents returned it is undeniable that state and local governments are best equipped to know what their particular community needs most local governments can provide the kind of flexibility creativity and attention to detail that is impossible on the federal level the final version of h r 5 includes my amendments on youth suicide prevention the roukema amendments establishes authorized youth suicide prevention programs as allowable prograins under the antidrug abuse act and chapter ii block grant fund the chapter ii block grant which provides money for such programs as early childhood development at risk students schoolwide improvements now includes one more important program suicide prevention let me be clear this does not mandate suicide prevention education this allows suicide prevention programs as an option my amendment allows local schools if they desire to apply chapter ii block grant money to establish needed prograins in youth suicide prevention my own district in northern new jersey was the scene of a terrible tragedy last year we all remember so vividly that four young people took their own lives dramatic evidence of the rising incidence of suicide across the country in the aftermath the community sought funds to develop a program to counsel children teachers and parents however their only recourse was the lengthy difficult process of applying for a federal grant which in the end was denied now i do not want a national competitive grant program to be the only recourse for communities to receive money if they desire my amendment is constructed to give the authority solely to the local entity without imposing the federal qovermients will oi discretion on local agercies it is an eflort to supplement and help schools deal with a tragic problem within their communities if they choose that option the school is the one institution that is the common denominator for all these students the purpose of my amendment is to use the schools to identify highrisk students and to identify them before they drop out in addition our local option provides the opportunity for the community to decide if there is a genuine need principals school teachers and officials who are most sensitive to the specific local circumstances will have the opportunity to establish programs and train personnel there is no doubt that suicide among teenagers is among the most serious social problems in that age group suicide is the leading cause of death among persons between the ages of 15 and 24 second only to traffic fatalities the number of young people taking their lives has increased greatly in the la t few decades last year the subcommittee on elementary secondary and vocational education conducted hearings on teenage suicide prevention a panel of expert witnesses offered their advice on how to prevent these tragedies the experts confirmed that there is a well established relationship between drug abuse and youth suicide my amendment recognizes this connection between drugs problems and other problems facing our young people no piece of legislation can be perfect and this bill is no expection i have serious reservations about one program included in h r 5that is the bilingual education act i have long been a critic of the bilingual education program for its failure to recognize the need to teach english to nonenglish speaking children as early as possible experience during the life of this program has demonstrated that teaching students in their native language has not proven effective although this compromise allows additional funding for alternative teaching methods such as immersion and english as a second language i would have liked to have seen it go further while alternative methods provide some flexibility bilingual education programs should be geared toward getting school children assimilated into englishspeaking classes rapidly and effectively the inability to speak english can severely hamper a citizens ability to participate fully in the mainstream of america we should not hesitate to support educational methods that ensure such participation another issue of great concern to me was the program improvement provision program improvement requires states to perform evaluations of local education agencies to determine improvement or decline in school progress state and local jurisdiction must be clearly defined while locals deserve the freedom to determine their curricula and programs states have certain oversight authority to ensure that schools remain in compliance with basic program requirements the conference agreement carefully balances this relationship states will receive a percentage of program funds to be used at the local level for program improvement furthermore the compromise allows local agencies workable time frames for improvements and provides states with the needed funds to help implement such changes the dual federal and state commitment is clearly formalized in this compromise i commend my colleague mr goodling for his tireless effort in forging this solution in the spirit of compromise the house accepted the senate proposal on magnet schools but not without a fightl the senate proposal establishes a separate program identical to magnet schools yet without desegregation as the main objective i simply do not see the need for establishing a new costly program for alternative schools the current program is effective and commendable in its purpose yet underfunded magnet schools have established quality schools in areas with a high concentration of minority students these schools have excelled in their academic standards and vocational skills they offer a curriculum capable of attracting substantial numbers of students of different racial backgrounds but most noteworthy students are accepted on the basis of talent not wealth although magnet schools are one of the most effective programs in h r 5 in the last year only 48 of the 126 districts which applied for funds received them there simply was not enough money to be distributed there can be no questioning the impact and far reaching effects of this bill its scope reaches all ages from early intervention programs for our very young to dropout

waive the immunity of that individual if such waiver is denied the secretary of state shall declare that individual non grata or insure the removal from the united states we are not talking here about

about probable cause we are talking about serious offenses there are many cases that we all know about where individuals in this country have been harmed by the actions of diplomats from other

due to present unitedstates tax laws the report was compiled by arthur young inc one of the nations largest and most reliable accounting firms in comparing the tax policies of the united states with those of the netherlands japan and germany the disadvantage was quite apparent this competitive disadvantage in world markets is present today due to enacted federal tax policy over the past 20 years including the 1986 tax reform act the primary reason this has occurred is due to the fact that many other countries have adopted tax policies that to varying degrees encourage firms to do business overseas essentially the united states has adopted exactly the opposite policy it is no wonder we are experiencing record trade deficits with a tax policy that is complex vague and discouraging to multinational companies the simple fact is that congress has failed miserably when it comes to encouraging business to engage in the international market instead congress prefers the easier route of protectionism we must aggressively seek to change the tax structure so that it is fair and equitable to do business overseas which will then in turn reduce our trade deficits though his competitive disadvantage has been accumulating over several years of federal tax policy arthur young inc has pointed out three very obvious disadvantages of the unitedstates multinational companies first when exemptions or deferrals foreign tax credits and tax treaties are taken into account the unitedstates multinationals most often are at the highest end of the tax rate scale on foreign operations compared to other countries even though the 1986 tax reform act lowered the nominal corporate tax rate many unitedstates companies will face increased tax liability on foreign source income second the united states has no treaty in which it agrees to spare unitedstates tax on income that could have been but was not taxed by a lesser developed country many other countries have such a tax sparing treaty the main effect of this absent treaty is that it hinders the unitedstates ability to access the low cost labor and raw materials of third world countries in a way that would enable these companies to compete equally in world trade third the third reason that puts the unitedstates multinational companies at a competitive disadvantage is the extent to which the present federal tax treaties modify the two above reasons this study has made me aware of a very serious problem with our international trade tax system in the coming weeks i plan to solicit the views of top

report ed out of the committee on waysand means before the stock market crash we have not risen to the occasion we r 9 161 have not opted to do something beyond the usual in this bill most importantly we are in the midst of an economic summit right nowdiscussion with the president and with the senate in a bipartisan fashion i do not know how successful those discussions will be but i believe it is imperative that they be successful that we show to the world that we can govern wisely and together that is the great imperative therefore it will take the courage and concurrence of the republicans to vote for revenue increases of at least the amount in this bill what i prefer however is that we delay this bill at least for a short time so that we can strive more mightily to reach some type of compact among all these parties rather than proceed unilaterally and i would prefer that we proceed possibly dollar for dollar revenue increase and spending cut or at least with both parts of the package in plan in whatever percentages we might agree to at the same time i am fearful that if we act todayand i support 95 percent of the measures within this billi am fearful that some of the spending reductions we might expect in the continuing resolution will not come about or might be illusory at a time when the market perception of the nation was that we definitely would have at least 23 billion in real and not illusory cuts because of the automatic sequestration provisions in the grammrudman law i also point out that i do not think 23 billion in deficit reduction is nearly enough because the resolution we adopted in august called for in excess of 36 billion and somehow from august to september the congress reduced it from 36 billion to 23 billion and now because of this action which i think could be good action if in concert with spending reductions there is a real possibility that we might not even make the 23 billion there are other difficulties that i have with this bill too as far as the welfare reform provision is concernedand i strongly support welfare reformi am glad that it was taken out because i do not think it was appropriately put in a reconciliation bill but there are some other provisions in the bill that give me great concern especially the provision which would eliminate the deductibility of interest for mergers and acquisitions so much of the rise in the market was due to the possible opportunity for mergers and acquisitions that i am fearful that the project of passage of this provision might have been at least a contributory factor to the market decline i am also cognizant of the fact that the leadership of this institution has now said that they might well abandon that provision in conference and i ask why can we not have a vote on that now why not debate it now why ask us to walk the plank to vote for a provision that is generally perceived to be a bad provision further we must have revenue increases i think far more than we have here 12 billion i think we should have from 36 billion to 50 billion in deficit reduction and perhaps 25 billion or more of that should be in revenue increases i am prepared to vote for that i am prepared to vote for such revenue increases there are countless measures that could be enacted i am prepared to vote for a great many of these but let us do it together and let us do it in a package of revenue increases and spending cuts if we cannot reach an accord with the president with the senate and with the republicans in for example 1 weekand i may be more hopeful than realistic because the republicans did not enter into any negotiations with us during the ways and means committee processi am hoping that the market crash has changed their disposition on thatwe can revisit this issue if need be and i hope it will not be needed 1 week from now if the rule is defeated it will not be the end of the world as a matter of fact when the first rule was defeated beforeand i am not saying there was a causal relationshipthe market went up from about 40 points at noon to about 90 points at close so at the very least the world will not end and the market will not collapse if the rule is defeated i think it would be best if we would attempt to achieve our stated goal 36 billion in deficit reductions or at the very least 23 billion if we give the republicans an opportunity of at least 1 more week to act jointly with us on revenue increases of at least the magnitude of this bill coupled with equal and real expenditure reductions in the same bill i think that would be the right course for us fourth i would suggest that if we democrats and republicans cannot reach agreement on the right mix of spending cuts then we should reluctantly take the grammrudman formula legislate that formula by half cut spending by about 12 billion per the grammrudman formula and couple it with the 12 billion in revenue increases of this bill we will have proven what is imperativethat we can

really towed the mark i did not agree with everything he did in the conference committee but he did a good job in getting out a bill the american people really want to hae confidence in their financial institutions and really and truly i think it comes down to this you can quibble about details in the bill and this is a compromise and not everyone likes the bill in its entirety but the fact is that what we are saying today in my judgment is whether or not we support the s l industry that is the bottom line they need to have the reserves in their insurance fund so that the american people will have a renewed confidence in what is an important industry this is an industry that has as its primary purpose in terms of its creation by congress to serve americans who want to own their own home so if you believe in the industry vote for the bill as a conferee to s 790 the bill to recapitalize the fslic fund i would like to extend my strong support for this muchnceded legislation this conference report presented before the house today has my full support and should be acted upon as quickly as possible no conference agreement is perfect and not all compromises satisfy all concerned parties but what we have here is a good agreement a good compromise and some very necessary consumer assurances that the unitedstates government is backing the insurance fund faithfully and adequately this legislation will restore the confidence of the american people who have billions of dollars in depository accounts within this countrys savings and loans i support and urge the house to come together and demonstrate to the american people with savings and loan deposits that the house is firmly behind the savings and loan industry the sum of money available within the fslic fund is at the critical stage currently it is reported that the fslic fund is more than 6 billion in the red the federal home loan bank board recently stated that the cost of taking over problem thrifts has grown to the incredible amount of 6 million per pay the gao reported to the congress last year that further delaying a resolution to the problem cases within the savings and loans will add substantially to the ultimate final cost of the industry as well as to the economy furthermore the lack of a substantial pool of financial strength at the insurance level disallows the thrift managers depositors and others who wish to inject muchneeded capital into the thrifts any guideline as to a source of stability lack of stability and confidence in this countrys financial industry specifically the savings and loans is a severe detriment to future operations confidence and stability are the cornerstones for this countrys financial strength in this legislation before the house today the conferees agreed to an exit fee of twoplustwo or 2 years premium and 2 years special assessment this level was originally proposed by the house and the senate initially rejected it with their own proposal to raise the fee to sixplussix within the spirit of compromise conferees agreed to retain the house portion of twoplustwo and include a 1year moratorium on institutions leaving the fslic this exit fee is a fair provision that provides for a reasonable approach without imposing a punitive fee to further discourage muchneeded capital in addition a fee of this magnitude will allow the thrifts to adjust to rapidly changing market conditions without an untimely cost imposed upon the operation the lee tailored within this conference report will permit the savings and loans to diversify for their ultimate survival what we have before us is the most sweeping financial industry legislation in 7 years both the house and senate held extensive hearings and will hold further hearings on the proposed legislation this broad comprehensive banking bill before the house today is quite an amazihig compromise the moratorium on all nonbanking activitiesmarch 5 1987 through march 1 1988will allow the congress to conduct valuable re search and hearings in the area of combining commerce with banking also the nonbank bank provision that puts a necessary limit on the amount of nonbank banks within current operations is very important restricting no other entity after marci 5 1987 makes good sense for the consumer and allows regulators to monitor this limited number of financial companies adequately one aspect of this bill which is very close to my heart as well as others ds the expedited funds availability act this significant piece of legislation would provide uniform scheduling practices by banks concerning when checks are to be deposited and cleared this act would prevent arbitrary policies imposed by various financial institutions regarding when the check would be credited let me say for the record that i am proud of this conference ireport and admire the efforts rom both sides of the aisle as well as the other chamber the conferees recognize the urgent need for compromise and recapitalization 1 strongly urge my colleagues to follow suit as a senior member on the banking committee my philosophy has always been better bend than break if members are not willing to accept the current conference report with its compromise then the fslic fund which is in such need of recapitalization could possibly break to reach final agreement conferees made significant compromises with sweeping legislation such as this further compromises are necessary to satisfy all branches i commend our good chairman mr st germain for his sense of compromise and for zmoving this conference session so expeditiously obstacles always appear when you take your eyes off the main objective of course there are always obstacles when legislation of this magnitude comes about but our good chairman always kept the conferees focused within the scope of the ultimate goal recapitalization of the ailing fslic fund as quickly as possible as william wrigley jr the chewing gum magnate

admitted for surgery or blood work between the ages of 15 and 49 such testing would be required in states where at least 0 1 percent of the population is infected with the aids virus proponents of routine testing of hospital patients have advocated such testing on the basis of protecting health care workers yet the major organizations representing health care workers and providersincluding the american medical association the american nurses association anal and the american hospital associationhave argued that the best means of protecting workers is to require that such workers use barrier protections whenever they handle any blood or body fluid current hhs guidelines require that all hospital patients be treated as hiv positive and that appropriate precautions be taken through the use of barriers such as gloves gowns and masks public health experts and hospital administrators feel that if general testing programs were instituted health care workers might stop using precautions around patients who test negative this would be a significant problem because the hiv antibody test sometimes mistakenly identifies certain people who are infected as uninfectedfalse negativesand because the test does not immediately identify hivinfected persons who have not yet developed antibodies to the virus in general hospital inpatients represent a population of low risk for aids since virtually all persons admitted to the hospital have blood drawn this amendment in effect requires routine testing of all persons admitted to hospitals between the ages of 15 and 49 in selected states according to the american hospital association over 20 million persons under age 65 were admitted to unitedstates hospitals obviously offering routine hiv testing to such a large population will be extremely costly even though this amendment will only apply to states where more than 0 1 percent of the population is infected since there are no obvious benefits of routine hospital testing i agree

have allowed la prensa to operl the catholic radio station can operate they are preparing to declare a unilateral ceasefire the question about all of this isk what does itall mean is it a legitimate and sincere beginning to a proeess of democratization or is it yet another tactical ploy by marxistlennists the history of marxistleninist regimes leaves na alternative to serious analysts than to say we view these moves with scepticism with caution with prudencebut also with a tiny bitof hope but hope doesnt make freedom happen rea substantive progress in the real world makes freedom happen we cannot be satisfied with the forms of democratization we must demand the substance and i rr this case the substance of democratization in nicaragu demands that the sandinistas know they still have the democratic resistance to worry about without the democratic resistance the sandinistas would never have come to the bargaining table the democratic resistance and itsability to remain a f orce in this peace process in my judgment is absolutely vital and that is why aid in the cr fs vital not lust for the contrasbut for the last fragile hope of justice freedom and peace in nicaragua consider the following the new nicaraguan constitution written by a sandinistasdominated constituent national assembly specifically mentions the sandinista popular army the armed forces totally under the ideological and political control of theruling sandinistas party how can there be true popular pru ralism in a state in which there is a constitutional provision about an army dominated by one specific political party f am glad to note that the washington post yesterday or the day beforefor the first time that t can recall mentioned that specifically in a na tionally recognized editorial comment of a dominant newspaper ir this coun try and the media have not focused enough attention on that specific subfect can we realistically hope the sandtnistal popular army will lose its ideological character in the brave new world of the agreement is there anyone in this chamber who believs the sandinista party is going to allow the army to be con trolled by another party or to be at the service of the nation regardless of who is elected no other country in central america has an army of this character it is the military arm of the vanguard marxistleninist party it is this ugly little fact that destroys the beautiful theory some might ha e about the sandinis tas good faith the fate of freedom in central america and in nicaragua especially is at a crisis point if we in the

going to change the balance of forces by any stretch of the imagination it is not going to threaten the sandinistas what it will do is to put tba united states of america on record of not abandoning an ally just because cer tai forms of democratization have been temporarily agreed to by a marxistleninist government if we withdraw our hand by refusing these fund it wil be a slap heard round the

where the extended family is still prevalent among the black population as many as 30 people depend upon a single wage packet thats a lot of people who go hungry when one wage earner loses his or her

africa stated the situation in stark terms most of us have nowhere to go disinvestment has destroyed our lives and our future if this makes those people who have called for sanctions happy then theyve got what they want but all we face now is suffering were desparate because we dont know where well live or how well feed our families both mary jane and annmarie stressed the need for jobs in south africa they pointed to the very positive social responsibility programs of american firms in their country the companies work with community leaders in developing and implementing projects that the people want and need they bring jobs and progress to the communities in which they are located when these companies move out of south africa the local firms that take over do not have the re sources to continue the social responsibility programs on the same scale the people hurt are predominantly black problems in the schools are also a major concern to black south african parents the school boycott has ended but the trouble hasnt mary jane said that urban children go to school at 8 am but they are lucky if the comrades do not disrupt classes before 11 because of the dangers and disruption in the schools many parents are forced to send their children to stay with relatives in the country and attend school there which is very hard on families and their pocketbooks do the
