of the budget resolution both the bush and republican budgets suffer from the same infirmities fiscal irresponsibility and selfserving and outoftouch priorities both are wholly inadequate to meet the needs of our nation and will pass along mounting deficits and debts to generations yet unborn first the 5year republican budget will result in a deficit of 376 billion in 2006 44 million over the presidents projection the republicans budget proposal also has many cost omissions because they know that their deficit numbers explode after 5 years as such this budget does not take into account the cost of fixing the amt which will cost at least 642 billion it does not take into account the 774 billion needed to pay for the presidents muchtalked about but yet unveiled social security privatization plan i suppose the republican budget proposal deserves a little credit for hiking its deficit projection as it at least includes 50 million in 2006 for the wars in afghanistan and in iraq the presidents budget proposal contained zero dollars as a matter of fact it reported that the costs could not be known however both figures are fantasy the realistic figure over the next 10 years in addition to the 80 billion that we just passed in the supplemental is likely to be 384 billion to pay for its misguided policies the house budget resolution cuts nondefense discretionary spending by 12 billion below the amount needed in fiscal 2006 just to maintain current spending levels and it cuts spending on mandatory domestic programs by 8 billion to add insult to injury the republican budget provides 18 billion in additional tax cuts these misguided tax cuts will actually cost much more when the tax cuts actually expire in 2010 in fact 97 percent of these tax cuts will benefit taxpayers with incomes above 200 000 i think most reasonable people can agree that these priorities are not americas priorities while little good can be said about the bush administrations budget it at least provides detailed information on the programs it seeks to cut the house resolution shrouds its cuts in darkness leaving the american people to wonder what vital programs will find their way to the ch6ppinig block next both the republican and bush budget proposals are travesties when the bush administration took office the nation was experiencing record surpluses it has managed to turn a 521 billion surplus into a 367 billion deficit in contrast the spratt alternative budget as well as the congressional black caucus alternative budget that we will consider tomorrow focus national spending on priorities that benefit all americans and get us on the road to economic recovery they do this by funding key domestic priorities which address the needs of working families while fully supporting the national defense and protection of our homeland and preserving medicaid social security pension programs and student loans let me speak particularly about the budget developed by the congressional black caucus which corrects the irresponsible fiscal and economic policies contained in the house budget resolution by supporting existing programs that are essential to closing disparities creating opportunities and helping our citizens build their future it will get our country on the road to recovery while funding meaningful national priorities for our children for our seniors for our veterans and for our communities importantly the congressional black caucus budget supports these priorities while also meeting our obligation to our troops in iraq and in afghanistan the cbc budget funds community development programs including restoring funding to the community development block grant program and supporting increased funding for elderly and disabled housing programs the congressional black caucus budget will also restore funding for veterans health care rather than imposing new copayments on them for essential services and prescription drugs importantly the congressional black caucus budget will reduce the budget deficit by 167 billion during the next 5 years below the deficit that will be produced by the house budget resolution theirepublican budget cuts educational housing and health programs for our children while bequeathing to them a public debt that has increased by 1 268 trillion over the last 4 years and that will exceed 4 6 trillion even before we begin fiscal year these actions are not only irresponsible they are unconscionable in the end one can only conclude that the republican budget balances itself on the backs of americans who can least afford it i urge the administration to reconsider its illconceived economic policies the congressional black caucus budget is the ultimate expression of our national priorities and our priorities must be our children our families our elderly and our veterans and of course our soldiers"], [0.0031911134719848633, 0.9968088865280151, 1, "i want to thank mr rangel for yielding me the

are dying their family members are praying for their safe return and the american public is questioning what exactly is our policy over there i just wish the debate were actually open the lark of debate is even more shameful when you consider the fact we have been fighting in iraq longer than we fought in world war i the european theater of world war ii and korea the american people deserve better and you can bet your life the american soldier definitely deserves better than that the american soldier deserves more than ten hours of debate on a policy that affects their lives i want everyone in america to know the leadership of this house of representatives wants to stifle debate and control what you hear from your government every single american citizen should ask themselves this what are they trying to hide what are they afraid of if a policy decision is so sound you would think they would let it be debated until everyone was blue in the face i think the lack of confidence the majority has in the ability of their policies to face challenges and amendments should be eye opening to the american public i am ashamed the majority leader of the house abandoned his earlier talk of a civil debate on policy and instead decided to turn something as serious as a war into a rhetoric filled partisan political tool with the goal to make democrats look sheepish in my opinion war and the deaths of american soldiers is too serious to be used as a political tool dont our soldiers deserve more respect from congress than this additionally anyone who would accuse a member of congress of not supporting our troops has no shame and those individuals should ask themselves whether anything is sacred to them anymore they should ask themselves whether or not there is any depth to which they wont sink in order to score political points i was not a member of congress when the resolution passed giving the president the authority to send our fighting men and women to war however since ive been a member of congress i have continued my lifelong support for our troops i have voted for every spending request and i have been to iraq to visit our soldiers four times

you can bet they will draw conclusions and hold people responsible in the history books and the public opinion of the future however right now we should focus on how we stabilize the country allowing for a new free democratic iraq to rein and how we get our troops home safe as soon as possible while ensuring our futureis more stable and secure i support our troops the congress and the american public support our troops and i think we should reaffirm our support for the troops by giving them every tool they need like additional armor and padding in their helmets to protect themfrom ieds rather than forking over taxpayers dollars hand over fist to halliburton and other defense contractors with little to no accountability that i think would be a stronger sign of support for our troops or the war than any politically motivated resolution brought to the house floor as thul majority has admitted in their interconference memo of talking points of how we must conduct this debate as a portrait of contrasts between republicans and democrats according to majority leader boehners memo i dont know about you but i believe our country and our troops deserve better than these political

funding for research on new nuclear weapons there are plenty of options to choose from last october during the final presidential debate before the november election president bush claimed that the gravest threat americafaces is the threat of nuclear attack unfortunately the president has done very little to address this threat one of the primary nuclear threats america faces is the development of such hostile weapons by countries like iran and north korea that is why we need to engage these nations in aggressive diplomacy not aggressive saber rattling earlier this week north korea indicated that it wishes to hold bilateral talks with the united states presumably to receive financial assistance in exchange for dismantling its nuclear weapons program iran on the other hand feels threatened by recent w~hispers that the bush administration might attempt a military assault on their nuclear weapons facilities we absolutely must negotiate with both countries after using the unitedstates milit ary to take down saddam hussein this president probably thinks that negotiations are beneath him but i have got news for the bush administration negotiations work and foreign assistance works we need to start relying more on nonmilitary security tools to work out our international differences the other major nuclear threat comes not from foreign countries but from terrorist organizations like al qaed a to address this threat we must secure the nuclear stockpiles that are out there before they get into the hands of terrorists most people agree that the best program to secure nuclear materials is the cooperative threat reduction program or ctr which enlists the department of defense to dismantle nuclear warheads reduce nuclear stockpiles and secure nuclear weapons and materials in the states of the former soviet union ctr is crucial in keeping nuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorists terrorists know that it would not be difficult to steal material from poorly guarded nuclear plants in russia that is why it is important to increase our funding for ctr and provide funding to extend the program so that other regions of the world can be included last year the cooperative threat reduction program received only 409 million from the defense budget and the department of defense did not even use all of this money we should triple or quadruple our funds and our efforts for ctr in the fiscal year 2006 budget and we should extend this vital program to other countries where nuclear materials are not safely guarded countries like iran north korea libya and

option is not working yet the president and his administration refuse to consider alternatives to the way we are handling the situation in iraq think about the good that could be accomplished if even a fraction of the billions that have been spent on military operations were instead spent on nonmilitary security we could help secure iraq by rebuilding schools so that their children could learn constructing new water processing plants so that the iraqi people could have clean water to drink and building new roads so that citizens can travel safely from one city to another our assistance

having no provisions for parental consent as it relates to a child securing an abortion some states having a very complicated process with judicial review and some states having a medium process the debate in the committee on the judiciary by members on my side of the aisle really centered and focused on the structure of the legislation that seemingly would close the door shut on a child that would seek counsel beyond the parent in this very troubling time in their life it also sought to clarify whether an innocent bystander who could provide a mode of transportation might in fact be held criminally liable under this particular law so there were a number of amendments being offered that would hopefully clarify this very difficult question this is a time when passions rise high temperatures rise high as well as i said there is a vigorous disagreement about this question of abortion and even more vigorous when it involves a child who is under the age of majority e 1745 so there were a number of amendments offered by my colleagues one offered that in particular the description of the amendment simply offered by the gentleman from new york allowed an adult who could be prosecuted under the bill go to a federal court and seek a waiver to the states parental notice laws if this remedy was not available subsequently there was a house report 10951 and in that report a series of amendments were described in particular to give license to sexual predators may i repeat that again to give license to sexual predators i started out by saying and i do intend to follow that charge that i have made that this is an effort to go forward to be able to highlight a mistake an indiscretion a pathway that hopefully we will not return to and allow us to heal on our own if you will but also to cite that this is not the way to run the peoples house that amendment simply stated that it allowed an adult who could be prosecuted under the bill to go to the federal district court and seek a waiver to the states parental notice laws remember i started out by saying state parental notice laws are varying around the nation it was ultimately written to suggest that that particular gentleman from new york had an amendment that would have created an additional layer of federal court review that could be used by sexual predators to escape conviction under the bill it suggested that that roll call that particular amendment was defeated 11 to 16 subsequently there was another amendment by the gentleman from new york to exempt a grandparent or adult sibling from the criminal and civil provisions in the bill again simply stated as plain as can be and by the way though i am not intending to challenge legislation that has already been passed on the floor of the house albeit i disagree with it vigorously in terms of the restraints it puts on the interaction between a child and confidante a trusted adult who can help steer them in the right direction let me just suggest this was a constructive amendment because it was to give the child an ability to consult with someone that may be out of the pipeline and be out of the childs distress area meaning we have never looked at the point that possibly the parent could be the predator or could be engaged in incest all of these are terrible things to discuss but in a responsible debate these were the considerations why these amendments were authored ultimately that amendment to allow a grandparent or sibling to confide or that child to confide in that particular adult or that particular sibling adult sibling it was described by the gentlemans amendment was described as having exempted sexual predators from prosecution under the bill and suggested that it was defeated in a roll call vote subsequently the gentleman from virginia offered an amendment to protect innocent bystanders who might have someone take their mode of transportation a taxicab a bus or other mode of transportation not knowing who they are carrying and ultimately caught up in the legislation and be prosecuted so this was to exempt innocent bus drivers taxicab drivers and others who would be transporting individuals and again the amendment was described as exempting sexual predators a subsequent amendment that limited liability to the person committing the offense in the first degree was ultimately described and suggested that it would aid and abet criminals then an amendment that i offered the amendment was to exempt clergy godparents aunts uncles or first cousins from the penalties in the bill again to give a young woman a greater latitude of who to seek comfort and counsel from and ultimately that anendment was described ms jacksonlee offered an amendment that would have exempted sexual predators from prosecution under the bill if they were clergy godparents aunts uncles or first cousins of a minor then though i had two separate amendments one a gao study that would have determined whether this particular legislation was necessary and whether or not the confusion of the states with different bases of determining parental consent whether or not that created an added problem the description in house report 10951 just lumped them all together which reads that would require a study by the government accounting office so in essence my amendment was described as exempting clergy godparents aunts uncles or first cousins of a minor and suggesting that i was exempting sexual predators and then adding insult to injury if i might use a phrase that i then wanted a gao study completely wrong complete misconstruing of the amendment and of the intent so we had a vote last week that ultimately wound up correcting the language in some form it did not however distinguish that i had two amendments and did not ask for a study of sexual predators who happened to be godparents clergy aunts uncles or first cousins first of all might i say in the prosecution of this particular entity i do not believe that any prosecutor worth his or her salt would allow this legislation to exempt an individual who happened to be a relative who happened to be a sexual predator there is no basis in the bill and if that was the case then it means that the parents the very underlying crux of the bill parental consent it means that the bill also protects parents that are sexual predators if you follow that line of reasoning so this is an attempt to have us go forward and not backwards the amendments were very clear on their face the amendments stood alone the general accountijig office shall conduct a study detailing the impact of the number of unsafe and illegal abortions performed on minors who would be affected by this law you see i have lived through a time when women went to back alleys and a coat hanger was a medical device so i thought it was appropriate that if we were going to pass a legislative initiative that we thought would help secure young lives then we needed to have a study that would determine whether or not it was in fact securing them or endangering them and the idea of course was to suggest that we needed to find out more about the impactof this legislation this ultimately got construed i do not know how as a gao study of sexual predators this is not a nice word to say oil the floor of the house because as we have seen the rash of attacks on our children two young babies killed just in the last 24 hours little precious danielle having been determined and identified decapitated a couple of years ago as cochair of the congressional childrens caucus we were briefed by alonzo washington on that tragic case the cases in florida the cases in texas no one wants to promote the extending of any criminal exemptions for the likes of those who prey on our children nowhere in this gao study would that say that and might i say that the war against sexual predators and child predators and child sexual predators is a bipartisan war it is not a frivolous desire of any of us to stand up against those heinous actors that will go against our children i would not in the least be hesitant to stand alongside of any member in this body and know full well of their undying commitment to weed out ferret out prosecute and incarcerate those individuals with the most evil intent to do harm to our children that is why a number of members took to the floor of the house to express such outrage not because we do not accept the fact that there could be mistakes there are politics in this house games that are played at all times there is vigorous debate on the question of choice parental consent but it was the very fact that something so sacred our children could fall victim to such a divide as we went to the committee on rules we would hope it would have been cleared up through that matter let me also just cite tle other jacksonlee amendment that was plain and simple the prohibitions of this section do not apply with respect to conduct by clergy godparents aunts unclesor first cousins simply to say that they could stand in place for example if there was some achilles heel some failure in the parental structure that this child needed to go outside of the family home a simple process no more no lessso we had hoped that there would have been some solution to this in the committee on rules as i indicated this report was filed thursday april 21 and the accompanying report was 10951 the point that should be part of the rules of this house that i hope that we will as we go forward make really part of our institutional fabric is that house reports from now on or from last thursday on should describe recorded votes with objective nonargumentative captions the committee on the judiciary majority cannot do that in house report 10951 by captioning the five amendments that i mentioned with remarks that would suggest that we are harboring that we are kowtowing playing to sexual predators the opportunity that was given to address this question in the committee on rules was troubling because questions were posed as to why such language was utilized might i say as an aside you realize that the house reports and my colleagues realize the house reports are used in history they are used by historians and political scientists students researchers of all kinds policymakers they are used to tell the story of america that is why we rise to the floor of the house and raise our voices and consent and dissent that is why we pay tribute to americans on this floor that is why each morning we say the pledge of allegiance and the chaplain or one who has been so designated offers a word of prayer it is for all of america to reflect and read it is a document that leaves a legacy that 2 days from now or 5 weeks or 1 year or 10 years from now cannot be changed so to ask the question why or to suggest to my colleagues that i only stand here today to remind you that if we can find any sense of unity in this very fractured nation and divided house and senate i would simply ask that it be adhering to the rules of this body and the simple reporting of the work we do here every day the reason why again i would cite this as an important request and one that i hope the correction of last week will not be simply the correction of that time but it will be embedded that we try and work not to do it again is because when we get on this floor and there are words that are not befitting or becoming of the debate albeit the member did not intend any wrongdoing or missteps but because someone else found those words to be inappropriate we have a procedure called to take the words down why do we do that we do that to pro tect the integrity of this record and i think that is the right thing to do in the furor of debate sometimes we step beyond the pale we are committed we are passionate we believe in what we are standing for and we are americans we stand in debate with our eyes on the flag of the united states and the words in god we trust this nations underpinnings allow us to do so but when sometimes in the heat of debate words flare we are allowed and some will ask that the words be taken down and in the course of the debate and the vote occurs there is a procedure to address that issue that means that we care about the integrity of this process and the written word that will then be there for thousands and thousands and millions and millions and years and years to be reviewed we are owed that kind of respect so this statement today should not be considered an effort to recount or repeat it is hopefully an effort in a moment of evenhandedness to suggest that this kind of mischaracterization not take place anymore in the committees of the house the final reporting and or the committee on rules and that we strictly stick to the conciseness and integrity of the process which is a nonargumentative objective reporting of the work of an individual member and certainly words such as predator and sexual predator and child predator to be thrown in the direction of members who leave their homes and their jurisdictions every day in the backdrop of some heinous criminal act maybe affecting their own constituents maybe some child law because as i was driving on the freeway yesterday in texas because of the amber alert that all of the members of this house were willing to support there unfortunately was a highlight of another kidnapped child from new mexico possibly on the run into texas not knowing whether there was an issue of sexual predator or child predator it was a kidnapped child a child that was vulnerable so it is not something that i personally take lightly and i would just suggest that the gentleman from new york and the gentleman from virginia who raised their voices i would think that their integrity also is wellknown and that to associate their work with that definition is one that is enormously frightening this clarification is used as well when you can find that the entity or the act or the actions have subjected you to public ridicule well a story is a story and this was written about so that will not be able to be taken down there will be articles that would suggest that amendments by the named persons exempted sexual predators we cannot go back to that we cannot pull that down that is in the annals of news that will be able to be researched so frankly i thought it was enormously important that this misdeed be called again to the attention of my colleagues why because i hope going forward we will not do it again allow me to quote from the ranking member of the committee on rules who said that it was not indicated how this was brought to our attention the committee on rules discovered yesterday that the committee on the judiciary report on this very bill which was authored by the majority staff contained amendment summaries which had been rewritten by committee staff for the sole purpose of distorting the original intent of the authors so in essence no one contacted our offices to be able to determine whether or not we actually intended that exemption meaning as the report was being written if it had not been for the staff of the committee on rules we would not have had the opportunity to clear the air i do want to pay tribute to the committee on rules in this instance republicans and democrats who listened to our protest if you will and frankly i had hoped and thought that that matter could be resolved there in the committee on rules the response of the majority of the coinmittee on rules is to stand by it or they stood by those amendments as they were described it appeared as stated by the ranking member that the representations being made in the committee on rules is that one the majority stood by it and two that the alterations to our amendments were deliberate when asked again why such an outoftheordinary approach was taken the majority responded and suggested that it was the tone of the debate that caused such to be done because we oppose the legislation the gotyou game was being played that is why i rise today because i would like to have today may 10 2005 really be the last last day that we would entertain such actions no matter how vigorous the debate in opposition how be it that we would step away from the integrity of this house the respect for the three branches of government and do as was done the exact quote as i understand and i repeat it here the majority offered to say you dont like what we wrote about your amendments and we dont like what you said about the bill that can take us all over the map that is why we are in this place that is why a president of the united states can stand with the georgian people and talk about democracy andhold his head up high because we are allowed to stand on the floor and vigorously disagree in a manner where we will not be punished so i would ask as we go forward that this kind of tone this kind of approach not be utilized i do not know what you would call it but i certainly know that it has no place here so the resolution that was offered and debated on asked for a number of actions i think now i should applaud one of the actions in the emergency supplemental in the rules that were passed last week the opportunity was taken to clarify the amendments i am not sure whether or not any formal apology was made but i imagine that when the record is corrected we have received a response that addresses the historical record of this body so it serves no purpose to ask for an apology today i do think we were a little bit off our mark and i would hope that having not asked for an apology and having not received it and seeking only the straightforward clarification that will be the approach that we will take one that we will be allowed to debate in this body whether it be in committee or on the floor and vigorously disagree and that in that disagreement there will be no punishment the only factor that we should have as the test of whether we are right or wrong or whether or not we prevail is that vote and in many instances the majority now in control of the house the senate the supreme court the executive by one party prevails in the instance of the committee on the judiciary in this occasion on these amendments the majority prevailed the minority however felt passion about the amendments and in fact believes that they were right and i personally believe that two amendments one to do a study of the negative impact of this legislation if it might occur or what dangerous procedures might occur of this legislation where would a child seek to go because they were fearful of getting parental consent that was a sincere amendment to get important facts and giving a child the opportunity to talk to godparents or aunts and uncles or cousins clergy or grandparents was not sinister it was simply to protect lives so i would hope that that would be where we would divide on our beliefs our reasons for the legislation not on how we talked about a bill for there have been many legislative initiatives that have had vigorous talk and members have agreed and disagreed about the vigorous talk but the only criteria for prevailing or not prevailing is that vote not a characterization by someone else that you are the leader of exempting sexual predators saying it over and over again of course may cause some to cringe and it is not my intent but i think clarification is very important and in the course of the battle of that particular legislation you can be assured as it was being debated if the glimpses of the words that were gotten were only that it was something to do with sexual predators that just muddies the water of the good intentions that you might be having and the intent of what you wrote in that amendment it would almost be like those who are abhorring drug cartels and drug dealers that if they were to have an amendment dealing with a gao study determining the extent of drug cartels influence in the united states or the growth of drug cartels between 1990 and 2005 and all of a sudden it was characterized as an amendment for the gao to promote drug dealership and drug cartels you would not want to hear that on the floor but it certainly would be the complete opposite of your intent and it would have mischaracterized the debate where you were standing and trying to determine whether some legislation promoted drug cartels more so than broke them up the constitution allows us the opportunity for three branches of government and i think that this country is unique because of it very unique in its uniqueness we have checks and balances the checks and balances do not purge into the inner workings of each body so we are the holder of our own records and it leaves little room sometimes in another body to go and complain about the workings of one specific body particularly the words that are spoken and so there are no other grounds or no other opportunities to clear the air other than to seek this personal privilege i hope that in the course of this discussion it was not rendered in anger or anguish it was simply rendered to say that what occurred deserved the greater attention of this body and that it was on the brink of abuse and the sadness is that we had to rise to the floor more than once before it was ultimately corrected in the waning hours of last weeks legislative session does that speak well of us it does not the rules committee is a place where we ferret out rules our respective committees is a place where we vigorously oversee legislation and provide our input and insight and our thought processes to do what is right i would venture to say there has not been one committee hearing and markup where some member promoted the criminal elements that would do harm to america and if any thought came to the mind of a colleague that that was the intent of that member i would assure you that the best approach of that particular colleague would be to query that member in that committee room none of us were queried about the question of the intent of our amendments whether or not they had to do with predators child sexual predators sexual predators no one was queried and therefore the interpretation that was attributed to us was purposeful and here on this floor the same courtesy should be extended and if you are misunderstood if you misspeak from the integrity again of this record that would be for all to see someone should query you and give you the opportunity to correct your words or in the alternative when the height ofthe debate is so furious there is a challenge by someone at some point that the words be called out there are a lot of papers here because i am looking at this debate that went on and so i will not add to some of the accusations that were made in the debate going back and forth i am simply going to conclude by asking again that it not ever be done again and asking that we respect the individual rights of members to defend and represent their constituents and to offer vigorous debate both consent and dissent and as well the rightto vigorously disagree on a legislative initiative if we can hold to those tenets and the idea of the constitution which i hold very dear which i will read briefly into the record the sacred rights of mankind a statement by alexander hamilton 1775 are not to be rummaged for among old parchments or musty records they are written as with a sunbeam on the whole volume of human nature by the hand of the divinity itself and can never be erased or obscured by mortal power of course this is high language to talk about the rights bestowed upon mankind humankind that they are not found in paper and this quote is correct but one thing is right as well is that although all is not said and done on the written word it certainly is a parallel to our rights because we look to a written document for our rights we look to the written word we look to the madison papers to determine our rights and therefore the written word is extremely important we have had our say on this and i hope that it has been a deliberate statement we will do work in the judiciary committee in the coming days and weeks and months we will have many opportunities to vigorously disagree i might say we have had many opportunities to agree and i expect that we will find common ground throughout the days and weeks and months democrats and republicans around issues of importance to the nation but when we use this document to exercise our job and to debate vigorously and disagree we should not be cited for what we have said about a bilr or punished because we have said something about a bill that others would not agree with our final act will hopefully be one that is respectful of this house and of this place to the judiciary committee members as we gather on a daily basis weekly basis i believe they will all agree that we have the right to disagree and to debate vigorously in the committee in the rules committee and on this floor again i close by saying i hope never again never again i rise to raise a point of personal privilege under rule ix clause 1 of the house rules this point as did the point raised by my colleague on the judiciary committee from new york mr nadler relates to the malreporting by the republican leadership of the committee on the judiciary with respect to h r 748 the child interstate abortion notification act of 2005 while i appreciate the efforts of the chairman of the judiciary committee for having filed a supplemental report part 2 of house report 10951 i must raise this point of personal privilege nonetheless in drder to emphasize the fact that the accuracy and the veracity of house committee reports carries tremendous weight and implications for the reputation professional record and personal life of members of congress again while the supplemental report to 10951 makes some corrections to the mistakes made in part 1 the report still contains an inaccurate representation of the amendments that i representative sheila jackson lee offered in committee on april 13 2005 in room 2141 of rayburn i offered two amendments en bloc that read as such amendment no 1 designated as dl005 page 3 after line 2 insert the following 3 the prohibitions of this section

"i was an early and fervent supporter of providing health benefits to families on welfare as they made the difficult transition to work often to entrylevel jobs not providing basic care for their children so i appreciate the need for this bill for welfare recipients and for premium subsidies for our elderly and disabled citizens on very low incomes but i do strongly object to the way these benefits are paid for in this bill i regret that offsets i suggested were not adopted instead of this flat ban on ed drugs getting congress involved in medical treatment decisions by limiting the availability of any category of prescription drugs sets a terrible precedent congress has repeatedly recognized that we should not be in the business of developing or defining formularies congress tasked the united states pharmacopoeia with developing the categories and classes of drugs to be covered by the new prescription drdg plans and we specifically tasked the p t committees in every medicare drug plan offered to our seniors and disabled citizens with the responsibility of assuring that the formularies were medically correct and not politi cally correct furthermore medicare and medicaid prescription drug plans have a number of tools at their disposal to ensure that ed drugs are not abused and could be covered only when prescribed for medically appropriate care further since they are not sold over the counter and must be prescribed by a physician control is not difficult medicare covers many benefits in some situations and not others and ed drugs would only be another such benefit as for sex offenders crosschecking with publicly available lists of these offenders is not difficult and could prohibit ed drugs from going to sex offenders at taxpayers expense while preserving access to these drugs when medically necessary for all disabled and senior men who are not sex offenders ed drugs are covered for federal employees and members of congress they are covered by the va and they are very useful in treating posttraumatic stress disorder why would we treat our seniors and people with disabilities worse than we treat all federal employees and veterans if my colleagues oppose full access surely medicare and medicaid beneficiaries should at least have access to all medically necessary medications medicare covers breast reconstructive surgery after a mastectomy or accidental injury medicare understands the importance of postsurgical psychological adjustment as women rehabilitate after a damaging cancer treatment or devastating injury are men not entitled to such wholeness after prostate cancer treatment ed drugs help men who have lost sexual function as a result of medical conditions like prostate cancer diabetes multiple sclerosis parkinsons or spinal cord injuries men need these medications not to enhance their lifestyle but to return them to normal just like women need reconstructive surgery to return as close as possible to normal in fact wholeness is so important that according to a university of chicago study 68 percent of men were willing to forego treatments that were more effective in eradicating prostate cancer in order to maintain sexual function why would we force men to choose between the most effective medical treatment and wholeness i could not agree more that we should ban ed drugs for sex offenders but a flat ban on ed drugs for all seniors lowincome americans people with disabilities who have edrelated diseases or conditions is just plain discriminatory and wrong so while i respect the concerns of those who support a total ban on ed drugs i hate to see congress go down this path of political correctness we must offer our seniors our poor and our people with disabilities medically correct health care plans the real answer to controlling the cost of medicare and medicaid is not micromanaging the programs but driving forward the adoption of technology that will enable us to manage chronic illnesses proactively reducing both the cost and suffering of hospitalizati6ns and emergency department visits for our seniors and those disabled amongst us that much said and with the hope that we will allow doctors to determine treatment protocols i acknowledge our public responsibility to extend access to medicaid benefits for welfaredependent families and for premium subsidies for our very lowestincome

yield myself 10 minutes i know this seems a strange thing to say on a bill as small as the bill to fund the congressional budget but i honestly believe because of the attachment of the proposal for the continuity of congress that this bill is by far the worst bill to come to the floor in this session of congress i believe that that continuity of representation provision attached to this bill is an assault on constitutional government i believe it is an assault on checks and balances it is an assault on the rule of law it is an invitation to oneman rule and dictatorship i think it is profoundly misguided profoundly misgotten and i think a profound disservice is done in not having months and months of hearings with constitutional scholarsbefore such a drastic proposal is brought before the house i think there is a very good reason that the senate has not taken it up it is because it is a turkey of a proposal it could leave us literally with 75 and 80 percent of the

million project to have a modest expansion of the capitol to give tourists an opportunity to come in and see a movie about what the congress was all about before they visited thb capitol but the security assault on this capitol and 9 11 has in my view been used as an excuse to expand this operation we have also had other efforts from the library of congress and other institutions to further expand this proposition and so as a result today this project is a 500 millionplus project it is more than a year behind schedule and i think it is wasting taxpayers money and wasting an opportunity that we had to provide muchneeded usable space for the congress at the same time what is happening out on the east front is that over 2 acres of underground spaqe is being added to the capitol some of that is being added for purposes of a visitors center and some of the other space is being added for the purpose of expanding space under control of the senate and the house to do their work we all know that this congress needs more working space in my view the number one need of the congress for working space is the need for additional rooms for conference committees between the senate and the house because most of our hearings especially on the committee on appropriations when i came here they were held behind closed doors the press was not in the public was not in so there was plenty of room for a few people to get behind closed doors and work out deals and that is not the way government is supposed to work today today when we have a conference committee the press has a right to be there we need our staffs there and the public has the right to be there too we have no real room in the capitol for that kind of facility this is an opportunity to create that kind of room instead what has happened instead the only appreciable room of any quality in the new house space is what is called the house hearing room but in plain language that room is really a media center that is going to be where the press focuses whenever there is a hearing in that room because it will have all of the creature comforts for the press that room will have ample room for one hearing one presentation and whoever runs the congress will be able to decide what subject it is that gets that attention if you are trying to hold another public hearing on another subject in the capitol you are going to be stuck in tiny rooms that are worthless in terms of public access when i visited the visitors center i asked the architect why with these vaulted ceilings that you have set aside for this hearing room why could you not simply reduce the height of those rooms and at least provide two rooms of approximately the same size so that we had enough overflow room for the committees to do our work and to have conference committees i have yet to get an answer from the architects office that is my problem my problem is that with all of this space being created much of it is not usable for the purpose that we need it used for then we come to the other portion of the addon which is the portion devoted to the visitors center originally that visitors center was supposed to have two media theaters so that the public could come in see a short film about the congress and then be on its way here is the problem we have those two small orientation theaters but in addition to that we have this huge congressional auditorium which is going to seat 450plus people i asked the architect and this is a vaulted theater i asked why do we need another theater in the capitol what i was told by the architect is well you can bring in large constituency groups i would like to know how many members of the house have ever brought 500 people into the capitol i do not think there are going to be many people would raise their hands the second thing the architect told me is that well we need a place for where the house of representatives can meet when the house chamber is being remodeled e 1615 that i found a might strange because we have just redecorated the committee on ways and means room in the longworth building that room was originally created to serve as an alternative meeting place for the house of representatives when we had to repair this chamber so we have already got a spare room in addition we have another spare room i cannot talk about because it i classified but it is being built off campus somewhere so in essence we will have three spare rooms i do not know how much the offcampus room is costing the taxpayers or how much the committee on ways and means room cost the taxpayers but this room is going to cost a bundle i keep asking what is the real purpose for this room you finally go back 10 years and look at the original plans what do we find out we find out that this was originally included in the plans at the request of the library of congress because they wanted another theater to show movies and give presentations that might be nice for them to have but this project is already 400 percent over original cost i do not think it makes any sense i think this is the last chance that we are going to have to reconfigure this center so we have some additional working space instead of the taj mahal show space we are going to have another thing i do not like we have been told we are likely to have three congressional seals in the new visitors center those seals i have been told will cost up to a million bucks does any member really want to take the political heat when taxpayers find out that somebody is talking about spending 1 million on three congressional seals do members remember the cain that was raised when marble floors were put in four of our elevators in the capitol does anybody have any memory i would like to think so but i guess not i consider myself to be an institutional man i usually support this piece of legislation but out of frustration i am not going to support it today because i think this capitol visitors center when it is finally built is going to draw fliesin terms of bad stories about waste of taxpayer money misuse of space and we are going to wind up not having enough room for the principal function of government if this is indeed supposed to be a working capitol then we ought to be able to do better than this floor plan i really believe this package has been brought to us by staff who do not really understand how committees work and do not really understand the principal needs of this institution this is the last time we are going to have a chance to repair this package and make it more usable for the 100 years at least that it will be used i urge members to vote against this bill so we can start over i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.0016029775142669678,

saying we need as an institution to step up to the plate and deal with the issue of lobbying and ethics reform and that is exactly what we have done again we have worked with democrats and republicans outside organizations and as i have listened to the debate and the statements made from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle it is very obvious to me that they have failed to read this legislation in virtually every single area that my friend from rochester just addressed this is addressed in the legislation and if it is not actually addressed in the legislation itself we have made commitments that we are going to as we move this process forward get into a conference with the senate and address some of these issues of concern critics seem to be absolutely intent on telling us what this bill is not everything that was said by my friend from rochester was in the negative just imagine if we went through every single day lamenting what is not today is not christmas that is terrible today is not thanksgiving and that is terrible today is not my birthday and that is terrible but what does it get us it does not got us a thing searching for storm clouds on a clear day is a recipe for inaction and defeatism speaker hastert and i and the leadership team here and the republicans and i am happy to say some democrats have indicated to me that they are interested in not defeatism they are interested in pursuing vigorous reform as i listened to the litany of what this bill is not i think it is very important again as i have read some of these editorials which mischaracterize the legislation as i listened to the rhetoric that mischaracterized this legislation let us again look at the bill and just four simple things of what this bill is this bill actually doubles the fines doubles the fines for lobbyists who fail to disclose this bill adds the possibility of jail time for failing to comply with the act this bill adds oversight to make sure disclosure information is accurate it gives the public full online access to disclosure reports it withdraws the governmentfunded pension for people who commit the crimes that we have outlined in the legislation so anyone who tries to say that they are supporting a recommittal motion are going to vote against this legislation because it does not do enough is in fact standing in the way of reform many people said we should get this thing out the speaker and i said we wanted this to pass by early march obviously we needed more and more input from members from outside organizations from academics from our constituents who are concerned about this issue and we extended beyond that early march date here we are now in early may having listened to so many different people and we have come up with a bill that i believe is strong i believe it is bold i hope we will be able to do more but this is legislation that allows us to move forward in a positive way"], [0.0019321441650390625, 0.49806785583496094,

committee on the judiciary i am proud to support this comprehensive package negotiated between the house and senate to reauthorize vital programs within the department of justice and to combat domestic and dating violence sexual assault and stalking i am grateful to the committees on financial services energy and customers and education and the workforce as well as all of the members of the committee on the judiciary for working with us to make it possible to bring this legislation up today i would also like to thank the original bipartisan cosponsors of this bill judiciary committee ranking member conyers representatives green of wisconsin solis brownwaite schiff coble lofgren and weiner for all of their efforts authorization is an important oversight tool that allows congress and committees of jurisdiction to create amend extend and set priorities for programs within executive agencies despite the laws requirement for regular congressional authorization for the justice department until just recently doj has not been formerly authorized by congress since 1980 the committee on the judiciary took action to rectify the situation in the 107th congress and reauthorized the programs within the deprtment of justice we tried again last congress however the other body did not take up our bipartisan housepassed bill i am proud to be here today to provide congress with legislation to again give direction to the department of justice and the important programs it administers dojs grant programs are an important tool in the fight against crime in america programs such as byrne cops and stop provide grants to state and local governments to focus on current crime issues affecting our communities because there are limited resources continuous congressional oversight of these programs ensures that the taxpayers money is spent appropriately this bill will ensure accountability from the department with a number of provisions designed to ensure grant recipients are meeting the conditions established by congress for the programs the bill includes an office of audit assessment and management to monitor grants and a community capacity development office to assist grant applicants and grantees in meeting grant conditions in addition to the numerous oversight tools provided in the bill there are a number of important reforms to grant programs and provisions designed to improve those programs and offices within the department the bill consolidates the local law enforcement block grant program and the byrne grant program into one program with the same purposes to eliminate duplication and improve the administration of the grants the bill preserves the cops program but addresses concerns expressed by many members about the previous use of these grants h r 3402 also allows grantees greater flexibility in the use of these funds the authorization also reauthorizes doj programs that will expire or have expired such as the juvenile accountability block grant program and the sex offender management program it also includes some very important modifications to the criminal code such as extending the statute of limitations for human trafficking offenses and applying increased criminal penalties to prison guards who sexually abuse persons in their custody titles i through ix of this bill focus on reauthorizing expanding and improving programs that wefe established in the violence against women act of 1994 and reauthorized in 2000 the bill reauthorizes some important core programs such as stop grants and grants to reduce campus violence these programs have been successful in combatting domestic violence and changing attitudes toward violence in the family in america the reauthorization of vawa in 2005 will continue to change attitudes toward domestic violence and will expand its focus to change attitudes toward other violent crimes including dating violence sexual assault and stalking because these are crimes that affect both genders it is important to note that the text of the legislation specifies that programs addressing these problems can serve both female and male victims additionally this legislation specifies that the same rules apply to these funds that apply to other federal grant programs it is illegal to use grant funds devoted to these programs for political activities or lobbying it is the intent of congress that these funds be used to provided services to victims and trained personnel who deal with these violent crimes the department of justice is expected to enforce that provision for all its grants and monitor grant activities to ensure compliance not only with this condition but all conditions of the grants the legislation will aid congress in continuing to fulfill our obligation to the

union and 41 other organizations dear representative we are writing to strongly encourage you to reject the compromise military commissions act of 2006 and to vote no on final passage of the bill more than anything else the bill compromises americas commitment to fairness and the rule of law for the last five years the united states has repeatedly operated in a manner that betrays our nations commitment to law the unitedstates has held prisoners in secret prisons without any due process or even access to the red cross and has placed other prisoners in guantanamo bay in a transparent effort to avoid judicial oversight and the application of unitedstates treaty obligations the federal government has operated under legal theories which dozens of former senior officers have warned endanger unitedstates personnel in the field and has produced legal interpretations of the meaning of torture and cruel inhuman and degrading treatment which had to be abandoned when revealed to the public interrogation practices were approved by the department of defense which former bush administration appointee and general counsel of the navy alberto mora described as clearly abusive and clearly contrary to everything we were ever taught about american values according to media reports the cia has used a variety of interrogation techniques which the united states has previously prosecuted as war crimes and routinely denounces as torture when they are used by other governments instead of finally coming to grips with this situation and creating a framework for detaining interrogating and prosecuting alleged terrorists which comports with the best traditions of american justice the proposed legislation will mostly perpetuate the current problems worse it would seek to eliminate any accountability for violations of the law in the past and prevent future judicial oversight while we appreciate the efforts various members of congress have made to address these problems the compromise falls far short of an acceptable outcome the serious problems with this legislation are many and this letter will not attempt to catalogue them all indeed because the legislation has only just been made available many of the serious flaws in this long complex bill are only now coming to light for instance the bill contains a new very expansive definition of enemy combatant this definition violates traditional understandings of the laws of war and runs directly counter to president bushs pledge to develop a common understanding of such issues with unitedstates allies because the proposed definition of combatant is so broad the language may also have potential consequences for unitedstates civilians for instance it may mean that adversaries of the united states will use the definition to define civilian employees and contractors providing support to unitedstates combat forces such as providing food to be combatants and therefore legitimate subjects for attack yet there has beenno opportunity to consider and debate the implications of this definition or other parts of the bill such as the definitions of rape and sexual abuse we strongly oppose the provisions in the bill that strip individuals who are detained by the united states of the ability to challenge the factual and legal basis of their detention habeas corpus is necessary to avoid wrongful deprivations of liberty and to ensure that executive detentions are not grounded in torture or other abuse we are deeply concerned that many provisions in the bill will cast serious doubt on the fairness of the military commission proceedings and undermine the credibility of the convictions as a result for instance we are deeply concerned about the provisions that permit the use of evidence obtained through coercion provisions in the bill which purport to permit a defendant to see all of the evidence against him also appear to contain serious flaws we believe that any good faith interpretation of the definitions of cruel inhuman and degrading treatment in the bill would prohibit abusive interrogation techniques such as waterboarding hypothermia prolonged sleep deprivation stress positions as saults threats and other similar techniques because they clearly cause serious mental and physical suffering however given the history of the last few years we also believe that the congress must take additional steps to remove any chance that the provisions of the bill could be exploited to justify using these and similar techniques in the future again this letter is not an attempt to catalogue all of the flaws in the legislation there is no reason why this legislation needs to be rushed to passage in particular there is no substantive reason why this legislation should be packaged together with legislation unrelated to military commissions or interrogation in an effort to rush the bill through the congress trials of the alleged high value detainees are reportedly years away from beginning we urge the congress to take more time to consider the implications of this legislation for the safety of american personnel for unitedstates efforts to build strong

their demos yet there is so much that music offers and we shduld be able to support music for its own sake but as my friend the gentleman from new york has already said music helps so many other endeavors in school as well math science it helps kids of all types as well it helps our highachieving kids and it helps our lowachieving kids so this is a truly valuable part of our school curriculum it should b p ffered in all our schools so all of our children have the chance to learn the joys of music i think as many of you all realize some of the most important intimate moments of our lives are usually associated with a song a song that we carry in our hearts throughout our days and a song that was written somewhere sometime by a remarkably talented individual who found that song in his or her heart so music is important to our lives it is important that we cultivate a love for music from the age of our youngest children so that they can grow up and develop their full godgiven potential whether it be music or whether it be math or science or reading or art or any of the other great disciplines that they are learning in our school systems e 1445 so i would encourage members

have seen it it is a story of a fabulous schoolteacher a music teacher and a school system who knows where who taught so well for decades who taught band introducing kids to the pleasure of marching music as well as an introduction to other forms of music and yet in the case of mr holland he was terminated by the local school board for lack of funds it is important that our children have a broad balanced education that it include music and there is no better time than the month of march for that love of music to demonstrate so i appreciate my colleagues in the house i appreciate the committee
