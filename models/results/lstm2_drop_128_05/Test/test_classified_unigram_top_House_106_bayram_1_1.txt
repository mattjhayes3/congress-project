interests of rural america i must rise in opposition to the amendment offered by the gentleman from iowa and urge my colleagues to instead support the obey substitute that will be offered today after the next amendment to this bill let me thank the gentleman from iowa for doing the best that he could inside his own caucus he is a member of our subcommittee and i know how deeply he feels these issues but truly i would say to his leadership this is not the way for america to deal with the crisis affecting unitedstates citizens our farmersfrom coast to coast west to east north to south why should we even consider an amendment here today which deals with such a teensyweensy portion of a massive problem as part of an emergency supplemental dealing with kosovo we considered this bill dealing with rural america in the house several weeks ago nearly 2 months ago and then something happened over in the other body and the leadership of both institutions were not able to get themselves together and i would have to say to my dear friend fromflorida this is not his fault either he has my sympathy because i understand a little bit about florida and that 175 runs between ohio and florida so a lot of our people go down there during the winter and come back and the gentleman has tried to do the best that he can under constraints that are being applied by the leadership of this house and the leadership of the other body it kind of reminds me of that old song by peggy lee when i look at this amendment is that all there is and when we look at the actual content of the amendment offered by the gentleman from iowa he has been cut back by his own leadership to only include a small portion of agricultural credit that is desperately needed by our farmers toget through this spring plonting season however even the administrations abysmal request to this congress included funding for the staff to administer that that is not in the amendment offered by the gentleman from iowa mr lathamx ag credit money that will unleash dollars in the private sector will not help farmers in this crisis because we need people to deliver the assistance and we know that because of the depth of this crisis in our country the disaster payments from last year have not even been fully processed and what has our secretary of agriculture been doing he has been robbing one account over there to pay for another account just to try to k eep staff people in place in these farm service agencies around the country and last week all authority ran out so the robpetertopaypaul mechanism that has been used because we have not been able to clear a bill because of the backwardness of the leadership of this institution now places the burden on the gentleman from iowa a respected member of our subcommittee who is trying to do the best he can but i would like to ask where is the leadership of this house and where is the leadership of the other body to give the farmers of this country that we owe such a debt of gratitude to for keeping this nation fed food security fundamental to any body politics peace why can they not get their day in the sun why do we get backdoored at the end in the last file in the cabinet in a bill dealing with kosovo and we cannot even deal with the enormity of this problem what kind of signal does the gentlemans amendment also give to farmers because in that particular amendment we basically have to offset the 109 million that he is talking about and why is the crisis in rural america any less of a crisis than what we are facing in kosovo in a foreign land or hurricane mitch what about the people of this country i do not think i am xenophobic i care very much about this country the people of this country elected me to be here andi think they should be at the front of the line not at the back of the file cabinet so i view what is happening in rural america a true emergency we are now into day 69 of this congress and we cannot even get a debate in here about the dimensions of people who are going bankruptfrom coast to coast so with all due respect to the gentleman from iowa i think he has done the best job he can do with this amendment but if people in this body really want to help rural america we ought to vote no on the amendment offered by the gentleman from iowa and yes on the obey substitute and truly ask the leadership of this institution to bring up a freestanding bill that is an emergency for the people of this country who are trying to feed us and the world and are being ignored at the highest levels of this legislative body i just say that in the obey substitute that will be offered we not only deal with agricultural credit the full amount asked for by the administration we ask for sufficient funds for people to administer that credit at our farm service agencies we also deal with the three major credit programs in his amendment we talk about emergency assistance for farm workers we have special aid to those who produce hogs around this country who literally are on their knees also our emergency conservation programs are attended to livestock assistance for those affected by disasters our watershed and flood prevention programs our rural water and sewer grants rural housing and even food aid for kosovo refugees 175 million in mr obeys substitute with the surpluses we have on our backs here and with hungry people there what a winwin for everyone why can we not get a freestanding vote on the needs of rural america in this chamber so i know the gentleman

destructive effects of cutting off important exchanges between american scientists and their counterparts from other countries the legislation in question offered by senator shelby would impose a moratorium on visiting scientists from socalled sensitive countries in american nuclear labs the senators proposal comes on the heels of recent reports of compromises to our national security with regard to the peoples republic of china while i agree that chinese espionage activities should cause us to be more vigilant with regard to that country i am concerned that this proposed legislation casts a wide net and would give too much discretion to officials at the department of energy the result could be a cutting off of positive scientific exchanges that do not affect our national security depriving all of us of valuable knowledge and disrupting the types of scientific contacts that actually promote security and cooperation one country that could be affected by this legislation is india while the senate legislation does not mention any countries by name a recent report in the newspaper india abroad quotes an energy department official that the list of seven sensitive countries includes in addition to china and russia india and pakistan the official indicated that different criteria were used for putting countries on the list and that india and pakistan were included because they are not signatories to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty i too am deeply concerned about the persistent pattern of chinas theft of our nuclear secrets i have come to this floor on several occasions to call for more safeguards against chinese espionage as well as to focus more attention on chinas documented actions with regard to nuclear proliferation which include providing nuclear and missile technology to unstable countries like pakistan but in the case of india we clearly do not have the facts to support the conclusion that india is involved in the same types of activities as china thus i would urge members of the senate and the house as well as the administration not to jump to any conclusions about india without the facts what we know is that unitedstates india relations have suffered in the past year because of the nuclear tests conducted by india last may but one key fact that is often overlooked is that indias nuclear program is essentially indigenous developed by indias own scientists export controls on supercomputers and other dual use technology have been in effect against india for years forcing india to develop its own highly advanced r d infrastructure another very important point is that india has kept its nuclear technology to itself out of the hands of rogue regimes and international sponsors of terrorism this is in marked contrast to china which has not only stolen our technology but has shared very sensitive information with unstable countries in asia and the middle east i fully agree that we need to be more wary of china this is an authoritarian country a oneparty state the communist party with a terrible record on human rights and a record of intimidation and aggression against its neighbors indeed some of indias recent actions

on the other side of the aisle when they do not agree with scientific studies when we get scientific answers to studies and that science does not say what they wanted to hear then they demand more studies and that is exactly what is happening right now we know it they know it and it is not going to work we can only delay this so long before i came to congress i was a human resources professional in the electronics manufacturing industry that was back in the seventies when i first went into that business and at that time we understood the problems that were caused by related stress injuries in fact it was trendy to take care of our employees and find solutions when we had carpal tunnel syndrome on our assembly floor in fact the company i worked for began to see a large number of repeated stress injuries and when we figured out that the problems were occurring with one group of workers we realized that our printed circuit board assemblers were using the same motions repeatedly in order to do their job as efficiently as possible but in inserting electronic components into printed circuit boards they were causing themselves carpal tunnel syndrome the company was causing it without knowing it in fact what happened was in handinserting components into printed circuit boards one of the components was just not going in smoothly and it was the same component over and over and workers had to use their thumb to push that component into the board well little by little you can imagine what started happening to their arm now today to prevent such injury to employees most electronic companies have automatic insertion machines employees do not even use those same processes but back then the repeated push with the thumb did result in carpal tunnel syndrome over time well what i did as the human resources manager for this company was something that i am sure everybody over there would think is pretty darn odd i called calosha and brought them into the company and they came they observed the workers carrying out their task we worked with them as partners and came up with the appropriate solution for our workers and their symptoms disappeared you see it was important for us because we were a company that was growing rapidly and we knew that our workers injuries would certainly inhibit our growth and we probably would not become what had been our goal to become a fortune 300 company which we did but it would not have happened without a healthy work force the point is that business knew about repetitive stress injuries years and years and years ago many employers have stepped up to the challenge to prevent repetitive stress injuries they worked with osha they worked with their workers comp carriers because they know that their workers comp costs go up when they have injured workers so we do not need further studies employers and employees will not benefit from further studies but they will benefit from ergonomic standards we already have sound science regarding the problems caused by repetitive motion the problem i said it before and i will say it again the problem appears to be when the republican majority disagrees with science they insist on more studies the problem really should be to put together ergonomic standards to prevent injury in the workplace to make the workplace safe for our employees and this bill h r 987 is an inexcusable delay tactic this delay tactic benefits no one it does not benefit business and it certainly does not benefit workers i would urge my colleagues to oppose h r 987 because a vote against h

signing ceremony this year last year i joined with my friend the gentleman from michigan and offered the patients bill of rights as an amendment on the house floor while i regret that it did not pass there may have been at least one good thing about that in the last few weeks many hmos have announced double digit premium increases because in my opinion they have not done such a great job in cost containment and their premiums have been loss leaders for years but you can be sure that if the patients bill of rights had passed last year they would be blaming us now for their skyrocketing premiums and by the way how many of their ceos are taking pay cuts from their multimillion dollar salaries as they are raising their premiums this year before discussing how i think congress will deal with this issue this year it is important to understand why passage of hmo reform legislation is so important i will bet that every member of congress has heard from constituents describing their own hmo horror story we have all seen headlines like hmos cruel rules leave her dying for the doc she needs or exnew yorker is told get castrated so we can save dollars or how about this headline what his parents didnt know about hmos may have killed this baby consider the 29yearold cancer patient whose hmo would not pay for his treatments the hmo case manager told him instead to hold a fundraiser a fundraiser well i certainly hope that campaign finance reform will not stymie this mans efforts to get his cancer treatment during congressional hearings two years ago before the committee on commerce we heard testimony from alan demeurers who lost his wife christy to breast cancer when a specialist at ucla recommended that she undergo a bone marrow transplant her hmo leaned on ucla to change its medical opinion who knows whether christy would be with her two children today had her hmo not interfered with her doctorpatient relationship other plans have placed ridiculous burdens on those seeking emergency care ask jacqueline lee how bad this can be in the summer of 1996 she was hiking in the shenandoah mountains when she fell off a 40foot cliff she fractured her skull her arm her pelvis she was semicomatose she was airlifted to the local hospital and treated now my colleagues will not believe this her hmo refused to pay for the services because she had failed to get preauthorization i want to ask my colleagues what was she supposed to do know that she was going to fall off a cliff or maybe as she was laying at the base of that 40foot cliff semicomatose with her nonbroken arm she could pull a cellular phone out of her pocket and phone a 1800 number saying i need to get to the emergency room colleagues there are countless other examples how about the doctor who was treating a drowning victim a little 6yearold boy this physician told me that this little boy had been in the icu for just a few hours was hooked up to a ventilator they were doing everything they could to save his life but it did not look very promising as this physician and the little boys parents were standing around the bedside just a few hours after admission to the icu the phone rings it is the hmo case manager well how is this little boys condition it is pretty critical well if it is so dismal have you thought about sending him home on home ventilation think about that we are fighting to save this little boys life and a few hours after admission the hmo is suggesting send him home on home ventilation so that we can save a few dollars how about the hmos that refuse to cover cleft lip and cleft palate surgery saying that these are cosmetic how about plans that threaten action against doctors who tell their patients about all of their medical options not just the cheap ones that the plan will provide how about hmos manipulating the term medically necessary to avoid covering costly procedures because our friends our neighbors our fellow workers or our own families have had these types of experiences countless polls show that people want congress to pass managed care reform legislation this year a recent kaiser family foundation survey found that 78 percent of voters support managed care reform and a similar percentage support allowing consumers to go to court to sue their health plans if their health plans are guilty of malpractice but no public opinion poll can convey the depth of emotion on this issue except the way movie audiences around the country spontaneously clapped and cheered helen hunts obscenitylaced description of her hmo in the oscarwinning movie as good as it gets audiences across the country responded to her plight because they saw the same things happening to their families their friends their fellow workers now the industry responds well these cases that you have talked about they are all just anecdotes well to paraphrase shakespeare hath not these anecdotes these hmo victims hath not these anecdotes hands organs senses passions the same as a hmo apologist and if you prick these anecdotes do they not bleed if you tickle those anecdotes do they not laugh and if you cut short their care for profits might they not die last year i and some others crossed party lines to push for passage of the patients bill of rights this is a good bill it would have done a lot to deal with the end of the constant stream of hmo abuses similar to the ones i have talked about it contained for example strong language ensuring that health plans pay for emergency care think of the plight of james adams age 6 months at 3 30 in the morning his mother lamona found him hot panting moaning his temperature was 104 degrees lamona phoned her hmo and was told to take little jimmy to the scottish rite hospital quote that is the only hospital i can send you to said the hmo reviewer how do i get there lamona asked i dont know the nurse said im not good at directions well about 20 miles into their ride little jimmys parents passed emory university hospital a renowned pediatric center then they passed georgia baptist and grady memorial but they did not have permission to stop there and so they drove on they had 22 more miles to travel to get to scottish rite hospital and while searching for scottish rite james heart stopped there is a scene in the recent movie civil action showing a mother and a father in a car on the side of the road administering cpr to their child think of little jimmy adams when you see that scene well lamona eventually got jimmy to the hospital but because he had had an arrest it looked like he was going to die jimmy was a tough little guy though and despite his cardiac arrest due to the delay in treatment by his hmo me survived however the doctors taking care of little jimmy had to amputate both his hands and both his feet because of gangrene related to the arrest all of this is documented in the book health against wealth as the details of baby james hmos methods emerged it became clear that the margins of safety in hmos can be razor thin maybe as thin as the scalpel that amputated jimmys hands and feet think of the dilemma an hmo places on a mother struggling to make ends meet in lamonas situation if she takes her child to the nearest emergency room she could be at risk for hundreds or even thousands of dollars in uncovered charges or she could hope that her childs condition will not get worse as they drive past other hospitals that additional 22 miles to get to the nearest er authorized by that hmo a strong hmo reform bill would ensure that consumers do not have to make that type of potentially disastrous choice last year we had support from consumer groups and from a number of nonprofit health plans calling for federal legislation these health plans and consumer groups wrote together we are seeking to address problems that have led to a decline in consumer confidence and trust in health plans we believe that thoughtfully designed health plan standards will help to restore confidence and ensure needed protection and noting that they already made extensive efforts to improve the quality of their care the chief executive officer of one of these plans said we intend to insist on even higher standards of behavior within our own industry and we are more than willing to see laws enacted to ensure that result let me repeat that the ceo of one of the countrys largest hmos said we are more than willing to see laws enacted to ensure that result so in recognition of the problems in managed care these three managed care plans along with consumer groups got together and endorsed nationally enforceable standards things like guaranteeing access to appropriate services providing people with a choice of health plans ensuring the confidentiality of medical records protecting the continuity of care providing consumers with relevant information covering emergency care banning gag rules well i am sad to say that despite strong public support to correct problems like these and the support of many responsible managed care plans the legislation stalled in washington last year that is truly unfortunate since the problem demands federal action 0 historically state insurance commissioners have done a good job of monitoring the performance of the health plans in their states but federal law puts most hmos beyond the reach of state regulations how is this possible more than two decades ago congress passed the employee retirement income security act which i will refer to as erisa in order to provide some uniformity for pension plans in dealing with different state laws health plans were included in erisa almost as an afterthought but the result has been a gaping regulatory loophole for selfinsured plans under erisa and even more alarming is the fact that this lack of effective regulation is coupled with an immunity from liability for negligent actions now personal responsibility has been a watchword for this republican congress and this issue should be no different health plans that recklessly deny needed medical service should be made to answer for their conduct laws that shield them from their responsibility only encourage hmos to cut corners congress created this erisa loophole and congress should fix it think for a moment about buying a car i often hear from opponents to this legislation well this managed care legislation this could lead to socialized medicine but think about buying a car federal laws ensure that cars have horns brakes and headlights yet despite these minimum standards we do not have a nationalized auto industry instead consumers have lots of choices but they know that whatever car they buy that car has to meet certain minimum safety standards one does not buy safety a la carte the same notion of basic protections and standards should in my opinion apply to health plans consumer protections will not lead to socialized medicine any more than requiring seat belts has led to a nationalized auto industry in a free market these minimum standards set a level playing field that allows competition to flourish let me share some thoughts on how i think this issue will evolve in the coming months as we know we came close to passing the patients bill of rights last year already however i see signs that a partisan fight could break out again this year while i continue to support the patients bill of rights and i wish it had passed i do not want us to get hung up on or let reform die on the alter of partisanship like the opponents to the legislation used last year so i decided not to cosponsor the patients bill of rights this year when the gentleman from michigan introduces it instead i am going to introduce my own bill probably next week while my bill will keep the best features of the patients bill of rights it will also eliminate some of the provisions that would add regulatory burdens on health plans without really adding much in the way of increased patient safety in addition my bill will have a new formulation on the issue of health plan liability i continue to believe that health plans which make negligent medical decisions should be accountable for their actions but winning a lawsuit is little consolation to a family who has lost a loved one the best hmo bill will ensure that health care is delivered when it is needed and to encourage that the bill which i will drop next week will provide for both an internal and an external appeals process but unlike last years patient protection act the external review will be binding on the plan it could be requested by either the patient or the health plan the review would be done by an independent panel of medical experts do external appeals work a recent review in new york shows that half of all internal appeals are decided in favor of the patient but that also means that half of the time the hmos decisions are upheld the important thing is to get the proper treatment for the patient in a timely way not necessarily to end the post mortem in a court so i will propose that where there is a dispute on denial of care either the patient or the hmo can take this dispute to an independent peer panel for a binding decision if the plan follows that decision there could not be punitive damages against the hmo since there can be no malice if they bind themselves to the decision of an independent panel of experts i suspect that aetna today wishes they had had an independent peer panel available even with a binding decision on care when it denied care to david goodrich last week a california jury handed down a verdict with 116 million in punitive damages to david goodrichs wife teresa if aetna or the goodriches had had the ability to send that denial of care to an external review they could have avoided the courtroom but more importantly david goodrich might be alive today that is why my plan should be attractive to both sides of the aisle consumers get a reliable and quick external appeals process which will help them get the care they need they can go to court to collect economic damages or lost wages future medical care but if the plan follows the external reviews decision the patient cannot sue for punitive damages hmos whose greatest fear is of a 50 or a 100 million punitive damage award can shield themselves from those astronomic awards but only if they follow the recommendations of an independent review panel which is free to make its own decision about what care is medically necessary as long as there is not a specific exclusion of coverage of a benefit i e a plan says up front to an enrollee we do not cover liver transplants i have shared this approach with a number of my colleagues as well as consumer groups businesses health plans i have been encouraged by the positive responses that i have received i think this could be the basis for the bipartisan solution to this problem in fact i recently spoke with the ceo of a large blue cross plan who confided to me that his organization is already implementing virtually all of the recommendations of the presidents health care quality advisory commission at little or no cost probably no premium increase but the one part of the health care debate that concerns him is the issue of liability he indicated that shielding plans from punitive damages when they follow an external review body would strike an appropriate balance passage of real patient protection legislation is going to require a lot of hard work dedication and seeking a consensus and a compromise my new bill represents an effort to break through the partisan gridlock that we saw last year and to move this issue forward and get a solution signed into law i hope that my colleagues will sign on as original cosponsors to the managed care reform act of 1999 if members have any questions about parts of this bill or if they want to sign on please give my office a phone call"], [0.9996625185012817,

talk about federal taxes it is useful to consider the overall context of the federal budket here let us remember federal spending is higher than it has ever been federal taxes are higher than any peacetime in our nations history as we heard earlier about 21 percent of our entire economic output goes to the federal government what the republican budget does is it says after we set aside all of the social security funds for social security and to retire debt and after we pay down 1 trillion in debt over the next 5 years and after we set aside 40 billion of additional funding for medicare over the next 5 years and after rebuilding our national defense and reprioritizing funding for elementary and secondary education after all of that there is still an unprecedented surplus projected as far as the eye can see when taxpayers are paying more money than it takes to fund all of that then it is obvious to me that taxes are just too high so the republican budget offers a modest but a meaningful measure of tax relief and tax fairness we need to lower taxes and restore to working americans some more of their freedom to decide how they want to spend their pwn money our colleagues with this amendment are offering a tiny little merely symbolic but not a real meaningful tax cut it is just not enough let us remember when the federal government takes peoples money away from them it is taking part of their freedom away this is money that the government takes from hardworking americans that they will never be free to spend for themselves as they see fit it is money that takes time to earn and that means time taken away that folks could spend doing other things like maybe spending more time with their children maybe caring for an elderly family member maybe volunteering in their community or just enjoying some leisure time at a time of already huge government spending record high federal taxes it is unconscionable at this point not to provide the american people with the opportunity to keep a little bit more of the money that they earn the republican budget strikes the right balance no more raiding of the social security surplus for the second consecutive year funding

is that we are preserving state and local control in terms of what edflex is doing for us the decisions about our childrens education should be made by parents and educators and at the local and state level not by politicians in washington d c and i think that is terribly important for us to protect we in washington should be supporting and supplementing those efforts and giving direction but not overriding them so aside from however the local control and state control aspect of this i think this legislation very well preserves accountability accountability that will require the states and the school districts to make their own decisions but they must meet specific and measurable educational objectives the school may apply for a waiver but they must justify that waiver when the application is made and i think the bill very well puts that into not only perspective but into enforceable ways edflex gives greater authority to the states to determine their particular goals bilt holds them accountable in terms of the accountability i think this bears repeating and stressing the accountability means first that under the monitoring provisions the states and local educational agencies must report their progress on how they are specifically meeting their goals secondly regulations relating to parental involvement cannot be waived i think that is very important and third by providing public notice and comment for application for waivers edflex recognizes the importance of community input and so that there must be notification for that kind of waiver in summary i guess i would say that this legislation gives authority over decisions concerning childrens education to principals teachers parents and local communities where in my opinion it belongs that is the only way we can strengthen our public school system and i think this will be an extraordinarily valuable tool for advancing the quality of education across the nation"], [0.005468904972076416, 0.5054689049720764, 0,

this to a country that made no overt action against us and in fact did not even threaten to there is no threat to our national security there is no vital unitedstates interest at stake or that is even threatened iraq is not even a paper tiger today some of our leaders have tried their best to make iraq sound threatening by repeatedly talking about weapons of mass destruction yet in several years of inspections by u n inspectors no weapons of mass destruction were found besides many nations including us and our leading allies have weapons of mass destruction we cannot go bomb every nation that

most americans believe the haitians should pick up their own garbage and that the bosnians should give their own rabies shots by the way the president originally promised we would be out of bosnia by

package contains a division relating to tax matters including the socalled balanced budget act bba medicare fix those tax matters were inserted into the omnibus package by the leadership and they fall into the jurisdiction of the ways and means and finance committees accordingly we appropriations members were not involved in that process in conclusion mr president i urge my colleagues to vote for this conference agreement despite its having all the flaws that we have seen in previous omnibus appropriations bills the time has come to finish the work of the 106th congress in that way we will have a clean slate for the new congress the 107th congress when it convenes on january 3rd and for the new administration when our new president george w bush is sworn into office on january 20th while i recognize that there are those who predict a continuation of the gridlock that we have seen in the recent past or perhaps greater gridlock in the next congress as it struggles to work with the bush administration i hope and believe that there will be unprecedented opportunities for bipartisan efforts to prevail in solving the nations most pressing problems to maintain a vital national defense and to find solutions which ensure that our medicare and social security programs can sustain the promised for our citizens over the coming century i am optimistic that the new congress will be prepared to work with the bush administration i know that the overwhelming number of members of the house and senate on a bipartisan basis join me in pledging our best efforts to do so and our good faith commitment to achieve results in these critical areas on behalf of the american people"], [0.018144190311431885, 0.5181441903114319, 0, "i yield myself such time as i may consume i rise in strong support of h r 457 the organ donor leave act i commend the distinguished gentleman from maryland for introducing this important bill i know that my colleagues in the house are strong supporters of organ donation but whenever we have a chance to highlaght this important issue we should do so more than 54 000 people arecurrently on the organ transplant waiting list and about 4 000 each year die while waiting for a transplant i believe that congress should do whatever it can do to encourage our citizens to consider becoming organ or bone marrow donors and that the federal government should be a leader in this effort the organ donor leave act does that the least we can do for those who are giving so much of themselves is to give them the time to rest and recover with their families as they save the lives of others h r 457 will make it easier for federal employees to become organ donors by providing those who donate organa with 30 days of paid leave in any calendar year under current law employees are permitted to take 7 days of leave in order to donate bone marrow or organs h r 457 retains the 7day leave period for bone marrow donors but increases the leave available to organ donors to 30 days this leave is separate and distinct from the annual or sick leave available to federal employees my home state of illinois has been a leader in organ and tissue donation through our secretary of states office in fact i signed up as a potential organ donor when our secretary of state now governor george ryan came to the house floor of the illinois general assembly and personally signed up every legislator on our drivers license on the back illinois is one of the few states with an organ tissue donor registry in illinois this registry makes use of the existing drivers license and id card database to identify individuals who are willing to be organ or tissue donors after death since october 1992 everyone applying for or renewing an illinois drivers license or identification card is asked if they want to participate in this registry the response has been terrific approximately 3 million illinoians have joined the registry and nearly 100 000 more enroll each month the average participation rate statewide is 38 percent compared to a national average of 13 percent and some counties have reported participation rates of over 70 percent the bottom

medicare was begun and as we look back 35 years it is hard to imagine now a time when seniors did not have medicare when they did not have a guarantee of health care just as it was impossible for them to imagine looking forward into time what health care could provide now we are at a particularly wonderful moment in our history over just the past 5 years or so we took a nation that was plunging into debt 250 billion a year adding to the nations debt and by 1997 making a lot of difficult decisions including many that affected the medicare program and trying to squeeze out some of the waste and fraud in medicare and we balanced the budget last year in fact just late last year we made another huge decision here in washington we said we are not going to spend any more of the social security trust fund on anything else but social security and that is another milestone that was brought about because of the fiscal discipline that we have demonstrated over the last several years now we are taking down debt we are to the point where by the end of this fiscal year by next october we will have paid down over a quarter trillion dollars in debt so this is a golden moment in american history the economy is strong revenues are coming in the budget is balanced and we have an opportunity now to take another leap forward and that leap forward i think involves creating this prescription drug benefit it is a quality of life item we have the opportunity to do it and again there is not any question in my mind that there is enough talent in this town some of it actually in the congress certainly in this staff and elsewhere enough talent in this administration talent in both the republican and democratic parties and a willingness across this nation to do this that we can do this this is a solvable problem and if we decide not to care who gets credit for it and work together across party lines it can and it will be done i justhope that all of the members of the house

such a presence around here when we think that this body operates with people who are in key positions positions of incredible respect and importance serving on the committee on standards of official conduct and his role on the committee on appropriations and many of us recall that in that role it was pointed out by his colleague and friend the gentleman from california that when he was chair of the subcommittee on the district of columbia of the committee on appropriations he was like the ad hoc mayor of washington d c because he had a passion for this city and for it being the nations capitol i want to share with the members just a moment i was a young staffer in the california state legislature when julian dixon became elected he was a magnificent human being tall handsome smart he was elected as caucus chair democratic caucus chair in the california state legislature and had incredible respect obviously when a seat opened here in congress he was a natural to run for that seat win and serve in congress with distinction we are at a loss because we sometimes know that people are ill or in the hospital but it is a shock when we learn that immediately someone is gone and particularly those of us from california if we look at the very short time in the last few years that we lost george brown we lost sonny bono we lost walter capps we have had an incredible loss of california members of congress julian was a champion among them all i am chair of the delegation and some people are already going back to california and i am sure they will hear on the airplane or

for us as everybody will agree is that there are 30plus million americans who fall under this umbrella of medicare and it grows every day we certainly know what the demographic shift is in america we have heard the numbers as they relate to social security we talk about it enough related to medicare but the fact is the senior that goes on social security is also the senior thatwill go on medicare the population will double in the next 15 to 20 years in america and i think there is a responsibility that we have to make sure that the system is sound enough that it will go on i think it is important to talk about some of the numbers that we hear on a daily basis as we discuss drugs individuals might see on the nightly news when they talk about the individual who is making a choice between food and drugs or drugs and something else in their monthly budget the presidents new proposal has a full subsidy at 135 percent of poverty that income level on an annual basis is 11 727 a year excuse me the 150 percent is 11 727 what happens to that person that is at 135 to 150 clearly they have the same choices that they have to make maybe not as great as the person at 100 percent but i think one of the things we have to do is we have to identify where is that safety net needed the most whether there is a transitional safety net for people in the middle because today we can look at 200 percent of poverty for seniors and realize that there is no state federal or community safety net that fills their need and how expansive we can be is only limited to how creative we can be at
