from washington for organizing this special order i want to thank my good friend mr fincher for his work on the legislation and i thank those who are really talking about trying to create jobs really what we are talking about here is in terms of the exim bank the exportimport bankit is a bipartisan piece of legislation that we are looking to reauthorize we are looking to make sure that again we are creating jobs as for the reauthorization of the bank for those who might have forgotten and for those who may be tuned in in 2012 the reauthorization passed on a suspension vote of 33093 it passed in the senate 7820 this was not three decades ago this was 3 years ago there is a reason to support the reauthorization of the exim bank and i appreciate my good friend mr collins for talking about how exim equals jobs i do believe that is the case you have all heard the statistics i mean 83 percent of the loans nationwide from the exim bank are going to small businesses small businesses create twothirds of the net new jobs in our nation i have to tell you in talking to my colleagues around this very body the number one issue that we encounter is the fact that it is jobs and the economy we want to create and make sure that there is a robust number of good highpaying careers the exim bank enables those small businesses to be able to keep their doors open to be able to ship to 96 percent of the worlds consumers which happen to be outside of the united states it is interesting to me when we talk about this because there are a lot of big businesses out there that have the ability and the resources to put a plant over in places like malaysia or germany or those other places it is the small businesses that oftentimes dont have that ability you heard me having a conversation with mr collins earlier about someone who came into my office who was talking about the fact that he manufactures tractors the tractors arent big tractors they are fairly small tractors but the tractors cost about 1 million apiece if they arent able to manufacture those tractors here in the united states in getting that exportimport bank financing they will go somewhere else they have a facility in france that they will be able to use those are jobs that are going to leave the united states i do believe that when we talk about the economic growth in manufacturing my district and i know many of the other districts of my colleagues here are heavy in manufacturing we are the fourth largest manufacturing district in the 10th district of illinois we have literally hundreds of jobs54 000in the district that rely upon exports i recognize that there are a lot of people who want to talk about boeing but boeing actually has three dozen suppliers in the 10th district of illinois these are three dozen businesses and hundreds of employees who support making things that go into a boeing plane you have heard the adage that when a boeing plane lands 21 000 small businesses land with it this is important this is talking about good highpaying jobs things that the exportimport bank absolutely helps support the thing that is interesting to me is that if we choose to not reauthorize the exportimport bank who loses our competitors overseas have export financing our small businesses will be the ones that lose we are going to in essence tie one hand behind our back and make us less competitive i cant think of a crazier thing that of making us less competitive we want to be more competitive we want to give our small businesses every advantage possible to be able to go out and compete and win this is what we have an obligation to do this is what we have an opportunity to do i am delighted to be able to stand up here with my friends to talk in a bipartisan way actually about why it is important that we reauthorize the exportimport bank it is because there are jobs and there are businesses in vernon hills in wheeling in lincolnshire in northbrook in waukegan in glenview in des plaines in gurnee in elmhurst in lake villa in bannockburn and in mount prospect these are all towns in the 10th district that have companies that utilize the exportimport bank this is not some random deal this is something that small businesses utilize in order to make sure that they can sell their goods to places all over the globe to places like france germany india and china it is super important that we give them the opportunity to not only make it here in america but to be able to send it all over the globe if we are looking for an opportunity to end a government program listen i am all for government accountability and for trying to make sure that the government is smaller and more responsive lets not focus on a government program that brings billions of dollars into the federal treasury and creates jobs we have heard about the crony capitalism frankly i think that we need to be focusing on how we help small businesses because again if we shut down the exportimport bank who loses it is our small businesses not the small businesses that they compete against that may be overseas because they will have an export financing arm as my friend mr collins was talking about before if the private sector and the private sector banks would do it i understand but there are a lot of those private sector banks and a lot of those local community banks even those midsized banks that see the collateral go overseas that they cant touch and that they cant get back when they walk in for 1 million of financing to send that tractor overseas the answer is no guess what they cant hire that next individual to create and make that tractor we need export financing we need to make sure that the exportimport bank has some restructuring this bill does some of that in terms of the bill that we are looking for to try to have some changes that go into the exportimport bank to make sure that we are having that appropriate oversight to make sure that we are holding them accountable but it is absolutely vital for good highpaying careers that the exportimport bank is reauthorized and reauthorized with an overwhelming support if it comes to the floor i am confident that

this bill passed in the house by voice vote the bill directs the president to establish monitoring and evaluation or m e guidelines for the federal agencies charged with implementing foreign assistance programs abroad the guidelines will require m e plans as part of the project development process and agencies will be encouraged to incorporate the findings of project evaluations and impact studies into subsequent foreign assistance programs this feedback loop will include measurable goals performance metrics and a clearing house for lessons learned on unitedstates led aid projects additionally the legislation requires that the documents and reports created under this m e regime be made available to the public on foreignassistance gov this administration has developed an encouraging record on foreign aid transparency the foreign assistance dashboard created in 2010 demonstrated a promising inclination towards disclosure that we should hope to enshrine in law this measure will strengthen and codify those transparency best practices to ensure that they exist as agency policy under future administrations that might not be as accommodating of the aid communitys demand for this information aid programs that are held accountable for their performance and results can be made more effective and their impact on communities and countries abroad can be more easily demonstrated perhaps with more information we can dispel the commonly held belief that 26 percent of the federal budget is spent on foreign aid when the actual amount is less than 1 percent i am hopeful that this bill will help foreign assistance operations become more focused and efficacious it is time to apply a data driven approach to constructing an assistance operation that has the support of congress and a wellinformed public we cannot ignore the increasingly important role diplomacy and development play in meeting our most pressing security challenges and demonstrating

resolution today to the house floor and i commend ms kelly a new member of the committee for her focus on this important issue the africa subcommittee chairman chris smith and the ranking member of that committee karen bass have also done indepth work on nigeria and on boko haram in particular i appreciate their travels to nigeria nigeria holds a critical presidential election this weekend it is expected to be the continents most consequential political event in years africas most populous nation has over 70 million registered voters who will report to more than 100 000 polling stations i had the opportunity with don payne to lead a delegation years ago with election observer responsibility there for one of these national elections in nigeria along with general colin powell at the time let me tell you the political environment is always tense but it is especially tense now the leading candidates are neck and neck as was the case then i just have to say that we have seen nigeria transition from military rule to democracy in the election that general powell and i witnessed and that was a very peacefulvery peacefultime but recent elections in nigeria have seen political violence and we are right to be concerned this resolution urges all political candidates to respect their pledges of nonviolence and insist that the government hold a free fair and credible election and that they do so on time this election date has already been postponed once meanwhile nigeria continues to face grave insecurity in the north at the hands of boko haram which loosely translates to western education is sin this islamist terrorist organization indiscriminately kills in mass and pillages villages in their quest to establish a sharia state satellite images document that after boko haram comes through villages are literally wiped off the map the group is responsible for 5 000 deaths last year in 2014 and displacing over 1 million people last year making this organization by the way one of the worlds most deadly but this weekend forces fighting boko haram reported discovering another hundred bodies in a shallow mass grave we dont really know how many they have killed out there in total but we know that the killing continues after watching boko harams violence i wasnt surprised to see that that group pledges allegiance to isis isis publicly accepted the overture claiming this new relationship expands their selfdeclared caliphate to west africa at the same time we have seen boko harams propaganda increase in quality mimicking the production of isis videos sweeping what we call the virtual caliphate on the internet so the good news is that nigerias neighbors chad niger and cameroon have all been making progress in the fight against boko haram under a newly established african union regional force they have rescued more than 30 northern nigerian towns to date from boko haram and from that harsh rule this is a good beginning but this african union regional force lacks equipment and it lacks training this resolution expresses the houses support for robust security assistance to these troops in their fight against boko haram nevertheless we cannot rely solely on other countries in the region nigerias security forces should have the lead role to play if dismantling boko haram is the goal we need a welltrained wellequipped nigerian military we must make sure there are no impediments legislative or otherwise to providing this muchneeded assistance i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.004240870475769043, 0.504240870475769, 1, "in a gesture of reaching across the aisle let us be clear that prior to this bills arrival at the rules committee it was mr pittenger and myself who worked in a collaborative and in a bipartisan way hard for nearly the last 2 years to get it to this point where we might have an opportunity to vote upon it i cannot exaggerate to you how saddened i am how much i regret and how surreal i find it that i stand here now and ask my colleagues to please vote no against my bill oppose the bill that i have worked so hard on for nearly 2 years its content prior to its arrival in rules had been laid out commonsensically codify the credit union advisory council codify the small community bank advisory council and create a nonbank advisory board for the appraisers the title insurers the real estate agents escrow company all people that the bureau regulates and with whom they should have an iterative conversation going with respect to the proposed regulations it wasnt easy getting here even before rules there was a lot of back and forth a lot of compromising along the way we had to allay fears from the consumer groups that this was a trojan horse we accepted amendments we broadened the bill we did a lot of things together but with a collaborative spirit and the support of the ranking member we did pass the bill out of committee 535 and then a torch was put to it a torch was put to it as has been described the bill now includes a socalled payfor amendment to lower the cap of available funds to cfpb by 45 million by the year 2020 and 100 million by the year 2025 it is bad policy it is bad precedent and it is completely unnecessary the amendment was inserted under color of being a payfor well i have got a couple problems with that the first is obvious cbo projection is 9 million we are talking about a cap that cost 45 million and 100 million it is a multiple of itor 75 million to 100 million by last count the second of course is the fact about how the rule is applied which has been heralded here and in fact genuflected as an important rule to provide for payfors when there are expenditures caused by proposed legislation the motivation is frankly inscrutable to me i honestly dont know how you do it with a straight face literally a matter of hours ago voting for 300 billion with a b with no paygo or payfor and to stand up here and say well we absolutely have to have a payfor for 9 million over 10 years but 300 billion was okay i say sincerely i dont know how you do that with a straight face frankly there is so much about this that i find surreal much in the debate was about questioned architectural practices by the agency the truth of the matter is gsa took over construction what 2plus years ago if that is the issue write an amendment to the gsa budget dont punish cfpb it has been argued that this funding is unique therefore it has to be curtailed unrelated to the underlying purpose of the bill maybe that is true check the history it was a republican who wanted it funded by the fedmr shelby i believe that may be unique in that way it has been suggested cfpb is nonbudgetedagain unrelated to the underlying purpose of the bill well guess what so is every other bank regulator agency in the federal government the fdic the occ the fed itself fhfa and ncua they are all nonbudgeted but no lets pick this one out of the pack and punish it there is so much about this that is surreal to me i believe that there is a bit of a trial under way here today and we are laying a marker down on april 21 on whether or not we are actually going to be able to function in a bipartisan way we did it took hard work 18plus months with mr pittenger 535 in committee and now as i say we are putting a torch to it we are going to decide this is a test are we going to use the cfpb as a piggybank to pay for all other manner of agendas are we going to ask them to swallow this poison pill in the goal of getting a bipartisan bill passed it is a test of whether or not we are going to do that it is an experiment to see how radicallyand it is radicalwe can change bills and still keep yes votes in the name of consistency although there is certainly no consistency between the payfors provided in this proposed legislation and that for legislation that passed last week by the way in addition to the estate tax and the sales and use tax totalling over 300 billion we did two cfpb bills last week too nobody offered payfors on those so it isnt consistent this is surreal standing here asking you to oppose the bill that i have worked so hard on with mr pittenger it is surreal i am reminded of my favorite passage in through the looking glass if i had a world of my own everything would be nonsense nothing would be what it is because everything would be what it isnt and contrariwise what is it wouldnt be and what it wouldnt be it would you see this is surreal but i say my strongest assertion that what is the most sad about thisand i have said this in rules and i am going to say it nowyou know you know you are killing this bill you are killing it and evidently dont care 18 months of hard work out the window to do something good and worthwhile but you know you are killing the bill you know you are killing it because you are not passing here vetoproof and the administration has as the ranking member suggested already issued the statement of administration policy i will go one further this bill will never see the light of day in the united states senate you are killing the bill that we worked on for 2 years to help nonbank businesses have a better structured institutionalized relationship which is as it should be and you are doing it by inconsistently applying a house rule for which you grant waivers left and right when you were of a mind this is good legislation my friend from north carolina has worked hard franklyand i will say ithe deserves better than this this bill deserves better than this the businesses that are regulated by cfpb deserve better than this than to kill this bill which is what you are assuredly doing vote no on my bill"], [0.005897939205169678, 0.4941020607948303, 1, "i want to thank dr heck and the committee staff for working in a bipartisan manner to develop this bill and particularly recognize chairman thorn3erry and ranking member smith for their leadership during this process the bill includes many provisions that will provide the military services flexibility to recruit and retain members of our armed forces and to continue our commitment to taking care of military families one provision that we have expands parental leave for military members to 14 days as well as expanding adoption leave for dual military couples to 36 days to be split between them it also requires dod to study flexible maternity and paternity leave sharing for all of our dual military couples this bill includes reforms that will put the commissary on a sustainable path while protecting the benefit for our servicemembers retirees and their families it also begins to reform and modernize the military healthcare system although we would all agree it is not perfect this bill is long needed to start ensuring that our servicemembers retirees and their families continue to receive the best health care in the world through efficient and economical means important issues were addressed in this bill i support many of the reforms and all of the hard work that went into them however i am extremely concerned with how this bill is funded i applaud chairman thornberrys desire to increase funds for end strength modernization and the operations and maintenance accounts but the 18 billion required comes from the overseas contingency fund and cuts short resources required for our troops in harms way this will require the next congress to pass a supplemental before may and that assumes current operations dont increase over the next year what programs do we cut midyear to find that level of funding this gimmick creates a hollow force it will require the military services to hedge their bets that the funding to maintain the increased end strength authorized will be available in fiscal year 2018 when sequestration hits the world we know is very dangerous in many places and the pace of combat operations will most likely not diminish in the near future in light of these dangers i do not disagree that the army may need more soldiers but the army has not provided us with the requested number nor have they told congress how they would create the appropriate force structure to use these additional soldiers lastly this ndaa passed out of committee continued to expand on congress efforts to increase opportunities for women to serve our nation by requiring women to register for the selective service this was only possible because the department of defense after several years of intense review opened the last remaining combat arms positions to women earlier this year unfortunately the rule for the ndaa strikes the provision without debate i understand that we are not always going to be in agreement and that is why we debate and vote issues on the house floor but to resort to gimmicks to hide debate is unconscionable this is a national issue that congress must debate and vote on i certainly look forward mr chair to continuing to work with the chairman and the

want to serve again frankly when i went into the military i thought i would do my 4 years and kind of check that box and no one would ever question for the rest of my life whether i wanted to serve the country again yet then i got out and found i really missed it i missed that sense of public service that sense of duty that sense that every single day my work impacted the lives of other people

to do that they have got to be able to transition into life back here as a civilian that is tough that is tough today because many of the basic health care needs of veterans are not being taken care of they are not given the opportunities to pursue jobs in the private sector so that great opportunity for our nations veterans to serve again is squandered because we are not taking care of them when
