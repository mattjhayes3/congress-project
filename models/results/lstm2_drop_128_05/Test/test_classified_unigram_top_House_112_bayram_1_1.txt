ranking member and the chairman for their work on this important bill i have some concerns about the bill but im going to focus my remarks on title vii which deals with commercial vessel discharge reform and deals more specifically with ballast water discharge and the concern about nonindigenous invasive species these nonindigenous species cost taxpayers and businesses hundreds of millions of dollars every year in the great lakes alone approximately 500 million is spent every year in dealing with invasive species that clog municipal water systems and that damage infrastructure such as electric power plants levees and aqueducts in california over 7 million was spent to eradicate the mediterranean green seaweed from two small embayments in southern california and 12 million had to be spent in san francisco bay to control the atlantic cordgrass most of these invasive species arrive in our waters via the ballast water of commercial vehicles unfortunately in my viewand i believe in the view of a great many of my colleaguesthe bill before us does not do enough to protect our communities and businesses from the avoidable costs of dealing with invasive species this week the state of california sent members of congress a letter saying that title vii of the underlying bill will set a federal ballast water discharge standard that does not provide a significant improvement over existing management strategies and would eliminate the ability of states to regulate vessel discharges in their own waters i would like to enter into the record the letter from the california state lands commission to which i am referring in my home state of new york weve been working with michigan and other states to develop standards that are achievable with the technology that is available today but that would still protect sensitive state waters more than would todays underlying bill unfortunately this bill does not incorporate these sciencebased suggestions nor the jurisdictional concerns of the states i also want to enter into the record a letter from the environmental council of the states which urges that the states be able to maintain a role in making determinations with respect to their water quality while i think that most partiesand im one of themagree that a uniform national standard is necessary to protect our water resources one of my largest concerns is that this bill completely erases any role for states to protect waters within their jurisdictions so as the gentleman from west virginia said i will be offering an amendment later today that will allow states to petition the federal government under a set of criteria that protects international and domestic commerce to identify and protect highly sensitive water resources within a states existing jurisdiction my amendment does not add or change any technological requirements in the bill this is an issue of extreme importance for the industry understandably so and for that reason my amendment simply does not affect in any way the technological requirements it also does not give states carte blanche to prevent ships from releasing ballast water which is another important issue for the industry there is ample precedent for the amendment that i am offering and for the policy that my amendment would embody in 1996 the thenrepublicancontrolled congress amended the clean water act requiring the department of defense to work with the environmental protection agency to regulate ballast water from military vessels through the uniform national discharge standards program through this program the republican congress acknowledged a deep respect for the rights of states including a residual authority for states to establish no discharge zones which is similar to what my amendment would establish another precedent is that section 312 of the clean water act which is the closest analogy to ballast water discharges from commercial vessels establishes uniform standards for discharges of marine sanitation devices section 312 specifically reserves a role for states to create no discharge zones for important state waters provided that these zones will not adversely impact vessels from operating within the states in the past ballast water legislation has included a role for the states and industry was on board with those provisions 1150 theres an irony to what were doing here today and that is during this congress much of the debate has centered on how states should be allowed to take the lead on managing different programs within their jurisdiction be they educational programs or environmental protection programs or eliminating regulations and so on and yet in this instance we are saying the exact opposite we are saying that the federal government knows best how to protect local waters and states are not given any say in protecting their waters just a few months ago this congress passed h r 2018 the cooperative federalism act of 2011 which eliminates any federal role in setting baseline water quality standards giving full discretion for the setting of those standards to the states title vii of todays bill says that states should have no say in what happens in their waters whatsoever the exact opposite of what this congress passed with pretty broad support several months ago we also have heard a great deal from our friends in the tea party about the 10th amendment and how rights need to be reserved to the states under that amendment well i would contend that the ability to protect waters of the state and to set standards for waters of

opportunity for all members of the financial services committee to participate in reforming and changing this bill additionally the chairman of the rules committee the gentleman david dreier has once again provided members of this body with a rules committee vote to ensure that we have transparency and an accountable structure under the rule which were discussing today allowing members from both sides of the aisle this opportunity to offer amendments and to join in the debate of the underlying legislation today marks the first anniversary that president obama signed into law the 1 300page unprecedented federal overhaul of the financial services industry the frankdodd wall street reform act i have the opportunity to discuss this bill today and also i did last congress and we spoke at that time about its overarching reforms that were being made in that legislation additionally i will discuss why and how it is bad for our current economy and what with the republican underlying bill will do to protect consumers ensure credit and allow for economic growth last year i stood before this body to state that our friends on the other side of the aisle that they were once again allowing the government to overstep its boundaries well into the private marketplace one of the most farreaching provisions of the doddfrank bill that was signed into law last year is the creation of the consumer financial protection bureau best known as cfpb the cfpb is a classic example of the government unnecessarily crippling its authority into the free enterprise system this massive new bureau will be led by a credit czar who will have unprecedented and unchecked authority to restrict product choices for consumers and impose fees on consumer products and financial transactions just about any business or financial institution who offers any form of credit falls underneath the jurisdiction of the cfpb the new bureaucracy would raise costs for consumers i will say this againwill raise costs for consumers it will reduce the number and types of products available to them it will increase the micromanagement of financial services firms and will greatly increase the confusion caused by differing and conflicting consumer laws across the united states the underlying bill we are voting on today is designed to promote greater accountability and transparency at the cfpb and to ensure that the cfpb fulfills its consumer protection mandate without undermining the safety and soundness of the financial system this bill achieves this mission by making the leadership structure of the cfpb a collegial body streamlining the financial stability oversight council or what is known as fsoc their review and oversight of cfpb rules and regulations and delaying the transfer of functions from other federal regulatory bodies to the cfpb until the date on which the chair of the commission of the cfpb is confirmed by the senate this comes and it is of a great deal of importance since it was just this week that president obama nominated richard cordray as the director of the cfpb which officially begins its oversight of banks with more than 10 billion in assets today so no director no mission statement no accountability no hearing in the senate to confirm the person who would have this extensive authority and responsibility the consumer financial protection safety and soundness improvement act makes three important changes to the current cfpb first it would change the vote required to set aside a cfpb regulation from twothirds of the fsoc membership to a simple majority vote excluding the chair of the cfpb a letter from the american bankers association from may 3 2011 states and i quote the very purpose of the fsoc was to avoid problems that could lead to risks that threaten the economy to ignore the majority viewpoint of the regulators with this responsibility is completely counter to its mission statement and that of the council this first provision ensures that the council carries out the intended mission and goal second the bill would clarify that the fsoc must set aside any cfpb provision that is inconsistent with the safe and sound operation of unitedstates financial institutions lastly the bill amends doddfrank which provided for the cfpb to be headed by a director to be replaced with a bipartisan commission with the responsibility of exercising the bureaus authorities this was in the original house version of the bill and was changed by the senate during conference in a letter sent by the unitedstates chamber of commerce dated may 23 2011 the unitedstates chamber expressed support saying the chamber strongly supports this reform because it would conform the bureau to other independent agencies ensure impartial decisionmaking minimize the risk of regulatory capture and ensure continued stability over the long term reforms to the cfpb as it stands are necessary to avoid business closures limitations to startup companies slower economic growth and ensure that we do not hinder the free enterprise system these are all in the best interest of consumers and our country the underlying legislation ensures that the original intent of this legislation is carried out in a fair and unbiased manner to ensure the future safety and soundness of our nations financial institutions i encourage a yes vote on the rule and a yes vote on the underlying legislation i reserve the balance of my time"]], "top_unsure": [[0.0022266507148742676, 0.49777334928512573, 1, "last year i reintroduced the keeping all students safe act to protect children from abusive seclusion and restraint practices in school two years ago this legislation passed the house with bipartisan support unfortunately it never became law and the incidents of students who are being abused or inappropriately restrained while in school continue to occur we cannot sit idly by congress must step up to the plate and protect our nations children in recent months weve been hearing more disturbing stories of students who are being dangerously restrained by teachers and staff while in school in several of these cases students have suffered serious injuries or have even died as a result of their injuries in december in kentucky 9yearold christopher baker who has autism was stuffed into a duffel bag at school as punishment in connecticut children have been afraid to go to school because theyve heard other students screaming in small windowless rooms the students in these elementary schools refer to these rooms as scream rooms in texas 10yearold lukas hines who suffers from seizures dyslexia and adhd was put in a choke hold while riding home on a texas school bus for 4 minutes the school supervisor refused to release him into the care of his mother and instead kept him in the dangerous choke hold then on april 18 at the leake and watts school in new york 16yearold corey foster was restrained by the school staff who were trying to remove him from a basketball court witnesses reported that several staff members piled on top of him corey told the staff he could not breathe tragically while he was being restrained he went into cardiac arrest and died coreys story is far too similar to a story i learned of several years ago that was the story of cedric a 14yearold in texas cedric was restrained facedown with his teacher sitting on top of him he yelled out that he couldnt breathe minutes later cedric died on the floor of his classroom tragedies like corys and cedrics need to stop in march the department of education released nationwide data showing that tens of thousands of children are subject to restraint and seclusion in school each year this map shows that 31 states have had reports of abusive incidents since the last time that we tried to enact the keeping all students safe act no corner of the country is immune from abuse it is widespread and it has gone on far too long this map shows that we need a nationally driven reform because where states have enacted students are still subject to the worst practices in these educational settings according to the report released last month only 30 states have any meaningful protection for the use of seclusion and restraint in school only 18 states prohibit restraint that restricts breathing only 16 states limit the use of restraining to emergencies involving immediate risk or harm only 16 states ban the use of mechanical restraints and only 24 states have any requirement that their parents be notified that their child was restrained or secluded in school in fact children can go to school day after day be restrained be secluded be locked in dark rooms kept in those rooms where they urinate on themselves and their parents are never notified when parents are excluded from the information about their students where is that a matter of good public policy the child and their safety should not depend upon what state they live in the federal government this congress needs to set minimum standards and model standards we have the federal laws in place to prevent seclusion and restraint abuses that happen in hospitals and other health facilities but children do not have any federal protection against these potentially dangerous and torturous practices when theyre in school schools are supposed to be a safe place a place for children to learn a place for children to socialize and parents should never have to worry about the safety of their children when theyre at school no child should be forced to suffer abuse neglect injury or even death while theyre trying to learn the keeping all students safe act would set minimum safety standards for the use of restraint and seclusion in schools and provide training and support for school personnel to reduce the use of seclusion and restraint it makes it illegal to strap children to chairs put children in duffle bags or restrict their breathing seclusion restraint practices should only be used in emergency situations by trained staff and should end as soon as the emergency has passed this legislation makes it clear that theres no room for torture and abuse in americas schools news reports showing children being tied up with duct tape sat on by staff locked in rooms for hours at a time is unacceptable our children deserve better this legislation wont bring back corey or cedric but it can prevent future abuses from occurring ive called upon the chairman of the committee on education and the workforce to mark up this important legislation so we can move forward on passing

1 year and 2 months the fact is that by rejecting the senate bill which would have created certainty for 2 months we are instead replacing that with uncertainty that begins in 2 weeks going the direction were going in in 2 weeks we wont know what the situation will be for payrolls that start on the 1st of january a fullyear consideration is not going to be achieved in the next 2 weeks the doc fix weve been working on for years unemployment compensation and tax policy weve been working on for a long time the idea that were going to appoint a conference committee and theyre going to meet and agree and figure all of this stuff out in a couple of days we tried that with the supercommittee it didnt work this little conference committee is not going to solve all of these problems in the next 10 days so we have a choice 2 months of certainty or a few days of total uncertainty who knows whats going to happen economists have said if we dont extend the payroll tax and unemployment compensation that it will have significant adverse effects on the economy so we should do this we should do it for 2 months and work on it for 2 months and hopefully well have a solution at the end of 2 months we certainly wont have a solution at the end of 2 weeks so thats the choice when people talk about certainty this is a group that talked about certainty and then changed the regulations on light bulbs that have been in effect for 4 years on a 2week notice here we are with certainty for 2 months and they say well uncertainty is a problem so lets do it in 2 weeks lets have some certainty 2 months of certainty lets work on it and we can get a fullyear solution were not going to do that the way were headed i would hope that we would adopt the senate amendments leave town send the bill

ability to create electricity from hydro we support increased generation at all facilities by developing conduit and incanal hydropower and again i support all of the provisions that i stated here but

going to have to push back slightly on a few of those if its at all possible this particular bill deals with 100 miles from the border simply because that is the legal definition of border land by both statute and judicial decree it does not deal with coastal areas in the committee those areas were taken out because it is maritime area the border patrol deals only with land borders and those particular areas the 36 rules that are waivable is precedent established by this congress in california where the gentleman resides when they wanted to finish the fence and it was being withheld by certain kinds of litigation homeland security came up with 36 specific rules and regulations they wanted to be able to waive so they could do it that was the precedent the rules and regulations that are in this particular bill thats now title 15 are the exact same 36 thats where the precedent comes thats why homeland security wanted that time to finish their job thats what they needed this time however im also making an amendment to this bill that will reduce those 36 because to be honest some of those never really were a problem it will reduce it now to the 12 that the border patrol thinks are the most egregious but there is precedent for that particular thing all we are doing is trying to give the border patrol the same rights on federal lands that they currently have on private property there is no expansion of power and no expansion of jurisdiction its the ability to say our number one goal is to have border security and if there is a rule or regulation getting in the

members of the pool for their tremendous service that they render to this institution and on behalf of the entire house i want to again thank the nonpartisan professional committee staff for their extraordinary hard work and commitment to the house of representatives and to the american people that we all serve as it is often noted on the floor especially during somber moments like this public office is a public trust and for the vast majority of members who have been honored with the opportunity the privilege to serve in this the peoples house there is an unspoken duty to hold ourselves up

ultimately up to her constituents in california to be the final judge of her actions i think it is safe to say she did a disservice to the hardworking taxpayers from all corners of this country who expect and deserve more from their elected leaders throughout the course of this matter the investigative subcommittee heard desperate sometimes emotional pleas for help from members of representative richardsons staff representative dent has shared at least one of the stories with the body today and even since word first broke yesterday of this resolution this morning the committee has received calls from other staffers thanking us for bringing this matter to a public resolution as a former hill staffer myself i have great respect for those staffers who were willing to come to the ethics committee with their stories and heartfelt concerns that is not an easy thing to do against a member of congress particularly when that person claims to be your boss and youre made to feel that your job is in jeopardy at the end of the day however we must remember and never forget that the real employer for us all are the american people i was particularly moved by one of representative richardsons former staffers who testified this certainly should not be an example as to the way an elected official for this country should conduct themselves under any circumstance and i am simply haunted by the statement of another staffer that mr dent referenced a lady who was part of the wounded warrior program someone who was willing to risk her life in service to her country and ended up

about like dr gingreys incentives for antibiotic development or the supply chain legislation that mr dingell has worked on tirelessly for years but theres one issue that ive been working on on a bipartisan basis throughout this congress that i want to discuss briefly drug shortages have rattled our hospitals our doctors and our families figures recently released by the university of utah show there were 56 more newly reported drug shortages in the unitedstates last year than in 2010 when there were 211 so again let me say 211 drugs in shortage how can this be happening and what can we do about it representative tom rooney from florida and i introduced the bipartisan preserving access to lifesaving medications act which eventually had 85 cosponsors the bill creates an early warning system between the fda drug companies and providers so a community can respond to a drug shortage quickly and efficiently it wont solve the root problems of the drug shortage crisis but it will help providers and doctors and hospitals identify those crises and help with the patient this february for example under a voluntary program the fda stepped in to allow for temporary emergency importation of the cancer drug doxil which was in shortage and at the same time the fda prioritized the review of a new manufacturer of the same drug when the cancer drug went into shortage so what our bill will do is make this program mandatory what we think it will do is it will help patients across the spectrum get the drugs they need it will help the hospitals and the providers identify potential shortages and it will help the manufacturers better make sure that they get the drugs to the patients that need them im thrilled that this is contained and i want to thank the chairman"],

has now concluded that the class program cannot be operated without mandatory participation so as to ensure its solvency hhs secretary kathleen sebelius called the program insolvent and democratic senator kent conrad chairman of the senate budget committee called the program in 2009 a ponzi scheme in fact he went on to say that it would make bernie madoff proud during its consideration in 2009

federal subsidies to continue he was ignored in fact he was eventually cut out of the email loop the health committee on the senate side and the staff of senator kennedy didnt want to hear any more from him subsequently in december of 2010 the presidents fiscal commission recommended congress reform or repealnot amendthe class act the commission report stated absent reform the class program is likely to require large general revenue transfers or else collapse under its own weight the commission advises the class act be reformed in a way that makes it credibly sustainable over the long term to the extent this is not possible we advise it be repealed in february of 2011 secretary sebelius testified before a senate finance committee hearing that the class program was totally insolvent as structured and needed to be reformed in order to work then in october of 2011 the secretary released a report on the class act that essentially found the obama administration could not make the program actuarially sound or credibly sustainable to quote the presidents fiscal commission over a 75year period thank god for senator judd gregg for putting that amendment in on the senate side that called for fiscal sustainability and the certification by the secretary over a 75year period of time or it could not go forward and thats exactly what happened based on the evidence the class program is not simply flawedit is broken as currently written it poses a clear danger to the fiscal health of our budget and to the american taxpayer in defending this broken program some of my colleagues have told me that there is no need to repeal class because the secretary has already abandoned it yet every day that we delay in repealing class we prevent congress from passing meaningful true
