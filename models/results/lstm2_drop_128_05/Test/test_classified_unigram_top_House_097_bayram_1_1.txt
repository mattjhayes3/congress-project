agencies 90 senators 200 house members and the smallbusiness and hightechnology communities this legislation is the small business innovation development act this bill has such universal support because it is needed now the united states faces its most serious economic crisis since the great depression unemployment stands at more than 10 millionthe highest level in over 40 years our basic industries that sustained us for so long are collapsing and have lost their ability to compete and create new jobs productivity has fallen dramatically even the hightechnology sector the one bright spot in our economy finds it difficult to keep ahead of the japanese our main challenger most serious of all we are losing our ability to innovate many scientific technological and economics experts warn that our ingenuity and our ability to capitalize upon scientific findings and create new technologies that lead to new products is faltering we cannot afford to lose our ability to innovate if we lose that we lose our ability to increase unitedstates productivity we lose our ability to maintain unitedstates technological preeminence we lose our ability to create many of the 20 million new jobs essential for a full employment recovery we lose our ability to compete in world markets and we lose our ability to prevent permanent damage to our economy and society we do not have time to waste the japanese realize that the only way to sustain their economic miracle is to move from being master imitators to being master innovators innovation is one of the few areas where we still are a world leader the japanese government has embarked on a major program to stimulate scientific innovation to accomplish that it has set upon a policy of sharp increases in research and development spending it is also consolidating physically some of its research in order to improve efficiency japanese companies too are increasing their r d efforts especially in such industries as electronics we must act and act now if we are to preserve our position as the worlds leading innovator the action we must take is before us todaythe small business innovation development act thi3 bill will tap the innovation and job creation abilities of the tens of thousands of smallscience and hightechnology firms in our nation their record is impressive the national science foundation has found that smallscience and hightechnology firms produce 24 times as many major innovations per r d dollar as large firms and four times as many as mediumsized firms gellman associates reports that small firms are 21l times more innovative per employee than idrge firms and bring innovations into the market sooner yet it finds that large firms are nearly three times as likely to receive assistance from public funds for their innovative efforts than small companies other studies show that small business created many of the millions of new jobs that put a record number of people to work in the last decade moreover new hightechnology firms have an average annual employment growth rate of 30 percent clearly smallscience and hightechnology firms are the most costeffective generators of innovation and the most prolific creators of new jobs in our economy these small companies are an essential element if we are to revitalize our economic and technological base they are a resource that we have no choice but tap at this critical time this is easier said than done for there are many obstacles which make it difficult to fully utilize this resource one obstacle is capital many smallscience and hightechnology firms find it difficult to raise the funds not only to get started but to develop their new ideas and then take them to the marketplace venture capital and tax breaks simply do not help these firms fledgling firms have neither the management team nor a demonstrated capability or feasibility that can be assessed nor do they have profits that can be written off on taxes all they have is an innovative idea the second obstacle is government federal r d agencies have long neglected and ignored smallscienc6 and hightechnology firms a study by the office of management and budgets office of federal procurement policy concluded that only 3 5 percent of total federal r d funds go to small firms despite the fact that they are such costeffective innovators the national science foundation reports that although 85 percent of all unitedstates companies conducting r d are small firms these firms receive only 2 percent of federal r d funds going to industry a recent study by the research and planning institute of cambridge mass on the growth of innovative hightechnology companies reported that small firms are unable to receive basic research support from agencies like the national institutes of health and the national science foundation in fact the report said their ideas are not even given a fair hearing while most people were in favor of government support of basic research there was resentment that in those cases where a profitmaking business could do the work better than another institution at no additional cost it still was denied the opportunity to do so the third obstacle is largeness prof walter adams a distinguished economist and former president of michigan state university recently warned of the dangers of industrial giantism his comments apply to universities too let me quote professor adams industrial giantism whether or not accompanied by monopoly power in specific markets is not benign and therefore cannot be ignored at the very least it breeds ap arrogance of power which ultimately causes those who wield it to lose touch with realityto their own detriment and the detriment of the society they are supposed to serve it also tends to divert entrepreneurship from risktaking investment research and development productivity enhancement and market expansion into efforts tq manipulate the state for protectionist ends it transforms the firm from an economic organism seeking to maximize profits by excelling in the marketplace into a quasipolitical institution seeking the quiet life in orderly markets protected and guaranteed by the state the strength of americas scientific and economic system has been its openness we need this openness even more today if we are to overcome our serious economic problems more important we need a mechanism to insure that the federal government fosters that openness by fully utilizing the unique ability of small businesses to generate innovation the small business innovation development act is that mechanism it mandates that all federal agencies with r d budgets of more than 100 million a year establish small business innovation research programs to develop innovative products and ideas these programs would be funded by earmarking a very small percentage of each agencys r d budget that goes for extramural r d that budget totaled 30 3 billion for fiscal 1982 the earmarking will start with a mere twotenths of 1 percent in the first year rising to 1 percent in the fourth year the defense department will have a 5year phasein that begins with onetenth of 1 percent the program will have three phases under phase i the most technically and economically feasible proposals would be awarded grants of up to 50 000 to perform feasibility studies those projects which demonstrate their technical and economic viability could then qualify for phase ii awards of up to 500 000 commercialization of the results would be left entirely to the private sector in phase iii unlike other government r d programs this one will rely on ideas generated in the private sector rather than on specific projects requested by government agencies the grants will be awarded strictly on a competitive basis and will go only to ideas of scientific and technical merit all of these requirements are spelled out in the act the legislation also would require federal agencies with annual r d budgets of more than 20 million to establish small business r d goals these goals would not be less than the percentage of the total r d funds awarded to small businesses in the preceding year the bill clearly states that sbir programs could be counted toward meeting these goals"], [0.4899452328681946, 0.5100547671318054, 1, "h r 4182 provides fiscal year 1981 authorization for the airport development aid program better known as adap adap provides grants to airports for airport development from trust funds contributed by the users of the aviation system the existing adap authorization

the ways and means committee that committee due to its work on the tax cut bill has been unable to schedule july 2 7 1981 consideration of the multiyear adap bill in time to permit its enactment before the end of fiscal year 1981 we are therefore faced with the prospect of losing all fiscal year adap funding the committee has therefore reported h r 4182 to fill that gap in ada authorizations the users have already contributed these funds in taxes to the trust fund in fact the trust fund surplus now stands at roughly 3 7 billion the 450 million authorized by this bill is in complete agreement with the administration budget the first buget resolution and the obligation ceiling in the fiscal year 1981 supplemental appropriation act furthermore defederalizatlon is not at issue in fiscal year 1981 since the senate does not propose defederalization until fiscal year 1982 in short none of the controversies which surround the multiyear ada bills really apply to fiscal year 1981 the only issue here is whether the users having already paid these taxes for airport development will get any benefits from those taxes h r 4182 would simply extend the adap program which existed on september 30 1980 for 1 additional year at the 450 million level the bill would not change the program in any way with respect to the existing setaside levels the various minimums and maximums provided for airports or any formulas for the allocation of funds the historic funding ratio between air carrier and commuter airports on the one hand and general aviation on the other has been retained in the authorization levels and the planning and noise planning programs authorized in the old law have retained their eligibility in the new authorizations furthermore because of the unusual circumstance of the lapse in the authorization for this program the bill would provide that projects begun in that period of lapse would not automatically be excluded from adap eligibility although they would still have to meet all tests and conditions as if the program had been in effect continuously i would also add that our decision to seek this 1year authorization in no way lessens our committment to our multiyear adap bill h r 2643 we anticipate that the ways and means committee will be able to consider the revenue title during september and that we will bring that bill to the house floor as soon after that as that as possible finally the committee amendment we have offered to h r 4182 is strictly a technical conforming amendment bringing our bill into technical conformance with the existing revenue title the amendment would not in any way change any curently existing taxes or have any other effect on the revenue title the amendment has been worked out in close cooperation with the ways and means committee and has their support i would ask unanimous consent that their letter to that effect be included in the record at this point"], [0.4900357127189636,

union that is destabilizing it not the united states by proposing to deploy a counterbalancing deterrent since mr breshnev announced his nuclear freeze proposal and claimed to cut back the production of ss20 the soviet union has deployed 20 additional ss20s targeted against western europe and has increased the production of this weapon fourfold the ss20 is 20 000 times more pow erful than the

overwhelming inf superiority it has the only deployed nuclear system in europe with 1 200 nuclear warheads terminating the planned pershing ii production would remove the principal unitedstates

the protection of the sugar grower exactly the same protections that exist today 0l 1 350 i will repeat that we are leaving exactly the same protection for the sugar growers that exists in the law today in other words the secretary of agriculture at his discretion acts to protect the american sugar growers but what we are saying today is that in this year when members on both sides of the aisle have voted to make the kinds of cuts that have been deemed necessary by the majority of this congress cuts in programs that range from senior citizens to students to mass transit to housing to social security to jobs that at this time to suggest that we can start a new program for the sugar growers even though they are protected i believe is more than the american public would stomach and more than this congress will stomach now i also would ike to bring out a number of factors that unless someone spends a great deal of time in studying this program and in studying past sugar programs i binderstand people do not have that intimate a knowledge i served on the agriculture committee i worked very hard in trying to grasp what really happens one thing i would like to bring out because it deals with money and this is something that many of the members are deeply concerned about there is much said that there is no cost to the sugar program i would like to think that 1 and all my colleagues in the house could share in what the cost is actually going to be we would not have to worry about future pay raises or anything of that nature if we have a sugar loan program at 18 cents which is what is indicated in the bill that we are acting on that 18 cents is higher than the present price of sugar on the world market consequently if one is a grower of sugar obviously one would want to put his sugar in loan today the sugar would be put in loan at 18 cents a pound even though the world market might be 15 or 16 cents or maybe 14 cents now having received this money the full amount of the money at 18 cents a pound on which one is paying 14 percent interest for that money at the end of the year when the loan is recouped let me give you an example of what has happened in the past in this situation it is unfortunate that some of the smaller beet sugar producers feel that they are hurt here and in many ways i have a great sympathy for them but what we are really talking about are the big corporations members know some of these big corporations use this money not for sugar but to go out into the money market and invest that money i have a letter here from the comptroller general of the united states dated september 21 1981 and it says specifically that there is no restriction on what companies can do with this money as a matter of fact it speaks of a sugar

the tax cuts does not hold much water because the recession began 2 months prior to the october 1 implementation date accelerating the tax cut will reduce and eventually eliminate the budget deficit by creating the foundation for a prosperous economy that is really what we are saying here the chamber of commerce has pointed out that by moving the full 10percent tax cut up to january 1 1982 the

the human tragedy of recession is in large part there because we have not taken the actions necessary to get this economy growing again it is also well to point out that there was a poll conducted which asked the americanpeople in terms of economic policy and tax policy which direction they preferred to go would they prefer to go the direction that many liberals are suggesting and that is a 6month delay or deferring the tax cut well 21 percent of the american people said thatthat was their preferred option 29 percent of the people said that they thought that the cuts ought to be left in place just as they are 30 percent of the people or the largest number said that they believed we ought to accelerate each of those tax cuts for 6 months in other words when you go out to ask the american people and ask them what do they think the policy should be most of them see the wisdom of giving them a greater tax break so that they have more money to save they have more money to invest and that jobs can be produced well i think the point is clear that the way in which we get the economy growing the way we get ourselves out of this recession is based upon not only economic

federal spending by figures more in the area of 145 billion rather than 45 billion i firmly believe this which is one reason i recently cosponsored house joint resolution 169 which calls for a constitutional amendment to limit federal spending and ultimately balance the budget it is based primarily on the word of dr milton friedman the economist who authored free to choose and was awarded a nobel prize for his work there are many amendments being proposed in congress to balance the budget but i believe this is the only one which adequately deals with the underlying problems plaguing our economy it is a strict amendment and requires much fewer federal programs and spending than most americans have been used to since the great depression basically this amendment limits growth of federal spending to the degree of productivity gains in the economy and tightens spending dramatically when the inflation rate exceeds 3 percent specifically the amendment will not allow the government to increase spending by a percentage any greater than the percentage growth in the gross national product for example if the gnpthe measure of our nations productivity in terms of goods and servicesincreased by 3 percent then federal spending will only be allowed to increase by 3 percent however if the inflation rate exceeds 3 percent then the permissible growth in federal spending must be reduced by a percentage equal to onefourth of the amount the inflation rate exceeds 3 percent for example if the inflation rate is 11 percent then the allowed growth in federal spending must be reduced by 2 percentsince inflation is 8 percent over the limit and onefourth of 8 percent equals 2 percent in a year in which the gnp grew 3 percent this would mean federal spending could only be increased by 1 percent as one can see when inflation gets out of control like it is now this amendment would force huge reductions in federal programs because they simply could not be funded at inflation market rates i favor this amendment because it attacks the two underlying causes of inflation huge government deficit spendingwhich creates too many dollars lessening their worthand a decline in productivity which forms the basic intrinsic value of the dollar in the absence of the gold or silver standard this plan of attack is exactly what president reagan is attempting to utilize but success now does not mean future congresses and presidents will not try to go back to the same old big government that got us in this sad state of high inflation and high interest the amendment is

federal spending as the most effective weapon in the ongoing war against inflation has at last received its proper priority in both the white house and on capitol hill the budget resolution recently passed by the congress and with substantial impetus provided by the reagan administration acting on its mandate from the american people correctly targeted inflation as the greatest threat to this nati ns economic health and viability that message was not lost on the public works and transportation committee when the conference report to the first concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 1982 directed our committee to achieve certain savings in both its authorization and direct spending programs we more than met the level of savings recommended in the reconciliation instructions in fact the committee in a strong bipartisan approach responded to the dollar targets set in the conference report by submitting recommendations containing 28 million of added savings in budgetary authority and over 400 million in outlays in accordance with budget committee guidelines the committee recommended no specific legislative changes for fiscal years 1983 and 1984 since reductions assumed by the budget resolution of the out years were for programs not presently authorized beyond fiscal year 1982 however the committee clearly and strongly expressed its commitment to achieve the recommended out year reductions when its programs come up for reauthorization in exceeding the aggregate savings directed by the budget resolution our committee complied with both the letter and the spirit of the savings directives it received while at the same time recognizing the expertise of the committee to make the necessary decisions on any programmatic changes i might say at this point that savings achieved by the public works and transportation committee in its recommendations to the budget committee were not reached without substantial discussion and some hard decisions on highly significant programs of great impact throughout the nation in making the necessary decisions on these programs our committee sought and achieved a careful balance between the essential spending reductions and the needs of vital programs in that regard the committee stressed the need to provide funding sufficient to those public works investment programs so essential to president reagans goal of national economic revitalization savings in specific programs were achieved in the following areas under public works and transportation committee jurisdiction in aviation the committee achieved a 139 million savings with 650 million cap in fiscal year 1982 budget authority for the airport development and noise abatement programs a figure substantially below the 789 million set by the congressional budget office even as we make the necessary decisions to reduce funding for aviation programs we must continue to protect our valuable capital investment in airports and air traffic control systems if we expect to meet projected increases in air traffic growth likewise the nations capital investment in its highway and public transit systems so essential to any plans for industrial revitalization must continue to receive high priorities in its recommendations to the budget committee our committee put an 8 2 million limitation for fiscal year 1982 on obligations for federalaid highway and highway safety construction programs excluding those for emergency relief and three emergency bridge projects consequently outlays for the federalaid highway program would be reduced by 500 million as compared to the budget resolution assumption of only 185 million in outlay savings in the area of highway safety the committees reconciliation proposal reduces total budget authority available for highway safety programs in fiscal year 1982 by 308 million the committee also proposed a 110 million obligation ceiling on highway safety programs in the next fiscal year budget authority for public mass transportation was reduced by the committee from that provided in the urban mass transportation act to levels anticipated by the budget resolution thus the committee achieved a 1 321 million savings in budget authority and an anticipated 200 million outlay savings in fiscal year 1982 in water pollution control programs the committee complied with the budget resolution conference reports assumption and recommended deleting the 5 billion now authorized for the environmental protection agencys construction grants program which assists municipalities in constructing publicly owned sewage treatment plants however the committee proposed a 100 million authorization to insure that states will be able to continue administering those portions of the program delegated to them for epas nonenergy research and development programs and for abatement control and compliance activities in fiscal year 1982 the committee recommended a 540 million authorization 209 million less than the amount in the congressional budget office baseline the committee recommended that funds for construction of corps of engineers water resources projects not exceed 1 588 million in fiscal year 1982 representing a reduction of 20 million more than assumed in the conference report funding for all programs authorized by the 1965 public works and economic

not support the proposal i smile and say that that is a movement in the right direction and given a little more time i believe they too will see the logic of the compromise which we bring here to the floor of this house the most important point is that timing is vital and very significant the timber is down in this area there are 30 000 acres of private land and about 4 000 acres of land belonging to the state of washington they need a decision as to what we intenid to do with this area the forest service has generously worked very hard to come up with specific exchange language so that once

the fh~st concurrent budget resolution for fiscal year 1982 i f ind myself faced with the difficult choice of deciding how to cast my vote on budget proposals which i feel do not adequately address several critical economic concerns the proposals before us all claim to present an economic program that is designed to revitalize the economy curb inflation reduce taxes and the growth of the federal budget and establish sound monetary policy although these goals are worthwhile and have my support i have doubts that these objectives can be met if national decisionmaking assumes that all states have the same economic problems and needs as an economic program takes hold the older industrialized states of the north and the expanding states of the south and west will simply not be starting from the same position my concern is that the northeastmidwest regions relative position will continue to decline if the disparities among regions are ignored if we assume that growth will affect all regions equally we run the risk of shaping an economic program which contributes to the decline of some areas of the country while favoring others variations certainly exist within regional economies however many northeastern states are faced with reduced business investment abandoned factories high unemployment declining tax bases and the increasing difficulty~ in financing locally vital services in new jersey we simply do not have the new industry new housing the clean air water and sewers the transportation facilities or the energy to meet the demands for services next year that would result from the proposed federal budget cuts conversely in the south and west most states enjoy higher investment greater business expansion and lowver unemployment according to an 0mb report issued on april 23 more than 3 4 million residents left the northeast and midwest to other regions resulting ini the loss of over 800 000 manufacturing jobs meanwhile 60 percent of the new jobs in the service sector were created in the south and west and nearly twice the amount in investmient for new capital equipment is in the south and west in the past the federal government has intervened in the southern and western regional economies through capital investment in ports dams roads water systems and defense installations without which the economic foundations for these regional expansions would not have occurred t he resulting effect has been a flow of federal dollars from the northeast and midwest to the south and west between 1975 and 1979 the older industrial states of the north paid 165 billion more in taxes to the federal government than was returned in spending while the south and west enjoyed a 112 billion surplus over their contribution to washington by favoring the construction of new facilities over the rehabilitation of existing plants the federal tax system has encouraged a rapid shift in investment away from the northern industrial tier this trend continues today and it is important to recognize that current federal tax policy inhibits the ability of older urban areas to retain existing businesses and attract new investment it is also extremely distressing to me to note the effect of increased defense spending on regional economies because a disproportionate share of all defense department personnelover 75 percentare located in the south and west these areas will reap the benefits of both increased defense employment and expenditures we all realize that defense is a national rather than a regional concern however while the security impact of defense is

trying to appreciate the rule governing debate today much less following the seven substitutes and 67 odd amendments is like playing croquet with hedgehogs and flamingos mir chairman i hold the president and his advisers primarily to blame for this ludicrous situation only a white house more interested in scenarios than fiscal responsiblity could first present congress with a stillborn budget proposal and then launch a media blitz complaining that congress was damaging chances for economic recovery by constantly delaying the budget process this administration keeps faulting congress for not immediately making hard choices necessary to prepare a budget that is tantamount to a doctor strangling his patient and then complaining because the clergy cant bring him back to life this administration has failed to make any hard choices in its travesty of a budget and now complains because congress struggles in building a consensus on budget priorities i have only been here 6 years but in those years and well before never has a president sent up a budget knowing it was doomed and then gone riding off into the sunsetleavins congress to struggle without a scintilla of presidential leadership this is a disgrace and the american people know where the blame lies it lies with the president of the united states and his colleagues yesterday and today we have tried to write a budget for the united states on the floor of the house of representativesand we will continue to try though as everett dirksen used to say there will be blood in the well up to our boottops before we are through i i have looked at all the substitutes and find their deficits with one exception because it has no deficit absolutely unacceptableand i believe the banking community wall street the american taxpayer the bluecollar and whiteshirted workers the labor leadership the small businessman and the corporate boardroom the family struggling to send their children to college or graduate school persons concerned with the environment the black community and minorities generally will also find them unacceptable the one exception to this view of course is the substitute offered by the geitleman from california but he balances his budget for 1983 on the backs of the elderly the poor the sick students farmers the housing automoble and steel indus tries and their workersand leaves essentially intact the unfair tax cuts and tax loopholes for corporations and wealthy individuals his sensitivity to human needs i need not dwell onhis substitute speaks for itself i just do not believe the american voter will return to office any member of the house of representatives or senator of whatever party who with a straight face presents a budget deficit for 1983 ranging from 96 8 billion to 109 4 billionand claims this was the best he or she could do and is in his constituents best interest if the white house likes scenarios this scenario is one of political suicide we all know that with a deficit of about 100 billion there will be no easing of interest rates you can have faith you can have trustand you can believe in this administrations economic policies if you care to but i respectfully suggest to you that this administration will still be forecasting the roaring back of the econom7 ad infinitum administration budget and economic experts must have known in their hearts that their deficit for 1983 was at the time they presented it in excess of 150 billion they also knew that their proposed defense increases and insistence on maintaining tax subsidies for the rich was feeding those deficits deficits which keep interest rates up workers unemploy d rnd families unable to buy homes cars clothes college educations for their children and the like administration economists of all people should have learned the lesson from franklin delano roosevelt when he said we have known that heedless selfinterest was bad morals we know now that it is bad economics it is bad economics to fatten the rich even more than they are already bloated it is also bad short and longterm politics this administration is riding into the sunset of political oblivion with its economic brand exposed in full view to the american people k that brand spells greed and uncontrollable greed is exactly what we are seeing as the hallmark of this administration and its misguided and selfdestructive economic policies may i first talk about corporate tax subsidies the combination of accelerated depreciation leasing of tax credits plus investment credits means that all of corporate america will soon reach the zero rate of taxation already achieved by such profitable corporations as occidental petroleum ltv and burlington northern rather than helping directly those companies which should receive tax relief these budgets are helping out very profitable corporations at an extraordinary cost to the treasury the taxpayers and to the future economic recovery of this nation those special interests who gathered in washington for the lear jet weekend may find that in aiming to raid the treasurythey really ended up shooting themselves in the corporate foot the feeding frenzy generated around the federal tax trough degenerated into an exercise in timelapse cannibalism their tax benefits are costing the nation revenues it does not haveare hiking interest rates and the deficit to ungodly levelsand helping kill the recovery needed to generate their own profits and sustain healthy economic growth and the creation of jobs for the millions upon millions of anericans out of work besides reducing the revenue hemorrhageinduced by the tax benefit given to corporations and the wealthy last yearanother way in which we could cut the deficit is by repealing reducing or delaying the third year tax cut however neither the tiny net tax saving of the middle income nor the several thousands realized by those with income in six figures are justification for the economic p nalties we will all pay through persistent high interest rates if the third year tax cut is left untouched repeal or reductions in the third year tax cut are essential if money managers and investors are to be convinced of our determination to reduce deficits it is far better to adjust the third year tax cut ant thus lower interest rates and create jobs than to maintain a tax cut which guarantees that the unemployed do not even have incomes on which to pay taxes defense spending is the third area where significant federal revenues can be saved the president wants to increase defense spending by from 13 to 18 percent above inflation the house budget committee would increase defense spending by 5 percent above leflation while the committee proposaland otherscut actual spending for 1983 between 10 and 15 billion they are really merely nibbling at this mammoth fiscal cheese i maintain that before we have a truly credible defenseand one which we can sustain without seriously eroding the economywe must repair the economic damage this administrations policies have caused to our great productive economic machine better to reduce defense spending by 50 to 60 billion than risk continued and deepening recession of the economy while experiencing runaway inflation and horrendous cost overruns in the defense sector defense spending can and must be reduced significantly beyond what any of these budgets before us propose a delay of several years will not have the russians launching their strategic missiles at us assuredly cuba will not strike out at us our present military strength is such that no nation on earth would dare risk assured mutual destruction defense spending ranging from 191 to 214 billion as proposed by the various substitutes is just too high during this period of economic crisis i feel sure our allies in nato and around the world would feel far more secure s9eing a unitedstates economy in good healthwith rational interest rates with greater production and productivity and with a dollar valued to facilitate rather than dampen world trade as the saying goes when the american economy has a cold the world economy catches pneumonia these three revenue sources must be tapped the american worker running out of unemployment benefits has lost patience with this president and this administration the congress must bite the bullet and present the american people with a budget which will foster economic growth and the creation of jobs for the mllions and millions out of work we must repeal or adjust the tax benefits passed out last year during a moment of fiscal drunkenness on the part of this administration and the congresstax benefits which i happened to have voted for unfortunate ly we must repeal or adjust the third year tax cutwhich again i voted for unfortunately we must reduce defense spending to a level consistent with economic realities we cannot accept continuing deficits in the 100 billion plus renge in spite or what our republican savior the gentleman from new york has said interest rates will not come down if deficits remain at current or higher levels we must secure the revenues necessary to achieve that and the areas i have indicated are those which i believe will produce increased revenues without cutting off economic recovery good government costs moneyby good government i mean that which helps peoplenot hurts them we should be investing in a government that truly cares for those who cannot care for themselves to have carelessly defaulted in his leadership responsibilities on the budget indicates that this president is greatly at odds with the view the vast majority of americans hold of the american government and its responsibilities i believe this president and those around him truly misread the american people they listen too much to the rhetorical grumblings and not enough to what the people really feel the american people instinctively understand what teddy roosevelt and his cousin franklin talked about when they used the word national the american people want a government that works and not one that is to be dismantled to oblige the greed and ideological liturgy of destruction espoused by this presidents wealthy cronies i have voted against all substitutes put before the house i shall continue to vote against others yet to be discussed the american people deserve better than the alternatives presented here for our deliberations and decision these budgets are unacceptable these things i believe"]]}
