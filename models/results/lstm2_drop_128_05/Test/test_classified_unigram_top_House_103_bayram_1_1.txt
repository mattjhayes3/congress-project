the right of israel to exist in peace and security chairman arafat vowed that the plo would renounce the use of terrorism and would work with israel toward a peaceful resolution of conflicts this historic plo recognition of the state of israel led to the emotional ceremony on the white house lawn when chairman arafat and prime minister rabin joined together to sign the israelplo declaration of principles in taking this courageous step rabin and arafat brought hope to the troubled middle east region in the months that have followed jordan has declared an end to its 46year state of war with israel and syria has entered into broad negotiations with israel as americans we have a tremendous national interest in stability in the middle east it is my hope that a sustainable environment of peace and economic cooperation in this region rule out the future necessity for unitedstates military action in the middle east like that our nation undertook in the gulf war the united states must continue to emphasize in words and action our unshakable commitment to theone true democracy in the middie east the state of israel over the years israel has proven to be a constant and valuable ally this nation which was founded almost half a century ago has maintained essential democratic freedom for its people and has sought economic opportunity for all its citizens it is gratifying indeed to see arab states ending decades of hostility against israel peace should bring greater economic cooperation between arab states and israel which should in turn bring a better quality of life to the people of these arab nations in order to promote lasting peace in the middle east nations must be held accountable for the agreements they sign i have considerable concern about the plos failure over the last year to adequately comply with its pledge to combat terrorism investigate terrorist incidents and prosecute those who carry out these acts terrorism in the middle east and around the world is a threat to all americans the united states should join with other democratic nations to see that those who commit acts of terrorism are identified and prosecuted the united states must also work to end the arab league economic boycott of israel that continues to be used as a tool of economic warfare the related secondary and tertiary boycotts which act as a barrier to united states exports have substantially hurt american companies that do business with israel a continued boycott undermines peace efforts and contradicts the principle of free trade ultimately the boycott threatens to hurt the citizens of arab nations who so desperately need expanded economic opportunity the united states should withhold most favored nation trade status from those countries that participate or cooperate in the arab league economic boycott of israel true peace in the middle east can only be established and endure if there is economic cooperation in the region the united states can promote sustained peace

japanese companies will be selling more products via mexico into our economy or market as well as germans and other industrialized nations so mexico is a prize for them only because it is close to the

the united states but we have two very different views of americas future being put forward today one is confident and open the other is insecure and closed both views are accurate in describing what most of us feel is going on around us but it is the first view that i believe must prevail we have a responsibility to our constituents to all amedcans to choose the path that wil enable us to prosper in an increasingly cornpetitive worid we cannot withdraw from that world and we must not let others determine our economic future since the passage of legislation providing for the consideration of the north american freetrade agreement our counw has been involved in an intense but nevertheless healthy debate about the merits of that agreement and what it means for the future this is democracy my decision to support nafra is one which i considered very carefully there am serious concerns on both sies of the debate as we have heard throughout today by our colleagues as with any important issue affecting the future of our country the decision has not been an easy one i recognize that many of my closest mends and stmngest political supporters have ex pressed fearsthat the adoption of nafta would lead to a loss of jobs for many hardworking americans they believe that a free trade agreement is desirable and ultma important to our economic future but that this agreement is flawed i recognize those fears are genuine and deeply felt they are not a mere debatin point they are the concerns of every hardworking american in making my decision to support nafta i have carefully considered the views of my constituents labor business environmentaliste human rights activists and those of the president and his administration on the 000nomic opportunities and risks that nafta presonts i an convinced the united states stand to gain with the passage of nafta mexico is already our tid largest taing partner in fact mexico wid canada together account for onefourth of a united states trade with a population of mor than 80 million mexico buys 70 percent of its iport3 from the united states since mexico began lowering its trade barriers in 1988 amorcan exports have more than tripled creating hundreds of thousands of american jobs the fact is that exports are our largest job creator and are likely to remain th key to americas continued economic growth the united states cannot ignore the kpotance of the mexican market for american goods nafta will create the worids largest free trade zone with over 370 million customers end 6 4 trillion n annual proucion as mxdcos tariff walls come down wtich we must remember are generally two to ee 1imes higher man thoe of the united states exports wil increase and jobs will be created in the long n nafta will enable mexcos using population to become a fastgrowing market for unitedstates goods and wil provide te economic incentim for its citizens tochoose to remain in mexico i understand that all of these statistics must be put in the proper contextthe fact is that mexicos economic importance and thus its impact has been exaggerated by both sides its size is only about 5 percent of the unitedstates second trade barriers between the united states and mexico are already relatively low what are we doing here today with this agreement is basically concluding a process of trade liberalization that began almost a decade ago third unitedstates employment statistics routinely fluctuate up and down by 200 000 on a monthly basis this need to be kept in mind when we look at the figures put forward by both opponents and proponents on projected job losses and gains this in no way dismisses the jobs issue i am merely setting forward the reality in which the issues are being framed clearly the labor community feels passionately about this issue during the past 12 years the federal government has essentially ignored the devastating impact of global competition on americas workers and communities therefore it is essential that we remain vigilant in examining and respending to the job effects of any trade agreement we must have retraining programs available and with respect to nafta we must be prepared to invoke those provisions of the agreement that provide for remedies if there should be extraordinary impacts on particular sectors or by the agreement as a whole we must put forward an economic strategy that both expands trade opportunities and offers new sources of opportunity and security for american workers however the global economy is reality that we cannot make go away a reality that a defeat of nafta will not change the daily shifts we are experiencing as a nation regarding job losses and creation will go on and must be dealt with as they occur regardless of what happens to nafta our responsibility is to work to ensure the overall growth of our economy a rising standard of living for our people and increased employment opportunities i view my support for nafta as a vote of confidence in americas future in a world in which no nation can close its doors and expect to prosper or grow and in which no nation can be expected to open its doors without demanding that such a move be reciprocated i have concluded that if nafta passes first the people of the united states stand to gain second americas credibility as a negotiator as a world leader and as a trading partner will be enhanced third american businesses and workers will profit from a market not just in mexico but eventually throughout latin america fourth american competitiveness will be strengthened visavis japan and the european common market and fifth and we will send a positive message that the united states is committed to working together to develop strong economic and political tieswith our closest neighbors ultimately i think nafta is about more than tariffs and trade it is about americas capacity for leadership its ability to compete in the new global economic order and its willingness to support the growth of economic reform and political freedoms abroad if we defeat nafta today we will first squander a unique opportunity to forge a new economic and political partnership with the reformers throughout latin america a partnership based on respect and shared opportunity second appease the forces of nationalism and antiamericanism in the western hemisphere third betray americas tradition of championing open markets and fourth tell our allies with whom we are negotiating gatt that the united states only supports free trade when it can insulate itself from the forces of international economic competition to defeat nafta is to believe that american businesses and workers can not compete and to encourage those waiting on the sidelines japan and europe to take our place and to run from challenge and opportunity when we know we can triumph and prosper in 1962 our 35th president john f kennedy was promoting passage of the trade expansion act and stated that protectionism reflects a national lack of confidence and growth i believe that americans fully understand that we live in a world in which doors can not be shut to isolate us from the vagaries of competition i also believe that americans are willing to keep those doors open as long as our neighbors do not shut theirs finally i believe that americans support policies that widen opportunities for american workers and businesses as long as we are prepared to assist those who may get hurt in the process for months the people of america and its representatives have struggled with the challenge of nafta is it good or is it bad will it create jobs or take jobs will it help to expand our economy or will it shrink it as of yesterday america was evenly divided this division is in the context of the loss of american manufacturing jobs and market share to foreign competitors and in the context of the conflict between fear and hope pessimism and confidence today the house must decide and that decision will involve risk i have concluded that it is a risk worth taking and i believe that america can and will meet the challenge posed by open competition change is never easy and rarely without risk and there is very often the fear of failure americas greatness has never been rooted in fear but rather it has been based on the willingness of americans to adapt to compete and to prevail as we make this decision let me urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who will vote for nafta that we pledge not to forget nor forsake those who are presently being visited by the pain of change in this global economy i believe support of this nafta is in the best interest of americas economic future of the political social and economic vitality and vibrance of this hemisphere and of the political and economic relations of america with the rest of the world john kennedy in his inaugural address asked can we forge against these enemies of tyranny poverty disease and war itself a grand and global alliance north and south east and west that can assure a more fruitful life for all mankind and then he asked his fellow americans will you join in that historic effort such a

time the test of any trade agreements success must be that it produces economic growth and jobs for american workers when the uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations broke off last winter the former administration the congress and virtually all unitedstates business came to the unanimous conclusioh that negotiations had failed to produce agreement that could pass this basic test furthermore by establishing generally weaker international standards for food safety and other issues concerns have been raised that the current text of the agreement makes it possible for other countries to challenge unitedstates health safety environmental and labor standards for the past 3 years the subcommittee on commerce consumer protection and competitiveness which i chair has held hearings looking at the ability of the united states to maintain and enforce strong environmental and food safety standards under trade agreements being negotiated last year the subcommittee took a resolution to the floor which stated that congress would not implement a trade agreement that compromises our countrys healtjh safety environmental and labor laws that resolution was passed unanimously by the full house of representatives our negotiators must make sure that any final agreement in no way qualifies the ability of the united states to establish and enforce standards it deems appropriate to protect the public interest by providing the president with authority to enter into trade agreements to conclude the uruguay round and by extending fast track approval procedures h r 1876 gives the united states a new opportunity to reach a successful agreement in the uruguay round of talks under the general agreements on tariffs and trade all american workers and businessthat is producers of manufactured products services and agricultural goodsmust have access to foreign markets to survive in todays world economy total world trade which reached 3 4 trillion in 1991 and grew by more than 60 percent since 1986 is clearly the worlds primary generator of economic growth since 1947 seven rounds of gatt negotiations have brought about huge reductions in tariffs on industrial products and have made a major contribution to the expansion of world trade but estimates are that about onethird of total world trade occurs totally outside the gatt framework of trade rules the uruguay round was begun in 1986 largely in an effort to develop rules that would promote trade in areas that currently are not dealt with on a comprehensive basis by gatt such as services and agricultural goods while this is certainly a desirable goal it is important to remember that an agreement that hurts unitedstates producers of manufactured goods is not an acceptable price to pay for success in services and agriculture for example the unitedstates must avoid major concessions that threaten whole unitedstates industries like textiles and apparel manufactured products accounted for 82 percent of our total merchandise exports in 1992 while agricultural goods accounted for only 10 percent if the united states were to get everything it wants in agriculture and our services trade surplus were to increase 10 per cent there would only be about a 6 billion improvement in the overall unitedstates trade balance unfortunately many of our gatt partners have tried to use the uruguay round to make changes that hurt not help unitedstates manufacturing for example it is generally recognized that gatt dispute settlement procedures need to be clarified and strengthened our trading partners have tried to use the uruguay round primarily to impose new restrictions to prevent the united states from using its unilateral authority under section 301 to retaliate against foreign unfair trade practices limitations on our ability to use 301 authority is too high a price to pay for improvements in gatt dispute settlement similarly unitedstates efforts to reduce world subsidies and to prevent dumping have been distorted by countries that only want to legitimize subsidies they now extend to their industries and to make it more difficult for the unitedstates to use its only defense against unfair subsidies our countervailing duty law the burden of proof must be on foreign concerns to prove that subsidies are not trade distorting and we should not agree to any change that would force unitedstates firms to meet higher standards of proof in their trade complaints under our countervailing duty laws in addition estimates are that violations of unitedstates intellectual property rights copyrights trademarks and patents has cost unitedstates manufacturers about 14 billion in trade despite this fact the united states and the european community have not agreed on what should be included in an agreement covering intellectual property it is clear that whatever is agreed to on intellectual property will not provide for effective worldwide enforcement as a result it will be very important that the final agreement coming out of the uruguay round not prevent the united states from using authority like that under section 337 of the tariff act which restricts the sale of imports that infringe on unitedstates intellectual property rights it will also be important to retain our ability to use special 301 authority that allows the unitedstates trade representative to retaliate against countries that violate unitedstates intellectual property rights these are a few of the areas that still need to be addressed in the final stages of the uruguay round negotiations our negotiators must keep in mind that an agreement that hurts unitedstates manufacturing is not acceptable by giving the president authority contained in h r 1876 our negotiators have another opportunity to complete the uruguay round in a way that benefits american workers and business including americas manufacturing industries 01250"], [0.022934675216674805,

diego our second biggest county and los angeles our biggest and spend 3 hours going to court and 4 and 5 hours driving home orange county is entitled to a modern courthouse it has come downand i will submit this for the record5 times already we are now into the bone of the seismographic building to withstand an earthquake so i repeat with great pause i wifl have to voteagalnst this amendment i rise today in opposition to the amendment by the gentleman from oklahoma that would cut funding for construction of the ronald reagan courthouse the ronald reagan courthouse in santa ana california has already experienced more than its share of cuts indeed if every courthouse project in the country were scrutinized and held to the same standards as the ronald reagan courthouse the budget would be in much better shape let me recite a few facts orange countys population is greater than the states of mississippi kansas and arkansas and 16 others and is rapidly approaching passing the population of oklahoma look out oregon here we come so orange county right now is more populous than 19 states currently the federal court system inorange county has just three permanent courtrooms and three temporary courtrooms which are in modular structures the longrange need of the courthouse however is for 29 courtrooms so the current facilities which are spread throughout santa aria are obviously grossly inadequate but get this even upon completion of the ronald reagan courthouse there will still not be adequate space but as we consider this further cut to the ronald reagan courthouse let me remind my colleagues that the project has already been cut substantially by onethird it started out as a 168 million project it was then subjected to uts of 10 percent and then 2 percent after those cuts it was subjected to the timeoutandreview process which recommended an additional 125 million cut eventually after all this we arrived at the 123 million figure in the committee bill the cuts have resulted in substantive changes to the courthouses design an entire floor has been chopped off and most of the parking has been lost these are not luxuries that are being cut we have looked long and hard at the expenses and we have cut them in my mind beyond the bone i believe that although past cuts may well have been justified this additional cut attacks the substance of the project furthermore consider that the citizens of santa ana a working class city in the center of my district support the project so much that they have donated the land for the courthouse their donation has saved the federal government 4 5 million and with all due respect to my friend from oklahoma construction costs in southern california cannot be compared to construction costs in tulsa orange county has one of the most expensive real estate markets in the country especially when you add in the increased expenses stemming from seismic requirements anybody who has been to southern californla knows what i am talking about again it is simply ridiculous to think that you can build in southern california for the same price you can build in oklahoma lastly if this cut

the chair well knows the gentleman from new york is one of our most articulate and effective spokesmen for his party positions he certainly has done well this morning and i feel constrained to respond in some degree so i would just like to clear the record a bit as to the reductions that are contained in this bill first of all this bill is 14 percent below the amount requested of us in the budget submitted to us by the president that is something in the neighborhood of s300 million below what we were asked to spend in order to provide for the funds that were identified as necessary by the various elements of the legislative branch i want to point out that of course 40 percent of this bill does not relate directly to congress it simply funds agencies that happen to be historically placed by the founding fathers in this branch of government of course this bill is below the base line that is the standard by which most bills re evaluated but in this case we look at something far more rigid and reflective of what will actually be spent the base line however is cut by 100 million something in the neighborhood of 5 3 percent the bill however is most effectively judged by what it cuts in terms of outlays money actually spent over what was spent last year this bill is a 6 4 percent reduction in actual spending below that which was spent in the 1993 fiscal year bill that is a very very tough reduction and when added to what we took last year we are now talking about reducing in 2 fiscal years something in the neighborhood of 13 percent well on the way to a 25percent reduction which ts what i think members of this institution have given this committee and our leaders an opportunity to accomplish certainly we know the legislative branch has to set an example has to be more stringent in its funding than any of the other bills later on i will be indicating how our budget stacked up over time with those of the executive branch with those of the office of the president and other institutions that we need to look at but i think we have been successful in achieving these results in part because of a franking reform that we put in place congressman frenzel a former member a republican and myself offered legislation a few years ago which truly has had an impact on spending on the frank this bill reflects further savings coming to a 167 million total over 4 year6 a reduction in what would have been the anticipated expenditures for the frank that is a 50percent reduction in mail costs over 4 years i think it is something of which we can all be proud i think it indicates that we have heard the concerns of the american people and i think it does show that this institution is on a path to reduction over time in a humane and thoughtful way for example you will hear more later on when the bill is brought to the floor about the provision for early retirement incentive which will have the effect of reducing the number of people employed in our branch
