on behalf of the 37memberstrong fiscally conservative democratic blue dog coalition as you walk the halls of congress as you walk the halls of the cannon house office building the longworth house office building and the rayburn house office building it is easy to spot an office that belongs to one of the 37 members of the fiscally conservative democratic blue dog coalition because you will find this poster as a welcome mat by each door of a blue dog member as you can see today the unitedstates national debt is 8 419 147 820 878 and some change your share of the national debt that is every living man woman and child including the children born today every american citizens share of the national debt is 28 134 as members of the blue dog coalition it is what we call the debt tax debt and that is one tax that cannot go away until this republican congress and this administration gets our nations fiscal house in order last week the president made a big announcement about how the deficit really was not as bad as what his white house had first thought and reported it would be i think the best way to sum up the events of last week can be found in an editorial july 11 2006 from the los angeles times entitled another mission accomplished and i will not read the entire editorial but i think it sets the stage for what we plan the spend the next hour discussing this evening it starts off like this the release of the white house midsession budget review is an annual event normally marked by a few wonkish observations and the routine updating of various spreadsheets not by a fulldressed presidential dogandpony show but president bush plans to preside today with members of congress and invited guests in attendance by all indications including his own in his weekly radio address last saturday he plans to turn this into a celebration just in time for the fall campaign the editorial from the los angeles times dated july 11 2006 continues this is proof if anyone still needs it that this administration is desperate for something to boast about on mr bushs watch tripledigit budget surpluses have turned into annual tripledigit budget deficits there is no information in the midsession report to alter that utterly dispiriting fact yes the report is expected to project that this years deficit will be somewhat less gargantuan than last years probably somewhere between 280 and 300 billion versus a 318 billion shortfall in 2005 and it concludes that part of the editorial by saying that is not much to crow about well they are right last week the administration released its midsession review of the budget and after further examination lets take a closer look at what the report actually tells us the report actually tells us that what we have here is another record deficit the administrations updated estimate of 296 billion deficit makes 2006 one of the four largest deficits in our nations history it is hard now to believe that we had a balanced budget in this country from 1998 to 2001 but it did not take this administration and this republicanled congress very long to turn fiscal responsibility into record deficits i 2000 as you can see the largest deficit ever in our nations history occurred in 2004 when the republicans controlled the white house the house and the senate it was 413 billion in red ink in hot checks if you will the year 2003 was the second largest deficit ever in our nations history where for the first time in over 50 years the republicans controlled the white house the house and senate and they gave us the second largest deficit ever in our nations history 378 billion the third largest record deficit ever in our nations history again occurred while the republicans controlled the white house the house and the senate it was in 2005 and it was 318 billion deficit the third largest deficit ever in our nations history then this year the president has a press conference has a grand ceremony and event to announce that the deficit for fiscal year 2006 is only 296 billion the fourth largest deficit ever in our nations history i think the editorial in the los angeles times had it right when it said that is not much to crow about the administrations updated estimate of 296 billion deficit as i indicated makes 2006 the fourth largest deficit ever in our nations history while this number represents an improvement over the 2005 deficit of 318 billion it still ranks as the fourthlargest deficit ever in our nations history these revised estimates do not account for the extent of our budget problems because they include in the calculation the annual surpluses in social security the first bill i filed as a member of congress when i got here in 2001 was a bill to tell the politicians in washington to keep their hands off the social security trust fund this republican congress refused to give me a hearing or a vote on that bill and now we know why because they are raiding the social security trust fund to fund tax cuts for those earning over 400 000 a year they are raiding the social security trust fund to fund this outofcontrol deficit this outofcontrol debt this reckless spending that we are seeing occurring in our nations capital and the way the republican leadership is running our government and thiscountry in fact when the social security surplus is excluded as it should be the 2006 deficit is not 296 billion it is 473 billion now throughout the evening we are going to be talking more about this including projected surpluses and how they became huge deficits i will talk more about that

about things that are important to this majority are important indeed to the american people and that is what we are going to do during this hour we are going to talk about the medicare part d prescription drug benefit but i want to digress for just a minute our colleagues on the other side of the aisle just spent the better part of an hour talking about the budget during the course of that colloquy we heard the word hypocrisy used a number of times i want to address this just for a moment because the hypocrisy of course is to suggest that the tax cuts that this administration and this republican majority have enacted and just today continued those tax cuts refused to let the other side of the aisle in this body raise taxes on the american people they spent a good deal of time talking about the fact that the rich get the biggest tax break well the hypocrisy of that argument is that the rich if you call someone with an adjusted gross income of 75 000 a year rich then so be it but these are the people that are paying most of the taxes these are the people that are paying at the 39 6 marginal rate the highest rate so for them in any acrosstheboard tax cut and indeed that is exactly what this is every taxpayer saves money but those that are paying the most in taxes with an acrosstheboard cut are quite naturally on a dollar amount not a percentage amount but on a dollar amount are going to get the biggest tax break of course they are but what is that enabling them to do the small business men and women in this country who create probably 75 percent of the jobs it is to grow their businesses because of the opportunity to rapidly depreciate for capital improvements and bricks and mortar and putting in a new product line in their business to hire some of these people who today because of their unemployment are not paying any taxes it is really hard i think and i think my colleagues understand this the american people understand it it is really pretty hard to get a tax refund when you are not paying any taxes but indeed we do that too the child tax credit increasing them from 600 to 1 000 those are refundable tax credits that are going to people who indeed are not paying any taxes again as i said at the outset what we are talking about tonight has got to be one of the most important things that we have done for the american people since medicare was first passed when i was a freshman medical student in 1965 where there was a part a the hospital part a part b the doctor part but no part d the drug part for many years i am going to say probably within 5 years of the passage of that bill people were starting to wonder why we didnt have that benefit of prescription drugs when more and more of these wonder drugs whether we are talking about pharmaceuticals or antibiotics or whether we are talking about beta blockers for heart disease and high blood pressure and irregular heart rhythms whether we are talking about oral bymouth chemotherapy and we realized of course it wasnt just surgery cutting something out a diseased organ that we really need to put our emphasis on it is preventive health care and allowing people to be able to afford to get prescription drugs to lower the blood sugar to prevent the ravages of diabetes such as losing your limb or having your kidneys fail and going on renal dialysis and maybe eventually needing a kidney transplant or to treat high blood pressure a condition which for a long time has no symptoms absolutely no symptoms it is incipient we use that word a person could end up in the emergency room having already had a stroke before anybody knew that they had high blood pressure or talk about coronary artery disease which most people have in adult life and until we realized that elevated cholesterol and certain type lipids in the blood stream is what caused those plaques to form in those coronary arteries that supply blood and oxygen of course to the heart muscle when we finally realized that if we could lower cholesterol and lipids in the body that we could prevent heart disease coronary artery disease heart attacks and not have to resort to what we know of course today as bypass surgery it is such a compassionate thing to prevent these diseases rather than to treat them when people are really really in danger of sudden death or a stroke that is what this is all about that is what this republican leadership president bush has delivered to the american people a promise that other congresses have made i can assure you that work was done on this in the past but former presidents former administrations former congresses just failed to deliver and so we are very proud to stand here tonight and talk about this wonderful addition tomedicare the part d prescription drug part it is optional it is just like part b a person doesnt have to sign up for it yes it is premium based there is a monthly premium often deducted from the social security check of those who can afford it and those who cannot afford it it is not going to cost them anything the lowincome seniors who qualify for the medicare supplement on this wonderful program for them they pay no deductible they pay no monthly premium there is no gap in the coverage they have catastrophic coverage and the only cost may be 1 for a months supply of a generic drug or up to 5 for a months supply of a brand name drug there are approximately 42 7 current medicare beneficiaries in this country today and mr speaker and my colleagues i want to draw your attention to my first slide because this really shows you the success that we have had in this 6month opportunity starting november 15 through upcoming in 6 days may 15 of those almost 43 million medicare beneficiaries most of them because of age 65 possibly 5 or 6 million because of a disability at a younger agelook at this mr speaker37 million seniors now have prescription drug coverage under medicare part d 37 million now we want to get this up to 40 million in the next 6 days and that is really why i am here tonight to get this message out to let those few stragglers if you will in regard to signing up to do everything we can and we will do that back in our districts we have been doing it in fact i have been working on that talking about trying to get that message out for over 2 years when we first passed this medicare modernization prescription drug act in november of 2003 a very proud moment for this physicianmember by the way to support such a wonderful program but now we have got the latest count 37 million and that is i think a fantastic achievement in this first sign p period why is it so important well seniors if you can see on this next slide my colleagues seniors ate saving an average of 1 100 a year with medicare prescription drug coverage maybe more importantly though that is average for the 37 million that are signed up but maybe more importantly the lowincome seniors are saving an average of 3 700 a year 3 700 a year that is a lot of money in regard to that number that i just shared with my colleagues 3 700 a year for those lowincome seniors and that is why we are pushing so hard in these next 6 days of the 6 million i said 37 million have signed up out of almost 43 million of those 6 million that havent we are estimating pretty accurately that close to 3 million of those are low income they qualify for this subsidy and some of them as i say their only cost of these lifesaving prescriptions would be a 1 copay and so it is veryimportant most important that we get the word out to them in these next few days and to get them signed up because this is literally a godsend it is a nobrainer and for whatever reason maybe they have heard some of the disingenuous well downright you know they talked about the h word in their hour just a few minutes ago hypocrisy from the other side regrettably i feel that that is part of the reason why the most needy 3 million of them have missed the opportunity thus far but we are determined to get the word out to them that is the compassioriate thing to do and we are doing it proof of the pudding more than a million seniors have enrolled in medicare part d just since april i am talking about a 2week period so we are talking about almost 500 000 people have signed up just in the last 21 2 weeks so we are getting the word out and thank god our seniors are responding well how is the program working for those that may have signed up on november 15 2005 and immediately january 1 2006 started getting their prescriptions with a prescription drug benefit before that of course we know that the seniors probably the only group of patients that go to the drug store went to the drug store and had to pay sticker price they werent getting any deals and nobody negotiated any discount for them because of volume buying it was just like going to buy a new automobile and paying that price on the windshield that we refer to as sticker price most people dont have to do that but that is what the seniors were doing well really that is what some were doing a lot were just too embarrassed to even go into the drug store knowing that they couldnt afford to pay even half that amount but what has happened since january 1 over this 5month period well 90 and i want to call my colleagues attention to this next slide i know the printing is a little small but look closely because these numbers are very telling ninetyone percent of seniors say their plan is convenient to use at their pharmacy and i want to thank our pharmacists too by the way especially our independent pharmacists because a lot of times it is just them and maybe a clerk up front and yet they are spending the time to explain and i know it is at significant cost to their bottom line and i think that they are to be commended because they have helped make this program a success and we are committed to continuing to work with them i know in my district i have met just within the last 10 days with some good personal friends who are independent pharmacists and they are bringing some concerns to us there is still some heartburn on their part and i understand that and we are going to continue to work with them because of the great work that they have done for us going back to the slide 90 percent say that they know how their plan works and they know how to use it eightyfive percent say their ilan covers all the medicines they need and nearly 80 percent are happy with the amount of coverage they have and this is so important they would recommend their plan to others i dont want to miss this opportunity to say my colleagues and i am sure on both sides of the aisle you have had similar experiences my mom god bless my mom i am thinking about her of course a lot this week because of mothers day coming up on sunday but the greatest mothers day gift that i gave to her mom is 88years old i dont think she would mind me telling that because she looks like she is 68 and if it wasnt for a couple of gimpy knees she would still be out on the golf course but i sat down with mom a couple of months ago and we went through this it was a little bit time consuming maybe a little bit more confusing than i thought or she thought it would be but she is saving about 1 200 a year now and this is what we are talking about real real savings moms very happy with the program she picked her own drug store very close by her home in aiken south carolina and she didnthave to change a thing and is very pleased with the program listen to what some of the senior organizations are saying about this program today and i remember during the debate and of course we got accused of passing this bill in the dark of night i would say to my colleagues in regard to that we started the debate late in the afternoon and we were determined to get our work done so we ended up on final passage yes in the dark of night but had we started our debate in the dark of night we would have passed this bill in the bright sunshine of the afternoon that is just the way the clock works i look at my job as a 24 7 job and i am not a clockwatcher just like i wasnt when i practiced medicine and delivered babies before coming to this body people were always coming to me saying dont all babies come in the middle of the night and i said well no but it seems that way because the patient either comes in in the middle of the night and ends up delivering in the daytime or comes in in the daytime and ends up delivering in the middle of the night we delivered this baby in the middle of the night but a beautiful beautiful baby it was and is and the other side criticized that great senior organization known as the aarp of which i have been a member for started at age 50 i wont tell you how many years i dont want to tell my age because my wife says that will tell her age but they were so mad so mad that this organization aarp with 37 million seniors as part of that group had the audacity to support a republican bill look what the aarp says today with the medicare drug program more older americans than ever before have access to affordable prescription drugs the focus right now needs to be on helping people not playing politics discouraging enrollment is a disservice to the millions who could be saving money on prescription drug bills thats a quote from the president and ceo of the aarp bill novelli and i know mr novelli and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle know him and know that he doesnt play politics he is just stating the facts no hypocrisy here well i am not a regular reader of the new york times maybe the washington times the new york times is not known as a bastion of conservatism but listen to what they say the medicare drug benefits success depends heavily on getting lots of healthy people to sign up so that their premium s can help subsidize medicine for the chronically ill the may 15 deadline should serve as a useful product to force fencesitters to make a decision now that is a new york times editorial april 3 2006 when we were debating we had this resolution nancy johnson the distinguished chairwoman of the health subcommittee of ways and means put forward a resolution this evening encouraging all members of this body to work hard over this next week to get people signed up but the other side continues to try to put up a fence to be obstructionist to say you know dont sign up and criticizing us for encouraging them to sign up saying that we are cruel that we are going to enact a penalty if they dont well the fact is a lot of people good people good seniors are just like this senior they have a tendency to procrastinate l 2245 if it was not for the april 15 deadline i would never get my tax return in even with that if there is an opportunity to extend it without significant penalty i am going to take that opportunity i have done that probably every year for the last 10 or so waiting until absolutely until the last minute when really i had the facts i had the information and i needed to go ahead and get that done but i just kind of put it off until the last minute that is why we have a deadline it is not to be cruel or to be coercing or forcing anybody to do anything but clearly we anticipate that because of that deadline and kind of a wakeup call to people that 1 6 million more will sign up between now and next monday that is what that is all about the new york times certainly understands that i cant understand why our colleagues on the other side of the aisle who probably most of whom read that newspaper every day it is kind of maybe sort of biblical for them they cant understand that or maybe they missed that particular article listen to what the st petersburg times said here is good news without exception every senior i saw on the way out of the gulfport senior center that is in st petersburg was happy or relieved carolyn toliver dallas texas area on aging carolyn toliver the benefits counseling coordinator at the dallas area agency on aging says she is not phased by the prospect of a lastminute surge she even admits to wishing for one i hope we are overrun she said this is a generous benefit i dont want anyone to miss out on it here again from the new york times editorial pages it says many seniors are clearly saving money on drugs purchases i quote complaints and call waiting times are diminishing and many previously uninsured patients are clearly saving money on drug purchases that was in the new york times an article entitled medicare drug challenges it was an editorial actually on april 3rd of this year the news indeed is good despite again a lot of negativism on the other side there were a number of things that were suggested when the opposition for this program was so strong but today as i pointed out at the outset 37 million have signed up listen to this breakdown because this is important too 8 9 million enrolled in the standalone prescription drug plan almost 9 million 5 9 million are enrolled some medicare advantage that is the program that used to be medicare choice but because of medicare modernization it is much much improved almost 6 million of the socalled dual eligibles those people that because of their lowincome and age were eligible not only for medicare but medicaid almost 7 million retirees are enrolled in a medicare retiree subsidy that is a supplemental plan that includes prescription drug coverage there are still people that had the option and i think is real important for us to remember that nobody is forced into medicare part d if they have got something that is just as good if not better then we have encouraged them to stay in those programs they are then of course there are 3 5 million that are covered under federal retiree coverage 1 9 million are could have had under tricare 1 6 million are covered through the federal employee health benefit plan and then 5 8 million medicare beneficiaries have some alternative source of what we referred to as credible prescription drug cov erage some examples of that would be like veterans affairs people are getting their medication they are 65 they are on medicare they are eligible part a and part b but as far as the prescription drug part they are utilizing the veterans administration"],

technologies there is a certain irony that while this amendment comes to the floor of the house now the president is addressing the nation about the iraq war right now a war in the middle of an oilproducing region that the world is largely dependent upon to sustain its economy the instability of that region in and of itself ought to point out the need to use the exportimport bank to encourage the development not of the fossil fuel energy sources but renewable energy sources and energy efficiency standards so our amendment would simply say that we have to use at least 5 percent of our energy products in renewable energy projects so we do not have to remain dependent on fossil fuel a couple of things that have happened to indicate the wisdom of this in the last couple of weeks oil has topped 60 a barrel and since dinosaurs went to die in the mid east that is where the oil is we have to break our dependence on oil internationally from any source secondly we have seen the effort by the chinese governmentowned oil company to buy a domestic united states producer as a precursor a predecessor of future disputes over this resource that we are now largely dependent on we need to break our addiction to oil we need to get serious about renewable energy and the third fact that has happened in the last several weeks is that we have learned that the debate abbut global warming is over debating whether or not global warming is occurring in large part or significant part during human activity is like now debating gravity and just two facts that i hope that some

because tourists say they want to see alaska before it melts we are now seeing with our own eyes the symptoms of global warming across our hemisphere we need to do something about it 2030 the science behind that this is not just anecdotal i would ask anyone when they think about energy sources to consider the fact that carbon dioxide now is at levels that we have never seen before in the history of the planet i refer you to a chart which shows the changes in c02 levels and temperature levels that have occurred on the globe over the last several thousand years this chart basically shows that while there have been changes in the last several hundred thousand years we have never seen spikes of carbon dioxide the major global warming gas like we have now here is the present we show that our carbon dioxide levels over 376 000 parts per million are the highest ever in global history since we have been able to ascertain even looking at the trapped air bubbles at historical levels thousands of feet down in the glaciers what we see is the prediction that if this nation and the world does not become serious about renewable and clean energy those levels will spike to unprecedented levels up to 980 000 parts per million by 2100 in the next century we will have carbon dioxide levels by 2100 three times higher than they have ever been in the history of the world at least for several hundred thousand years we have to get serious about this issue our amendment would be one small step i would like to pass it tonight we will not because a point of order has been raised against it but i hope

assistance programs and domestic homeland security priorit ies however this legislation also includes an insidious section with provisions of h r 418 the real id act which has nothing to do with what should be the real intent of this emergency supplemental instead of being united on issues of national security and international relations we are put in a divisive situation with the provisions of the real id act the issues of importance addressed by this emergency supplemental do not give rise to a need to include provisions from h r 418 the real id actlegislation for which congress has not held a legislative hearing markup nor full debate in the house just last year our colleagues on the other side of the aisle attempted to force these provisions in the context of the 9 11 intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act h r 10 the sponsor of the real id acts drivers license provisions would have gone far beyond the scope of the 9 11 commission recommendations the 9 11 commission did not suggest that the standards should be federally mandated without state participation that a database should be created to share personal identification information that undocumented immigrants should be prevented from getting licenses or that noncitizens should get an identifiably different drivers license finally none of the real id act sponsors provisions have been reviewed by the congress or the commission there have been no hearings or debates on these significant changes to existing law the immigration provisions that have been forced into this supplemental include numerous provisions restricting the grant of asylum protection imposing onerous new drivers license requirements on the states making it easier to deport legal immi grants waiving all federal laws concerning the construction of fences and barriers anywhere within the united states and denying immigrants longstanding habeas corpus rights the usa patriot act for which we in the subcommittee on crime terrorism and homeland security of the judiciary are only now holding hearings in piecemeal form already barred terrorists from receiving asylum protection in the united states none of the people associated with recent attacks or plans for terrorist attacks in the unitedstates were here under grants of asylum instead these changes will make it harder for people legitimately fleeing persecution to prove their asylum claims and gain protection here bona fide refugees who cannot meet the higher standards will be returned to countries where they were persecuted possibly to face terror torture and death the forced provisions will set a dangerous legal precedent by requiring the government to waive all federal state and local laws to build barriers and fences to deter illegal entry into the united states this waiver would require violating laws that protect sacred native american burial sites important environmental regions and the wages of laborers yet this policy is unnecessary in the 911 act we passed language to develop and implement a comprehensive plan for the systematic surveillance of the southwest border by remotely piloted aircraft and other electronic means we can preserve our legal rights and regimes and still secure our nation the great majority of this emergency supplemental a sum of 75 9 billion goes towards unitedstates military operations in iraq and afghanistan in this conference reports military spending total of 75 9 billion includes 37 1 billion for military operations and maintenance spending 17 4 billion for personnel and 17 4 billion for new weapons procurement i am very pleased to say that this conference report increases the military death gratuity to 100 000 from 12 420 and increases subsidized life insurance benefits to 400 000 from 250 000 for families of soldiers who died or were killed while on active duty beginning from oct 7 2001 i can not describe how fundamental it is that we take care of our armed forces and their loved ones this conference report addresses some of the concerns that democrats have had about the fact that the families of soldiers who were killed while on active duty were not being given the necessary funds to provide for themselves in addition this conference report provides 308 million more than requested for addon vehicle armor kits large increases for new trucks added funds for nightvision equipment and 60 million in unrequested funds for radio jammers to disrupt attempts by iraqi insurgents to explode remotecontrol bombs and mines as with the increase in death benefits democrats in this body have been advocating for increased funds to provide the necessary armor and equipment to protect our troops while i am supportive of our troops and their families i am disappointed that this war continues with no end in sight how long will it be before our brave men and women of the armed forces can come home and embrace their families this is the question democrats have been asking for months and we still dont have a real answer again while i support funding our soldiers and their families to ensure that their safety and financial needs are met i am deeply disappointed that we still do not have a proper exit strategy in iraq as i stated there are many provisions of this emergency supplemental in which this body can be united in agreement one such issue is the tsunami relief provided in this emergency supplemental the conference report before us today appropriates 907 million in direct assistance for tsunami disaster relief for countries affected by the dec 26 2004 earthquake and tsunami in addition this measure also provides 226 million to reimburse the unitedstates military for expenses incurred in providing emergency relief to the tsunami victims and 25 million to build and deploy 35 new tsunamidetection buoys in the pacific atlantic the caribbean and the gulf of mexico to provide warning to communities of approaching tsunamis i had the opportunity to see the damage caused by the tsunami when i visited sri lanka with my colleagues led by mr crowley shortly after the tsunami disaster i had the opportunity to visit with usaid personnel who were there trying to aid the sri lankan people in rebuilding their nation i have to say the attitude of our american personel and the smiles they brought to the face of the sri lankan people would make every member of this congress very proud we talk about public diplomacy with the international world and i firmly believe that the funds appropriated here along with the work of our personnel on the ground help make a great case for the goodness of our nation i am also similarly pleased that about 400 million in this conference report will go towards humanitarian assistance in darfur sudan i recently had the opportunity to visit refugee camps in neighboring chad where thousands of sudanese in darfur have fled to escape the conflict needless to say i was able to confirm from eyewitness accounts that the conflict in darfur is indeed even more shocking and deeply disturbing in its viciousness than has been reported to us we as a nation must stand against such brutality and the funds in this emergency supplemental will help to ease the suffering of those involved in this conflict in addition this conference report includes 920 million for all peacekeeping programs many of which are in sudan however while i have always been a strong advocate for peacekeeping operations i am disappointed that the total money appropriated is 70 million less than the presidents request we must continue to support such operations because the alternative can only be to the detriment of the international community including our own nation again i am in general support of the goals proposed by h r 1268 but i am troubled by the implications of the supplemental appropriations measure that this body is poised to pass that relate to immigration policy the underlying legislation proposes to fund important needs that pertain to operation iraqi freedom operation enduring freedom in afghanistan army and marine corps restructuring recapitalization and replacement of equipment and replenishment of cash balances in certain working capital funds in truth this emergency supplemental funds many needed priorities but it is the one issue of the real id act which is not a priority that poisons this legislation"],

country byrne funds are the primary source of funds for drug task forces and are critical in combating methamphetamine abuse congress restored 410 million of byrne funds but this is way short of the 1 1 billion of authorized spending that was allowed the state of texas was forced to eliminate drug task forces and other states are now considering doing so the presidents 2007 budget proposal again eliminates byrne funds unless congress restores these funds at an adequate level we will lose the drug task forces in nearly all of our states this is our most effective means of combating methamphetamine abuse for every 1 that we spend on education and prevention we get 9 at the back end and save costs on imprisonment crime and all the things that are attendant to methamphetamine abuse

yielding me this time i rise today in strong support of h res 379 and the underlying bill h r 525 the small business health fairness act of 2005 my good friend the gentleman from new jersey just spoke about some mandates regarding ob care and of course there are mandates that have been passed in the several states all 50 in fact that are very compassionate sounding the gentleman from new jersey is right many of us have as former members of state legislatures voted for mandates i am one of them in fact in the state of georgia there was a mandate because of managed care intrusion and the requirement that everybody go through a gatekeeper and not to a specialist that women in the state of georgia if any health insurance policy was written they would have direct access to their obgyn certainly as an obgyn specialist i liked that mandate in fact i think i voted for that one but shortly after that along came the dermatologists and they wanted direct access to everybody who had an itch to have to be able to go demand to be seen by a specialist a dermatologist rather than their family practitioner i want to tell you about a couple of other mandates in the state of georgia there was one to require that every woman would have the right to have a blood test to be screened for ovarian cancer it is called cea125 any cancer specialist would tell you that that screening test for ovarian cancer is absolutely worthless a better mandate would have been to say that anybody over age 30 any woman could have an ultrasound done every 6 months to look at the ovaries but that would be astronomically expensive another mandate in the state of georgia says that every baby born in a hospital in the state of georgia has to be screened for sickle cell anemia even when they are a part of an ethnic group where the percesitage of sickle cell anemia is zero nada these mandates just go and on and you have got them in all 50 states clearly we need to do something about that because they are driving up the cost of health care we need to give people the opportunity to join their other employees in trade associations this is a good bill it will reduce the rolls of the uninsured by 8 million people i commend it to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle i urge you to support this rule and pass the sam johnson legislation it is a good bill it will get people the protection they need and provide health care for so many who do not have it"], [0.004030376672744751, 0.49596962332725525, 0, "i thank the gentleman from california for yielding me this time i thank him for his hard work on this conference report as many in this chamber know this conference report contains the provisions of the real id act which i offered and the house overwhelmingly approved earlier this year the sensible reforms contained in this legislation are long overdue and will make america safer these provisions will hamper the ability of terrorists and criminal aliens to move freely through our society by requiring that all states prior proof of lawful presence in the unitedstates for their drivers licenses be accepted as identification for federal purposes such as boarding a commercial airplane entering a federal building or a nuclear power plant this legislation will also require a temporary drivers license issued to a foreign visitor to expire when their visa expires with the maximum term of 1 year the legislation will also prevent the ability of potentially dangerous aliens to show up under false pretenses on our shores and be granted safe haven while simultaneously protecting those who are legitimately fleeing persecution finally the legislation will also ensure that the security and integrity of our border is not imperiled by endless and frivolous litigation i would also note that there are several immigrationrelated provisions included in the report by the other body that enjoy broad support from this house one will provide that aliens who have received h2b visas issued to work in temporary or seasonal jobs in any of the last 3 years shall not be counted toward the 2005 or 2006 quotes when applying for an h2b visa during the next 2 years another amendment expands immigrant visas available for aliens who serve as nurses or physical therapists i wish to thank the house leadership the white house and many members of both chambers who rightly recognized the importance of the real id act and supported its inclusion in this conference report"], [0.0040995776653289795, 0.495900422334671, 0, "first let me thank my good friend and colleague from arizona for allowing me the privilege to rise today in support of legislation i introduced the newlands project headquarters and maintenance yard facility transfer act h r 540 this legislation passed the house under suspension of the rules last year but was not considered in the senate prior to the adjournment of the 108th congress i truly appreciate the opportunity to stand before my colleagues again in support of this legislation that is so important for the people of the second district of the state of nevada the purpose of this legislation is to transfer all right title and interest in the newlands project to the truckeecarson irrigation district otherwise known as tcid this conveyance consists of approximately 35 acres and will allow tcid to make permanent improvements on this land for the continued operation of the newlands reclamation project in 1996 the bureau of reclamation certified that tcid had repaid the original construction costs designated for repayment to the united states the original construction costs included the cost of the land on which the initial headquarter facilities were located in the late 1970s however tcid had outgrown the original facilities and moved to the current site which is the area to be conveyed through this legislation tcid paid for the land where the original facilities were located however they were never compensated when they vacated these lots despite the fact that a federal post office now sits on the original tract of land thathoused the project headquarters critics will charge that this bill unfairly favors the tcid and that the land is a taxpayer asset and should be treated accordingly those assertions simply do not make sense the bureau of reclamation certified that the newlands project had been paid for and asking the tcid to pay for their land that their headquarters is currently located on would be in effect asking them to pay for it twice to say that h r 540 is a giveaway is simply incorrect and misrepresents the intent of this important legislation this bill is a fair solution to an unfair situation therefore i urge my colleagues to join me and senator john ensign and senator harry reid and governor kenny guinn of nevada and the local leaders of churchill county and the city of fallon nevada in supporting this legislation i want to thank the gentleman from arizona my good friend and colleague once again for allowing me to speak on this bill i appreciate the consideration of this legislation that is so very important to my constituents in nevada"]]}
