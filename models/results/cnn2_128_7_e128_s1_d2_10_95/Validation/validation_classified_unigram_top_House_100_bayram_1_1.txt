integrity and courage it is refreshing to hear my colleague from massachusetts speak as slowly for once and with such obvious feeling even the speaker pro tempore from the distinguished state of virginia has been able to understand him in the last few moments and i think there is something to be said for that i also commend the gentleman for placing in the context of american political history the march and demonstration which will occur this weekend in washington dc there have been a great many marches here i think many of us certainly this member of the house began our political careers and had our political energies ignited in the first instance by the great marches and the movements of the sixties the civil rights movement in the sixties certainly the marches and the effort to bring to an end the tragic war in southeast asia i first marched myself in washington in 1963 with martin luther king for civil rights i marched again with martin luther king from selma to montgomery in 1965 i marched two more times on this city in the sixties in the great demonstrations against our involvement in the war in vietnam i marched in 1967 i marched again in 1969 an extraordinary thing happened to me a few years later i was elected to this body and normally one ceases to march upon ones self at a time like that there was another great march in the late 1970s it was the first and until this weekend the only march for lesbian and gay rights in the fall of 1979 in washington having joined so many of the major efforts on behalf of my black brothers and sisters and people of color in the sixties i did not i was unable to bring myself to join the march in 1979 for my own civil rights the closest thing i could come to an act of courage at the time was to alter my routine jogging path so as to come within sight of the march as it came down the mall in this weekend i shall be in this march along with hundredswe do not know how many but certainly hundreds and hundreds of thousands of our fellow americans i would like to join my colleague from massachusetts in welcoming the men and women from i suspect every state in this country virtually every city of this country who will be here in unprecedented numbers to do something which first of all as the gentleman pointed out is in the mainstream well within the american political tradition which is to petition their government for redress of grievances second and sadly to do something which they ought not to have to do at all which is to request as american citizens their fundamental civil rights this is a city where much is spoken and all too often little is said where english has not been spoken in many places for years where a great many people like to refer to themselves as conservatives which is further proof of the inadequacies of the language these days here but let me submit to my colleagues that there is no more fundamentally conservative proposition in this land than the contention that all americans ought to be guaranteed fundamental civil liberties and civil rights that ought to be so fundamental as to be not subject to debate and yet we are still in this country debating the equal rights amendment whether or not to extend the protections of the constitution to people regardless of sex and those who would argue that that amendment is not necessary because the constitution already guarantees those rights need look no further than judge bork the great living incarnation of the argument for the era who explicitly says that in his judgment the constitution does not mean to extendthose rights to women because women did not enjoy them a century ago when the fundamental amendments were drafted that same logic would leave us with involuntary servitude because many of the men who wrote that constitution themselves held slaves times change we change with them and now another category of americans long denied their fundamental rights are coming to washington peacefully to assemble and to ask for those rights i have a feeling that if it were possible for members of this house to vote their hearts and consciences that there would be very little debate at all there is no controversy and deep down inside people know i think it was mark twain who said always do right this will gratify some people and astonish the rest there is no about whatsoever what the right thing to do is here it is my hope that even the president of the united states one of those many at this time in washington who like to refer to themselves as conservatives will grasp the fundamentally conservative nature of what is being requested here it is my hope if the gentleman will yield further for one moment that this sunday when hundreds and hundreds of thousands of americans are gathered on the mall and are marching toward this capitol building that perhaps the president could look out from the white house across the mall and realize that what he was seeing in the sea of humanity that he will see on that day is simply a cross section of this country his country his america young and old black and white and brown and yellow rich and poor male and female gay and straight this mr president is your country and it is asking for something which is your responsibility mr president which is leadership if i had the ear of the president which as the gentleman knows is not the case i would ask that he speak to our compassion and our love and not to our ignorance and our hate i would ask that he call on what is best in us not pander to what is worst in us we are better than you think mr president we as a people and we are far better certainly than you fear finally i would say mr president if you must listen to a general for gods sake listen to your surgeon general and not to your attorney general if i may quote dr koop who as the gentleman from massachusetts said is perhaps one of the more unlikely heros to some of us this time dr koop said recently i am the surgeon general of heterosexuals and the homosexuals of the young and the old of the moral or the immoral the married and the unmarried i dont have the luxury of deciding which side i want to be on finally may i pay a special tribute to the gentleman from new york our colleague who will participate in just a moment in the march of 1979 which as i indicated earlier i did not participate in that march was addressed by two members of this house the gentleman from new york and our late and sorely missed colleague the gentleman from california mr phillip burton i clearly remember i think i am correct that the first time there was mention on this floor of the tragedy of aids it was a special order taken by the gentleman from new york in which i had the honor of participating in 1983 that too is a subject which ought not to be a subject of debate here finally i thank the gentleman from massachusetts i commend him and i join with him in welcoming many many of our fellow citizens i hope they will not have to make this march again"], [0.0014559030532836914, 0.9985440969467163, 1, "i will never forget my first impression of the man martin luther king jr while being at my home in rural alabama near troy i was 15 years old and in the 10th grade when i first heard of the montgomery bus boycott and martin luther king jr as a black child deep in the heart or rural alabama i had tasted the bitter fruit of racism as i watched the unfolding drama in montgomery just 50 miles away the concept of nonviolent confrontation with the forces of segregation brought a ray of hope to me just as it did to blacks throughout the nation i saw him as a very young man a product of the south who had received a good education i saw him as a youngminister whose way was trying to make his religion relevent to the needs of his people and i admire that in my mind he was moses using organized religion and the emotionalism within the black church as an instrument as a vehicle toward freedom not long following the successful end of the montgomery bus boycott when martin luther king had earned worldwide recognition as an eloquent and articulate spokesperson for the black masses in america i sought his counsel and advice since i intended to desegregate the college in my hometown in the spring of 1958 i traveled from troy to montgomery to meet with dr king and rev ralph abernathy and that was the beginning of a long and beautiful relationship after that our paths were to cross often in the sitins during the freedom rides as a board member of his organization the southern christian leadership conference in organizing the 1963 march on washington and in mississippi in 1964 in the march from selma to montgomery in 1965 at riverside church in new york in 1967 when he spoke out against the war in vietnam and in preparation for his ultimate questthe poor peoples campaign of 1968 as i grew to know dr king in the activities of the movement my admiration for the man also grew he was a spokesman not only for blacks but for alienated human beings everywhere martin luther king jr spoke to the hearts and conscience of all of us who believed that nonviolence and love offered a more excellent way this good man this godfearing man gave us hope in a time of hopelessness this good man this man of god this son of the south produced light in dark places martin luther king had the ability to bring the dirt and filth from under the american rug out of the cracks and corners into open light in order for us to deal with it martin luther king jr more than any other human beingof the 20th century had the power to bring people together to do goodblack and white protestant catholics and jews young and old rich and poor martin luther king jr s message was love his weapon was truth his method was creative nonviolence his goal was the beloved community a community of justice a community at pease with itself this man that i marched with worked with and went to jail with this man that i got to know was so sensitive and so caring he was a beautiful manso black and so american he personified the best of humankind he could speak and the masses understood from his words that they were somebody he was a gentle man who used the teachings of jesus and the tools of ghandi in a sense he spoke a strange languagethe philosophy of passive resistance to evil and the use of nonviolence in the struggle for good in a sense he far too advanced in his concepts of love and peace for the violent times in which he lived as we celebrate and commemorate the life of martin luther king jr the word must go forth that his assassins did not kill the dream of peace the did not kill the dream of an open society they did not kill the dream for a beloved community the movement that martin luther king jr led the movement that he sustained it was too right it was too necessary to be buried with his body here in atlanta we know that his voice is stilled today but his message must still be heard we have a right to know what is in the food we eat what is in the water we drink what is in the air we breathe and as human beings and as consumers we must become responsible and we must realize that the bounty of the earths resources is not ours to hoard waste or destroy but to use only what we need to share and to preserve for future generations we must demand sufficient food to eliminate hunger provide housing for the homeless jobs for the unemployed quality education for our children and comprehensive health care for all americans in the process of moving toward and building the beloved community each of us must become involved we have no saviors who will lead us to the promised land but if we remain true to our vision continue our struggle and have hope we

assistance act of 1988 which was developed by the committee on public works and transportation h r 4844 addresses problems associated with the interdiction of drugs smuggled by air h r 4844 is identical to the aviation provisions of title viii of the omnibus drug legisation which was passed by the house on septembor 7 these aviationrelated provisions have strong support on both side of the aisle and are noncontroversial over the past year the committee on public works and transportation has conducted an indepth investigation into what the federal aviation administration could do to better assist the drug interdiction and enforcement efforts of local state and federal authorities what this investigation revealed was that the faas system of registering aircraft and certificating pilots should be changed in order to make the false registration of aircraft more difficult it is also clear that there is need to improve the faas information of pilots and aircraft ownership to facilitate investigations of and legal actions against drug smugglers when drug enforcement authorities learn that a particular aircraft is being used in drug smuggling activities it is sometimes difficult or impossible to discover the identity of the true owners the difficulty is cause by the ease with which the faas aircraft registration and pilot certification requirements can be circumvented by smugglers in addition there are some significant holes in the faas system of registering aircraft and pilots even when a pilot or owner is acting in good faith the faas registration system is adequate to its purposes of recording liens on aircraft however it is not well suited to assisting in drug interdiction and enforcement h r 4844 directs the faa to initiate a rulemaking to

colleagues on the banking committee mrs roukema the ranking republican on the subcommittee and mr vento they have all provided strong leadership contributions in designing and improving the basic homeless assistance programs enacted in the first session of the 100th congress for todays conference report the banking committees portion of the conference report provides only modest increased funding in fiscal year 1989 and 1990 for the three existing programs for the homeless fema emergency food and shelter program emergency shelter grant program and the transitional housing demonstration program as well as additional funding for the section 8 moderate rehabilitation for single room occupancy program a total of 410 1 million is authorized for fiscal year 1989 and 426 2 million for fiscal year 1990 for these homeless assistance programs under the banking committees jurisdiction the conference report contains several policy changes which are designed to improve the efficiency in delivering much needed homeless aid to state local and private nonprofit organizations such as encouragement for more technical assistance and improved coordination of information by state agencies greater flexibility has been provided by increasing from 15 percent to 20 percent the amounts of funds under the emergency shelter grant which may be used to provide essential services despite these positive changes still greater flexibility and local determination in my judgment is needed before the homeless assistance programs will truly reach their most effective potential homelessness is a diverse and essentially localized problem and the solutions therefore must be designed to provide such local discretion we would have preferred to see the acceptance of the ridge roukema block grant approach which was narrowly defeated by the house on august 3 which would have created maximum local flexibility for local communities in administering the mckinney act programs through a block grant system notwithstanding these reservations i believe that the conference report under consideration is on the right track and should receive our support this conference report also makes some modifications not directly related to homelessness which were necessary to provide technical and other clarifications to the housing and community development act of 1987 while these provisions at first appeared to be controversial with the administration i am now satisfied that the budgetary concerns expressed relating to changes in the section 8 program used in conjunction with huds loan management program have been significantly improved and their cost impact moderated sufficient to at least soften some of the administrations opposition this legislation is strongly supported by the united way the salvation army the national council of jewish federations the american red cross the national conference of catholic charities the national council of churches and by such organizations as the national mental health association the association for retarded citizens united cerebral palsy and the easter seal society these organizations represent only a few of the people who are in the front lines in our battle to end homelessness and i believe that they will make excellent use of the funds provided in the mcklnney act while title v of this act is not under the jurisdiction of the banking committee how section 501 is interpreted is a matter of great importance to our committee whether or not title v is interpreted as including single family properties in the fhas inventory has major implications for the solvency of the fha insurance funds section 501 of the mckinney act requires federal agencies to survey their buildings and real property to determine which are underutllized and might be available for the temporary shelter of the homeless nothing in section 501 or its legislative history in any way indicates that it was intended to apply to fha single family properties as i understand it the conference agreement contains language intended to ensure more rapid and effective use of unutilized and underutilized federal buildings however the conference agreement does not expand the universe of covered properties to include those in the fhas inventory of single family homes for this i commend the conferees as a recent unitedstates district court case has already shown an erroneous interpretation of title v can result in a freeze in fhas 3 billion annual sales program would place the insurance fund in jeopardy or force its dependence on appropriations while we must do all we can directly to assist the homeless we must be careful not to change unintentionally the basic nature of the fhas vital insurance programs which have provided

against america and they tear at the cultural fabric that binds us together at the constitutional shield that protects us all unfortunately far from being isolated rare occurrences according to the antidefamation league of bnai brith there have been more hate crimes committed during the last 3 years than there were in the past 20 years i am sorry to say that credible but scattered reports put the number at 3 000 such incidents between 1980 and 1986 this is a dangerous trend it is dangerous to gay people who have suffered more particularly because of the aids threat it is dangerous to jews hispanics arabs asians and african americans who are often the target of hateful acts and it is dangerous to the american community we can reverse thid trend the first step is to lift the rock to shine the light in the corner to gather as much information as we can about this threat to our nation i urge the passage of this perfecting amendment to make clear that we are not conveying special

grant program and the transitional housing demonstration program as well as additional funding for the section 8 existing housing certificate program from a supportive services standpoint the bill

handicapped persons who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless some of my colleagues have raised questions as to whether this is the best way to proceed their points are well taken i for example feel that state and local governments should be doing more to address the particular needs of the homeless within their communities in this regard the provisions of this bill directs federal assistance to state andlocal governments to work with voluntary nonprofit organizations at the local level in their efforts to assist the homeless in view of our hearings and based on experience with our existing homeless assistance programs there appears to be a consensus on this point the major purpose of this legislation was to focus attention on the fact that there is a problem and on that no one seems to disagree but such a conclusion should have been clear to all of us you can see it in almost any large city in the country ive seen it in columbus but ive also seen how some of the suffering and hardship can be alleviated in columbus we have an excellent program to aid the homeless that is funded under a previous piece of legislation that was approved by congress it works but we need more money and additional tools h r 558 will provide that this legislation is strongly supported by the united way the salvation army the national council of jewish federations the american red

foremost our thoughts and our prayers go out to his wife gigi and to their two children in this moment of great sadness and tragedy for them vinnie was a wonderful man and a good friend and he had recently turned down an opportunity to become the state democratic chairman in connecticut because he wanted to be sure to have enough time to devote to his young children who were growing up and who needed his fatherly attention and guidance that makes this occurrence ever so much more ironic and causes us to reflect about the needs that his wife and children will now have we all expect and hope to gather around them and give them the support that they need to get through this most difficult period this certainly is a terrible tragedy for me and for others who worked closely with vinnie mauro

was honored by the new haven chapter of the sons of italy who gave him an award for community service and made reference to all the things he had done to make the city of new haven and surrounding communities a better place for people to live at that gathering vinnies family and friends of many years came together and told him about their pride in the work that he had done it is an occurrence that i am sure we will all look back on with fond memories because we saw vinnie there in the prime of his life with all his friends and supporters around him having an opportunity to tell him the words that many of us will now speak in his memory about how proud we were to be associated with him and with his work he was a great political leader he helped make the democratic party in new haven one of the strongest in the state of connecticut he was able to carry that town for statewide candidates and presidential candidates in good years and bad and he did it because of his unique personal qualities qualities that i think we hope to find in many people involved in political life but are so often disappointed about let me tell you about two facets of vinnies approach to politics first of all vinnie mauro had an extraordinary commitment to openness in the political process he believed the process works best when all have an opportunity to have their say and to participate he was always supporter of registration drives to see to it that all would be registered in no way wanting to keep any group or any group of individuals from participating in the process he saw in registration drives the opportunity to bring people in give them a stake in the result and give them an opportunity to make a difference under his leadership many many new voters were registered in new haven especially many members of the black and hispanic communities who historically had not been registered in such large numbers as we would have liked vinnie mauro was always there encouraging their registration and participation in the political process i remember his openness to newcomers to the political process when i first ran for congress having never run for office before i sought his advice and support he did not turn me away and say get some more experience you really dont belong here you dont have the experience he said the opposite he said go out there and demonstrate what you have to offer get support show people what you can do and if you can show that kind of support i can be there to help you and he was there playing a significant role in all three of my elections to the congress it was that kind of open spirit and desire to get people to participate that was particularly unique and important second he was a man of great integrity someone on whom you could depend when youask vinnie mauro a question you got a straight answer that kind of integrity is essential to the political process we have lost a very good man a man who understood that good government and

yielding this time to me i rise in strong support of h r 4471 which reauthorizes the overseas private investment corporation it is not often that we in congress have the opportunity to support an economic development agency that promotes growth in the neediest areas of the world fosters the role of the private sector in these nations assists unitedstates business and promotes us exportsall at no cost to the taxpayer this bill does all of that opic was created in the 1960s as an outgrowth of the marshall plan which so effectively enhanced the role of the private sector in rebuilding europe following world war ii the concept underlying opic was to extend a marshall planlike program to the third world through the provision of political risk insurance investment guaranties direct loans and investment promotion programs for unitedstates firms in targeted developing countries opics primary mission is to provide political risk insurance against currency inconvertibility revolution and insurrection it also provides loan guaranties feasibility study assistance and with this bill equity investments in projects in subsaharan africa and the caribbean these programs are available only to american investments in new projects located in a developing country in which opic operates opic is an unusual agency of the unitedstates government in that it does not require an appropriationonly a congressional authorization to operate it began with 108 million in public funds which have long since been returned to the unitedstates treasury it is a selfsustaining operation and in fact has returned moneys to the government on occasion opic programs by removing much of the political uncertainty surrounding projects in the developing world allow the private sector to be the vehicle for development an indirect benefit of u s companies undertaking projects in developing countries is that such projects often help develop the host countrys private sector during the past several decades developing country governments have often practiced statism or government rectorship of the economy and government participation in the economy through parastatal enterprises these policies have proven to be ineffective models for development because opic insures unitedstates investments abroad there has been some concern that it underwrites the export of jobs from unitedstates soil at congress direction opic contracted an investigation of the trade and employment effects of its programs arthur young the contractor found that opic is a net creator of jobs in the united states it generated almost 18 000 person years in 1983 28 000 in 1984 and 17 000 in 1985 opic estimates that in fiscal year 1987 it created 15 000 jobs in host countries and generated 1 7 billion in unitedstates exports it believes that 1987 programs will generate 13 500 person years of unitedstates employment and 2 billion in exports many of these projects are being undertaken by small to mediumsized unitedstates companies the legislation before the house today extends and builds upon opics previous authorizations although there are no major departures from previous legislation the bill includes a potentially significant new program as mentioned by chairman bonker it provides a 5year pilot project for equity investments in subsaharan africa and the caribbean basinareas particularly economically distressed opic will be allowed to own up to 30 percent of a project once up and running opic will sell its equity share with the debt crisis many sources of international lending have dried up often an equity investment by a bilateral or multilateral lending organization is necessary to attract other investors to a project small businesses in particular often have difficulty in acquiring financial backing this pilot project will allow important projects in priority areas to go forward other developed countries have organizations similar to opic in the case of japan it is the export insurance division eid in the ministry of international trade and development last year the eid had a portfolio of outstanding insured investment of 7 4 billion in contrast opic had a portfolio of 4 7 billion neither eid nor many of its european coun erparts are selfsustaining perhaps as a result their insurance rates are lower almost all make equity investments the concept of political risk insurance and loan guaranties for projects in the developing world has proved so useful that world bank members have established the multilateral investment guarantee agency miga which will provide programs similar to opics to investments in developing vations miga is expected to be in operation by the fall migas programs will be available to firms from all member countries it will not be exclusively for unitedstates investments as in opics program at a time when unitedstates foreign assistance budgets are rapidly declining and international commercial lending is in retreat

and maintenance of our nations highway system is an important national objective therefore on january 6 1987 the committee on ways and means favorably reported an amendment to h r 2 which extends the highway trust fund including the mass transit account and the highwayrelated taxes which support the fund this revenue amendment has been added as title v to the bill as introduced by the committee on

that the majority of the members that would be with me simply did not have the time to digest the legal language of what a state of belligerency reallyis if we had the time in this debate and i am trying to be accommodating because we are working on this in a great bipartisan way i would win this debate given a good thorough hour of debate on what this is because this house is sick to death of all of the circular nambypamby jockeying around and we want an upordown vote on what we are doing here and whether or not we are going to support these people or not this will be framed in the criticism of my own administration this is about whether we are serious on our side about this issue item the second leading source of economic aid to the nicaraguan dictatorship is the combined efforts of western europe and japan who are receiving 120 to 150 billion in military aid real and other from us item two this spring the unitedstates information agency informed the board of foreign scholarships i just checked this out and it is confirmed mr maurio 0 rivas of managua has been awarded a fulbright scholarship to study industrial management in the united states i wonder if he will

they say yes that is substantially correct item proposals for an embargo of nicaraguan bananas the countrys major export were delayed in 1983 and 1984 giving the sandinistas badlyneeded time to

charitysome charity that must beand then they deduct that total from their unitedstates taxes causing other americans to step forward and make up for general mills clever little tax dodge the point is

the publics attention on the improper disposal of medical waste from the floating garbage barge to east coast beach closings the american public has recoiled in horror at the perceived threat to human health from improper medical waste disposal medical waste disposal however is just a portion of the overall waste disposal problem which plagues many of our states and cities in many areas of this country landfill capacity is limited and where available exorbitantly expensive recycling initiatives have not been fully pursued and incineration carries a separate set of concerns still in other portions of our country the disposal of waste including medical waste has not proven to be a problem many states like kansas have acted with foresight in establishing disposal programs which are effective the legislation before us today refl ts a blend of these facts by establishing a medical waste disposal demonstration program to track wastes from the point of generation to ultimate disposal in the states which we know to be suffering the effects of improper medical waste disposal at the same time the legislation requires epa to report to congress based on the experience gained through the demonstration program on a number of outstanding issues is the disposal of medical waste a national problem what are the types or categories of medical waste that need to be tracked is it appropriate to apply the tracking of medical waste in all parts of the country in rural areas or to small quantity generators what penalties are appropriate to deter violation of a tracking and or disposal program the answers to these questions will help guide congress should it be determined that a nationwide medical waste disposal program is desirable or necessary because this legislation deals with a whole new category of generators hospitals physicians dentists laboratoriespreviously unregulated under rcra and for whom little information exists i have had a keen interest in the enforcement provisions of this legislation after a great deal of discussion the bill establishes a civil penalty of up to 25 000 per day of violation and a criminal penalty of up to 50 000 per day of violation while i believe these figures are substantial epa has been given the authority to tailor where appropriate the degree of a civil penalty through the rcra civil penalty policy by incorporating this policy we can be assured that epa will take into account the seriousness of a violation and any good faith efforts by a entity to comply with the law additionally the bill requires epa to report on the appropriateness of the penalties established in this demonstration programinformation which can be used as a reference should future national legislalion be debated again i rise
