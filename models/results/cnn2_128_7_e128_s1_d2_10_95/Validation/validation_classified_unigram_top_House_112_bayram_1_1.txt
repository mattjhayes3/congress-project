correct amount of taxes withheld and paid to the states without the undue burden the current system places on employees and employers from a national perspective the mobile workforce bill will vastly simplify the patchwork of inconsistent and confusing state rules it would also reduce administrative costs to states and lessen compliance burdens on american workers take my home state of georgia for instance if an atlantabased employee of a st louis company travels to headquarters on a business trip once per year that employee is required to file a missouri tax return even if her annual visit only lasts for 1 day however if that employee travels to maine she would not be required to file a maine tax return unless her trips lasts for 10 days if she travels to arizona on business she would only have to file an arizona income tax return if she was in the state for more than 60 days in each case her employer is also liable for withholding those states taxes out of her paycheck and the only way she can avoid double taxation is if she files for a credit for each states tax in her resident state h r 1864 would fix this problem by establishing a uniform threshold before state income tax laws would apply to traveling employees this bill would protect employees who perform employment duties in a nonresident state if they work in the state for less than 30 days until that threshold is reached they will continue to pay in their state of residency when i initially started working on this bill the withholding threshold was 60 days in response to the concerns by the federation of

the bulk of their concerns the ftas concerns have certainly not been ignored in addition to lowering the day threshold we also worked to clarify that the bills operating rules were not drafted to avoid paying withholding tax and clarified if an employer has a time and attendance system designed to allocate wages among states it must be used at a time when more and more americans find themselves traveling for their job this bill is a commonsense solution that helps workers who are employed in multiple states by simplifying the tax reporting requirements for them and for their employers for the vast majority of states this bill carries a minimal or no revenue impact in fact this bill will greatly increase compliance rates this bill will end up saving states the

that defeats patentability there are some who think this bill hurts small businesses and independent inventors but they are wrong it ensures that independent inventors are able to compete with larger companies both here and abroad american inventors seeking protection here in the united states will have taken the first step toward protecting their patent rights around the world the bill also makes the small business ombudsman at the pto permanent that means that small businesses will always have a champion at the pto looking out for their interests and helping them as they secure patents for their inventions this bill protects small businesses and independent inventors by reducing fees for both this bill represents a fair compromise and creates a better patent system than exists today for inventors and innovative industries patents are important to the united states and the world for example during the war of 1812 american troops burned the canadian town of york known today as toronto in retaliation the british marched on washington in the summer of 1814 to put the capital city to the torch dr william thorton the superintendent of the patent office delivered an impassioned speech to the british officer commanding 150 redcoats who were tasked to burn blodgetts hotel where the patent office was located thorton argued that the patent models stored in the building were valuable to all mankind and could never be replaced he declared that anyone who destroyed them would be condemned by future generations as were the turks who burned the library in alexandria the british officer relented and blodgetts hotel was spared making it the only major public building in washington not burned that day american inventors have led the world in innovation and new technologies for centuries from benjamin franklin and thomas edison to the wright brothers and henry ford but if we want to foster future creativity we must do more to encourage todays inventors now is the time to act

debt would be and has become ive shortened the words a bit and provided them here as they express my heart more exquisitely than my own written words could when letters took a month by sea and the records of the united states government could be moved in a single wagon pulled by two horses we had great statesmanship we had men of integrity and genius washington hamilton franklin jefferson adams madison monroe these were men who were in love with principle as if it were an art which in their practice they made it they studied empires that had fallen for the sake of doing what was right in a small country that had barely risen and were able to see things so clearly that they surpassed in greatness each and every one of the classical models that they had approached in awe now lost in the sins and complexity of a xanadu when we desperately need their high qualities of thought their patience of deliberation and their unerring sense of balance we have only what we have which is a political class that in the main has abandoned the essential qualities of statesmanship with the excuse that these are inappropriate to our age they are wrong not only do they fail to honor the principles of statesmanship they fail to recognize them having failed to learn them having failed to want to learn them in the main they are in it for themselves were they not they would have a higher

or lack of it but from elsewhere where in patient and infinite ranks they simply wait to be called they can be read in history they arise as if of their own accord when in the face of danger natural

now they can be neglected but they cannot be lost they can be thrown down but they cannot be broken each of them is a different expression of a single quality from which each arises in its hour of need some come to the fore as others stay back and then with changing circumstance those that have gone unnoticed rise to the occasion rise to the occasion the principle suggests itself from a phrase and such principles suggest easily and flow generously you can grab them out of the air from phrases from memories from images a statesman must rise to the occasion democrats can do this harry truman had the discipline of plowing a straight row 10 12 and 14 hours a day of rising and retiring with the sun of struggling with temperamental machinery of suffering heat and cold and one injury after another after a short time on a farm presumptions about ruling others tend to vanish it is as if you are pulled to earth and held there the man who works the land is hard put to think that he would direct armies and nations truman understood the grave responsibility of being president of the united states and that it was a task too great for him or anyone else to accomplish without doing a great deal of injury if not to some then to others he understood that therefore he had to transcend himself there would be little enjoyment of the job because he had to be always aware of the enormous consequences of everything he did contrast this with the unspeakably vulgar pleasure in office of president clinton truman absolutely certain that the mantle he assumed was far greater than he could ever be was continually and deliberately aware of the weight of history the accomplishments of his predecessors and by hum ble and imaginative projection his own inadequacy the sobriety and care that derived from this allowed him a rare privilege for modern presidents to give to the presidency more than he took from it it is not possible to occupy the oval office without arrogantly looting its assets or nobly adding to them may god bless the president who adds to them and may god condemn the president who loots them america would not have come out of the civil war as it did had it not been led by lincoln and lee the battles raged for 5 years but for 100 years in the country both north and south modeled itself on their character they exemplified most perfectly churchills statement public men charged with the conduct of the war should live in a continual stress of soul the continual stress of soul is necessary as well in peacetime because for every good deed in public life there is a counterbalance benefits are given only after taxes are taken that is part of governance the statesman who represents the whole nation sees in the equilibrium for which he strives a continual tension between victory and defeat if he did not understand this he would have no stress of soul he would merely be happy about money showered upon the orphan taken from the widow about children sent to day care so that they may be long absent from their parents about merciful parole of criminals who kill again whereas a statesman knows continual stress of soul a politician is happy for he knows not what he does it is difficult for individuals or nations to recognize that war and peace alternate but they do no matter how long peace may last it will end in war though most people cannot believe at this moment that the united states of america will ever actually fight for its survival history guarantees that it will and when it does most people will not know what to do they will believe of war as they did of peace that it is everlasting the statesman who is different from everyone else will in the midst of common despair see the end of war just as during the peace he was alive to the inevitability of war and saw it coming in the far distance as if it were a gray wave moving quietly across a dark sea the politician will revel with his people and enjoy their enjoyments the statesman in continual stress of soul will think of destruction as others move in the light he will move in the darkness so that as others move in darkness he may move in the light this tenacity that is given to those of long and insistent vision is what saves nations a statesman must have a temperament that is suited for the medal of honor in a soul that is unafraid to die electorates rightly favor those who have endured combat not as a matter of reward for service as is commonly believed but because the willingness of the soldier to give his life is a strong sign of his correct priorities and that in the future he will truly understand that statesmen are not rulers but are servants it seems clear even in these years of squalid degradation that having risked death for the sake of honor is better than having risked dishonor for the sake of life no matter what youre told by the sophisticated classes that see virtue in every form of corruption and corruption in every form of virtue i think you know as i do that the american people hunger for acts of integrity and courage the american people hunger for a statesman magnetized by the truth unwilling to give up his good name uninterested in calculation only for the sake of victory unable to put his interests before those of the nation what this means in practical terms is no focus groups no polls no triangulation no evasion no broken promises and no lies these are the tools of the chameleon they are employed to cheat the american people of honest answers to direct questions if the average politician for fear that he may lose something is incapable of even a genuine yes or no how is he supposed to rise to the great occasions of state how is he supposed to face a destructive and implacable enemy how is he supposed to understand the rightful destiny of his country and lead it there at the coronation of an english monarch he is given a sword elizabeth ii took it last and as she held it before the altar she heard these words receive this kingly sword brought now from the altar of god and delivered to you by us the bishops and servants of god though unworthy with this sword do justice stop the growth of iniquity protect the holy church of god help and defend widows and orphans restore the things that are gone to decay maintain the things that are restored punish and reform what is amiss and confirm what is in good order that doing these things may be glorious in all virtue and so faithfully serve our lord would that we in america come once again to understand that statesmanship is not the appetite for power but because things mattera holy calling of selfabnegation and selfsacrifice we have made it something else nonetheless after and despite its betrayal statesmanship remains the manifestation in political terms of beauty and balance and truth it is the courage to tell the truth and thus discern what is ahead it is a mastery of symmetry of forces illuminated by the genius of speaking to the heart of things statesmanship is a quality that though it may be betrayed is always ready to be taken up again merely by honest subscription to its great themes have confidence that even in idleness its strengths are growing for it is a providential gift given to us in times of need evidently we do not need it now but as the world is forever interesting the time will surely come when we do and then so help me god i believe that solely by the grace of god the corrupt will be thrown down and the virtuous will rise up slavery was an abomination but statesmen arose and fought until its demise but 13 years after the foregoing words were first said we do so desperately need that statesmanship and gods unmitigated grace so that his providential gift of this nation to us may

might have 10 employeescompanies that are not yet profitable theyre working on these really innovative and neat technologies that are there to help patients improve their lives and save their lives in

decline in elderly disability rates i think as well hear from some of our colleagues particularly from the indiana delegation which is where we were just about a week and a half ago were learning there are some new hurdles on the horizon number one there is a medical device tax that will be imposed in just a little over a year its a 20 billion tax and studies have shown its going to cost the industry about 10 percent of their workforce its about 43 000 jobs that will be at risk in fact i just met with an owner of a company today who mentioned that he believes this excise tax if put in place 1 year from now will cost his company at least 50 highpaying jobs then you have the other issue of just an fda that has become so bureaucratic so unpredictable so inconsistent and so nontransparent that its becoming more difficult for these companies to bring these lifesaving technologies to market to make sure that the patients have access to them i have traveled the countryto california to boston to new york and well have a chance to go to north carolinawhere these pockets of industries in the medical technology field are really strong and vibrant one area in particular was indiana we were there just a little over a week and a half ago and i will tell you of the folks who testified therethe companies and the presence there and the jobs thereit was compelling in fact ill never forget the words from one of the testifiers there at the committee when he mentioned when he gets asked for advice on where to invest on where to start up that his advice to new companies is go to europe go to europe that is the wrong message in this down economy when we are trying to save jobs when we are trying to encourage job creation were encouraging one of our best american success

and modernizing the fda to make sure were doing what europe is doing for instance and to make sure we dont have as high a hurdle we want to make sure there is a strong relevant rigorous process at the fda because these companies want the gold standard they want the gold standard of approval but they dont want the goalpost moved in the middle of the process to make it so ridiculous that their
