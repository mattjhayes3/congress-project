office right now a letter to members of congress from the christian coalition entitled stop the gag rule on free speech vote no on the lobbying disclosure conference report i urge every member to read that because i do not think that members realize that buried in this socalled lobbying bill is a deliberate grassroots gag rule designed to kill precisely the pressure from back home that has been so effective in this congress let us be honest liberals hate grassroots voter pressure it was voter pressure in support of home schooling that forced the liberals to pull out a provision that would have killed home schooling it is the grassroots pressure of the righttolife movement that has sustained a fight that liberals would have crushed years ago it is the grassroots pressure of people who believe in the second amendment which has stopped the efforts by liberals to strip americans of the right to bear arms it has been the opposition to the clinton tax increase by the grassroots which reduced it to a onevote margin when the entire power structure of washington was going to raise taxes on the american people again and again whether it is school prayer opposition to prohomosexual education in first grade or a range of issues which are not politically correct here in washington it has been the grassroots who have risen up the crowning blow to liberals was the grassroots opposition to the clinton health plan which stopped in its tracks an effort to create a big government big bureaucracy big tax health plan now what do we have we have in the bryant conference report an effort to strangle grassroots efforts i urge every member get a copy of this report and look at the specifics i am going to give you today so you understand this is not some scare story this is a danger of the clinton administration getting even this is the clinton revenge bill to get even with the grassroots activists this is what they say this is in the bill page 5 grass roots lobbying communicationsthe term inside grass roots lobbying communications means a any communication that attempts to influence a matter described in in these various clauses through an attempt to affect the opinions of the general public this is not lobbying the congress but informing the general public b any communication between an organization and any bona fide member of such organization to directly encourage such member to make a communication to a covered executive branch official or a covered legislative branch official with regard to any matter described here again not lobbying the congress but if you belong to a group and you try to talk to your own group this is now going to be described by the bryant gag rule as something inappropriate c any communication between an organization and any bona fide member of such organization to directly encourage such member to urge persons other than members to communicate in other words if you are anywhere in america and you decide you want to lobby congress up to 10 percent of the time you are paid for and you spend over 2 500 which is one round trip from los angeles and hotel spending one trip from that point on under these rules you are going to be subject to the registration act and you are going to have to report to the director of registration who is the director of registration going to be for 5 years longer than a presidential term it is going to be somebody appointed by bill clinton let us say roberta achtenberg for example is appointed a vehemently in the case of elders anticatholic person now we have a question is a papal message on school prayer political or is it religious is a papal message on homosexuality political or is it religious is a papal message on righttolife political or is it religious i happen to be baptist but i would say that those people who are worried about joycelyn elders anticatholicism ought to ask what would that kind of person do in the directors office by the way the director can assess a fine of up to 200 000 now you are a local grassroots organization out here let us say you are an antitax organization yes you do the horrible thing of actually seeing your member of congress lobbying you actually pay one member to do this part time and they spend 10 percent of their time seeing the illinois delegation they are now subject to filing every report as directed by bill

from ohio and the members of the republican budget committee in the 8 years that i have been in congress and watched this budget process this is the most professional most dedicated and most real effort that i have seen by any budgeteering group they have got the right conceptual framework that we ought to grow down the size of the government and allow more freedom to grow up the freeenterprise sector of the american economy that only by growth in the private sector can we generate the revenues to support this enormous government spending program and only then can we decrease the deficit if we combine with that growth in revenues from a growing private sector a containment of growth in the public sector it takes courage it takes commitment it takes details a few weeks ago we were challenged on our side of the aisle to put up or shut up and the fact of the matter is the republicans on the committee on the budget put up details pain sacrifice not sacrifice by those of us who senator gramm says are pulling the wagon and paying higher taxes by heaping on more taxes but sacrifice by those who are in the wagon by reductions in government largesse and containment of the size of government what do we have from the democrats the democrat package can be broken down into three components the pain the payoff and the promise the pain is the massive tax increases which are immediate and certain on all of the american people and if in fact you happen to be earning 30 000 a year and suffering a tax increase by this clinton plan they will perform the magic of redefinition and give you by a redefinition of your income the status of being a wealthy american by imputing to you through the government alleged earnings of your children the rental value of your home the inside value buildup of your retirement programs the cheating on your taxes that this government under clinton is assuming that we all do by either unreported or underreported income they will make you wealthy this presidency is going to make us all wealthy by simply redefining income now in addition to that pain we have the payoff to all of the government agencies the supporters the communities in addition to all of that payoff in thisgovernment stimulate pork package we have then the promise the promise we have all heard before to the american citizens is once again the democrats have said take the pain of the higher taxes allow us to fulfill the payoff to our constituency groups allow us to provide the pork early and we promise you the cuts later ladies and gentlemen the cuts will not arrive the cuts will not get off the launching pad the cuts are the fiction of democratic budgetary policy the pain is real the suffering is optional vote for kasich vote against the democrats fiction the plan offered by president clinton and the democrat majority and the one developed by the budget committee republicans offer the american people a stark contrast in our respective parties approach to tax and budget policy the democrats want to tax the people and grow the government while republicaos want to grow the private sector and constrain the government the democrat package contains the largest tax increase in american history and tens of billions in new spending by contrast the republican alternative cuts spending and the deficit 430 billion without increasing taxes without slashing defense and without cutting social security the democrat package can be broken down into three components the pain the payoff and the promise the pain is massive tax increases which are immediate and certain the payoff is the stimulate government package which even the washington post notes is an effort to reward democrat constituencies with taxpayer money and the promiseone weve heard so many times befores that a few years from now well cut government spending in reality the democrat plan will grow the government and shrink the economy it will mean fewer jobs for ordinary americans particulariy when coupled with the new wave of regulations we are certain to see on behalf of big labor and other special interests the reason job growth has been stagnant is that the tax and regulatory burden on small business has increased 34 percent in the last few years and i remind my democrat friends that during the reagan boomthe longest peacetime expansion of the economy in history it was small business that created 75 percent of the new jobs in america what does the republican plan do it achieves more deficit reduction than the clinton plan by reducing federal spending less than 3 percent thats right 3 percent its appalling that my friends in the democrat majority and the new democrats in the white house would stick the american taxpayer with the largest tax increase in american history while refusing to reduce government by even 3 percent in fact the democrat plan adds tens of billions in new spending while the democrat plan asks all americans to pay higher taxes for more government the republican plan asks the beneficiaries of government largesse to contribute to deficit reduction the republican plan cuts federal overhead reduces congress bloated budget asks wealthy medicare recipients to pay a larger portion of their health care costs requires federal workers to work until age 62 like everyone else instead of retiring at 55 it reforms foreign aid puts medicaid patients in a managed care program and saves taxpayer dollars by empowering lowincome americans to use housing vouchers instead of building expensive crimeridden public housing and best of all the republican plan eliminates unnecessary programs and government agencies like the interstate commerce commission which was created in 1887 to regulate the railroads i would like to compliment my colleague mr kasich and the other republicans on the budget committee for putting together an honest fair and wellbalanced plan that reduces the deficit without raising taxes this plan attacks the root of our deficit problem runaway federal spending balancing the budget and encouraging a prosperous and growing economy requires a twopoint plan we must first limit government spending as this plan daes and we must pass a progrowth package which reduces the cost of capital and labor and encourages our people to save and invest i would say in closing that the clinton taxandspend plan will fail as i told another president 3 years ago durtng the 1990 budget summit higher tas and ~her spending will stifle growth in the private eoonomy kim jobs and not reduce the deficit the cinton plan is the 1990 budget deal pan ii in super 3d with twice the tax increase i urge my coieagues to reject the big government democrat agenda and support the kasich alternative which cuts 430 biliton from the

did quite understand it but what it used to sayit had a picture of a car seat with keys in it and an open window it said dont help a good boy go bad lock up your car by the same definition if you believe congress is subject to the temptations occasionally to run in and raid or do some things that you prefer it not do then why leave it to temptation take social security off budget the proponents of this amendment from what i have heard say they have no intention of doing anything with social security anyway that the amendment wouldnt have hurt it however that point is not before us

agencies who are going to regulate private property in america that is what it is all about if you do not believe that is what this data collection is all about then i suggest you should not have appropriated the tax dollars we have appropriated behind this survey let me concede a point to my friend the eloquent chairman of our committee that is what we ought to have good scientific data i am going to vote for this bill even though madam chairman i think you are going to rule this amendment is not germane as i have been told you would the reason i am going to vote for it is that i think we ought to have good data i think it serves us all to have better data in the management of these very important regulatory laws that we pass in america in fact so bad is our data base believe it or not the endangered species laws now are based upon a standard of data known as best available data the acronym for which is bad so bad is the base upon which regulatory decisions are made today that we get some awful consequences as a result across america but to say that this data is somehow going to be collected and then forgotten is entirely wrong this data will be used you and i know it it will be used to affect management decisions it will be used to regulate peoples private property it will used in some cases in ways that will deprive people of their jobs and deprive people of the value of their property you and i know that regardless of what our friend the chairman says you know that is what the data will be used for and if it is going to be used for that why not have the agencies examine in the beginning of the process that impact and examine the alternatives in which we can avoid those impacts why not make this a germane part of this bill i understand what is about to happen and i understand that most members know this amendment is going to be ruled nongermane but madam chairman this debate will continue i hope we have put the gauntlet down i hope we have laid it down

us in the michigan delegation knew that paul henry was sick but we held out hope that a miracle might happen and that the day that came would never come but now that it has i realize that the true miracle is the courage and the bravery that paul henry showed in the face of unbelievable odds and unbeatable odds and the passion with which he lived his life history tells us on the day that john kennedy died a tailor in new york city put up a sign on the door that read closed today due to death in the family that is i think how we all feel it is ike we have had a death in our family we did not see eyetoeye on every issue but i do not think there was a member of this body who was more respected and more liked than paul henry and we are all going to miss him while flying out to the funeral last month somebody asked me how he thought paul would be remembered and it struck me then that paul henry was a man of some very interesting contradictions very midwestern contradictions we know from the many causes fought right here on this house floor that he was both softspoken and persuasive selfdeprecating and proud deeply religious as mr wolf has indicated yet a firm believer in mans ability to effect his own fate politically paul was a deeply patriotic man who spoke out against flag burning a fiscal conservative who voted in favor of extending unemployment benefits a defense supporter who said no to both the mx missile and the nicaraguan contras it seemed that paul was not so concerned with the right or the left as he was with the right and the wrong he followed i think what we all strive to follow in our own public life and hopefully in our personal lives an inner compass and worked hard to make this country a better place to live and i think that is how he is going to be remembered i always got the feeling that to paul the richest life the fullest life is a life that is dedicated to helping others whether through the peace corps as he did in his early career or as a teacher as he did for many years before he came to the legislature in lansing and of course am a legislator here where he made his true mark and if paul could see us i think paying tribute to him this evening i have a feeling he would probably wonder what we were all doing standing around when there is so much work to be done i think sometimes if we had a few more paul henrys around here we would shout at each other a lot less and we would work together a lot more so our thoughts today go out to pauls wife karen and his children kar and jordan and megan their father was a credit to this institution and to our state of michigan and we will miss him in the days ahead as we lead this national through some difficult times i hope we can all show a little bit of courage and bravery and dedication that marked paul henrys entire life in the end that would be the highest tribute we can pay to him let me also say at the close of my remarks how much i appreciate and think the whole delegation appreciates the warm and touching friendship that fred upton had with paul henry fred was with him through thick and thin on thisfloor and through the very difficult battle he had at the end of his life and we all got strength from fred as he reported to us on a regular basis of pauls health and spirits and so fred thank you for going out of your way the extra mile to do something for

the heart and soul of militaryreadiness i am at a loss to explain why the president has proposed for the second year in a row to send the wrong signal to the troops by proposing a cut in pay from levels endorsed by congress less than 6 months ago today unitedstates military personnel are working harder deployed away from home longer and remain underpaid relative to their civilian contemporaries if the presidents pay proposals were to be enacted within 2 years military pay would be a staggering 17 percent below comparable civilian pay one result would obviously be a worsening of the already troubling trends becoming apparent in recruitment and retention today for example an e1 a private makes 832 a month that is only slightly above the federally defined poverty level we have got people in our military on food stamps military pay is a key issue the frank amendment will only hurt more of our young men and women in uniform to its credit mr chairnan congress rejected the

undo what we did last year the 2 5 billion that the gentleman from massachusetts proposes to cut from the fiscal year 1995 defense top line was added to the budget by the administration late last year

its joball within the structure established by the rules of the house now it is a rare occasion for an appropriation bill to be considered by the house without first adopting a rule why because almost every appropriation bill contains legislative provisions and or provides unauthorized appropriations and as my colleague from new york ms slaughter has explained this bill is no exception when we asked for a list of those provisions which were not authorized in this vahud appropriations bill we instead received a list of those programs which were authorized because the list of unauthorized

matter of fact that the arts money go back to the state in a greater share generally i think that reauthorization did a lot to improve the way in which the national endowment for the arts is operated i was interested the previous speaker mentioned that football baseball and basketball are not subsidized i would i believe observe that many of the stadiums that are built around the country are built with taxpayers money that is certainly a direct form of subsidy to sports in any event the arts money does leverage as was pointed out earlier a great amount of private money many of the private donations are based on approval by the nea for a small portion it becomes a way in which we can encourage private contributions of the major industrial countries in the world the united states contributes the least in public tax dollars because of this leveraging feature we do encourage private contributions and as the gentleman from illinois who is a member of the committee on ways and

unit nd as many of my colleagues will recall this large water project was completely redesigned and reformulated by congress in 1986 many expensive and environmentally destruction features of the

water from the missouri river wetlands would be restored since the 1986 reformation congress has appropriated well over 100 million to construct the newly reformulated garrison project i have supported each and every one of those funding requests unfortunately however local sponsors of the project the garrison diversion conservancy district have repeatedly attempted to rewrite history and the law by repudiating the 1986 garrison reformatibn act their obvious intent is to resurrect the old garrison project complete with outdated expensive and wasteful irrigation late last year north dakota leaders and the garrison diversion conservancy district asked reclamation commissiondr beard to initiate yet another new process to determine north dakotaes contemporary water development needs the commissioner with the concurrence of all north dakota political leaders insisted that all north dakotans internally reach consensus on any propesed changes to the 1986 act when the governors proposal was issued just a few weeks ago it was promptly rejected by the north dakota congressional delegation eight years after we passed the reformulation act the delegation has advised the united states that our state is owed this project and that north dakota will not have to reimburse the federal government for major features of this project if the state of north dakota and its congressional delegation are not interested in constructing a major water resource project for the benefit of their citizens i see no reason why congress and the taxpayers should be expected to force the project upon them i intend to convene a hearing of the committee on natural resources to receive testimony on legislative proposals to further reform and perhaps even deauthorize the garrison project i would say that i have been given a letter that has been written to michael whittington the area manager of the bureau of reclamation by the delegation which has a statement by the congressional delegation that they plan to go back to start a new collaborative effort to produce concurrence among all of the interests in north dakota and to produce consensus legislation that they will introduce in congress to modify the garrison reformulation act that is clearly their right to do so i would welcome and would participate with them if necessary with the committee on natural resources i must say however in that same letter dated may 12 to mr whittington that i am deeply disturbed by the suggestion that somehow this project is owed to north dakota and that they should not have to pay for what they should receive as compensation this project when it was passed in 1986 as a reformulated project was very narrowly passed by the congress by a handful of votes those handful of otes were secured by the effort of myself and many others to represent to the members of the congress that there would be consensus that there would be a fundamental reformulation and there would be repayment of this project that is what we did in 1986 after long negotiations on both the house and senate side to now suggest that somehow unilaterally one party or the other within north dakota is going to change the purposes and the intent of this act is simply unacceptable i hope that perhaps this letter is more reflective of the desire to enter into a true consensus rather than simply a onesided discussion

founded 8 5 percent more small businesses than men they are well over the 50 percent mark this is because women in america are very well educated now they are very energetic they also feel the glass ceiling that exists in so many companies and so as they gain experience they look to go out andstart their own business become their own ceo become their own management force and in doing this they have to take all the risks make all the capital investments of founding a business to make it then harder for them to expand their business by carrying the much higher cost of a fortune 100 benefit

working so hard on this bill i come from a district that has been absolutely wracked by violence this summer teen violence that is random that no one can understand there is a massive hysteria going on and we are all trying to cool out and look at it and analyze and figure out what do we do this bill that we are passing today is one of the best things we can do as we have looked at the centers for disease controls analysis of the different things that do work in america it never works unless we give half hope and half discipline unfortunately for 12 years our only approach to young people in this country has been discipline it has been the finger in the face do this do this because we tell you you have to we have really lost a generation of young people this is reclaiming them this president has said our young people are our future and we must get on withbuilding a community among them and showing that they are part of the community of all of us this is the best of what america is about if we forget our youth if we forget the tremendous problems we have got with the risky behavior of youth in this country then we are off the charts we are ahead of every other nation when we look at risky behavior problems i think a very large percentage of it is because these young people have not had hope they have not felt included i think it is wonderful that this program is going forward today saying henceforth evermore they are going to be included they are a part of it we need them and we start rebuilding those ties i thank the committee for moving it and ihope we get on

former naval officer who served during the cuban missile crisis i have firsthand experience of military operations in the caribbean therefore i take seriously the responsibility of placing the men and women of the unitedstates armed forces in harms way had president kennedy been schackled with a date certain for the termination of the cuban quarantine the soviet union would have successfully put nuclear missiles in cuba our senior military leaders like joint chiefs of staff chairman general shalikashvili jcs director of operations general sheehan and former jcs chairman colin powell have told us that we place our troops at risk by imposing a date certain it seems irrational to me that we would then impose a date certain which is little more than a political solution to this military operation unitedstates troops should not be pawns in the debate between the legislative and executive branches of government the plan we have before us in the dellums substitute requires the administration to define the mission identify the costs estimate the duration of united states presence in haiti with monthly reports to congress this substitute supports our troops without giving congressional approval to their deployment and without jeopardizing them with a date certain i see this as the best means to successfully completing the mission in haiti i know that is this partisan environment some who have never served their country in the military will criticize those of us who refuse to jeopardize our troops for political gain while i disagreed with the decision to introduced troops into haiti without congressional approval now that they are there we must give them our full and unequivocal support i urge adoption of the dellumsmurtha substitute"]]}
