by locking away 100 percent of social security revenues and surpluses for retirement security republicans want to pay down the national debt and republicans also want to lower the tax burden for middleclass working families i believe this year as we work to lower the tax burden for middleclass families that we should focus on making our tax code simpler and making our tax code fairer to families and let me raise a series of questions today that really illustrate what i believe is the most unfair tax and that is the tax on marriage the marriage tax is not only unfair it is wrong is it right that under our tax code married working couples pay higher taxes than two single people living together outside of marriage do americans feel that it is fair that 28 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married that is right under our tax code today a husband and wife who both are in the work force pay higher taxes than two single people living together with identical incomes that is wrong let me give an example here of what it means as i pointed out earlier there are 28 million married working couples paying on average 1 400 more in higher taxes here is an example of a south chicago suburban couple i represent the south suburbs of chicago if we take a machinist who works for caterpillar in joliet and a schoolteacher in the local public schools of joliet and they have a combined income of 62 000 the machinist makes 35 500 and as a single individual when he files his taxes if we subtract the personal exemption and the standard deduction he pays a certain amount of taxes but if he chooses to marry and his schoolteacher wife with an identical income and when they are married they file their taxes jointly their combined income of 62 000 when he subtracts the standard deductions and exemptions under our current tax code this machinist and his schoolteacher wife making 62 000 a year pay the average marriage tax penalty of 1 400 now there are those particularly on that side of the aisle who believe that this is no big deal that is money that we have to spend in washington back in joliet 1 400 is 1 years tuition in joliet community college 3 months of day care in the local child care center and also several months worth of car payments the marriage tax elimination act which i am proud to say has 230 cosponsors a bipartisan majority of this house we propose to eliminate the marriage tax penalty for all americans under our legislation we double the standard deduction for joint filers to twice that for single filers we double the brackets so that those who are married filing jointly can earn exactly twice what a single filer can make and be treated fairly under taxes the bottom line is the marriage tax elimination act would eliminate the marriage tax penalty for this machinist and this schoolteacherwife who are married in joliet illinois eliminating the marriage tax penalty is really an issue of fairness and will help simplify the tax code what is the bottom line the marriage tax elimination act puts two married people on equal footing with two single people that is fair and that simplifies the tax code i am proud to say i was part of this congress when republicans succeeded in passing into law the adoption tax credit to help loving families find a home for a child in need of adoption we accomplished that as part of the contract with america in 1996 and we followed up in 1997 by enacting into law the centerpiece of the contract with america the 500 per child tax credit which benefits 3 million illinois children that is 1 5 billion that will stay in illinois rather than coming to washington and of course i believe the folks back home can better spend their hardearned dollars back home than we can here in washington we can build on that helping working families by working to simplify our code by working to bring fairness to our tax code by eliminating what is the most unfair tax of all and that is the tax on marriage let us stop taxing marriage let us pass into law the marriage tax elimination act and eliminate the marriage tax penalty once and for all let us

system is the largest impediment to people moving from the first rung of the economic ladder to the second because the harder you work the more you save the more you invest the more we take it is a system that is inefficient we have seen testimony from the kemp commission to harvard studies that says for a small business man or woman to comply with the code and to collect and remit 1 in business income taxes it costs them anywhere from 4 to 7 the current code is not understandable our own irs tells us that if you call the irs for help in filling out your own tax return 25 percent of the answers they give you will be given in error over 50 percent of americans have to pay others to decipher the tax code and do their taxes for them in an effort to show how complex the irs code has become money magazine created a fictional american family and asked tax professionals to prepare an irs tax return incredibly every one of the tax professionals came up with a different tax total and not one of the tax professionals calculated what the editors of money magazine believed to be the correct income tax the current code invades the privacy of every single american citizen there are 100 000 people at the irs who know more about us than we are willing to tell our children i want them out of our lives these are not bad people they are people doing the job that this congress by statute has directed them to do but we should not have any agency of government that knows how much money you make or how you spend it that should be none of our business we should not have anybody who can look into your records and know your history the government should not be looking over your shoulder counting every dime you earn unfortunately to the irs we are all presumptive tax criminals required to open up aspects of our livesto auditors at any given moment for all of these reasons we are here today to debate and pass h r 4199 what the legislation before us today does is to sunset the current

is to do three things one sunset the current convoluted tax code two create a commission to consider alternative tax systems and three foster a national debate on how to create a fair tax system for working americans this is not a jump over the cliff as some will say there are several proposals before the congress now that have been carefully thought out the gentleman from texas has one that he has written a book about the gentleman from louisiana has one that he has pushed for several years the gentleman from pennsylvania has a very thoughtful proposal and i have one too all of these are ready to be placed in place they are different but every single one is better than the current system my bill h r 2525 that i introduced with my friend the gentleman from minnesota is a comprehensive tax reform bill the national retail sales tax would put in place a transparent form of taxation that will end the confusion forever this bill is known as the fair tax it would repeal the federal income tax the capital gains tax corporate and selfemployment taxes all payroll taxes including social security and medicare taxes all estate and all gift taxes under the fair tax americans will be able to see exactly what they are paying in taxes and the embedded costs of the irs would be gone because the irs would be gone americans would be able to take their entire check home with them and the irs would be shut down unlike the relatively simple tax return that you would get if we move toward a flat tax under our system we would have no tax return at all and you would never have to keep a receipt or a record not one let me simply say that any of these proposals as i said earlier any of these tax reform changes would be better than the current system i welcome the debate that will

and over 3 million homeless the regions economy and its infrastructure and its environment has been totally devastated and the second human disaster namely the collapse of farm prices here at home across the heartland of america where rural americans are losing their farms and their livelihoods and their homes under those circumstances with true emergencies we could well have funded these emergencies without the shenanigans that are going on here but this bill finances our response to these crises with offsets which themselves have disaster written all over them and i would just want to talk about one of these i support the obey amendment which covers four of them but i particularly wanted to talk about one of them that i consider to be the most dangerous and that is the cut of 150 million for nuclear disarmament nonproliferation programs with russia last year the congress provided the energy department with 525 million we have talked about it to dismantle nuclear warheads dispose of excess weaponsgrade plutonium and enriched uranium mostly in russia some was actually here in the unitedstates well this 525 million supports two of the most important swords into plowshares agreements reached by the united states and russia since the end of the cold war and the critical 200 million of it although we have had at least one suggestion that we ought to virtually throw out the agreement that is already ready to be signed which relates to the uranium but i think that is not a very sensible thing to do the critical 200 million is to be used to implement a bilateral plutonium agreement to dispose of 50 tons of weaponsgrade plutonium that is currently on hand in russia 50 tons of weaponsgradeplutonium which could make 15 000 to 20 000 nuclear weapons this 200 million does another job along the way it leverages the nonproliferation contributions from others of the g7 countries which are necessary in order if we are ever going to manage to get hold of all the plutonium that is around that might get loose among terrorists and rogue nations the 150 million cut in these two nuclear nonproliferation programs is an extremely dangerous move in my view

missile defense system that would cost us billions of dollars and do nothing about the possibility of terrorists getting hold of this kind of material today we are being asked to endorse a 150 million offset which will make more likely the transfer of weaponsusable plutonium from russia to rogue nations like north korea iraq iran and libya and surely make it more likely that it could fall into the hands of terrorists if we are serious about eliminating nuclear threats to our national security and this is one way of eliminating a major nuclear threat we should do all we can to keep nuclear

difficult votes that a congress can cast and that is on our emergency supplemental it might be called a warplus bill it is not just to forward fund the war because there are over 3 billion to forward fund the war and it is not just monies that could escalate the war because there are multiple categories in this bill including money intended to rebuild our national defense that could in fact expand this to a ground war and the motion to limit that was defeated so this in fact is not just a funding bill for the war however because it also includes important funds to rebuild what has been a devastating number of years on our military where we do not have the readiness and where we have sent troops into battle without being properly prepared and without the munitions necessary we have weakened ourselves around the world and i realize that it also has important funds for our agricultural catastrophes and it may even have things for hurricane mitch and the victims of the earthquake in colombia in this bill it has a pay boost for our veterans but ultimately this is a vote on war and that becomes a very difficult subject for members of congress to handle in their districts because in fact we have troops on the ground and none of us want to be perceived as weakening them and putting them in the battle without adequate supplies at the same time many of us have strong reservations about this war that in fact it is not winnable and in fact we are putting our soldiers lives unnecessarily at danger by continuing to fund this war i have been regularly visiting high schools and elementary schools in my district since the first of the year as part of the committee on education and the workforce efforts to look at the elementary and secondary education act and when i talk to students whether about the drugfree school program or school violence inevitably the war comes up because many of them are concerned that they may soon become involved in this especially if it expands to a ground war and we should have to resort to a draft which in fact we might have to do if we need 400 000 troops the question i get regularly asked since i express my skepticism that this war cannot be successful and we have had a poor strategy is how do we stop genocide and the ethnic cleansing around the world if in fact we do not fight this war and what are we to do to show our disapproval if we do not go to war these are difficult questions but not easily addressed or solved merely by saying therefore we are going to bomb everybody who we disagree with or who we think has committed genocide clearly this has been a problem in the past it has happened in turkey visavis the armenians we watched the communists overrun hungary and many of us i was only 6 years old at the time of the hungarian revolution but many americans felt we should have intervened at that point but there are certain things in amer ican history we have said that are criteria for when we get involved in these type of conflicts one is generally that it has to cross international boundaries this question is complicated here because it is inside a nation albeit an autonomous subsection of that nation or at least an area we believe should be autonomous we have also historically argued that there has to be a clear national interest and the only clear national interest here is the instability of europe and quite frankly what we have seen is that every week this war goes on europe is becoming less stable and the agreement will be less good in other words our peak in american interest agreement was before we started bombing every week the bombing has continued the agreement in the end will be worse the agreements that are now on the table we could have had several weeks ago in truth the kosovars are less willing and the serbians less willing to live together in peace in the future because of the conflict escalating the more we bomb the more we destabilize montenegro now we have accidentally hit the chinese embassy and china has used this at least as an occasion to stir up their people russia is concerned as to whether we will be coming in there and they have reactivated and are concerned about their nuclear defenses because they do not want us coming in if it is chechnya other nations around the world are concerned about what our international policy is israel is concerned justly that if we recognize an independent kosovo what does that mean for the palestinians turkey is concerned about what this means for the kurds the settlement we are looking towards is worse than we would have had early on while there was still a possibility to put this thing back together furthermore it does not appear to be winnable historically wars or efforts that have worked have been winnable or had an exit strategy but that does not and still begs the fundamental moral question how then do we deal with a milosevic or a serbian population or for that matter in croatia where many people were killed and moved out the ethnic cleansing being the moved out the killed being the genocide without a trial now sandy berger the national security adviser to our republican conference suggested that the goal of this administration and he said this pointblank was to teach the world how to live together in peace this shows some of the divisions that we have in this country and in the world regarding quite frankly the perfectibility of man can we in fact especially through bombs teach the world how to live in peace or even without bombs is that a realistic goal in my opinion that is more a humanist perfectibility of man argument and not one rooted in the judeochristian beliefs that this country was founded on i will extend my comments with written

patrol agents to be added at the rate of one thousand per fiscal year from 1997 to 2001 ins did not request any additional agents in its proposed budget for fy 2000 this is greatly due to the

1881 the border patrol retention and recruitment act the border patrol is not able to recruit enough agents to meet this authorizing level when the appropriators keep allocating each year an additional 100 million each year for the ins to hire 1000 additional agents and the ins is unable to recruit these agents then what the congress is doing is leading the horse to the water but not
