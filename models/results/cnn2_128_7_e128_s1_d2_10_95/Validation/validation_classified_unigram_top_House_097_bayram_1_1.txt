the repayment of debts owed to the federal government i am convinced that use of these private collectors can be done in a way that is consistent with the right to privacy the rules that govern the contracting out of government functions and the laws that regulate debt collection practices this bill is necessary because it is not clear under present law that agencies have the authority to enter into contracts for debt collection services for many years the general accounting office took the position that federal agencies could not legally delegate the debt collection function to private contractors in order to overcome this restriction congress found it necessary to expressly authorize the use of private debt collectors for a specific category of debts in the education amendments of 1976 public law 94482 i was surprised when the general accounting office and the department of justice reversed this interpretation and amended the regulations for the federal claims collection act

health policy since the rnid1960s has been the attainmient of equal access to health care that is access that does not differ because of income race or age differences between individuals however in the 1980s as the new administration begins to tackle the health care financing and delivery issues facing the unitedstates health care system concern will undoubtedly begin to focus on the relationship between federal health budget reductions and potential reduced access to medical care by the poor and elderly this may require the application of civil rights principles to the delivery of health services in the context of an ever changing political and economical environment consequently a new emphasis on civil rights as a mreans to protect health benefits may be needed to continue the public debate over equal access to medical care as a right for all americans even during a time of economic austerity the delivery of medical care in the united states through the use of expensive technology has fostered spiralling health care costs and the development of one of the largest service industries in the nation however access to medical care is limited for many americans with low incomes and who lack adequate health insurance protection during the past 15 years medical care for the poor and elderly has been subsidized primarily under the medicare and medicaid programs these programs help transfer a traditional welfare and charity arrangement of financing medical care into new attempts to mainstream medical care for the indigent populations this emphasis on making the availability of medical care more equitable has increased the purchasing power for the indigent and has helped to close the gap in health services and health status between black and white americans moreover recent attempts to expand the health care purchasing power of the poor along with removing discrimination barriers have been instrumental in assuring equity and accessibility in the delivery of medical care now this trend is being reexamined to reduce federal and state health expenditures and to develop more prudent methods of financing medical care for the poor the two major health care financing laws were created in 1965medicare and medicaid programsto help assure equal access to medical care for the elderly poor and disabled medicare established uniform hospitaland medical benefits which are administered as part of the social security program for all elderly persons regardless of income or place of residence now 16 years later despite the dramatic rise in public spending for health care the aged pay more out of pocket for health care than they did before medicare began the medicaid program was designed to aid and encourage the states to provide minimum health benefits for at least those individuals receiving federal income protection a ssistanceafce and ssi in 1975 many states began to liberalize entitlement and benefits for medicaid to individuals meeting specific categorical and income eligibility requirements the federal and state governments attempted to fulfill national expectations to make health cafe available to all even those unable to purchase private health insurance however runaway health care costs began to exceed public expenditures to meet this goal in 1978 states began to take measures to reduce expenditures under the medicaid program through lower fees to medical providers elimination of optional benefits and reducing the number of persons classified as medically needy for enrollment in the program the result of these policies was to reduced access to medical care for many of the poor as states began to restrict budget allocations for programs such as medicaid this required many indigent patients to rely on charity hospitals and other facilities that were funded by local government to obtain medical care thus many of the poor and elderly have been subjected to segregated facilities based upon inadequate purchasing power this time segregation was not on the basis of race but based upon low incomes and inadequate health insurance protection racial discrimination has been of fered as an explanation for racial differences in the utilization of nursing homes between blacks and whites many have concluded that racial dis crimination plays a major role in nursing home admission procedures this may also account for the low percentages and inadequacies of nursing home care used by blacks and other minor ities contrary to some reports these differences cannot be viewed based simply upon disparities in life expectancy between blacks and whites since recent mortality data identifies few differences between racial groups above the age 6f 70 1urthermore lower rates of nursing home usage among blacks cannot be attributable simply to more superior health status this stance is supported by recent data which suggest that therev is a higher incidence of disabilities amonir black elderly whicht may require institutionalization than among elderly whites for example the black elderly are more likely than elderly whites to reside as a part of an ex tended family living at home because they lack the resouirces tobe supported by nursing homes or other alterna tive living arrangements aside from racial discrimination economic limitations play a major rolein reduced nursing home utilization additionally nursing home beds are in short supply in many urban areas and blacks with limited and lower incomes have relatively fewer chances of obtaining admission consequently the black elderly are more likelyr thani white elderly to be institutionalized in settings other than nursing homes such as mental and chronic disease hospitals moreover reliance oni social security and medicaid for income and health insurance protection reduces their ability to receive quality nursing home and home health services a form of economic discrimination is thus created because many nursing homes are not willing to accept medicaid recipients it is well known that title vi of thel civil rights act prohibits discrimination violations on the basis of race color or national origin in any program or entity such as a hospital home health agency community health center and nursing home facility receiving federal assistance but relatively little is known about the application of this provision on eliminating access barriers to federal health benefit programs for the general population for example the de partment of health and human services office of civil rights ocr was involved in litigations during the l1970s over batterns of racial lsegregation among hospitals in new orleans la arid other urban areas similarly in 1978 ocr be came concerned about potential eases of discrimination against minorities die to reductions relocations l and closures of hospital facilities in urban communities currently we are not certain what position ocr will take under the new administrationto guarantee equal access to medical care for the poor elderly and handicapped citizens of this nation we can only hope that this office will continue its efforts to reduce barriers and practices of discrimination the primary cause of hospital closures facing many urban commnunities is the amount of care they provide to patients who cannot afford to pay for services and who lack adequate health insurance protection recent estimates in dicate that at least 200 hospitils closed during the 2month period between 1975 to 1977 this fact isl often related to the large numbers of individuals who lack medical insurance for example recent data has reported that over 23 million persons have no health insurance coverage in the united states and another 20 million have inadequate coverage many of these individuals are considered the working poor with incomes above state medicaid eligibility levels but are inadequate to purchase private health insurance or to pay directly for the medical care they need many of the poor and working poor would be eligible for medicaid if it were not for limited income eligibility requirements imposed by states these limitations on eligibility and scope of benefits contribute significantly to the gapq in coverage that exist among the medically indigent under the medicaid progran these gaps have become even wider in many states due to limited state expenditures to finance medicaid this requires many charity and public hospitals to provide expensive medical care free to individuals without health insurance in the past it was possible for private and voluntary hospitals to recoup a portion of their losses on services to uncovered patients by passing this lost on to privatepaying patients public general hospitals deficits for providing free care to a sizable number of their patients were usually subsidized by local governments now due to shrinking tax revenues for innercity areas many public general hospitals are in2 great financial distress since many local governments can no longer support them in a number of urban areas public hospitals which are the major sources of primary care and the only source of emergency and trauma services began to close moreover these closures have begun to be seen as a serious threat to reducing access to medical care for urban residents and viewed as a legittmate civil rights issue for example a recent study identified that the percentage of minority residents of the community around the hospital is directly related to the proportion of hospital closing or relocating from the area in neighborhoods 025 percent black in 1970 for example only 14 2 percent of the hospitals hadf closed or relocated between 1937 to 1977 but neighborhoods 70 to 100 percent black in 1970 fully 48 9 percent of hospitalsalmost half had disappeared other consequences of hospital closures include firstdeparture of the few remaining primary care physicians in private practice from the community surrounding the hospitals and second lost of health service employment opportunities for community residents these conditions have further reduced the effectiveness of the urban health care delivery system and to reduce assurance of equal access for many urban residents who have limited medical care purchasing power a number of cases now pending before ocr are designed to determine whether reductions in the availability of medical care due to hospital closures violate title vi since these actibns occur more readily in minority and poor communities many have viewed these closures as an act of racism cases involving homer 0 fhillips hospital in st louis mo and thenew york city health hospitals corp which have either closed or reduced health services in recent years are major litigation disputes for ocr the complaints allege that proposed reductions in medical services by hospital closures in predominantly black communities would reduce access to health care since few alternative health care resources were available contrary to earlier civil rights legal cases which involve hospitals and other health facilities practicing discrimination in the provision of medical care to minorities and handicapped individuals present cases have not gained national attention however as more hospitals and community health centers either close or reduce services due to recent federal health budget reductions we may expect future civil rights debates to be concerned with reduced access to federally funded health programs one major objective of title vi of the civil rights act in regard to the delivery of health services was to prevent minority patients who are seriously ill from being turned away from hospitals and community health centers legal disputes involving patients who were transferred from private to public hospitals or subjected to long delays for medical care are now being considered as a violation against federal civil rights statutes these problems of discrimination appear to be most frequent for blacks mexican americans asian immigrants a number of civil rights regulators have recently examined policies of proprietary hospitals that require patients to pay advance payments prior to receiving treatment and the diagnosis of illness in addition the failure of proprietary hospitals to inform patients of their free care obligations which they must assume in accepting hillburton funds can be considered an attempt to prevent poor patients from receiving equal access to medical care in private health facilities these examples of discrimination practices in the delivery of health care services may have to be rsolved within the context of civil rights protectionism civil rights in the delivery of medical care may gain prominence in the 1980s to assure equal access to medical care for the poor heightened public concerns about the relationship between federal budget cuts greater control by state governments and efforts to reduce access to medical care mpay be a concern of many black elderly yet the entrenched coalitions and ideological commitments to reduce inflation will continue to influence the debate on mainstream medical care for the poor and elderly we can only hope that concerns over whether blacks and other minorities are discriminated against by the private health system may be raised as a major public policy issue in this round of debate as in others that consider equal access to medical care the major issue will undoubtedly relate to an individuals ability to purchase medical care this argument is highly needed based upon recent attempts to reduce medicaid recipients freedom to choose health providers which may encourage the poor to receive substandard care in socalled medicaid mills ironically the governments new emphasis to convert categorical health programs into block grants to reduce medical care inflation has been opposed most vigorously by opponents that this will encourage states to reduce funding to urban health facilities that serve the minority poor conventional public opinion suggests that few solutions other than legal disputes are most likely to emerge during this period of federal budget reductions congressional leaders must understand the importance of federal health funds as a necessary ingredient to assure minorities and the poor equal access to medical care only in the event of strong and coordinated leadership committed to the ideas of civil rights and equal access to medical care can we expect that the poor and elderly will fare better

waxman and ways and means health subcommittee chairman andy jacobs in this effort to halt the administrations cruel and illconceived efforts to deregulate the nursing home industry the legislation which we are introducing today the national nursing home standards act of 1982 does two things first it prevents the secretary from imposing nursing home deregulation rules until 1984 second the legislation establishes a national commission on nursing home regulationa commission which will thoughtfully and rationally examine the utility quality and adequacy of existing regulations let us briefly reexamine the urgent need for this legislation on may 27 1982 the secretary of health and human services published his proposed nursing home deregulation rules in the federal register it became evident to us who have traditionally defended the rights of the frail elderly that the rules represented an abandonment of these institutionalized people the secretary proposed the inspection of nursing homes not less than once every 2 years a change from the current annual inspection requirement two problems exist with this proposal first the data show that nursing home patients average stay in these facilities is 2 years therefore patients might never be in contact with an inspection team second studies show that patients are getting older and sicker and therefore may not be capable of withstanding poor treatment for a 2year period waiting for an inspection team to arrive i am also alarmed by the secretarys recommendation that homes in which violations have been detected report by mail or by phone that such violations have been corrected if a nursing home operator has placed the frail elderly at risk by violating a fire ordinance then that home should be reinspectedstate agencies should not rely on something as little as a postcardto determine if the violation has been corrected finally i am very distressed by the secretarys recommendation that the joint commission on the accreditation of hospitals be permitted to determine if facilities should receive federal funds under medicare or medicald jcah is a private nonprofit entity that performs such a function for the accreditation of hospitals this recommendation is objectionable for several reasons first 42 unitedstatesc 1396aa 33 b is the operative language regarding the duties of state agencies to determine whether institutions should receive medicare or medicaid funds there is no authorization for the state agencies or the federal government to farm out this responsibility to anybody particularly jcah second jcah has a policy of keeping the results of its certification process confidential when jcah examines a hospital and finds a problem that problem is kept confidential in fact jcah surveys of hospitals are exempted from general and specific public disclosure requirements of the social security act the problem here is that jcah may well encounter a nursing home violation which should be referred to a state law enforcement official and even if the violation is not appropriate for that purpose a family deciding whether it should place its beloved relative in the home would find that information very helpful yet the information uncovered by the jcah during a nursing home inspection will be unavailable for that purpose third the track record of jcah in inspecting hospitals has been called into question in 1972 congress required hcfa to undertake periodic surveys to validate the work of jcah in accrediting hospitals the results are reported to congress annually in fiscal year 1980 61 percent of the hospitals in hcfas selective audit were found to have serious deficiencies 50 percent of those sampled violated the life safety code by contrast the results of state agency surveys of hospitals were found to be much more reliable given the deficiencies which i have listedelimination of the annual reinspection requirement permission to notify state agencies that violations have been corrected by phone or by mail and authorization of jcah to deem the status of nursing homes as proper beneficiaries of federal fundsi am plpased that our bill would prevent the

the authorization so that the ustta can carry out the mandatory provisions of existing law the administrations recommended authorization level is too low to even permit the ustta to meet its legal

its second year to make the goal of increasing international travel receipts a reality this nation is the most beautiful on earth with an abundance of attractions both natural and created by energetic americans we have vibrant cities gorgeous seashores wonderful entertainment and a diverse friendly people the united states should be encouraging more foreign tourists to come to our shores and share what we have to offer during the past few years the effort made by the unitedstates government to persuade people to visit america has actually declined at a time when competition for the foreign visitor has increased the unitedstates share of the international tourism market has remained fairly constant despite phenomenal growth in the number of people traveling in the world today the number of international arrivals has gone from about 70 million in 1960 to about 275 million in 1980 yet the unitedstates share of that market has not improved we need to do a better job selling america i

performance in the inter national tourism marketplace which is a blueprint for what needs to be done now we need to give the ustta the opportunity to put that plan into practice by passing this 1983

sponsored by the distinguished gentleman from new jersey and wish to associate myself with the laudatory remarks of the previous speaker and i want to indicate to this body that it has been an edifying and wonderful experience for me to sit upon the subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights chaired by the gentleman from california it was an interesting experience and one which made clear to me that the kind of expertise he displays in marshaling witnesses and testimony was in accord with tl~e highest standards of this congress i tal~e my point of departure in this discussion as did the previous speaker the distinguished gentleman from illinois from the 15th amendment with emphasis upon that section which says that the states shall not deny or abridge the rights of the freedom to vote h r 3112 extending the voting rights act of 1965 is a simple extension which puts meat and gusto and verve to that long languishing 15th amendment i do not think we can look at the 15th amendment in a void i think it has to be put into historical context in the historic continuum if we look at it in a void we may forget that this country has over the past 100 or more years been steadily impelled in the direction of an ever extending franchise to guarantee every adult the untrampled inviolate right to vote that is what this debate is all about the question is whether this congress will continue in its pristine powerful form the act which after a 100 years of delay was finally designed to do something about the right of blacks and hispanics in this country to vote when we look at it in a historical context it takes on more meaning i think we can trace it for example to the direct election of senators in these united states we can take our point of departure from the 19th amendment and the sufferage for women we can look at the other aspects of that continuum the constant fight to remove certain impediments to the black mans right to vote in the south such things as a grandfather clause knocked down by various courts we can look at the 24th amendment and the elimination of the poll tax as part of an exorable march to expand the franchise in this country the 18yearold vote carried it forward as did the oneman onevote decision of the supreme court in the sixties and finally the civil rights act of 1965 so we can see that this countrys objective has always been to protect the right to vote as an individual when people stand here and say this is punishment to the south or punishment to the covered jurisdictions or an impingement upon their sovereignty or a holding of them in hostage they are not looking at the 15th amendment and they are certainly not looking at the history of this country a history which has made it very clear that every adult citizen should have the right to vote the registration figures indicate quite clearly that this act has ben successful for example in the covered jurisdictions primarily in the south the registration figures have gone up from about 20 percent to approximately 50 percent the number of black elected officials in covered jurisdictions in the south has gone up from approximately 100 to around 2 000 section 5 the preclearance section has therefore been a strong and powerful mechanism whereby devices designed to dilute the vote in the south have been removed there are some who say that since it has been such a singular success perhaps the time has arrived to abandon it obviously and clearly that is not true any one who had been privy to the hearings we had throughout this country in which we saw scores of witnesses at 18 hearings would certainly come to the conclusion as i have done that not only should the a~t be extended but also that no mechanism should dilute it in any meaningful fashion we heard prominent litigators before us on both sides of the question civil rights organization leaders state officials secretaries of state attorneys general former and present congressmen those who had been involved in the initial 1965 act and those here sitting in the house today black and white state assemblymen from throughout the south appeared before us grassroots people academicians but there was an overwhelming positive support for the extension of section 5 preclearance the weight of the testimony was simply astounding the gentleman from illinois is not diminishing the potency of that evidence when he says that the weight of the testimony was so overwhelming that it turned him around he had been against to a certain extent the extension of that act the witnesses before us gave us a chamber of horrors instance after instance in which the act had been violated there had been intimidation threats coercion poll changes with no notice individuals in the south forced to vote at an open table where everyone could see them and intimidation was rampant objections have been filed to approximately almost 300 of these various changes in the south the civil rights commission stated that over 500 changes made in covered jurisdictions were not submitted to the attorney general racial gerrymandering was rampant in many many jurisdictions through the south and

coming forward at a very difficult time and it is my sincere hope that my colleagues will support it i want to take a few minutes today to talk about one specific matter in the report accompanying this bill in the section of the report describing our committees action on the department of agriculture some language was included regarding the operation of certain pilot school lunch projects by usda this language was offered to enforce the original intent that we had when this project was first funded in fiscal 1981 in summary this pilot project is an attempt to determine if the school lunch program can be run more effectively by giving schools cash or letters of credit in lieu of the commodities that they are currently receiving this is a subject of some disagreement and we felt that it was prudent that the matter be appropriately reviewed before any further legislative action was taken on it under this project 30 school districts will operate as they currently do under the lunch program 30 others will receive all letters of credit in lieu of their normal commodity support and yet another 30 will operate with cash in lieu of the basic commodity support the problem is that usda is acting as if we had given them authority to provide cash or letters of credit for the value of the bonus commodities which is something that we definitely did not do in the report that accompanies the fiscal 1981 supplemental appropriations bill we directed that the department may either withhold charge for or earmark in some fashion the value of bonus commodities which may be received by those school districts this language did not mean that the schools should get extra cash or extra letters of credit it meant that the impact of bonus commodities provided to the schools should be separately accounted for or that the bonus commodities should be withheld entirely the report language provided by our committee reminds the department that it does not have the authority that it claims it does they may give bonus commodities and not a substitute given that the stories of surplus commodities have received great attention in recent weeks we want to see these commodities used in an efficient way we do not want them bottled up in some warehouse where they will rotespecially not when the provision of these commodities to schools can do some good furthermore under the way the school lunch program is supposed to operate bonus commodities are not supposed to be a normal component it is for this reason that we want bonus commodities separately accounted for not transformed into a different medium the department should not treat the bonus commodities as a normal component of the school lunch program and by designing the study in the impermissible way that it has it is acting as if these bonus commodities will always be there the purpose of the study is to determine alternative methods for the lunch program and their respective feasibilities it is for this reason that the study concentrate on the basis of the lunch program and not its collateral components second during the course of our hearings on the fiscal 1983 agricultural appropriations bill assistant secretary mary jarrat testified that the study can be completed in 2 years and by implication for this reason it is not necessary to run this pilot program beyond the end of the study term our report notes this fact and directs the department to not make plans for continuing the project beyond the 198384 school year unless the projects are extended by congress this report language is essential for maintaining the original intent of our 1081 appropriation action the department has yet to provide sufficient justification for the actions in wishes to take in contradiction to the directives provided by our previous action answers to questions that have been submitted to the food and nutrition service by myself and the subcommittee on agricultural appropriations have been nonresponsive and the action of the department has in fact been in contradiction to the recommendations issued by a large number of a departmentalppointed advisory panel which is supposed to oversee this project many of the panel members have become so frustrated with the departments inattentive ear to their concerns that these members doubt whether or not the advisory panel has any real value at this point i am hoping that the house can support the agricultural appropriations subcommittee and the full appropriations committee on this matter in an effort to return to days of responsible decisionmaking we

nearly doubled and since 1965 the number of black elected officials across the united states has more than tripled it is true the minority community no longer faces blatant practices such as literacy tests and poll taxes but we face just as serious a threat to our ability to elect representative public officials this threat comes in the form of gerrymandering and annexation schemes aimed at

virginia the filene center was orginally built over a decade ago with private funds it and the land upon which it sits in excess of 100 acres was donated to the federal government and is now a unit of our national park system operated by the national park service as the wolf trap farm park the wolf trap foundation works in close cooperation with the national park service and the foundation is principally responsible for providing the programs scheduled for the center the entire arrangement represents a close cooperative relationship between the government and the private sector after the catastrophic fire of last april which totally destroyed the center the administration proposed legislation which embodied a partnership in cost sharing between the government and the wolf trap foundation the center would be rebuilt on a 5050 cost sharing basis h r 6875 as initialy introduced embraced this costsharing approach the legislation before us while embodying a totally new text preserves that 5050 costsharing approach however the current bill text is much more detailed in the provisions of how this partnership will work it endeavors to more precisely define responsibilities

investigations brought forth a great many details of concern and the bill provisions represent an effort to deal with these matters while i believe that both the bill and the committee report quite comprehensively address most matters related to the rebuilding there are a number of matters which i believe deserve further comment a significant concern has developed with regard to possible extraneous noise intrusion problems coming upon the center and adversely affecting the performances emanating from the nearby dulles road corriderairport access and yettobe constructed toll road in order to minimize that type of problem and also to minimize the extent and cost of mitigation effort to be undertaken by the highway interests it is crucially important that the site chosen for the reconstruction of the center be located in the best location within the park to separate it as far as possible from highway noise several alternate locations have been considered but the long favored choice of the foundation is to return to the original site some 300 feet from the existing highway corridor the alternate sites are farther distance from the corr dor there has been some concern that the foundation may desire a return to the original site more on a basis of sentiment than on a basis of it factually representing the best choice with regard to the most freedom from extraneous noise conflict it is crucially important that the federal investment here be amply protected by assuring that the most noisefree site be chosen unless the difference from other sites is only marginally better and or other factors such as increased cost strongly override such a choice the language of the bill section 4 d which gives final reconstruction decisions to the secretaryparticularly as to location and designwas strengthened by the full committee to emphasize this very concern and the feeling of the committee is strong and absolute that the secretary fully and purposefully exercise his authority here to assure that the final decision as to location and design for the center is made by him with total assurance that it is in the best interests of maximum reduced conflict with extraneous noise and maximum beneficial internal acoustical properties it well may be necessary for even more noise measurements analysis and evaluations to be made beyond those already completed in order to totally assure the proper conclusion as to the best location and design the department of transportation and the federal aviation administration should check this matter very closely as well as their interests have much at stake in the final center location and design decisions they will have to arrange and pay for necessary mitigation from unacceptable noise and they should help assure the minimization of such potential conflict and difficulties by assuring that the final reconstruction site is the best correlated to minimal noise conflict the final point i wish to make has to do with the cooperative relationship between the national park service and the wolf trap foundation which is so essential for the optimum operation of the overall park the bill provides for a cooperative agreement to constitute the basic document for setting forth this relationship and such an agreement is already in place at the moment and is working among other essential ingredients it is important that any new agreement address such subjects as both entities keeping each other totally informed of the others septemberf0 1982 planned public activities for the park in a timely manner the disposition and handling of food service and similar typically concession type operations the responsibility of all operational costs for all aspects of the park and the proper financial separation of the foundations parkrelated operations from its nonpark operations as it relates to the overall wolf trap farm park operation in regard to the latter it is important that the foundations operation of nonpark properties such as the barns be properly financially and otherwise separated from its governmentrelated wolf trap farm park operations to the extent there are current questions or problems

firm the report was completed for the state department in march 1982 which allowed them to get a handle on the magnitude of the problems and what it would cost to correct them ultimately due to the unability of the state department to receive a supplemental appropriation of 1 5 million for fiscal year 1982 the decision was made to transfer the property to the general services administration who

oceans and cold water in the deep oceans rich deposits of strategic minerals have also been discovered in the ocean particularly in the northern pacific estimates of the quantity of minerals in the pacific ocean range from 100 to 1 600 billion tons the mining industry is presently developing the technology to mine these minerals in the deep sea it is important that we continue to develop these resources however we must develop them carefully the impact of dumping chemical waste at the love canal in new york has demonstrated clearly the danger we face if we do not examine closely the impact our actions have on our environment which keeps us alive it is essential that we conduct studies of the oceans and its inhabitants so that we can measure our impact the mote marine laboratory on longboat key in my district is an excellent marine laboratory which has conducted a significant study of sharks and has completed an important study of the red tide we must continue such research and expand it to include more studies on mans impact on the ocean or we may again pay for our mistakes so i again wish to add my voice to those celebrating national wildlife week and to thank the many concerned people and organizations in florida and in my district who spend their time making our ocean resources productive for the present and clean and safe for the future e"],

am more upset about what is going on now than i have been since those sort of private times when i tried to influence policy decisions on the korean war and the vietnam war incidentally i was virtually never successful i am terribly worried about this performance because i have as the members will see as i try to explain what i am saying the deepest respect for two of the people who are heavily involved in this first i am very sad that this is happening this way and i say this not with any lack of sympathy for the republican members of the house i have witnessed the same kind of thing going on the democratic side particularly when lyndon johnson was the president when the white house presumed to take over the whole process i do not mean to be unkind to anybody on the republican side but it is very clear that the timing especially with regard to the great push to bring up this particular matter at this particular time was masterminded by the white house and perhaps some members of the house that i do not know but certainly not the leadership in such a way that it would have an overwhelming political smell i am not sensitive about politics you know i know about it and i have played legislative politics as well as substantive politics most of my career but this is really an extraordinary example it is an example of a party that had had a very strong program which went astray and then the party had the good sense to modify it somewhat that has happened in the last roughly 20 months i guess it is i am not going to go into any detail but it is very hardit is very very hardto come to a conclusion any other conclusion than that the timing on this is a diversion i would not be worried about it if the principal actors in this were only the president and jim baker and ed meese and the other white house operators the only sad thing about it is that a man whom i admire enormously and think would make a quite good prestdentand i hope i am not hurting him when i say thishas apparently been the hit man on this the vice president i hope that is not true i hope it is the others because i have come to expect that from them even including lyndon johnson and richard nixon this is the most political white house i have ever dealt with it is so much a politicalwhite house that it sort of frightens me because it does remind me of a combination of johnson and nixon and if that does not fnghten people we have a problem that is why i am sad and i am quite serious about this i have great admiration for the republican party and many of its members i am also sad because one of my best friends on the republican side of the aisle and one of the men i admire the most is the author of the base resolution i have a strong feeling that i understand why he is in that position he just got so fed up with the democrats that he thought anything was better than what they were doing and i do not even blame him from his point of view it makes sensenot from my point of view i have almost gotten in that situation a couple of times and never quite made it but i do not belong to his party i am not trying to be funny i am telling you why i am concerned but the bottom line of why i am concerned is the substance the gentleman from new york crafted the best possible bad resolution and the fundamental thing that is wrong with that resolution is that it demonstrates that he has truly given up on the essential democratic process he puts certain things in his resolutioneven though much more wisely drafted than most of the ones i have seen and many of those resolutions have been created by democratswhich would require supermajorities to decide that there will be an unbalanced budget some very estimable people on the republican side again whom i admire have made the point that we already have a supermajority that we have a supermajority in the twothirds required to override a veto but dear god does not anybody understand that in a government cleverly and carefully crafted to separate the powers so that no one power would become the tyrant that the veto override process is the great clash in the american political process between a convinced executive and a convinced congress that simple twothirds requirement is the only one and here we are not talking thank god and thank mr conable about anything quite as bad as a twothirds supermajority i can bring this rule to the floor only because i am convinced that it is the best rule we could possibly have for a completely outrageous situation that should never come up at this time in the flow of congress there can be all kinds of arguments made that the democrats prevented it from coming up any other time that is simply not true if the big five were going to put the heat on people some of whom are directly opposed to this proposition they could have done it earlier if they had really wanted to generate the steamand they did generate the steamit could have been done practically anytime even earlier this year now what is political about this it is inescapable to me that it is a diversion it is inescapable to me that the timing is a diversion the substance is not but the timing is a diversion now why is it upsetting me why am i worried my worry is very minor it has to do with me i am worried that i will not present this as well as it could be presented i am upset because i fear we are going to do grave damage to the republic and its processes i have been one of the earliest people to recognize that we must have a responsible process a budget process that gives us a rational approach i have been defeated by my party on occasions by both parties on occasion in seeking that opportunity the bill that we have been operating under for a number of years i crafted to a large degree and when i presented it to the house which voted virtually unanimously for it i tried to make it clear that it was not a very good bill that it needed a lot of change and that its future depended entirely on the will of the membership one of the tragedies of our time has been that in this institution we were unable to achieve what was achieved in the senate until very recently the budget resolutions have been a totally partisan matter i have no intention of trying to lay the blame for that there cannot be a partisan budget approach many of the democrats have never understood this what you do in your fight over a budget resolution is fight out the alternatives and come to a conclusion and then if you really believe in a budget process you have some responsibility that it functions and even if you do not win you need to vote for the process that may be a strange idea to some of you who have never looked at process as being that complicated and that restrictive but that is the way you are going to deal with these major problems if you ever do there are a lot of democrats who need to learn this lesson that we must have the process if we do not have a process which deals with the macroeconomic situation in the united states we will revert to the boom and bust of the period prior to world war ii administrations of great variety for years gave us a relatively steady approach to macroeconomic problems it is something that has to be done and it has to be done by this institution along with others we are dealing with the greatest single issue that faces the society the free world and all the democratic countries because none of them even the parliamentary ones have successfully dealt with it in this approach to using the constitution as the vehicle we crush the proper approach which is that we must have the will to pass legislation that will deal with economic problems and then we have the character the courage and the wisdom to deal with it in a bipartisan fashion i do not believe there is any future for this country literally if we think that one point of view by itself can prevail i do not think the democratic party by itself can prevail with the policies that we must have i do not believe that the republican party can prevail with its policies alone i am deeply committed to the notion that the only way we can function together and survive together is by coalitions of the unlike i am convinced that the good things that were done in a period of political chios in the late 1940s were done in that fashion by a great coalition of the country that put together the policies that made us live very well i think this is exactly the wrong way to go and i think we should defeat all the proposals for a constitutional amendment i think then we should return to an effort to see to it that we have an adequate budget process adequately supported by all of us and not in a narrow political way i reserve

shorted altogether 30 slots on the 21 committees of the house of representatives we have been shorted 37 slots on the subcommittees in this house the ways and means committee is the most egregious example of the despicable division which the democratic leadership in this house has visited upon we republicans i can say without equivocation that the division the slots that we republicans have been allocated on the ways and means committee in the 97th congress is a violation of every historical precedent in the house of representatives in the history of this republic why because the democratic leadership is desperate they lost the election in november 1980 they are hoping by their strangulation of this committee the ways and means committee in this house to impress to force to stifle their philosophical point of view of tax spend and elect which has run this country for the last generation i hope that the american people will understand the difference between the two major parties the difference between the two tax bills and our hope and desire that we can bring a rectification of this injustice this travesty i am reluctant as a member of this house to go outside this body frankly into the court system to ask them to look into our tent to correct an injustice but analyze for a moment what our alternative would be we could object to every unanimousconsent request that comes along we could ask for repeated quorum calls to delay everything that comes along we could in effect obstruct the processes of this house to bring its proceedings to a halt in order to bring to the attention of the people of this country the disparity we republicans have sustained in this house but would that be responsible i have to answer that no for the reason that there is legislation that the people of this country need and want not the least of which is this tax bill which we will vote on this week had we elected to go the obstructionist route nothing would move that is not in the interests f this country that to me tells me that the only alternative we really have as a practical matter is to file this suit in the unitedstates district court and ultimately i fir y believe the matter will be resolved by the unitedstates supreme court in deciding whether or not the unitedstates house of representatives is going to have to get in step with tlie vast majority of the parliaments of the free world in deciding that the allocation of slots on committees of that house is to be consistent with the division of the parties as reflected by the last election of the

this legislation if we were debating the merits of this issue before a decision had been made then i believe some of the arguments in favor of h r 6838 might have some validity but the point is the decision has already been made for the house to vote to override the administrations action would only serve to confuse our allies and adversaries as to whos in charge here during the subcommittee hearing on this bill we heard witnesses from previous administrations who believed the congress would be acting correctly by passing this legislation frankly i do not believe those witnesses would have said the same thing if the administration each of them represented had been faced with the same situation americas foreign policy must be represented by one voice and to overturn the presidents decision in this case would not serve our nations interests aside from the principle of the matter i believe the merits of the case demonstrate the president acted correctly in imposing tighter controls on the sale of oil and gas technology to the soviets if you look back at events in 1979 when the soviets invaded afghanistan and in 1981 when they increased pressure on poland thus foreing the establishment of martial law you see reactions from our european allies that were not as significant as those adopted by the unitedstates i believe the reaction was mild because of the europeans close economic and trade ties with the soviets for that reason i am concerned that increased dependence by europe on the soviets as represented by the pipeline would mehn the soviets would have even greater ability to influence european actions whether the presidents actions actually serve to block the construction of the pipeline may be debatable but the decision will unquestionably increase the costs for the soviets and will also have the effect of delaying the time when they would begin earning hard currency from the operation of the pipeline many who oppose the presidents decision on the pipeline argue that it is inconsistent with the decision to sell grain i do not believe it is inconsistent at all the decision on the pipeline denies or at least delays the soviets ability to earn hard currency the sale of grain requires the soviets to use their hard currency to purchase it from the united states in both cases the soviets balance of payments are adversely affected some have questioned the advisability of sanctions altogether yet if you revigw the reports from the soviet union following the invasion of afghanistan the recurring theme is the surprise the soviets felt at the degree of the sanctions imposed following their invasion i believe the soviets view those earlier sanctions plus the threat of sanctions before december 1981 influenced in large part a soviet decision not to invade poland unlike their actions in 1956 in hungary and 1968 in czechoslovakia the application of the sanctions in december and june further served to emphasize to the soviets the costs attached to their aggressive international behavior i am quite sure the soviets view the entire package of sanctionsthose of our allies and our ownas merely the first step of potentially greater sanctions i do not believe the soviets are willing to risk facing additional sanctions from the united states and the west by aggravating the situation in poland if we were to relax our current sanctions without any corresponding movement from the soviets in poland then we would end up encouraging them to maintain their pressure if not increase it i should add also that the aflcio supports the presidents decision on the yamal pipeline despite the hardship for individual workers and companies that union organization believes unitedstates interests are best served by maintaining these sanctions as long as martial law remains in effect political detainees continue to be held and the free trade union movement is suppressed does anyone really believe that legislation removing the sanctions would improve the situation for solidarity moreover recent reports indicate the soviets are using slave labor to build the pipeline this body is on record as consistently deploring the human rights offenses of the soviet union we must not condone the soviets use of slave labor for construction of the pipeline by voting now to make it easier for them to do so also on the issue of extraterritorial reach of unitedstates laws the antiboycott provisions of the export administration act offer effective evidence that extraterritorial extension of unitedstates laws is appropriate and valid before any decision is made on this legislation i believe it is vital to remember that if the house passes this legislation we would not be getting the administration off the hook of a bad decision we would instead be forcing the president to harden his position leaving him no leeway to seek a conciliatory solution to the disagreement that has arisen between the united states and our european allies over the pipeline i am confident the president would resist any effort to elimirate his options in trying to administer the foreign policy of this country i am sure if it came to that point he would veto this legislation and the final result would be only confusion and lack of confidence by our allies in our ability to adopt a policy and stick to it ironically some of the supporters of this legislation to lift sanctions are the same ones who not long ago argued in favor of reimposing sanctions the president had removed i urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation"],
