committees or bring them to the floor they are trying to work on a more longterm comprehensive tax reform bill as we should be here so we cant blame the democrats for that it is the republicans in the senate who have said they arent going to take this up so then the question arises why are we doing this why arent we doing something that is more urgent and more pressing like passing a department of homeland security appropriations bill and lets be clear about what the problem is there is a bipartisan bill that democrats and republicans agree on on funding the department of homeland security what some of the more extreme elements in the house of representatives on the republican side have done is they have loaded it up with all kinds of antiimmigration provisions they have decided that that is where they want the debate on immigration so all of a sudden this bill has been loaded up with extraneous issues that dont belong on this bill quite frankly we think that that is wrong and democrats in the senate think it is wrong what we are saying is actually bring before both bodies a clean bill what is so wrong with that if you dont like what the president is doing on immigration bring up a separate bill or sue him again because that seems to be what my republican friends like to do all the time but dont hold up a department of homeland security bill for a political battle on an issue

urgent deadline items that we are actually facing in fact as i travel across my district in colorado i dont hear a lot of my constituents crying out for access to sand and clay i do hear them saying dont default on the national debt do something about the budget make sure that we prevent another government shutdown yet all of those deadlines are looming while we are fiddling here with other bills that arent going anywhere and arent becoming law and have already passed this body in similar form so for the fourth time in three congresses we are going to consider a nearly identical measure that the republicans have brought to the floor despite the senates unwillingness to pick it up and the presidents opposition the socalled strategic and critical minerals production act promotes industry interests over the american peoples health and welfare the biggest conceptual problem with it is the definition that it gives of strategic and critical minerals the bill not only expands the mining companies ability to mine on public lands for minerals like gold and copper but also materials that one would think by no stretch of common sense are rare like sand and clay if we include sand from the beach or from my kids sandbox as a mineral of critical development and if we include the gravel from my driveway as a mineral of critical development i am not sure what we are excluding i think this applies to almost everything in fact i am not even sure how we are even saying the term critical and strategic can even apply here when we are talking about sand and gravel and some of the most common natural resources that we have this bill permits nearly all mining operations to circumvent the important public health and environmental review processes that are required under the national environmental policy act instead of maintaining a reasonable threshold to ensure that we focus on resources and developing resources that are actually critical for our defense or for our economy this bill expands our definition of strategic and critical effectively making it worthless by including everything and by saying everything is strategic and critical you are effectively saying that nothing is strategic and critical that is what this bill does while we are 8 days from hitting the debt limit while we are 6 days from expiring on the federal transportation authorization by the way i have to talk about how these days work because we are 8 days from the debt limit and 6 days from the transportation authorization those arent real days that americans know that is because the republicans always send this congress on vacation nearly every week so it might be 6 legislative days i think it is actually 15 or 20 days but congress isnt working for most of those while these deadlines tick members of congress are actually at home most of the time because the republican leadership wont let us work they wont let us come here they are adjourning the session that is why when something is 20

follow two distinguished colleagues from california and pennsylvania who spoke with great eloquence about the future who were addressing the issue of student loans and student loan debt that we are experiencing all across the country this evening i am here to discuss social security currently before the ways and means committee we are addressing the issue of social security that as everybody knows not only covers old age and survivorship but also disability that fund is due to expire in 2016 if congress does not take action due to be cut severely and have an impact on so many americans and yet all across this country frankly on a bipartisan basis on the committee and from without the committee people are talking about coming up with solutions for social security that is why we have introduced the social security 2100 act why 2100 well because we want to make sure that the program of social security which by law is required to make sure that it is solvent for 75 years in fact is and that is what our proposal does but i want to talk about this in terms of a pragmatic practical commonsense path forward to make sure that social security is not only there for seniors who are currently receiving it but for future generations as well social security is uniquely the most indispensable plan that the government has been committed to we have a slide that i would like to put up that demonstrates exactly how indispensable social security is today twothirds of seniors rely on social security for the majority of their income think about that for a moment of all the people that you know of all the retirees that you are associated with twothirds of them rely on social security for a majority of their income the median retirement account balance for all americansall americansis 2 500 ask yourself america is there anyone that could sustain themselves or a family or a spouse with 2 500 in their retirement accounts and savings only 14 percent of private sector workers are participating in defined benefit pensions well what does that mean that means that 86 percent of americans are not so what we are faced with in the united states congress really isnt a social security problem because we all know that social security works social security has never missed a payment and social security is there to both help people who are disabled to help the spouse and the children who are survivors after an untimely death and it is there in retirement and serves as a pension as i said before almost exclusively for twothirds of all of america so simply stated it makes no sense at all to cut social security it makes no sense at all to raise the age of social security since 2008 and the great recession and the devastation that so many americans went through people who had worked hard and played by the rules and had invested their money in 401ks well the reality is that they saw their 401k become a 101k so it is long overdue for congress to come together in a nonpartisan way to fully address this issue at the start of this session our colleagues on the other side of the aisle developed a rule i commend them for this rule the rule says that you cant just address simply disability with respect to the social security trust fund you have to address both disability and old age and survivors benefits collectively that is the way the program has always been addressed and i commend them for underscoring what is a retirement crisis and why we need to take these bold steps i say retirement crisis because you saw the statistic before where only 14 percent of the private sector workers are participating in defined benefit contributions that simply cannot sustain us what this particular chart shows is that more seniors than ever are also paying taxes on their social security benefits so we have this retirement crisis in which twothirds of americans are retiring with just about social security as their only means of moving forward their only means of sustaining themselves to further compound that problem the way the social security act was changed in 1983 has now found us in a situation in which taxable income over 25 000 for a single person is subject to being taxed and 32 000 for a married couple this is only escalating as more and more baby boomers retire into the system for example in 1998that was not that long ago26 percent of all seniors came under this law and were taxed under the current law just last year in 2014 that figure rose to 49 percent and it is only growing we need to address this issue why because more seniors out of necessity are finding themselves workingworking to make up for the loss that they incurred from 2008 forward in their 401 k s and in their investment portfolios working to make ends meet one thing seniors understand and i think america understands is this social security is not an entitlement certainly you are entitled to social security payments but why you are entitled to them because they are the insurance that you paid for it is the earned compensation that people through their hard work and sweat of their brow have put into the system the system is called fica the federal insurance contributions act those contributions have been made by all americans and as i said earlier they remain the bulk work for the nations retirement program and are the safety net that prevents seniors from retiring into poverty that allows them to exist this is the time to focus on strengthening the social security program this is the time we should be talking about expanding the social security program it is because of the retirement crisis that we find ourselves here not for lack of contribution not for lack of effort but because of the real economic conditions most families have found themselves in that is why we introduced the social security 2100 act what does it do first and foremost it doesnt raise the national debt at all it is completely paid for how do we know this because we have an actuarial report the chief actuary for social security has determined that it exceeds the 75year limits in terms of its solvency so that social security will not only be here now tomorrow and well into the future but justin bieber will be 106 years old and social security will still be there for him and for those of his generation as well it is that important and vital a program for our nation so that it needs our very specific and direct focus and attention with so many relying on social security we also need to expand its benefits we are proposing a modest 2 percent increase across the board but we are also proposing what senior citizens know already which is that the system that we have of calculating the cola is inadequate and does not work most importantly it doesnt reflect what seniors actually pay what they actually have to go through in terms of the costs of heating their homes of buying prescription drugs and of paying for the escalating costs of food and heat and energy we have devised a systemendorsed widely by groups that embrace itthat we call the cpie the consumer price index based on the actual costs of the elderly with the e standing for elderly in this circumstance it makes sure that there are sufficient amounts of money that are there to provide for our senior citizens the next thing that we do is to make sure that nobody can retire into poverty we raise the minimum benefit to 125 percent of poverty which would amount toin so many cases at the lower end of the economic scalea 50 percent increase in benefits for the poorest amongst us when i say poor i mean the working poor people who are pulled into the system again this is not an entitlement this is earned compensation this is the insurance that so many have already paid for and why this has become so important and so vital a test we also provide a tax cut for 11 million working seniors let me repeat that we provide a tax cut for 11 million seniors how do we do that as we said earlier people out of necessity have found themselves in this system they have found themselves in a position in which in retirement they are finding themselves working they work hard for their money but as i said earlier if they are single and if their combined incomes are more than 25 000 they are taxed if they are a couple and their combined incomes are 32 000 they are taxed these numbers are easily reached and are being exceeded and that is why we are recommending the tax cut by raising those limits and by providing those to working seniors and there is a value that they bring to all of our communities with the break that they need so that they can sustain themselves and can also continue to pay their way in retirement with the benefits that they have earned with the benefits that they have paid for but that havent kept pace with the economic times it provides an acrosstheboard benefit increase of 2 percent for every senior and it improves the costofliving adjustments by going to cpie as i said before a new minimum benefit to ensure that no one who has paid into the system retires into poverty is flat out fair you may ask how do you pay for this certainly at the outset of this we made the boast that this is solvent into the next century beyond the 75 years that is required signed off by the social security chief actuary who has determined the solvency of the program how do we do this first and foremost we say that we ought to increase the contribution to the fund by 1 percent now 1 percent may not seem like a lot but when you have the whole country contributing in fact it is even at that 1 percent level though we believe that especially in dealing with the times in which we are today we ought to phase that in over a 25year period what does that mean what that means is that for a worker who is making 50 000 a year for 50 cents a week as part of his or her contribution they get the most valuable governmental program in the history of this nation the program that keeps people out of poverty the program that for more than twothirds of them is the only retirement vehicle that they will have the program that is also there in disability and for survivors benefits we have so many members in this body who can tell their stories about how they would not have made it without social security both the chairman of the ways and means committee paul ryan and probably one of the foremost authorities on the issue richard neal of massachusetts benefited from social security it made it possible for their mothers to help them and their families into college and beyond and look how successful both of them have been this is americas story this is about america coming together and that is why it is around modest pragmatic straightforward proposals that dont shy away from the cost but address it head on that address it head on in a simple pragmatic commonsense manner these arent taxes these are contributions that people are making and that they are receiving a direct benefit from it is unique amongst all of the programs that we have along with the 1 percent increase phased in over 25 years which amounts to 05 percent or 50 cents a week for someone earning 50 000 or moreless if you are earning less and a little bit more if you are earning morewe are also asking the top 4 percent to pay the same rate as everyone else as you may know social security is taxed currently only up to 118 000 after that people stop paying into the system what we are saying is listen the country is going through some difficult times people especially those who work hard and play by the rulesthe working class the middle class who are suffering under thiswe ought to give them a little bit of a break not until 400 000 do we start taxing social security againexcuse measking those who are paying into the system to pay the same rate as everybody else at that level only 4 percent we ask to pay to make this fund solvent in conjunction with raising the percentage by 1 percent for the next 75 years and beyond we keep social security strong for generations to come and that is why this is such a vital and important benefit for this great nation of ours at the end of the day what has made our country great going back to those first settlers who all gathered together to help one another raise their homes and their barns and plow and sow and reap the benefits of their fields americans have rallied to come together rallied with one another from the time the thirteen colonies formed the union to today of our 50 states our states are unique our states all have special qualities but the one quality that we all share is that we are americans social security is americas program it is what roosevelt recognized as did the congresses back then the importance of dealing in our system of entrepreneurialism and capitalism and risk taking that that gives us an unbelievable strength in a global and world economy but it has to be balanced off with the value and the notion that if you work hard and play by the rules that your nation is there for you as well and that you cant retire into poverty after working all your life that some calamity or misfortune a disability a tragic death cant ruin you or your family because it is part of a larger family the united states of america god bless you god bless america thank you for listening to this presentation we have 56 original cosponsors of this bill and we know all across this country the more that we talk about this straightforward commonsense practical solution to social security americans are going to require that congress steps up to the plate and meets its responsibility and obligation to make sure that no senior no individual can retire into poverty and the system that has worked so extraordinarily well for every american is there not only today and tomorrow but well into the future without raising the national debt and only calling upon americans to do what they have done traditionally contribute to a program that guarantees a secure retirement and pension and benefits that they will reap throughout a lifetime i yield back the balance of my

even years election delays can provide opportunities for unscrupulous employers to engage in threats coercion and intimidation of workers these delays can be exploited to violate workers rights including firing prounion workers or threatening to close the plant if the workers choose to vote a certain way we all know that the sanctions against violations are insufficient to deter the unscrupulous activities including firing prounion employees researchers from the center for labor research and education at berkeley found that the longer the delay before the union election the more likely the employer was to engage in illegal conduct that violates its employees rights the nlrb election rule would help prevent the illegal intimidation and coercion of workers this regulation provides targeted solutions to discrete specifically identifiable problems the rule brings into the 21st century the updating of rules involving the transmission of documents and communications allowing you to use email and electronic communication rather than paper it will enable the board to better fulfill its responsibility to protect employees rights by fairly accurately and quickly resolving issues of representation in many cases the rule just simplifies and standardizes practices that have been common in regions all over the country already or reflects existing practices used in civil actions the rule does not change substantive law involving elections it just makes sure that you can have a timely election these modest updates provide workers and employees with reasonable time to consider unionization while preventing unreasonable delay by bad actors now this resolution isnt going to go very far the administration has already issued a statement of administration policy

timely piece of legislation i want to thank ranking member swalwell from california for his hard work on this as well i rise in support of this bill hundreds of our people have been radicalized lured to the jihadist safe haven in syria they have been joined by thousands of westerners forming a terrorist army unlike anything we have ever seen these foreign fighters represent a triple threat they strengthen groups like isis on the ground they radicalize others back home and worst of all they may be sent back to conduct terrorist attacks against us in the homeland we saw this in the streets of paris where battlehardened extremists returned from syria prepared to kill and here at home we have arrested socalled returnees from syria including one individual plotting a terrorist attack in ohio earlier this year i launched a bipartisan congressional task force on combating terrorists and foreign fighter travel one of their findings was that we must do more to track the great jihadi migration around the world our intelligence about foreign fighters in syria is improving but as we have seen the threat can change almost overnight isis is already urging its followers to go to its other sanctuaries in places like afghanistan and libya we need to stay a step ahead of this threat which is why this legislation requires the intelligence community to track extremist travel patterns and to report on a regular basis to congress it also requires agencies to monitor the number of unitedstates citizens in terror hotspots and to report on how many individuals have departed those locations this is the kind of earlywarning intelligence we need in order to create a firebreak to slow the spread of islamist terror and to keep americans from being lured to new jihadist safe havens i would like to commend the task force for their hard work on this including mr katko and let me just say this i get regular threat briefings and i have never seen a higher threat environment than we have seen since 9 11 and it is from the flow of foreign fighters we have 5 000 of them that have western passports 30 000 foreign fighters from 100 different countries 250 americans have left to join the

approach that is more accountable to taxpayers and i think it rests on governments closer to the people making more of our transportation decisions i dont think anyone is going to sit here and claim that the transit and highway system as it is done up here in washington is being done well it is chronically underfunded we are using all kinds of budget gimmicks in this bill we are doing the strategic petroleum reserve again to quote unquote pay for this somehow you are taking oil at 50 a barrel and you are projecting it to be sold for 85 a barrel so we know we have been through this a lot here i think part of the problem is if you look at our infrastructure needs most of them are intrastate not necessarily interstate and while the interstate system is very important and it needs to be maintained expanded where appropriate most of the needs that we have in a state like florida can be done at the county level or at the state level i would note that since we have had the highway trust fund since 1956 florida has paid a lot in taxes and we received about 88 cents on the dollar back so i am trying to figure out why we would want to perpetuate a system that is not fiscally sustainable and that puts more power in washington think about it most of your needs are done countywide citywide and statewide and yet people in a state like florida will pay their gas taxes that will be shipped up to washington people will fight over it politicians lobbyists and interest groups and then the money that comes back is 88 cents on the dollar i would like to send the gas tax to washington that is going to fund the actual interstate system but then leave a portion of the gas tax for state legislatures to spend or for people in local governments to spend i think you would be able to do it cheaper i think it would be more accountable to the taxpayers and i think it would be better for motorists and people who are using our transportation system so all this does it is not

been very controversialnorth carolina has gotten a bad rapand this article from abc news north carolinas controversial antilgbt bill explained the article says several civil rights groups and lgbtq advocates are organizing a rally tonight in raleigh this is from march 24 of this year north carolina to protest the states controversial passage of its house bill 2 which critics have called the most antilgbt bill in the country the article says heres everything you need to know about the bill also known as the public facilities privacy and security act which was signed into law by governor pat mccrory on wednesday what does it do house bill 2 declares that state law overrides all local ordinances concerning wages employment and public accommodations thus the law now bars local municipalities from creating their own rules prohibiting discrimination in public places based on sexual orientation and gender identity though north carolina does have a statewide nondiscrimination law it does not include specific protections for lgbtq people we keep adding letters you know we kept adding letters until we got to lgbt and now we have added q the law also directs all public schools government agencies and public college campuses to require that multipleoccupancy bathrooms and changing facilities such as locker rooms be designated for use only by people based on their biological sex stated on their birth certificate transgender people can use the bathrooms and changing facilities that correspond to their gender identity only if they get the biological sex on their birth certificate changed under the law public institutions can still offer single occupancy facilities and nobody has a problem with that if you have got a single bathroom facility that has just got one facility for going to the bathroom that is fine it can be for whoever needs to use it but they are saying as has been consistent with the history of the world for most of the worlds existence that if you according to documentation are a female you use the female restroom when it is for multiple peoples use at the same time and if by documentation you are a male you use the male facilities it has really been shocking to see how many people including singers and entertainers and different groupsi understand target now wants to make sure that boys can use girls restrooms as they please but it has been amazing that such people have been demanding that we have to let boys who want to go in little girls bathrooms go in there if a man wants to go in a little girls bathroom according to the big popular movement now for heavens sake lets let the man go in the little girls bathroom north carolina has taken action consistent with the position of the world since the world began if you are going to have a multipleuse restroom normally you have a female go to a female multiuse restroom a male go to a male multiuse restroom this article goes on it says republican lawmakers who make up the majority of north carolinas general assembly publicly unveiled the language of the bill wednesday morning it goes on and talks about its passage in less than 12 hours i am talking about after its passage the bill was approved by the house and senate or after it was brought forward the bill was passed signed by the governor lawmakers in the house voted 8325 to pass the bill the senate approved the bill 32 0 after democrats who make up the minority walked out of the chamber in protest obviously they want men to go to little girls restrooms too republicans and allies supporting the bill argued that it was necessary to protect the safety of women and children from radical action by charlotte critics of charlottes ordinance said it could have allowed men who may be sexual offenders to enter a womans restroom or locker room by claiming a transgender identity well critics of the charlotte ordinance is what the article says but actually that is not just a claim that is a fact under what north carolina was objecting to if someone who is a sexual offender has decided he wants to go in and meddle in a little girls restroom where he has no business people like the entertainer that doesnt want to go to north carolina they are saying by golly you have got to let that man go in that little girls restroom what has happened to the sense that used to be such a prominent part of this country i mean there was a very intelligent man on fox news bill oreilly who actually asked a lawyer on a panel with him on the show so they passed this law they dont want men going into the womens restroom basically was the crux of it or boys going in where little girls go he asked the question actually who are they trying to protect i couldnt believe that we have come to the point where an intelligent person would have to ask such a stupid question whether you agree or disagree with what north carolina did whom they were trying to protect it is almost rhetorical clearly whether you agree or disagree they were trying to protect the little girls 1245 it is shocking that anybody would have to ask such a question gee whom are they trying to protect by saying men cant go into girls restrooms incredible the outrage aimed at north carolina has just been incredible i see an article today by ryan lovelace from the washington examiner trump slams north carolina bathroom law says state should leave it the way it is the way apparently charlotte was going to have it was that men could go in little girls restrooms of course sexual predators who are male all they have to do is say they are transgender and they get to go in the little girls restrooms and wreak the havoc that made them a sexual predator whom are they trying to protect in north carolina they are trying to protect innocent kids who cannot protect themselves they count on adults to keep them from harm it is incredible that people are outraged at north carolina anyone who has children who are female do you really want men to say i am transgender and get to go in where your little girl is going to the bathroom where you cant go because you are not transgender you are the girls father this article says what do proponents of the bill argue it says republicans and allies supporting the bill argued that it was necessary to protect the safety of women and children from radical action by charlotte john rustin president of the north carolina family policy council testified before the senate saying that the charlotte ordinance means men could enter women restrooms and locker roomsplacing the privacy safety and dignity of women and the elderly at great risk parenthetically i noticed an article in recent days last week that indicated that one of the leading colleges in pushing for transgender restrooms has had a problemand it has come up a couple of timeswhere men would come in where women were showering go into the restroom and use their cell phone hold it up over the stall so they can film or take pictures of the female who was trying to have some privacy in a very personal act of showering or going to the bathroom what is wrong with saying do you know what when it comes to going to the restroom females will go to female males will go to male and look if you want to have a single facility for one person at a time to use or families to use to change diapers or whatever those are really handy those are very helpful my wife and i have used them ourselves raising girls it is a handy thing to have but why condemn north carolina when they are just trying to protect the privacy of girls it has already been shown that if you give guys a chance to say i am transgender and i can get to go in and film a girl in a shower there will be people that do that why not let the transgender lgbtqrstwhatever the initials arelet them have their activities where they dont impose upon the privacy of someone who wants to go to the restroom or shower without someone from the opposite sex being there with them governor mccrory wrote this statement the basic expectation of privacy in the most personal of settings a restroom or locker room for each gender was violated by government overreach and intrusion by the mayor and city council of charlotte as a result i have signed legislation passed by a bipartisan majority to stop this breach of basic privacy and etiquette which was to go into effect april i i mentioned that i understand target may now be changing their restrooms i will have to doublecheck because if they are going to be having women come to mens restrooms i wont be going to target to shop unless and until that changes usually target is great they have the restroom right there where you go in the door to the store normally you dont have to go clear to the back of the store it is a handy thing if you have to go shopping it is handy but not anymore anybody that wants to go to the restroom and have privacy from the opposite sex may need to shop elsewhere we will have to look at what they have actually done anyway this article seems to make the point that it is not such a crazy thing that north carolina has done and that is why for 99 999 percent of human history since civilization exists since we got past the caveman era when there have been public restrooms you recognize there is a difference between males and females some day it will be written in the rise and fall of the united states that the greatest freest and most powerful country in the history of the world showed symptoms of insanity when it reached the pinnacle of its greatness and successand this will be one of the symptoms that was written aboutthat they thought they were so much smarter than civilization for most of our history of the world that a difference was recognized between men and women for purposes of facilities it is a sad day for the country now i see this article from yesterday that curt schilling an espn analyst was fired over what they deemed as an offensive social media post here is what schilling said the post showed an overweight man wearing a wig and womens clothing with parts of the tshirt cut out to expose his chest it says let him into the restroom with your daughter or else you are a narrowminded judgmental unloving racist bigot who needs to die apparently this kind of thing offends espn although at one time their job was covering sports now their job is being social managers apparently in making sure that if men want to go to little girls restrooms then we let the men go to little girls restrooms this article from yesterday talking about target stores says target says transgender customers may use the bathroom of the gender with which they identify how about that et tu target so here we are at the place in our history where insanity in the name of political correctness rules the day common sense is no longer common and to the point that the current leader in the republican campaign for president even says that north carolina should not have taken action that in essence says menwhich would include sexual predatorsshould not be allowed to go in womens restrooms he wanted it left like it was so if charlotte wants to say that if you are a man and you are a sexual predator and you say you are transgender and want to go into the restroom where little girls are go ahead that is the position of the leading republican candidate i dont know hopefully that will be another one of the positions he will change but in the meantime we need to get common sense back in charge in america while we are still the great country we have

from so many distinguished members of the congressional black caucus most recently from the gentlewoman from texas with whom i serve on the judiciary committee about the importance of the moment in time in which we find ourselves right now related to not just the confederate battle flag but perhaps more importantly what is the legacy that we want to have as americans as members of congress in dealing with the complicated issue of race it is an honor and a privilege to once again have the chance to come to the house floor to have this conversation this is a most distinguished venue from which to speak to the american people an appropriate one i would add given the houses constitutional relationship to the people of america this of course being the only institution that was envisioned by the founding fathers as one in which the people serving in the institution would be directly elected by the people the senates members of course in its original constitutional version were elected by the state legislature then of course the presidency to this day is a vehicle through which the individual is selected by the electoral college so this is the peoples house the institution most intimately connected to the people of america and the place where we should be able to speak truth to power we witnessed that last week as we were forced unfortunately to discuss the issue of the confederate battle flag at a moment when people of all racesdemocrats and republicans blacks whites the extraordinary leadership from the governor of south carolina and the distinguished gentleman from south carolina jim clyburncame together at the moment when the confederate battle flag was coming down in south carolina there were members of this house trying to lift it up it was quite unfortunate that we needed to detour from this moment that we were having in america led in south carolina to address the battle flag issue on this house floor but i am hopeful that as we move forward now in a more productive way we can begin to confront some of the public policy challenges that we face in america that supporters of the confederate battle flag have fought against as others have detailed during the presentation here today the battle flag which met its initial defeat in 1865 at the end of the civil war remained largely dormant in american history until 1954 in the supreme courts decision of brown vs board of education it was decided that this facade of separate and equal was constitutionally suspect and that african americans were being denied the opportunity of being educated in quality public schools in the deep south and in other places in america really it was in the midfifties and then into the early sixties when the confederate battle flag was resurrected as a symbol of the segregationists who were fighting to uphold jim crow it was a symbol of those who were fighting to stop the efforts of courageous individuals like congressman john lewis who in 1965 was the cochair of the student nonviolent coordinating committee it was a symbol of those who were trying to fight efforts by john lewis and others to make sure that the franchisethe right to votewas colorblind in nature and that the 15th amendment could actually be brought to life all throughout america and in the deep south where there were those who were trying to prevent african americans from being able to vote the battle flag was resurrected in the fifties and in the sixties to stop certain things from happening it seems to me that rather than having the discussion about whether it should come down no reasonable person can take the position that it should have a place of honor so it is extraordinary to me that we had to take to the house floor last week and have to come to the house floor today to continue to address this issue hopefully reason will prevail over the next couple of weeks or the next couple of dayseven prior to the august recessand we can move beyond the confederate battle flag issue and address some important substantive issues that many would argue remain as part of the legacy of the confederacy we dont want to see the ghosts of the confederacy invading the united states congress from a policy perspective those nine soulsgodfearing churchgoing african americanswho were killed simply because of the color of their skin died because of someone who charged into that church with the intention of sparking a race war that was inspired in part by the confederate battle flag one of the things that has happened as a result of that tragedy is the battle flag has come down but that is just the beginning of the work that we need to do in response to that tragedy and the conditions that so many people find themselves in all across america as has been mentioned we have got to confront the gun violence issue that we have in the united states how can it be that we have 5 percent of the worlds population but 50 percent of the worlds guns it is estimated that we have more than 285 million guns in circulation nobody can give you an exact estimate because a chokehold has been placed around the federal agencies charged with preventing gun violence and dealing with gun safety in america it is an incredible act of legislative malpractice but it is estimated that we have got over 285 million guns in america isnt it reasonable particularly in the aftermath of this tragedy in charleston south carolina that we come together and figure out a way to prevent those guns consistent with the second amendment from falling into the hands of individuals who would do us harm it seems to me to be a reasonable thing that we can do as americans it also seems important that we would find a way 50 years after the passage of the 1965 voting rights act to stop trying to prevent americans from exercising their sacred franchise and participating in american democracy yet something happened in the aftermath of 2008 a real interesting moment in november of that year that seemed to have shocked a whole lot of people across this country as a result 2 years later when there was a midterm election subsequent to that there was an outbreak with this concern of voter fraud fabricated because no one can point to any evidence of an epidemic of voter fraud not a scintilla of evidence has been presented anywhere in this country that we have got a problem that needs to be addressed but we have had all of these voter suppression laws enacted that are consistent with the ghosts of the confederacy and what those folks stood for who were waving the confederate battle flag in opposition to the changes of the fifties and sixties what shocks me is that even the supreme court has gotten into the act by decimating the section 5 preclearance through claiming that section 4 is outdated and this house refuses to act on fixing the voting rights act i would argue thatagain consistent with our democracy and the spirit of coming togetherthat perhaps that is one of the things we can address so that we can take down on the one hand the divisive symbol of hatredthe confederate battle flagfrom here in this capitol and in whatever form it hangs all

about time time is running out i think right now we look at what is happening in coal country and nothing could be more alarming than what is happening this is one promise the president kept when he ran as a candidate he said you can continue to generate electric power by burning coal but if you decide to go that way we will bankrupt you that is one promise he has kept now in pennsylvania alone coal is responsible for over 40 000 jobs and 40 percent of our electric power the associated press calls it the workhorse of americas power system but the extreme overreach by the epa is threatening jobs and forcing energy costs for families and manufacturers to skyrocket which hurts every single american that is something i think the general public has to understand while maybe they dont go down in those mines and while maybe they dont bring that precious product out from underneath the ground and while maybe they dont work in a coalfired power plant one thing they do know is when they hit that switch to turn on the power it is reliable because of coal coal has always been the standard coal has always driven the fact that we not only have coal that is abundant we have coal that is accessible and we have coal that is very affordable why in the world would we go away from this workhorse of americas power system that is one of the reasons we reintroduced the coal country protection act that is h r 2637 it is just a commonsense bill that would stop any epa regulations from affecting americas power plants until four outcomes are achieved number one no job losses number two no loss in gdp or economic growth number three no higher electric rates and number four no interruption in the reliable delivery of electrical energy these are pretty commonsense goals now who would be able to verify that or who would certify well the secretary of labor could do it the congressional budget office could do it the energy information administration could do it the federal energy regulatory commission could do it and the north american electric reliability corporation could do it you said about time it is about time but it is time not just for the coal country people to stand up and fight for coal it is time for the whole country to stand up and fight for coal it is well past the midnight hour as we continue to shut down mines and lose jobs and shut down communities and raise peoples electric rates and then people at home sit back and wonder what are they doing in washington why do they continue to hurt us at every turn the answer is the people making some of this policy have never done what you have done they have never walked in your shoes they have never had to do what we have done in coal country to protect electric power why in the world would we do this now at a time when the country is looking for jobs at a time when the country is looking for less dependence on foreign nations for energy why now why mr president why continue to push in the direction you have been pushing the bottom line is this is just not about coal country this is about our whole country"], [8.463859558105469e-06, 0.4999915361404419, 1, "i thank the gentleman for yielding more than 14 years ago two jet planes were deliberately crashed into the world trade centerkilling thousands of innocent people a third plane slammed into the pentagon and a fourth plane likely destined for this very capitol complex in which we now stand was brought down by a group of courageous passengers in a field in shanksville pennsylvania as i do today i represented ground zerothe world trade center areaon september 11 2001 in the hours immediately after the attack i left washington and took the last train back to my home in new york i will never forget the moment i first saw the ravaged skyline of lower manhattan from the train windows normally on the train while going between philadelphia and new york i would look to see the first glimpse i could catch of the twin towers now what you could see were not the twin towers but long tall billowing clouds of smoke that were going straight up and then were stretching down the jersey shore the twin towers had been replaced by the brutal glow of raging fires and of black billowing smoke the train that left at 10 oclock arrived at 6 we had been held up in baltimore while they walked the tracks looking for bombs coming out of penn station at 6 oclock was like a scene from the movie on the beach for those who remember that movie nothing was moving the city at 33rd street and eighth avenue seemed completely emptyno people no cars no buses there was nothing moving as if it were completely depopulated to get home i had to call a friend to come pick me up when i went down to the world trade center the next morning the scene was absolutely horrible there was fire smoke debris twisted metal human remainstotal devastation yet even then there were signs of hope firefighters police emergency medical technicians ironworkers and construction workers of all types rushed to ground zero from around the country to offer their help messages of support and comfort flooded in from all 50 states the american people were united and determined to help new york get back on its feet the attack may have occurred in my district but it was an attack on our nation as a whole and we all recognized that in the years since the attacks america has acted as a nation to help rebuild new york and to support the responders survivors and families of the victims last year congress reauthorized the james zadroga 9 11 health and compensation act so as to provide health care and support the 33 000 responders and survivors who now live in all 50 states and in 429 congressional districts by passing a permanent health program and reauthorizing the victim compensation fund congress provided peace of mind for tens of thousands of brave americans in addition to making our responders and survivors whole congress invested billions of dollars to help rebuild lower manhattan one world trade center now fills the hole that was left in our skyline when the towers fell and businesses that were shuttered after the attack are reopened and are thriving in what was once the shadow of the towers there now stands a comprehensive museum that is dedicated to sharing the stories of september 11th and the bravery of those who risked everything to protect their fellow americans on that day and on the days following in place of the smoking hole that congressman macarthur and i saw day after day in lower manhattan there now exists a somber and inspiring memorial it is a site of remembrance and hopea place for every american to come and reflect as to what happened on that september morning and to renew our promise to never forget the events of that day it is a national memorial for a national tragedy that is why i am pleased to cosponsor the legislation introduced by my colleague from new jersey to provide federal recognition and support for the memorial this legislation will help ensure the memorial continues to provide a sacred and inspiring spot for generations to come i appreciate the bipartisan support from the members of the natural resources committee and from the house leadership in bringing this bill to the floor today i look forward to working with my colleagues on the house appropriations committee every year to ensure that the national 9 11 memorial and museum receives appropriate levels of funding i will also work with my colleagues to maintain open communications with the department of the interior to ensure the money is spent wisely and achieves our shared goal of ensuring the memorial remains a spot of reflection and peace and is accessible to millions of

sheets these days we hear of a lot of young people defined simply by their brushes with the law but for this man billy frank jr his story was so much more than the crimes for which he was arrestednot convicted i might add his rap sheet martin luther kings rap sheet rosa parks rap sheet and congressman john lewis rap sheet are just a piece of a larger narrative about the struggle for social justice billy frank jr was the pacific northwests foremost advocate for restoration of native american fishing treaty rights a dream he lived and saw realized he cherished clean water and salmon and he was a key voice in the recovery of the puget sound the largest estuary in the united states of america billy was also a proud patriot he served in the united states marine corps where ironically he was a member of the military police billy passed away a year ago may 5 but he really isnt gone his story is here in the halls of congress in which he was so often seen and which he roamed on behalf of his beloved causes including protecting the puget sound our fisheries and the cause of clean water his story is in the nisqually national wildlife refuge which we now protect to give our wildlife a clean and sustainable place to live and which was made possible by a great former member of the house of representatives norm dicks billy was born raised and grew up at franks landing which was literally just a hop skip and a jump from the wildlife refuge and is where his family lived for perhaps thousands of years he fished in the nisqually river which snakes through the nisqually wildlife refuge and that is the location of where he was arrested more than a dozen timeswell okay it was actually 59 times the bill i introduced this week h r 2270 will rename that refuge after billy frank jr and it will also make the place of the signing of the treaty of medicine creek a national historic site it will make sure that the story of that site is told especially by the descendants of those who lived that history those tribes will be involved in the development and the understanding behind that site and what it means to them now and before billy was often asked how do you do this how do you effectively advocate on behalf of clean water and salmonas he didover so many decades billy always had the same answer he would say tell your story tell your story so when people go to the billy frank jr nisqually national wildlife refuge they will be able to see whywhyhe held fishins they will see why he risked arrest so many times they will see why he ultimately worked with others to help protect his home and the home of the fish they will see why he did all these things like many young people today he fought for what he believed in and later in his life he worked with lawmakers to build consensus in fact he was a master consensus builder how do i know this well he was nominated for the nobel peace prize he actually won the extremely prestigious albert schweitzer prize for humanitarianism award and he has had not one but two books written about him so my hope is that when people drive by the sign that directs them to the refuge maybe they will feel a little bit of that billy frank jr magic maybe they will wonder who he was what he did and find out about his story for those of us who knew him it will be a great reminder of a hero in fact i would count billy frank jr a man i knew many decades and loved more than a hero he was truly a great man he was the pacific northwest equivalent of nelson mandela or martin luther king jr or desmond tutu that is how great a man he was here is what billy said i dont believe in magic i believe in the sun and the stars the water the tides the floods the owls the hawks flying the river running the wind talking they are measurements they tell us how healthy things are because we and they are the same that is what i believe in those who learn to listen to the world that sustains them can hear the message brought forth by the salmon billy frank jr and his stories have to be told and that is why i invite my colleagues today to join in cosponsorship of h r 2270 join me and all the members of the washington state house

share act this amendment directs the unitedstates fish and wildlife service to reissue a rule to delist the gray wolf in wyoming and the great lakes region which includes my state of michigan in 2011 the fish and wildlife service determined that the wolf recovered in wyoming and the great lakes and would remain recovered under federally approved state management plans i can speak from personal experience about the impact that wolves and their recovery are having on my district this photo next to me is of a constituent in my district one of his calves was attacked and eaten by a wolf which may not mean much to the opponents of this but it means pretty much to small farmers in michigan it isnt just the cattle as the number of wolves have increased well beyond the recommended number for recovery we have seen drastic declines in the deer population in northern michigan my camp has no deer the economy of the whole area is in collapse because there is no hunting anymore i understand that some are opposed to ever delisting the wolf but as numbers continue to expand we must consider the impact the wolf has on the landscape as a whole this amendment does not change the endangered
