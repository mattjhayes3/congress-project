i have advocated for changing the tone of debate that surrounds school reform too often critics point fingers instead of offering solutions that is why i am pushing for real change dramatic change in our schools that harnesses the energy of parents the community and the school to turn around our failing schools that lift up all our students now there is no denying that this approach can be challenging and hard work but research shows when communities parents and schools collaborate and work together there is nothing we cant achieve i know this because i have seen it firsthand in my district in east los angeles esteban e torres high school is a shining example of a community school its the first new school built in the neighborhood in 85 years and its facilities and classrooms

2012 tax year but what it means is that middle class americans will not have a 2 200 per family of four going into january 2013 i just want to lay that on the table because now i want to move to this

at it globally and then im going to narrow it down globally one would say that were living longer of course women are this is the actuarial genius here you know the actuarial tables that you deal with so women are living longer its always been a tradition et cetera but the body politic is living longer maybe because theyre healthier that is not the case in the span of what were speaking of because what were talking about globally or nationally are people whose beginnings are different whose lifestyles are different now i dont know but the family farmersand im not picking on that group of peoplehave worked with their hands of course they work with their mindsthey have to have a budget and make things workbut theyre in the outdoors foresters some would say well thats a healthy lifestyle

building trades those individuals who work in the energy industry in all shapes forms and sizes those who may be in the vocational trades maybe even nurses and nurses aids who are lifting patients all

immediately jump to entitlement reform between now and december 31 heres a solution the bipartisan voices have said pass the senate bill or pass the elimination of the tax cuts on the top 2 percentbut i frankly believe that 100 percent of americans will get it we cannot then jump to entitlement reform now it would not be wise it is not prudent it does not work when you talk about 65 to 67 that is a lifetime because what you do as the gentleman has said you throw seniors into the marketplace you save a buck and they have to spend two bucks three bucks four bucks and then on top of the four bucks they will have doors slammed in their face the affordable care act was premised on a 65yearold medicare admission if you willexcept for those who are disabledand therefore now you want to skew it youve already claimed that obamacare is going to raise prices look at the projection of cost to the seniors trillions of dollars that they will pay in the open marketplace but more importantly how many of the poor seniors not having the money to go into the open marketplace will drop dead im being colorful because in terms of your lifestyle some people struggle to get to 65 it makes no sense that they should be on the altar of sacrifice im passionate about this because i just dont understand why we jump so far i say members lets be deliberative you cannot throw it out and say oh thats what were going to do when you dont know the numbers you dont know the ultimate results you have not done an analysis on what seniors of this age what are their particular work histories maybe we will have 40 years from nowlet me go 20 years from now well have all white collar seniors i dont know what we have now and therefore i cant judge that 65 for one person is 65 for everybody let me say this

me finish on this note i sat down with doctors and i posed a question doctors have a sense of pride they like their work and they think they can keep us healthy they could have said a number of things to me well if we stay on a nutritious diet and if we do our exercise i can see that in the future they did not say that they shook their heads and they said it is unbelievable it wont work it doesnt work its not a good answer they were against raising it on the basis of medical grounds so let me just say this i hope that we stand firm our caucus i hope we will work with the white house i know they are speculating over a number of opportunities and options but my perspective is you go for this tax relief and you put on the table for deliberative consideration what is the best approach to

another 6 000 will die this impacts all women of all backgrounds and my interest is to make sure that every subset has a seat at the table chairman young so that no matter what ethnic background you come from you will not in essence suffer the opportunity for full research my amendment was 500 000 it is in tribute to the honor and the leadership and the life of yolanda williams i would like to ask my colleagues here on the appropriations committee to allow me to engage with you and to possibly modify as we go forward language to just say that this money will be available for difficult strains of cancer so that her life will be honored and that we would be able to move forward in conclusion i would indicate that i had the privilege and honor of paying tribute to ms williams at her homegoing service i want to offer to her family again her husband her children her mother and all her family members my deepest sympathy for this valiant american woman with that i know that we will work together mr chair i rise today in support of my amendment 67 to h r 2219 the fy2012 department of defense appropriations act my amendment would increase funding under title vi defense health programs by 500 000 in order to fund research related to triple negative breast cancer and will be offset by reducing the general operations and maintenances and activities of the department of defense triple negative breast cancer is a specific strain of breast cancer for which no targeted treatment is available the american cancer society calls this particular strain of breast cancer an aggressive subtype associated with lower survival rates i offer this amendment to increase funding for research in order to develop a targeted treatment for the triple negative breast cancer strain breast cancers with specific targeted treatment methods such as hormone and gene based strains have higher survival rates than the triple negative subtype highlighting the need for a targeted treatment breast cancer accounts for 1 in 4 cancer diagnoses among women in this country it is also the most commonly diagnosed cancer among african american women the american cancer society estimates that in 2011 more than 26 000 african american women will be diagnosed with breast cancer and another 6 000 will die from the disease between 2002 and 2007 african american women suffered a 39 percent higher death rate from breast cancer than other groups african american women are also 12 percent less likely to survive five years after a breast cancer diagnosis one reason for this disparity is that african american women are disproportionally affected by triple negative breast cancer more than 30 percent of all breast cancer diagnoses in african american are of the triple negative variety black women are far more susceptible to this dangerous subtype than white or hispanic women last month i spoke at a funeral for yolanda williams one of my constituents in the 18th congressional district of texas yolanda died from her battle with triple negative breast cancer like many other women who are diagnosed with this aggressive strain she did not respond to treatment yolanda wife and mother of two daughters was only 44 years old this strain of breast cancer is not only more aggressive it is also harder to detect and more likely to recur than other types because triple negative breast cancer is difficult to detect it often metastasizes to other parts of the body before diagnosis seventy percent of women with metastatic triple negative breast cancer do not live more than five years after being diagnosed research institutions all over the nation have started to focus on this dangerous strain of breast cancer in my home city of houston baylor college of medicine has its best and brightest minds working tirelessly to develop a targeted treatment for the triple negative breast cancer subtype it is time for the department of defense to follow that example and commit additional funding to study the triple negative strain i urge my colleagues to join me in protecting women across the nation from this deadly form of breast cancer by supporting my

members for their leadership today the people of the united states sent about 1 billion overseas to countries from whom we bought imported oil this is 1 billion that could have been spent to employ american construction workers to give more activities to american research scientists to reward the investment of american entrepreneurs and to create domestic energy and american jobs here in the united states one of the most effective ways to create a nearly 200 billion annual stimulus program paid for entirely by private sector dollars and not by government would be to dramatically reduce the amount of oil we import into our country this is an issue on which i think there is strong agreement we obviously part company on exactly how to do that and i think this bill illustrates three of the ways in which there is some disagreement let me begin by thanking the chairman and the ranking member for what i view as a very wise decision to make a funding investment in nuclear waste disposal at the yucca mountain facility this is a very controversial issue particularly in the other body but i think that clean and wellmanaged nuclear energy is a key part of this countrys economic future sadly there has been a backpedaling from years of research and investment in the yucca mountain facility i think that the geological evidence is compelling and i think that the national security arguments are compelling i think that the best way for us to dispose of nuclear waste at one site is as isolated from any population center and geologically insulated from any water table that would be nearby i think that the yucca mountain site has been proven to be the right move i think for unfortunate political situations weve not invested in that i commend the chairman and the ranking member for reversing that decision to the extent possible in this bill and for moving forward with the further exploration of that option one of the areas of the bill in which i would agree with mr visclosky is somewhat disappointing is its relatively meager investment in alternative renewable energy now i do think as the president has said and as our speaker has said that an alloftheabove energy independence policy is the right choice for our country so we must understand that investing in wind or solar or geothermal or hydrogen is not meant to be completely in lieu of more traditional fuels its meant to be a supplement and a transition i think that the transition here is insufficient for the possibility of powering our country through wind and the growing solar industry our state of new jersey is actually number two in solar energy in the country which is i think a tribute to our innovation given our relative climatological disadvantage relative to other states there is promising research in hydrogen and other areas i think that we are being frankly somewhat shortsighted and pennywise and poundfoolish by not making a more robust investment in these areas of alternative energy in this bill which leads me to my third point i understand the justification not by the subcommittee chairman or the ranking member but by the budget resolution that was passed the justification for what i view as an unduly meager investment in alternative energy is because of the budget allocations adopted by the house several weeks ago"], [1.5497207641601562e-06, 0.5000015497207642, 0, "i yield

about 15 acres are currently the site of the existing native health facility and of proposed longterm care facilities and employee housing the subject lands have already been conveyed by the secretary to the association through a quit claim deed the federal indian health laws however under these laws transferring a land through the use of a quit claim deed could present some obstacles for the future use of the land by the association h r 443 addresses this problem by directing the secretary to convey the property through the use of a warranty deed this method provides clean title to the land the administration testified in support of the land transfer and we have heard no other objection to this bill the bill was referred to the committee on energy and commerce the chairman of that

noncontroversial bill that will provide the centers for medicare medicaid services cms with additional flexibility in imposing and enforcing penalties on clinical laboratories under the public health service act the committee on energy and commerce has a long history of being vigilant with respect to quality and safety standards for clinical laboratories in fact the public health service act standards for labs originated in this committee when john dingell ed madigan ron wyden and i sponsored the legislation in the 1980s all laboratories in the united states must be certified and meet certain quality and safety standards to maintain certification laboratories must periodically perform proficiency tests which measure the quality of a labs work these proficiency tests must be performed inhouseas the test is intended to measure that specific labs quality and competency if a lab is found to have intentionally referred a proficiency testing sample to another laboratory the secretary of hhs must revoke that labs clia certificate for at least 1 year thereby preventing it from billing medicare or medicaid for that period in addition the owner or operator of any lab that has had its clia certificate revoked is barred from owning or operating any cliacertified laboratory for 2 years current law does not allow the secretary any flexibility in imposing these penalties for labs that improperly refer proficiency testseven for an unintentional referral equally importantly there have been a number of changes in the organization and delivery of health care since these penalties provisions were enacted in particularthe growth of health systems that have many providers joining together to operate under the same umbrella in the case of laboratories one hospital system may own and operate a number of labs if one lab is found to have a proficiency testing violation all of the labs under the hospitals system would be barred from medicareeven if those labs had no quality or proficiency testing issues this is not a sensible result this legislation would address that problem first h r 6118 ensures the statute is clear on the point that no proficiency testing sample may be referred to another laboratory even if such referral would be part of the testing labs standard procedure for patient specimens a point of existing law on which some providers have been confused second it grants the secretary discretion in determining whether to revoke a labs clia certificate for improper referrals of pt testing samplesto account for the case of unintentional error finally the bill would grant the secretary discretion to apply alternate sanctions in lieu of the 2year owner operator ban if a clia certificate has been revoked due to an improper proficiency testing referral correcting the problem of having to ban all labs in a health system even if the others had no known problems the taking essential steps for testing act would address that issue striking a balance to ensure quality protections remain yet giving the secretary the flexibility to more appropriately tailor penalties for violations of the law im pleased to support this bill today"],

months and 25 days then 6 months and 91 days and now were talking about another 3month extension lets just do it thats why theres instruction to accept the senate bill if we know what we need then

are small businesses trying to provide jobs trying to be able to build a future i live in western colorado my district encompasses a good portion of the entire state of colorado the eighthlargest congressional district in the united states 54 000 square miles the number one employer there small business traveling through that district i found it remarkable as i have stopped into those small businesses visited with the owners sole proprietorships sub s corporations llcs people just trying to make a living as i visited in those communities with county commissioners with city council members one message comes through loud and clear government is overregulating america it is hurting our ability to truly be able to get americans back to work congressman west just mentioned a very important figure in this country we are paying 1 75 trillion a year in terms of regulatory cost that is impeding americas ability to be able to get back to work now some of our friends always want to take that to the extreme saying that we want to eliminate all regulations its not the case when we go back to the beginning of the 20th century when we were starting to build cars in this country in new york city there were two automobiles two cars they ran into each other so stoplights are not a bad idea but the government has overreached it is hurting small business and our opportunity to truly be able to grow america let me tell you a story about a constituent of mine he started out with nothing he and his wife invested and they scraped together dollars and worked hard and over the course of the years theyve been able to build a small car dealership in western colorado he called me up the last few days and he said washington simply doesnt get it they seem to believe that they need money more than we do here at home and that brings us back to a lot of the conversations which we have been having over these last few days in terms of the debt and the deficit in this country we currently have a debt in this nation of 14 3 trillion come the end of september were going to be adding on another 1 4 trillion on top of that national debt a crushing burden on the promise of america his granddaughter she isnt old enough really to know how much she owes but her portion of that national debt is now well in excess of 45 000 if our grandchildren are going to inherit the promise of america we have to restrain we have to slow down we have to reduce the spending in washington d c we simply cant afford it the numbers are too high our colleagues will tell us that taxes are the answer they like to call it a balanced approach we need more of your money because washington needs it more they failed to point out that through the bills that they have passed through this chambercongressman west and i we werent here we didnt help create the problem but we are certainly here to try to help solve the problem they increased the debt on the backs of the american people when they passed obamacare the governmentrun health care im concerned about that because it is hurting jobs in america that small businessman who started that business from nothing and was able to grow that car dealership is afraid to hire because he doesnt know what the costs are going to be from the governmentrun health care well weve got a pretty good ideaat least the upfront costs its costing us better than 1 trillion our senior citizens indeed are worried about that through the actions of our counterparts we saw that 562 billion was cut out of medicare to be able to fund that program and starting in january this coming year the president will appoint his 15member commission to start rationing health care for senior citizens were fighting to stop that connectivity which we see in our economy between government regulations excessive taxation and having too many people in washington who have never gotten dirt under their fingernails theyve never met a payroll theyve never created a job theyve never worked in the private sector thats the disconnect between here and at home we have people right now that are gathering around their kitchen tables they are looking at the resources that they have coming in and know that they cant spend more than they take in tomorrow morning those small businesses are going to unlock the doors they know that they have to spend within the limitations of the income that they have fortynine of our states live under a balanced budget requirement just like the men and women who live in the communities of those states isnt it about time isnt it about time that washington applied the same principles that they expect out of every american every american family to apply to washington d c some will say no but thats a challengemore

truly made this country the freest the richest and the greatest nation on the face of the earth and that the earth will truly ever see american entrepreneurship american knowhow but we have to have the freedom the resources and the opportunity to do that the government is no longer the steppingstone to success in this country but has indeed become a stumbling block this is our chance this is our
