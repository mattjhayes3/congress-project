sought the return from guyana of laurence layton who was charged in that murder by the federal court in ryans home district outside san francisco to lead this sensitive and delicate mission to pick up layton an associate of former cult leader jim jones the unitedstates marshals service chose howard turner of pittsburgh previous missions had failed to win laytons release from guyana one of turners main difficulties was to arrive at this small south american country via a circuitous route through the caribbean without publicity because turner and his two assistants paul pongrace and stan holland were armed getting in and out of various airports was no simple matter the american embassy in guyana handled the secret release of layton to the marshals just before their plane took off for trinidad by the time they arrived in new york city the word of the arrest had leaked out escorting layton to his arraignment there flying him to san francisco and delivering him safely to the county jail from the airport were made difficult by hordes of newsmen the account of this complicated but successful assignment is featured in the pentacle the bimonthly magazine of the unitedstates marshals service marshal turner and the extradited prisoner larry layton are pictured on the cover i want to share the article so the public can take pride in the ability and professionalism of this arm of the justice department and of the particular officers who carried out the mission the extradition op laurence john layton on october 9 1980 a federal grand jury in the northern district of california indicted lauence larry layton for conspiring with former cult leader jim jones in the murder of unitedstates congressman leo ryan in guyana the federal court jurisdiction that issued the charges and the bench warrant for laytons arrest includes ryans home district outside san francisco since no witnesses were available the guyanese earlier acquitted layton of the airstrip slayings but had planned to hold him on other charges until the united states intervened charging that layton also attempted to murder richard dwyer deputy chief of the united states mission in guyana the grand jury based its indictment on a statute that makes it a crime to kill a congressman or an internationally protected person what follows is unitedstates marshal howard turners personal account of subsequent events which he obligingly reconstructed at our request little did i know that the events on the west coast and in south america would affect my life in distant pittsburgh and turn my already harried schedule into 27 days of mad rush and constant tension on october 27 at approximately 1100 hours i received a phone call from howard safir assistant director for operations during the conversation safir said the director had selected me to lead the mission to pick up layton who was then being held by guyanese authorities in that nations capital georgetown safir told me that thomas kupferer chief of enforcement operations for the service and carole shaffer administrative assistant would coordinate details of the mission from washington d c safir added that i should pick two of my assistants to accompany me i chose inspector paul pongrace and deputy stan holland due to international complications there were false starts and at least three plan changes causing physical and emotional stress that cannot be measured finally headquarters gave us the green light and on november 19 we left the greater pittsburgh international airport on a 9 40 flight bound for miami prearranged communications and coordination with state department officials along our preplanned route through the caribbean facilitated our movements through customs and immigration despite the complexity of the planning and the many stops on our route to guyana we had to keep our mission secret we feared that if word leaked out about our purpose then the guyanese might be reluctant to release layton to us no one wanted to take any chances because previous missions had failed for similar reasons replete with details of the gruesome mass murders and suicides newspaper and tv reports were noting the second anniversary of the jonestown deaths since this coincided with our trip keeping it quiet became particularly difficult meanwhile a congressional committees intent to hold hearings on ryans murder was also making headlines therefore we intended to keep a low profile when we arrived at the miami airport at 12 15 inspector jim simmons of the unitedstates marshals office met us and presented us with a copy of the indictment against layton two photographs of him and an fbi rundown on his personal history when problems came up with our next flight headquarters officials intervened and we managed to get tickets on an antillean airlines flight which took us on a circuitous route to guyana our scheduled arrival time in georgetown changed from 8 55 to 4 15 when we got off the plane in portof spain trinidad we noticed three linesone for citizens one for visitors and one for passengers changing planes since uniformed officers manned all three lines we immediately realized we might have problems explaining our guns we decided we had better seek out the chief immigration official at the airport when we found him we told him our problem explained our duties and went over our arms and ammunition with him finally he gave us a security clearance and escorted us to the next flight bound for guyana at 2 49 at 4 23 we were met at the guyana airport by the unitedstates counsel who took care of problems with the immigration and customs officials and introduced us to the chief of police the american diplomats had taken care of everything so we did not

the conclusion of the ford founman dation the carnegiemellon institute ie u m the harvard business school an most recently the department of energys own solar energy research institute study the same results were confirmed by the energy research advisory board of the department of energy just last month it just so happens that the conservation and renewable strategies recommended by these studies are also the most job intensive and require the least capital an important contribution could be made to our full employment objectives therefore if we were to reverse the reagan energy policiesdrop the subsidization of capital intensive nuclear projects that produce only electricity which accounts for only 7 to 8 percent of our oil useand invest much more capital in energy efficiency improvements to give just one example the weatherization program proposed for elimination by the reagan administration saves oil at an average price of just 10 per barrel as opposed to 30 per barrel for nuclear energy and 70 to 100 per barrel for synthetic fuelfor which we have established an 88 billion synthetic fuels corporation whereas nuclear and synthetics produce few jobs and require huge

constitutional convention in buffalo new york may 30th through june 1 1944 the polish american congress as its first order of business sent a memorandum to president franklin delano roosevelt urging him with supportive historical and demographic data not to recognize de facto annexation by moscow of the polish territories wrestled at that time by the soviet forces from the retreating german army the memorandum expressed fear that the soviets will impose communist tyranny not only in the provinces already annexed but in the rest of poland west of the chimerical curzon line on that same day may 30 1944 the senate and the house of representatives passed the sense of congress resolution advising president roosevelt to support polands right to freedom independence and territorial integrity in response to its memorandum the polish american congress received ambiguous statement coached in officialese double talk then on february 4th through 11th 1945 came the yalta agreement which deprived poland of nearly half of its rightful territory and declared on paper that new poland should be a free independent democratically governed state the signatoriesthe united states united kingdom and the soviet union solemnly declared that the execution branch in poland will be a government of national unity which should include on equal basi representatives of the polish legal governmentinexile in london and communist activists who were already setting up some administrative units in territories left to poland after the yalta partition the legal polish government in london was not consulted or even properly informed about this particular yalta decision this cavalier treatment flaunted the fact that the polish government in london had third largest armed forces on the western fronts the yalta agreement reached it would seem under the spell of josip stalin and supported by misguided misinformed or outright prejudicial communist apologists in the west was a tripartite fait accompli even so it had a slim chance of winning reluctant concensus among nations of continental eurpoe however the yalta agreements and declarations were never implemented or put to test due to the singlemindedness and intrasigence of the soviet unions aggressive policies that by the end of 1945 brought part of the central and the entire eastern europe under complete russian domination these were in our times the initial acts of soviet aggrandizement and the wests accession to kremlins design for conquest they were the omens of the cold war naive apologists and certain intellectuals in the west who propagate the russian version of history told us at the time of yalta and are telling us today that the soviet union was and is justified in brutal subjugation of eastern europe because it needs protection for its western borders protection from what these apologists and disoriented historians never accepted one single fact that was obvious throughout centuries that russias fixed purpose of world domination has been the same under tsars and under communist tyrants her juggernaut eastward in asia her struggles for complete control of the dardanelles her annexation of vast polish territories in the 18th century and in 1945 her current incursion into afghanistan her designs to the persian gulf her meddling in south america and africaare all integral parts of the same andin russian mentalityimmutable pattern of progression toward world domination what happened some 37 years ago in eastern europe and at yalta is a matrix for the soviet unions current plans and activities currently the kremlin is shouting and some misguided or outright prored intellectuals are parroting the line that the poles want too much the poles are troublemakers they go too far with their solidarity movement they are never satisfied with the status quo they shout these inanities in a crude effort to minimize the universal acclaim earned by poles for their struggle to regain basic human rights in their national existence todays struggle in poland is as crucial as it was in the closing months of world war two only this time it has different dimensions and is waged in the civic sociological cultural and economic areas without resorting to arms or to any form of physical violence nonetheless it is a struggle which can influence events in east europe and remind the west that freedom as a godgiven attribute of man is indivisible the polish american congress was right in 1944 in its message to president roosevelt and it is eminently right in our times to wholeheartedly support president reagans just stern and securityminded policy in dealing with the soviet union it is also subscribed with appreciation to the statement and declarations of secretary of state alexander haig jr and defense secretary caspar weinberger regarding the soviets we favor negotiations that would bring a measure of stability and security in europe and the rest of the world but as president reagan has firmly and convincingly stated we will enter these negotiations from the position of strength to which we addwithout the wishful thinking that has been and remains the hallmark of

intend to take the full hours time but i have found the colloquy this afternoon to be invaluable i believe that is is absolutely essential as we begin to prepare within this body to correct the tremendous depression we find within the farm economy today that we make all the members aware of the gravity of the situation they must also understand how serious the situation is across the landnot just in feed grains and wheat not just in livestock not just in dairy but in every sector within the farm economy it is my understanding that the national news media recognizes how difficult this situation is and is focusing their attention in many of these areas i think it is to their credit and certainly at long last to the credit of american agriculture that they are getting the message out we have talked about some very grim statistics this afternoon as we look upon the chart today i think i would be remiss if i did not add that these statistics while very grave they really do not tell the whole story those statistics of course are the worst that we have seen in perhaps 50 years in terms of income in terms of the exodus in farm numbers off the family farm and in terms of what little price they are getting for the products that they are currently receiving i think one of the most graphic demonstrations of how serious the situation is was given to me just this morning leroy schecher is the manager of one of the rural electrics in south dakota and his office contracted with the south dakota press association clipping bureau for the last 45 days during that time the clipping bureau was directed to find and to retrieve every one of the auction sales by date within the state of south dakota during that 45day period the clipping bureau was then directed to send the clippings of every one of the auctions the announcements for those auctions to the bison rural electric association office whereby upon receipt of those clippings they were put into the form of a scrapbook i have before the body this scrapbook right now they began on march 13 and they ended this project on april 27 45 days i have before the body by date each one of those clippings beginning on march 13 and they are just incredible h 1796 co this scrapbook contains 320 farm auctions within the state of south dakota a state mind you that only has 680 000 people a fourth of which represent our farm population day after daymarch 20 ed and doris satterness from bryant march 27 lanny and valine hutzebos the owners of a farm outside of pipestone april 13 james and rose watenbach springfield april 14 merlin adal parker march 22 a land auction outside of the sioux falls area by martin and eileen nelson all told this document represents all of the auctions in a 45day period in south dakotamarch 13 to march 27 320 farm auctions that comes to 6 8 farm auctions per day so what we find as we look across those statistics is that the human element here is even more dramatic so many people are being forced off the farm and having to look for a new livelihood it is all so similar to what the conditions weie in the great depression of 1929 through 1939 so the message in agriculture today is depression it is not a recession it is not a temporary downswing but a downright bona fide depression i do not think there is another time in the state history of south dakota where we can point to 320 auctions in a 45day period i think we have to recognize how serious this situation is i think that if we look to farm income alone we can demonstrate why this farm auction sale is going on the impact on agriculture in south dakota is severe i think we have to recognize that agriculture not only in south dakota but in this land is the largest industry that this country hasthe largest industry when we find that industry as we do now in the depths of a depression we need not wonder why the ripple effect has had the same impact throughout our economy today i think again as we take out the special orders this afternoon it would be foolish for us to talk about how serious the situation is without offering some substantive way in which we can bring ourselves out of the depths of this depression rhetoric alone is not going to solve the problem simply citing statistics or talking about the impact these statistics have on individuals is not going to solve the problem rather i think it is important that we commit ourselves to act so it is that a number of us in the last couple of months have felt it imperative that we begin to try to make this congress respond we want a call to action in response to the great depression we find in agriculture in 1982 the farm crisis group was organized specifically for that purpose it represents many of those farm state congressmen

strike the requisite number of words i rise in strong support of the refugee assistance amendments of 1982 as the representative of san joaquin county one of the most heavily impacted refugee areas in the united states i can attest to the importance of a dependable program of cash and medical assistance reimbursement to the states an estimated 12 500 refugees live in san joaquin county and make up 3 45 percent of the countys population of 365 000 the presence of so many refugees in a county which is experiencing an 18 1percent unemployment rate is particularly sensitive as many lack the skills and language ability to compete for scarce jobs during these times of economic adversity i regularly receive complaints from constituents about the refugee ii13755 presence some constituents are resentful about the federal benefits refugees are receiving which are not available to them with unemployment as high as it is and with decreased funding for social programs it is hard to be charitable nevertheless i believe the majority of my constituents want the refugee population to suceeed they are here now and they will be here in 10 years and it behooves us to provide the services and training to help speed their assimilation into contributing members of society no one wants this more than the refugees themselves we know the refugees need help and to ignore this would be a grave abdication of federal responsibility that is why i believe we cannot establish the cap on federal reimbursement which the administration would like the committee bill clarifies the intent of congress that the states will be reimburscvd 100 percent not up to 100 percent as was previously contained in the lawfor the expenses they incur in relation to the refugees already california is expecting a shortfall in its federal reimbursement and although the magnitude of this shortfall is being debated we must assure the states that they will receive 100percent reimbursement more stringent state department guidelines are expected to reduce the southeast asian refugee flow by about 30 to 40 percent a 1year reauthorization of the program and the authorization of such sums as needed is the most flexible approach to varying refugee numbers and assimilation rates the san joaquin county administrators office reports that almost 8 000 of the countys 12 500 refugees are receiving afdc and cash assistance i am encouraged by the provisions in the committee bill that provide for closer coordination between the voluntary agencies and the welfare offices specifically welfare offices are required to notify promptly the sponsoring voluntary agency whenever a refugee applies for welfare voluntary agencies are required to notify welfare offices whenever they learn that a refugee has declined an appropriate job offer this latter requirement will lead to the termination of cash assistance for that refugee after an administrative hearing the bill also provides for line items of 100 million for social services such as english language training job training and job placement and 14 million for medical screening and initial treatment social services funding will target money toward assimilation efforts and the medical assistance will relieve the states and localities of the burden of paying for the health needs of the refugees as the committee report notes indochinese refugees have tended to concentrate in certain geographic areas california has approximately 40 percent of all indochinese refugees admitted since 1975 and 78 percent have been placed in 10 states for whatever reasonsclimate an established asian community the relatively higher welfare benefits or the free community college system in californiamy state has been a popular site for secondary migration and san joaquin county has accepted its share of migrants the county administrators office estimates that 7 000 or 56 percent of the refugees have come through second ary migration

allowance system was developed to assure that eligible individuals would not be precluded from participation in training programs because of an inability to pay for the costs of participation under the previous program employment and training policy was administered directly from the federal government to local prime sponsors the state had no coordinating function h r 5320 provides for statewide coordination of employment and training programs the governor is authorized to develop a coordination and special services plan plans for employment and training programs conducted under this act and plans for employment service programs must fit into this overall plan in order to receive certification additionally employment service plans must be developed jointly with the prime sponsor other factors that separate this bill from those of the past include a displaced worker training program funds provided to prime sponsors as single grants a single eligibility criteria for participants and the requirement of local matching funds for some por tions of the program these are only a few key differences between ceta and h r 5320 but they are critical in spite of the many important and meaningful changes that have been incorporated into h r 5320 there are several aspects of the bill that warrant attention and refinement the amendments which mr jeffonds and i will offer address the concerns of the republicans in the education and labor committee and will bring the bill closer to a workable compromise with the other body they will also help insure presidential approval of the final product of that conference their purpose is to strengthen further the provisions in this bill which correct the weaknesses of previous employment and training programs as a balance between the permissive allowance provisions contained in current employment and training programs and the strict prohibition against allowances in the senate bill the house bill contains a needsbased systema provision suggested initially by the ranking republican member of the employment opportunities subcommittee this system restricts allowance payments so that only those most in need receive funds of particular concern for example are the eligible participants who would not have access to training because they do not have the necessary funds to pay for transportation to the training or worksite we do not want to deny training to individuals who are motivated to re ceive it because they cannot afford the costs of participation on the other hand we do not want to provide incentive for participants to remain in the program for as long as possible because allowance payments are greater than entry level job wages we cannot afford to divert scarce resources from the direct training services to allowance payments the needsbased allowance system is a remedy for this concern in keeping with this premise an amendment will be offered to satisfy the republican concern that maximum funds under this program are devoted to the direct provision of training the amendment states that not less than 70 percent of the funds received by a prime sponsor shall be used to provide direct training services to participants this amendment allows up to 30 percent to be used for administrative costs supportive services and wages allowances and stipends we must insure that a greater share of the funds is directed toward training not income maintenance i believe that this amendment accomplishes that goal further it has long been true that republicans desire to involve the private sector more in the total fabric of publicly funded employment and training programs eighty percent of all jobs are in the private sector it is imperative to have the insight and participation of the private sector in the determination of the types of jobs for which to train participants the necessary skills that are required for the jobs available in the area and the areas of potential job growth if a true partnership of local governments can be developed with the private sector an acceptance and support of public job training programs can be fostered among the private sector without a commitment to job training programs by the private sector an unnecessary barrier to placement of participants in unsubsidized jobs is created i intend to offer an amendment that will clarify the initial planning authority of the private industry council this amendment does not change the requirement in the bill that both the prime sponsor and the pic must agree to the plan before it is transmitted for approval the balance between the pic and the prime sponsor is retained if the business community perceives that its role is only to approve a plan after it has been developed by the prime sponsor it is likely to take its role seriously because this program will be judged by the successful job placement of participants an active role for the private sector is critical a major weakness in previous employment and training programs was the lack of clarity among the roles of the federal state and local governments under these programs the federal government held the responsibility for designating monitoring and auditing over 450 prime sponsors this administrative structure was at best unmanageable the coordinating role given the state under this bill is a step in the right direction it will help to reduce overlap and duplication of services with scarce resources this reduction is essential this improvement is not enough an amendment i will be offering balances the role of the state with that of the federal government federal oversight is retained and overall performance criteria are established at the federal level the states are given the authority to designate prime sponsors and to approve community job training plans pics and prime sponsors still retain their right toappeal these decisions to the secretary the states will be the direct recipient of federal funds with a prescribed passthrough of funds to the prime sponsors this reduces the federal oversight function to the 50 direct recipients of funds and transfers several of the functions previously held by the federal government to the state governments while retaining the local role of plan development and program implementation republicans support a federal policy for employment and training as embodied in h r 5320 the amendments i have already described are designed to strengthen even further the elements of the bill that are integral to the success of job training programs of a different nature are two othdr amendments that will be offered to the labor standards section they clarify reduce and eliminate redundant and unnecessary federal labor standards that have been inappropriately inserted in the bill the amendments assure that federal osha applies where applicable and where not applicable the secretary shall apply appropriate standards with regard to participants similarly state workers compensation laws shall apply to participants but they shall august 4 1989 be given to participants but where they are not applicable the secretary may assure that insurance coverage for injuries suffered by participants is secured it is my desire to see that all participants are treated the same as similarly situated persons not treated differently or given special benefits because of participation in the programs established by the act it is clear that such participants could not benefit from funds contributed for their retirement rather than divert these funds from training an amendment will be offered to prohibit contributions to retirement systems or plans since public service employment is no longer a concept contained within this bill contributions to retirement systems or plans are not appropriate other amendments address issues where the bill as presently written may conflict with areas under the national labor relations acts jurisdiction my amendments will allow the nlra to govern where it is presently applicable but still addresses the concerns of proponents of the bill so that funds cannot be improperly used and collective bargaining contracts cannot be impaired without concurrence of the parties to those contracts the final amendment distinguishes between the roles of the authorizing and appropriating committees h r 5320 contains an authorization level of 5 4 billion for fiscal year 1983 the amendment that will be offered changes this figure to such sums as may be necessary the republicans on the education and labor committee believe it is their responsibility to establish the framework for a federal job training program this framework must be defensible and must meet the needs of the eligible participants however the responsibility for establishing the allocations for this program within the context of the economy and the need for a responsible federal budget lies with the appropriations committee republicans attempted to change the authorization level in committee but were unsuccessful due in part to the lack of a first budget resolution at time the bill was considered now that the budget resolution has been adopted a specific authorization provision is misleading it creates the false expectation that the total amount will be appropriated an action that is highly unlikely the appropriations must be made with consideration for the needs of other programs and for basic economic and budgetary constraints h r 5320 is the result of a long process of compromise and negotiation since the first hearing was held in november of last year the members of the employment opportunities subcommittee have considered a wealth of information regarding employment and training programs the efforts of mr hawkins and mr jeffords in this process must again be noted without their knowledge leadership and willingness to compromise we would not be where we are today the end result of this process is a proposal for federal involvement in job training policy that does not perpetuate the errors of the past but instead incorporates improvements that have been determined to be essential to the success of job training programs although i support the improvements that have been incorporated into h r 5320 i believe there are a few areas where refinement is necessary the republican amendments to this bill will insure that h r 5320 does not fall victim to the errors of the past and will conform the bill to present budgetary realities adoption of these amendments will provide the house with a sound and realistic proposal with which to go to conference with the other body i am confident that the house will realize the value of these amendments and will recognize that h r 5320 is a significant piece of legislation one that is an integral part of an economic recovery program"], [0.5397474467754364, 0.4602525532245636, 1, "i rise in support of h r 6444 the patent term restoration act and urge my colleagues to adopt this

accruing to the states and cities as a result of money spent by foreign visitors are impressive the unitedstates travel data center has calculated that 11 cents of every dollar that a tourist spends comes back into the public treasuries in the form of taxes either federal state or local it is for these reasons the united states has become dependent on the international tourism dollar to help offset our balanceofpayments deficit in addition such expenditures provide jobs for close to 7 million americans a significant proportion of which are women youth and minorities realizing that travel and tourism is the largest single employer in 14 of our 50 states my state of florida included and the second and third largest private employer in at least 38 states one can truly appreciate the significance of the industry to our economic wvellbeing i hope today that the house will overwhelmingly pass this legislation because it is only through a new tourism policy that we can create the appropriate atmosphere which will lead to continued growth in the tourism market this in turn will reduce further our balanceofpayments deficit and generate newv jobs in the private sector"]]}
