japanese ministry of international trade and industry along with their major corporations and yesterday i read from newspaper articles about toshibas efforts at lobbying our industries as another part of this targeting and also about what has happened in the semiconductor field to us now i want to tie to link a section of the book to a matter the semiconductor as it was discussed and what happened in 1983 to show how it is happening what is happening to us today as a result of that there is part of chapter 2 chapter 2 being called green tea and dirty tricks of course referring to the green tea that the japanese have over which business contracts and contacts are made and then the dirty tricks that have been heaped upon american industry now this particular segment of the chapter deals with one corporation in the semiconductor field i want to point out that stanford ovshlnsky is a brilliant inventor whose work in optical electronics rates an entry in websters new collegiate dictionary under a newly coined word ovonics in 1970 ovshinsky patented a remarkable system for storing data on a computer memory disk using a laser the ovshinsky device can place 100 times as much information into the same space as conventional magnetic storage methods and it can be erased or changed at will even though ibm was not sure what products might result from the process in 1972 it bought a hicense from ovshinskys company energy conversion devices ecd is a small firm based in troy michigan primarily devoted to research and development it has fewer than 300 employees remember this was written in 1983 by marvin j wolf when he was researching for his book the japanese conspiracy it says that it has fewer than 300 employees and less than 21 million in sales but it has been very active in licensing japanese companies and in forming joint ventures with them weve had very good relationships in japan up to now explains larry norris a senior vp with ovshirskys firm we have a joint venture with sharp corporation in the field of photovoltaies which is now in production making solar electric cells from our amorphous silicon technology and were now going to calculators we have sev eral japanese licensees with a chemical company and fuji we also have a japanese subsidiary and a wide range of business associates partners and licensees in fact we have more business in japan than we have in the unitedstates in april 1983 ovshinsky was shaken to see an elegant press kit distributed by matsushita a 45billionayear conglomerate which proudly claimed that it had produced an erasable optical disk for the first time n the world ovshinskys firm promptly filed suit ibm is a licensee under this patent which is being infringed by matsushita says norris ibm did the right thing in 1972 it took out an insurance policy and put in in the bank if we ever use the process well pay you a royalty they told us in norriss opinion matsushita went ahead and just grabbed it without paying us a cent the book goes on to say the book goes on to ask why would a giant company like matsushita just take someones technology norris has no theory i cant understand this behavior theyre invested a lot of money in development probably as much as 100 million then to go out and jeopordize the whole thing by just blatantly infringing somebodys patentto me it doesnt respresent rational business behavior its stupid but in tokyo shigeki hijino does have a theory to explain matsushitas behavior hijino is the 42yearold editorinchief of britannica international yearbook and a prominent social critic matsushita is an octopus everybody knows it its just out to grab whatever it can he says norris of energy conversion devices is still shaking his head we took a very aggressive stance a small company like us could have written them a letter and gotten into their corporate bureaucracy and we could have been there for ten years and they would just put us on hold maybe thats what they were relying on norris says stan wasnt going to be put in a position like that thats why we filed our lawsuit and held a big press conference they were stunned a few weeks later ovshinsky and norris went to congress to testify about the case before the dingle committee we talked for an hour and matsushita got raked over the coals recalls norris im sure that they didnt think that a little company of two or three hundred people was going to give them that kind of anguish maybe theyre in a mood to talk business now that we have their attention mr wolf writes on thatthey do seem to have captured matsushitas at ntlon while matsushita continues to publlcl deny that it has done anything wrong they have initiated talks with ecd and ovshinsky has gone to japan to negotiate with the giant electronics firm weve got e patent infringement case and if they take a license from us on reasonable terms that should settle the matter says norris if matsushita does not agree to terms however it could take a long time for ovshinskys firm to get anything out of matsushita japan has comparatively few courts and only 11 000 lawyers in the entire nation their judges have caseloads five or six times heavier then those of unitedstates federal district judges which makes litigation an impractical avenue for corporate redress i might point out that we call edc the company and it is still in business because it was able to get a substantial settlement only because it went on the attack and it now has 350 employees at its plant and then there is another company one of the most as it goes on to point out one of the most popular components in home computers is a chip called the z80 developed in 1976 by federico faggin one of the maverick geniuses of americas silicon valley faggin founded zilog to manufacture the chip and after a few years sold his company to exxon returning to devote more time to his research according to mr wolf as personal computers rose in popularity more and more manufacturers chose the z80 as the cpu or brain of their computers zilog licensed three companies including sharp in japan to make the z80 and collected a small royalty on each z80 chip these companies sold several of the newest home computers are being produced by such japanese companies as nippon electric company nec sord fujitsu sony and hitachi and many of them have chosen to use the z80 this chip allows software manufacturers to easily adopt many programs written for other mostly american computers in early 1983 zilog came upon a new chip called the pd 780 produced by nec which was becoming a bestseller in japans awakening home computer markets when zilog took the chip apart and examined it carefully it seemed to be an identical copy of the z80 mr wolf says there are three legitimate alternative sourcescompanies we licensedfor the z80 but we are contending that nec which is now rivaling us for market share is illegally producing our chip says an angry chuck signor spokesman for zilog which has sued nec in the unitedstates federal court they just went out and copied the chip and its selling like crazymainly in the japanese markets but now also in the unitedstates signor claims mr wolf points out the japanese are skilled and noted for reverse engineering taking someone elses product apart to see how it works then building something that does virtually the same thing as the original they have their top engineers maybe the best 5 percent of their force working on nothing but reverse engineering claims ronald n billings an american who has worked in the japanese computer industry for 14 years and is now a consultant to nihon soft bank japans largest software company apparently the technique is legal or almost so its a tricky business because historically reverse engineering has been considered a valid situation even on patentable areas says zilogs signor a person opens your chip and looks at it and tests it and tries it out then he goes to his r d people and says can you put out a chip that does the same thing they start from scratch and they go do it rhats considered allowable in this business mr wolf continues to point out the problem says signor is that he is convinced that the nec chip is not a product of reverse engineering they photographed it warts and all the errors are still in there he contends federico faggin the guy who designed our chip says its all still in there its a direct copy and not an engineering development other companies weve licensed have paid several million dollars for the right to be a second source in addition to the lawsuit zilog has brought a complaint to the international trade commission which has accepted the case but in japan zilog is powerless we cant prosecute them over there says signor but if we can get an itc ruling in our favor the itc will stop all imports of products with that chip in it the itc will settle it in nine months to a year unfortunately the unitedstates courts will take three to five years thats why we went to the itc after zilog presented its claims nec couatersued zilog contending that the z80 is a copy of the nec chip not the other way around they claim to have patents on their chip says signor but well agree to their suit if theyll agree to ours their claim is worth about a million bucks ours in our opinion is worth 40 million even if they could prove their suit they would receive very little in damages on the other hand weve had tremendous damages even if the itc ruling is in zilogs favor hundreds of thousands of products with necs chip will have been sold around the world each representing a sale lost to zilog and more will be sold in japan where zilog can neither block sales nor hope to get a court settlement some of the repercussions that we are feeling from all of this action by japanese interests on the semiconductor industry and the chip industry the memory chip industry is really beginning to hurt in this country yesterday i pointed out from an article in the san francisco examiner some of the offshoots of that of how we are down to depending almost totally now upon japanese mtnufacturing in the chip department in this particular article it says yet by 1988 most unitedstates firms had abandoned the memory business entirely in the ideal scenario chip prices would have risen to a point where american companies could afford to return to the fray instead because of what has happened and because of the way our industries were targeted only two unitedstates firms texas instruments inc of dallas and micron technology of boise id remain in the dram business and they make a relatively tiny number of chips the san francisco examiner points out that japan accounts for more than 90 percent of the dram market and meanwhile japanese companies have raised prizzs of memory chips above the fair market value and this is all part of this conspiracy that we have been pointing out of targeting american industry of putting them out of business so they will control more than control what happens economically in the united states of america in closing i simply want to refer to a poll that was made recently about how the american people feel about all this how do they feel about having others come in and taking over our buinesses fortynine percent of the public said that they do not think it was good for the united states to have foreign companies building more plants here in this country and 84 percent thought it was not a good idea for them to buy companies and real estate in the united states and of course they are all upset all of the american people are upset about the way we have been exporting jobs been forced to export jobs overseas and to buy so many of our goods from overseas because our industries have been targeted and destroyed i might note that targeting our businesses and threatening americans with the loss of their jobs if they do not support for instance toshiba which is one f the companies that had a vast public relations campaign on in washington to make certain that they were not barred from doing business in this country even after they sold secret machinery to the soviet union that is not one of the ways that i think we should keep america prosperous the references that i made in the book japanese conspiracy came out of the chapter once again i want to point out green tea and more dirty tricks i will read more of that in the weeks to come so once again the american people are alerted and have been made knowledgeable about what really has happened in the destruction of our industries it is not by any means all our peoples fault there were major contributors to this from overseas"], [1.297393851018569e-06, 1.297393851018569e-06, 0,

group of strategic thinkersconvened to address the continuing problem of modernizing the landbased icbms this highly respected commission carefully reviewed the issues and concluded that attempting to solve all icbm issues with a single missile in a single basing mode made the problem of modernizing the icbm force so complex as to be virtually insoluble therefore the commission recommended a threepronged approach which suggested first prompt deployment of 100 mx missiles in minuteman silos to immediately reduce the soviet advantage in icbm capability second development of a small singlewarhead icbm to be deployed in the early 1990s in such a way to enhance survivability and stability and third vigorous investigation into followon icbm basing technologies to enhance future icbm survivability this approach was accepted by the president and unanimously supported by the secretary of defense the national security council the joint chiefs of staff the secretary of state and the congress which authorized the air force to proceed but as you know the bipartisan consensus did not last long congress decided to cap the deployment of mx missiles in silos at 50 due to continuing concern over survivability we also told the administration to look again at icbm survivability and gave the department of defense funds to explore alternative basing technologies along with the small icbm well the air force did exactly what we asked them to do they came back with another examination of icbm basing and this time combined the elements of mobility and deception we implored them to

eighth anniversary of the brutal and illegal soviet invasion of afghanistan i am very encouraged that members are once again taking time out of their busy schedules to bring the tragic plight of the afghan people to the worlds attention secretary gorbachev made quite an impression and scored a few public relations points during his recent visit to washington however before we get carried away with his friendliness and policies of glastnost i urge members and citizens alike to consider the soviet rape and plunder of innocent afghanistan it is our duty especially with reports that the soviets and their leader gorbachev are more cognizant of world public opinion to use greater public pressure and private diplomacy to end the occupation of afghanistan this special order is one of those types of public pressure today i seek to remind my colleagues of the grave injustice and suffering borne by the afghan people and caused by the soviets the ghastly situation in afghanistan must remain on the front burner afghanistan must remain as a part of the united statessoviet dialog december 27 1987 marks the eighth anniversary of the soviet invasion of the independent nation of afghanistan in examining the events of the past 8 years it is obvious that this is a day of mourning not celebration recently the reports of the u n special rapporteur dr felix ermacora and the independent lawyers of project on war crimes in afghanistan serve to educate americans on the genocide happening today in afghanistan it is not hard to compile a long list of barbarous crimes the soviets and their afghan collaborators have commited against the innocent afghan population the 13page annex of dr ermacoras findings that the u n wrongly refused to make part of the official report is even more revealing the following heinous crimes are frequently being committed by the soviets in afghanistan incidentially these are the same soviets who came to washington proclaiming a policy glasnost or openness apparently this means open season on afghans the soviets are engaged in a scorchedearth policy designed to force afghans to become refugees the soviets have purposely burned villages and crops they have destroyed irrigation systems schools and mosques their goal is the destruction of the afghan nation as a whole the soviets have purposely bombed innocent civilian targets there has been extensive use of napalm and high explosives against nonmilitary targets often times the soviets will opt for maming rather than killing innocent afghan women and children to increase their suffering and burden on the rest of the population the use of land mines is widespread and the dropping of bombs designed to look like toys means that young children are deliberate targets those afghans who have stayed or have become internal refugees in the soviet controlled cities are subject to indiscriminate arrest and torture the soviet and puppet afghan jails have absolutely no concept of even rudimentary human rights violent torture is common and executions routine a december 1986 upi report detailed the brutal execution of prisoners at kabuls pull charki prison to relieve overcrowding in their efforts to eradicate traditional afghan culture and heritage the soviets have kidnaped afghan children from their parents and have forceably sent them to the soviet hl11598 union for communist indoctrination other children yes children have been conscripted into the military according to the u n rapporteur the conscription system is governed by severe discriminatory methods the brutality unleashed against the brave mujahideen freedom fighters is almost incomprehensible prisoners are not taken they are executed medical treatment is denied unfortunately as we have recently experienced the soviets and their afghan puppets have not constrained themselves to afghanistan their bombings and the terrorist actions carried out by the kgb and the khad have killed many afghan refugees in pakistan as well as pakistani citizens in fact because the pakistanis have been so helpful the soviets have deliberately tried to destabilize this important american ally and with all of the attention we have focused on the persian gulf we must not forget that the soviets have always coveted this region their actions in afghanistan and pakistan and the geographical proximity of these countries to the gulf are further reasons for concern finally a picture is worth a thousand words i recently received a very revealing book from the writers union of free afghanistan it was filled with pictures of innocent afghan villages and villagers who were subject to the red armys inhuman policies i urge concerned citizens to review this book however i must warn them to do so only when they have a strong stom achthe brutality is gut wrenching as i previously mentioned the list of atrocious human rights violations and blatant disregard for numerous international laws treaties and conventions is very very long it is incumbent upon us to continue to try to focus international attention on this afghan genocide i hope my colleagues especially those who argued during the debate on the defense bill that the soviets can be trusted and that the soviets really arent that bad to carefully review the sorrowful happenings in afghanistan talk to our colleague charlie wilson who has traveled with the mujahideen into occupied afghanistan and has seen the destruction first hand the rape of afghanistan is the policy of the soviet union the afghan genocide is the result of the red army let us not fool ourselves the soviet advisors who murder afghans in cold blood are the same soviet advisors teaching the mpla in angola and the sandinistas in nicaragua the tragic situation in afghanistan cannot be looked at as if it were in a vacuum the courage and resolve of the afghan people despite these great burdens is very inspiring on the battlefield the afghan mujahideen have routed the red army and confined their control to only the largest cities the arrival of new weapons like the stinger sam have challenged soviet air power and strengthened the capabilities as well as the morale of the freedom fighters eight years ago many believed the afghans would be unable to last for long against the soviets they were wrong the soviets have signaled that they are tiring of their afghan quagmire and are looking for a way out i strongly believe we must continue to support the mujahideen to provide even greater incentive for the soviets to get out of afghanistan as long as

consequence of unemployment due to a displaced imports we also pay out enormous amounts of money for these trade policies at both ged the ad state and federal levels now if you call y casing the the

continue our present trade policies it is easy to say that the damage of imports is mininal because we have only paid out of the federal treasury a small amount of dollars ignoring that the major burden of the cost is state borne and also ignoring that more than half the claims for tra are denied moreover some of the highest unemployment rates are evidenced in those areas where the most

are in the states of michigan missouri new york pennsylvaria wisconsin ohio and california i am not for a moment suggesting the dissolution of the tra program for many workers it represents the difference between bread on the table and nothing i am suggesting that the tra program was never meant to be a supplemental welfare system or as excuse for categorically relinquishing more of this countrys production jobs it the name of free trade moreover it is grossly inequitable at a time when states are experiencing serious financial difficulties to expect states to pay for national trade decisions if the high cost of our trade policy is able to be seen for what it is then perhaps those who make the trade decisions will pay closer attention to what their decisions are costing this

district with two small fishing vessels in tow the boats appeared as fuzzy white objects in the glow of the infrared sensors in a sequence shot two hours later the cameras swept inland to pick up a cluster of small white outlines intelligence analysts identified the white blots as 20 to 25 guerrillas with pack animals in the swampy brush beyond the beach what you are viewing is an overtheshore logistics shipment to el salvador from nicaragua a narrator asserted in an introduction to the film the beach area from la union to the rio lempa is extensively used by the salvadoran guerrillas to receive supplies from nicaragua a second film shot shortly after midnight on july 9 revealed a 75foot trawler a few miles off playa espino a once popular beach resort that is now well known as a guerrilla stronghold two smaller craft stood nearby they look like rowboats observed the recorded voice of a c130 crewman but suddenly the two small rowboats roared away toward shore their wide wakes looking like streaking comets on the lowlevellight film a final shot showed what may be the same two boats anchorgd in an isolated inlet with small white forms moving around them and a third short film focused on a 24foot dugout nearing the shore with a group of 40 people descending to the beach at the same time mr rivard goes on and says in fact there is no evidence at all that the trawlers originated in nicaragua or that they carried arms or ammunition stillhe says and this is an objective reporternicaragua is nearby and has the only government in central america that favors the salvadoran guerrillas ordinary smuggling remains a possibility of course but the clandestine rendezvous along guerrillacontrolled beaches strongly suggest that weapons are involved in addition the guerrillas claim that they have completely armed their troops with weapons captured from the salvadoran governmentand this is a direct quoteseems frankly ludicrous how many times have we heard our colleagues suggest that that is the case skeptics may argue that even if the guerrillas are importing weapons there is still no proof that they are being supplied by nicaragua and cuba neverthelessand this is the bottomline comment from mr rivard the bureau chief in el salvador of newsweeknevertheless a thin but reasonable chain of circumstantial evidence does indicate that the guerrillas acquire material from the eastbloc countries well it may be a thin line for mr rivard but i am glad that our chairman the gentleman from massachusetts indicates that it is not too thin that he reaffirmed today in answers to my questions and his own comments that a major portion of arms and materiel are coming from cuba and other countries to el salvador through nicaragua i want to point out to my colleagues a backgrounder paper released from the department of state and department of defense in which the thin line that mr rivard talks about is not so thin after all here are pictures of

section 703 does not put any restrictions on the ability of foreign persons to make investment in the united states this section is not intended to discourage foreign investment at all instead 703 simply recognizes the obviousinformation on foreign investment is difficult to get because the investor may not be located in the united states the proposed amendment however is written so loosely that it could be used to exempt all foreign investment from the disclosure or even the reporting requirement the amendment would let the secretary exempt individuals or whole classes of investors if reporting would impair a beneficial investment in the united states how i ask you is the secretary supposed to distinguish between a beneficial and a nonbeneficial investment does a foreign investors statement that he will not make his investment if reporting is required meet the amendments test of substantial impairment it would seem to me that if the proposed amendment is adopted we will be

saying that they do not have to report the required information if they do not want to this approach makes no sense we either want the information or we do not want it thats what is at stake i for one think it is important to have basic information on foreign investment for example the administration became greatly concerned about the impact on national security when fujitsu a japanese semiconductor manufacturer attempted to buy fairchild a semiconductor company located in california section 703 could not be used to stop a takeover because reporting under section 703 occurs after the acquisition is made however section 703 would ensure that our government would know for example whether a foreign person has a significant or controlling interest in a defense contractor with whom it is dealing section 703 would also give us important information concerning foreign control of financial assets in the united states foreign control of unitedstates bank assets has quadrupled in the

very comfortable voting against this amendment and i think they should the fact is that i do not think they will find very many people that would agree"], [0.349647581577301, 0.849647581577301, 1, "we have been told in the past several days that the reason we have to continue aid to the contras is because of the testimony of mr miranda who defected from the sandinista government and came here and told members of congress and others about the dramatic buildup in the sandinista army today in the wall street journal and the other day in newsday we find out that perhaps mr mirandas remarks have been misrepresented by mr elliott abrams who is already on the record as lying to the congress of the united states and what we find out is that in the major buildup in the threat to the security of this nation the sandinistas will continue to rely on the 1950s weapon system of the t55 tank that is as old as we say as most of the people who drive it in fact mr miranda says and the reporter states that actually their intent was to reduce the size of the army to around 60 000 or 70 000 from the current 80 000 and that the balance would be a reserve force to be mobilized during the united states invasion that is quite different from the words spoken by members from the other side of the aisle telling us about mr mirandas remarks on why we must continue this aid to the contras so i would hope when the continuing resolution comes up that members will vote against it understanding that it is unnecessary it is a full full assault on the arias peace proposal it is not only an increase in humanitarian aid but allows us to continue the delivery of military assistance to the contras who are undermining the peace process in central america"]]}
