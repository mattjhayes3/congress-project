at 8 oclock so this 40 minutes is going to have to be about 22 minutes i just left the committee on banking finance and urban affairs committee room where they are conducting socalled hearings on whitewater you had to see the scene there to really believe it it will be all over the evening news i have never in my 16 years here seen more than a panel of six people at a witness table not on the foreign affairs committee where i served for years or the committee on science space and technology or the armed services committee where i serve now or in the permanent select committee on intelligence upstairs in closed session rarely maybe four or five times a year you will see six witnesses and they are usually all focused on one subject in the armed services committee and this was the policy in all of the years for the better part of a decade that i was on the foreign affairs committee we usually have panels of four people because this is the best you can handle when you have 10 20 or in the case of the banking committee 30some members who want to speak or ask questions and are restricted to the 5minute rule the white house must have been a lonely place today because here is who we had down at the banking committee mr bruce lindsey assistant to the president mr george stephanopoulos senior policy adviser to the president harold ickes assistant to the president and

first lady there were 10 people lined up to i think deliberately obfuscate the whole issue i consider the gentleman from texas as a friend of mine but this is such a transparent attempt to rig the hearings and prevent republicans from asking hard questions and getting solid answers in return and while they are trying to make the hearings boring they are not goingi to be boring because of the visual impact of 10 people who are all trying to be questioned only by the majority members the democrats who are just laying on the compliments and here is the order of members for questioning on the republican side leach who is just a general linebacker then mccandless lazio and ridge will handle mr sloan mccollum and nussle will handle eggleston roth bachus and castle will question bruce lindsey roukema and thomas will handle podesta bereuter and grams will handle ickes pryce linder and king will handle margaret williams knollenberg alone gets stephanopoulos baker gets mclarty sam johnson a

freshman members peter kings press release of the day he is from the third district nassau county here is what he says about yesterdays whitewater hearing session and you will learn more by this synopsis than you will by actually watching the hearing he says the first day of the house banking committees whitewater hearings exposed yet another pair of widely contradictory stories regarding improper white house contact with agencies conducting criminal investigations of the whitewatermadison savings and loan affair going into todays session of the hearings that is this morning king said the continuing emergence of conflicting stories from clinton administration officials indicates that we are still a long way from the truth ah the truth the truth the truth shall set you free well we will see during his questioning of white house counsel lloyd cutler king pointed out that on october 6 1993 president clinton met with arkansas governor jim guy tucker sitting governor jim guy tucker who had earlier been named as the possible target of a resolution trust corporation investigation of whitewatermadison according to cutler the president was unaware that governor tucker was named in the criminal referral do your homework seven score and six year senior adviser king told cutler that documents in the committees possession showed that senior white house adviser bruce lindsey was brief in detail on the rtc criminal referrals on september 30 1993 furthermore it is believed that lindsey while traveling to the west coast with the president on october 4 or 5 1993 briefed him on the criminal referrals king says someone is not telling the truth did bruce lindsey a senior white house staffer and close personal friend of the president fail to inform him of the criminal referral mentioning tucker or did he brief clinton in full i wonder either mr lindsey and the white house counsels office are guilty of very shoddy staff work or the president decided to go ahead and meet with governor tucker despite the appearance of white house interference with an ongoing criminal investigation quoting againfrom pete king mr cutlers limited inquiry simply failed to get to the facts under questioning during tuesdays hearing cutler admitted that his findings on this meeting were based entirely on the uncorroborated testimony of longtime friend of bill bruce lindsey the president was never asked about his wholly improper meeting with jim guy tucker cutler fully accepted a secondhand version of events and gave testimony to the committee that would have been disallowed as a double hearsay in court can you not just see it now objection your honor double hearsay sustained as fast as the judge could bring down the gavel what did the president know and when did he know it king asked why are people close to the president and close to the first lady not telling the truth who is telling them not to tell the truth these are the questions we must answer in this preliminary round

of the people are tired of listening to this discussion about the budget but 1 know they are not tired of thinking about the fact that each one of them may qualify because they have children who would be eligible for the 500 tax credit more on that later for those that are listening i want to go back and kind of paint the picture of where we have been in the last 15 monthe i say to my colleagues you might rem member that last yea the president came up here and he sakt you dont like my tax and spend program then repubean let us have your speeffimss and so the budgeteers sat down and we basicauy began to reinmvent government and we put our specifics on the table and what we did is we sabd that we weold be able to redues the deficit by as much as the presidentl without a tax increase mr speaker we sent our specifics down to the president he rejected them we sent them to the majority party the democrats in the comnjt tee they rejected themwe came to the house floor and we were rejected here they were not interested in our specifics to offset their taxes but we did not quit the reconciliation or tax bil came to the house flapr and the president said i would say to the gentleman from connecticut k the president said i you dontt like my speciftc taxes tel us how you would get rid of them and we did we gave our specifles about how to reduce the influence of the federal government in all of our lves and to have deficft reductions through tax increases because we fundamentallybelieve that big government big taxes and big regulation stifles economic growth in this country well they did not like our proposal that time beat us again in favor of more for washington and less for the people well then the gentleman from minnesota and i got together along with a distinguished group of legislators and our goal was ta try to reduce spending again by a penny on a dollar to get the momentum rolling for change in this country we sent our specifics to the president he said he did not like them so did the vast majority of the majority here they said they did not like them and so one more time they beat down our specifics that were designed to downsize the government ta reduce the influence of washingtom they voted at that point to give more to washington and less to the people and then this year the president came for his state of the union speech and he said yox know my budget is the toughest budget ever toughest budget in 4w years i do not remember exactly his remarks but he claimed that he was sending us a toughmpinded budget and as i pointed out today in the debate if we let these automatic spending increases occur as provided for under law if in fact we put the government on automnatic pilot and the president had not sent his budget to capitol hll we would have lower deftcits and lower spending than the budget that the president sent usand so republicans said we can do better and sol would say to the gentleman from connecticut adr smavsj that we got together again and this time we got even more serious about reinventing government we privatized programs we consoidated programs we eliminated sane of the programs like the helim reserve and the interstate commerce commissiom we decided on ehiminsadon and privatizing and consolidating programs to eliminate federal waste and on letting peo ple at home have momre controll over solving the problems with their money that they send here to washingtom basically what the president said is i want more for washington and less for the people and oh by the way that middle income tax cut forget it you caa have it and so what we did is we went through all nooks and crannies of the federal budget and we truly have begun to reinvent government but we felt that reducing the deficit was our no i priority and so what we did was we reduced the deficit in all yearsby a greater amount than the president and cumulatively over the 5 years we are 150 billion lower in deficits let me emphasize again i sav to the gentleman from connecticut and to our other colleagues this budget that the republicans wiu offer tomorrow has 50 billion in lower deficits than the administration now we think there are some other things that should happen as a result of downsizing the government we think the family the american family ought to share in the benefits of downsizing the operation of the federal government after all it is their money now this 500 tax credit 500 per childk per family up to 200 000 in income is going to be the first instal1ment on an effort by republicans totry to help the besieged american fami17 and we pay for it we are not providing benefnts dr tax credits to somebody and taking that money and saying well well pay for it later we have paid for it in our republican budget we have also said there ought to be a crime bill we ought to pay for more prisons we ought to put more police on the street we alsa say there ought to be some rea welfare reform andf theleader of the welfaxe reform movement in the house and frankl i think the nationa leader on this welfare reform movement the gentleman from pennsylvania a member of the committee on ways and means he is going to be with us tonight to talk a little bit about what the welfare reform package is and we also make a down payment on health care reform by introducing the republican health care bill which relies on market forces rather than the government to begin to fix thfs health care problem and we have also provided help for the american worker how well not by turning more money over to washington but we have provided some help for theamerican worker by no gfving busfess the ability to buy more plant buy more machinery become more efficient and more effective and hire more people so we can be even more eompetitive internationally and we also provide for everyone in this country a provision to protect 1h244 their investments against inflation now let me explain that for a second we index the capital gains tax i have some nextdoor neighbors who are senior citizens they probably bought their house for i do not know 30 000 or 40 000 i do not know what their house is worth now but i can promise my colleagues that that house has gone up in value not just because of an increased value on that home but because of inflation driving up the price of that home if they should sell that home i do not think they should have to pay taxes on the inflation value of that home so we are not only trying to help business and the american worker by making it more possible for them to expand and export to have higher productivity but at the same time we are also saying that we will index the capital gains for industry and for individuals and at the same time of course we want the american family to share in a piece of the reinventing government that we have started in this congress of the united states imagine 150 billion in lower deficits under the republican plan 500 per child per family up to 200 000 more incentives for business to expand and hire people a crime bill a welfare reform bill the down payment on health care all within this package i would say there is no reason to vote against this proposal because do you know what this proposal represents this proposal represents more for the people and less for washington and that is how it will be judged on the vote tomorrow should it come tomorrow or next week if it comes next week and it will be judged for the rest of this year decide who you want to choose up sides with just like when you were a kid picking teams at a baseball game do you want to choose to play on the team with the washington establishment or do you want to vote to help the people of this country who are back home in the

believe the american people voted for was to end gridlock and when it comes to crime legislationwe still have that gridlock as the gentleman from louisiana point out the problem of passing any of the elements regardless of their merits in our crime bill this should not be a partisan issue we need to take off our republican hats and take off our democrat hats roll up our sleeves and work together in a pragmatic commonsense comprehensive way to address the problems of violent crime in america the people of america deserve nothing less but it is obviously difficult to pass a bill that has not been introduced we do not have an administration bill we do not have a democrat bill the only thing we have to deal with right now legislatively is a republican crime bill that has been introduced i want to take this opportunity to renew my offer to the president and to you to work with your side of the aisle to formulate and pass a strong bipartisan anticrime bill i hope it includes the elements that the gentleman from florida discussed as well as the gentleman from louisiana there are three violent crimes three violent felonies that should result in life imprisonment certainly in that bipartisan spirit i ask you not to dismiss these innovative proposals in the republican crime bill these proposals can be supported by many members on the other side of the aisle many of the elements should be noncontroversial there is no room for partisanship when it comes to crime people are getting killed people are getting raped people are getting addicted to drugs there are two proposals that i have introduced and i thank the gentleman from florida as well as the gentleman from louisiana for their tutelage and their support on these and other issues their leadership has truly been outstanding the two proposals that i have introduced to the crime bill fall within the nonpartisan category i strongly believe the first is the jacob wetterling crimes against children act which would require convicted child sex offenders and abductors to register with police for 10 years after their release from prison this bill came from my home state of minnesota as a result of an abduction of a young boy named jacob wetterling who has not yet been found and thanks to the tireless efforts of his mother patty wetterling who walked these halls of congress who walked the halls of the minnesota legislature this bill is now before this body the department of justice reports over 114 000 nonfamily child abductions every year in this country we need to pass this act because child sex offenders repeat their crimes again and again to the point of compulsion in fact the national center for missing and exploited children reports that 74 percent of imprisoned offenders had one or more prior convictions for a sexual assault against a child listen to this the typical child sex offender in america molests 117 children before being apprehended and convicted the first time 117 young victims so certainly there is justification for this bill for keeping track of these pedophiles these convicted child sex offenders after their release from prison as many as 22 states already have registration statutes but state law enforcement officials have told me as well as the fbi has told me that they need this national registration because of the obvious ability to cross interstate lines and given the mobility of our population today the second bill that i would like to describe very briefly which also should be noncontroversial which also deals with children and crimes against children is called the assaults against children act that is also included in our republican crime bill this would close a very serious gap in the federal crime abuse law this was brought to me by the former unitedstates attorney for minnesota tom heffelfinger as a result of several cases on indian reservations back home in minnesota currently in order for child abuse to be considered a felony in federal court the injuries to the child must be permanent or protracted whip marks cigarette burns and even broken bones do not reach this threshold so the federal prosecutor can only charge simple assault which carries a 3month penalty so most of the cases are not papered so there is a big gap between a 3month misdemeanor and a 5year felony for child assault or assaults against children there is no protection in a nutshell for the vast majority of federal child abuse cases which fall in the middle but this provision in our crime bill would close this gap by providing a maximum of 5 years imprisonment for assaults to children which result in substantial bodily injury likecigarette burns to the face which i have seen cases of or broken bones and other blatant examples of child abuse let me just conclude by saying the jacob wetterling bill which now has 52 cosponsors and the child abuse bill which has 33 cosponsors nearly half of these cosponsors are from the other side of the aisle and i am pleased to state that bipartisan cooperation and to see that spirit of bipartisanship again i only hope we can address all of the elements of a comprehensive crime bill in this bipartisan way we do have an opportunity to pass a tough comprehensive crime bill and we have an obligation to at least pass those provisions on which all of us can agree and which are so desperately needed and demanded by the american people the republicans have put out comprehensive crime bill on the table it is tough it is fair it is comprehensive it does put victims rights first i urge my colleagues to

there will still be problems in accessing the system until we expand our community health center system i there is a lack of transportation in cities and in rural areas there is a lack of providers in many areas of the nation it is only by expanding this infrastructure of care that we can make access to community health care a reality for the majority of those 37 million who are uninsured in my state of connecticut these community health centers helped those that went through serious periods of unemployment because it made access available and affordable whether one was covered or not covered i hope that we will lay aside our differences today and vote for this amendment because it is the heart and soul of one of the critical pieces of the solution to access for health care it supports those kinds of institutions that provide holistic care that create the relationships that mean that prenatal care is accomplished that create the relationship that assures that wellchild care is carried out in a timely fashion 0j 1710 community health centers create the relationships through which substance abuse family abuse and violence can be addressed they are comprehensive they are holistic they are family oriented and they are located where the people who need them can reach the health services that are so critical to the lives of our children and the strength of our families i

that places on a family and to come to the floor and to suggest that we should be doing this bill without compassion seems totally incompatible with the concept with which we are dealing today compassion is a very important part of what we do in this chamber compassion without structure or discipline i would agree is unconscionable but compassion with a sense of where we are going bringing everybody aboard the boat so we can all get there at the same time is something that we need and we need to bring people into that boat from claremont and from mount lebanon and from mount clemens and

from connecticut and the members of the committee on house administration for coming forth with this i regret that it is not a bipartisan bill unfortunately efforts were made but did not work out in terms of a bipartisan measure so we are left with facing sort of the political harangue here of bumpersticker slogans by the opponents slapped onto a problem that is very complex frankly i think it is a disservice to the members and the people of this country the choice here is between whether you want the continued policy path of special interests funding campaigns or you want to interject something that is going to bring about a reform and a change in terms of how we fund campaigns which does have an effect i think all too often or at least the perception in terms of what is the publics negative view of campaign funding the issue here is whether or not we want to set up a voluntary process within the government to help limit what the total overall spending is the only bill that limits the spending in this albeit too high from my perspective is the gejdenson bill the democrat bill proposed here today there is a fundamental difference here some think there ought to be no limits no limits no government participation just the special interests and only those selected special interests that happen to feather the nest of a particular group of candidates i do not think that is what would be called a level playing field i think what is happening here is we are trying to reengage the american people and try to claim back or gain credibility so that they have the faith in what we are doing in congress there is no taxpayer funding in this bill nor is there any designsto do so in the concepts advanced in this measure it is a voluntary system where people make voluntary contributions to try to gain back the control in terms of an election system that is careening out of control that is what the policy attempts to do in this measure it limits spending in line with the law we have to live within the precepts of the constitution the public does not understand that and some get up here and make all of these bumpersticker slogans about the features to achieve such limits but the fact is that the 1976 decision limits what you can do and how you do it you cannot limit independent expenditures you cannot limit what an individual candidate will spend overall you cannot limit what an individual will give to himself nor the total amount spent most significant to the public perception that is the 1976 law a confusing and awkward law of the land that we must comply with so what you have to do is to create a system wherein you will actually accomplish some sort of a spending limit and different controls that is exactly what the gejdenson bill does it is not a simple process it is complex because not everyone will accept that type of spending limit they are going to go through it so you have to address those particular phenomena election law is not simple some people talk about election law they think they are going to take politics out of elections they are going to thwart the system you have to provide an opportunity to challenge it in my district i do not need 600 000 i hope i never do i hope i never see the day someone got up here and talked about local funding of campaigns how about local control and state control of laws that govern our campaigns we cannot have that because that was ruled unconstitutional by the court we dont have that option so the fact is let us face the issue as it is honestly can the bumper sticker slogans and move on to a bill that will work the gejdenson bill i rise in strong support of h r 3 the congressional campaign spending umit and election reform act of 1993 as a cosponsor of this important reform legislation i want to commend the leadership for allowing us to move forward with campaign reforms these reforms are long overdue hopefully todays positive action will bring needed reforms one step closer to reality as my colleagues know h r 3 is very simlar to legislation that the house considered and approved in the last congress this bill will set voluntary spending limits for house candidates for those candidates who agree to the spending limits assistance is providing to communicate with the voters the legislation also limits the contributions that a candidate can receive from special interests political action committees and wealthy individuals the legislation also prohibits the use of soft money and addresses negative campaign ads h r 3 is not perfect we all have changes that we would like to see incorporated in the legislation personally i believe that the spending ceiling is too high and could be significantly lowered without stifling effective campaigns however these objections should not be used to derail comprehensive federal campaign reform congress must lead if campaign reform is to become a reality regrettably a statebystate approach has not been permitted to work my own state of minnesota implemented meaningful congressional campaign spending limits which i actively supported and observed unfortunately the opponents of campaign reform successfully overturned the minnesota law with the action the hope of state leadership on federal reform was ended h r 3 addresses the problem of campaign spending headon by limiting campaign spending without adequate spending limits any campaign reforms will be meaningless spending on congressional campaigns is too high the american voter wants election campaigns based on ideas not 30second sound bites the enactment of the spending limits in h r 3 is an important step to take our national elections out of the hands of media gurus like ed rollins while returning campaigns to the oneonone contact with the american voter h r 3 is complex principally because of the careful mine field of limitations that campaign reform must march through to become law the 1975 decision in buckiey versus valso limits what the law can do directly by preventing mandatory spending limits overall preserving the right of an individual candidate to spend as much personal resources as the candidate wishes permitting unlimited independent expenditures as special interests in support or opposition to a specific candidate these factors thwart the ability to write laws that level the campaign playing field some of our constituents do not understand these factors when added to the swamp of political rhetoric seeking political advantage rather than true reform this debate sinks into a swamp of controversy and public confusion h r 3 is not simple to understand because of the need to avoid the constitutional limitation requirements and to fundamentally advance the issue of reform despite these constraints h r 3 limits political action committee support encourages small contributions and sets in place a voluntary public funding program albeit without the funding mechanism left as an important future step clearly reflecting the special house and member hostility reserved for any tax measures finally h r 3 holds out the real hope of limiting spending in the highcost house

california legislature in 1976 and i can say without fear of contradiction that he was one of the best friends i had there in the legislature i am a democrat he was a republican but those things did not matter that much we sat together on committees as democrats and republicans together and i served on the agriculture committee together with him and we served on the water committee together and we generally shared the same interests i will never forget the man gene chappie there was a lot of talk there tonight about gene chappie being a republican but i remember him primarily as a man and a real man in the strongest sense of the word who believed above all in honesty and in keeping your word and in fact one of my fondest memories of a lesson in the assembly was one timeand i know my colleague congressman lewis who is here was there in those days and shares many of these memories with me as wellbut i will never forget there was a very important vote on the republican side of the aisle on leadership and a freshman republican i guess had voted against the way he had professed he would vote on that matter and a few days later on the floor of the assembly there was a crucial vote in which this republican member had a bill up and geno as we used to call him was up in his office listening to his squawk box he heard the vote was up and it was tied on the house floor he walked down to the floor late that night and they lifted the call and he cast his vote against the republican and i will never forget the republican coming over to geno and he said well why did you do that and gene said my friend and his cigar was in his mouth one thing you got to learn around here is how to keep your word and he taught lessons like that to people on both sides of the aisle at all times again some of my fondest memories of gene were in the social settings that we got together with him in sacramento often on these late night sessions as we invariably had we would find ourselves finding our way to genes office late at night where we would all sit around republicans and democrats together talking about what was going on on the floor and sharing stories and maybe easing some of the pain and also the tensions that we had in those days and gene was a great one at helping people to relieve tension again i do not think he cared so much about where you stood but that you stood for something and that you came from someplace solid inside of you when you made those decisions because he certainly did also i remember every year he used to sponsor a bus trip that we would take up to the auburn dam site and he would get all of the members who wanted to go to ride up there in that bus with him to take a look at that big hole in the ground that was sitting there and we would circumnavigate the dam site and then hear genes perspective on things and then we would go to a nice restaurant up in genes district for the rest of the evening he was dearly loved by everybody in the legislature and i know is as greatly missed out there as he is back here he brought the same type of character to this house the same type of commitment to the people that he represented and the same type of friendship with anyone who would look him in the eye and i am just proud to have spent some time with him and to have known him and to have considered him a dear friend of mine a person who i

mentioned earlier someone who really loved to go around in jeeps and other vehicles in the mountains and had a real sensitivity towards the area that he represented and a real relationship on a human

hide from their financial obligations to their kids let us give states the freedom to automatically deduct child support payments from a parents paycheck and to work across state lines so parents cannot avoid child support by moving to a different state and let us clarify the law so collection organizations can make reasonable efforts to contact these parents who are not paying up without the fear of endless and expensive law suits there are nearly 5 million mothers across america receiving welfare because fathers are not paying child support how much longer do we have to wait for the presidents welfare reform proposal so we can collect this money from deadbeat dads and give their children an opportunity for a bright future we have a republican welfare reform plan let us act on it

cutting government waste and start doing something about il the kasichpenny amendment cuts 90 billion in deficit spending over the next 5 years today i was shocked to learn that the govemments own civil service and military pension fund is over 1 trillion short lot me repeat that the government pension fund is over 1 trillion n the hole the federal govemment as a whole is over 4 trillion in debt were in trouble and we must stop deficit spending the kasichpenny amendment is a golden opportunity we must not let pass despite all the claims by its opponents kasichpenny is modest relatively spealdng it is only 1 penny of cuts per i for the next 5 years opponents of this responsible amendment have gone to great extremes to try to scare the public away from cutting federal waste they claim kasichpenny will severely cut medicare food for poor children and colas for retirees they should reread the amendment it does not do that at all this is nothing more than clever fearmongering rhetoric and it is a disservice to the american public which deserves the facts i would not support this amendment if in fact it did all these terrible things claimed by its opponents but t doesnt the real reason opponents are fighting this deficit busting amendment is because t is cutting their special pet pork projects theyre upset because kasichpenny responsibly reduces programs under the jurisdiction of committees they chair and consider their personal flefdoms the american people are demanding real fiscal reform in government this is responsible and genuine reform that cuts the deficit the rest of the country has tightened its belt in hard economic times why cant congress i urge my colleagues to join me in strongly supporting the kasichpenny amendment"],

beasts and that is what we are really hearing here we are being made to develop and debate an amendment we did not see we did not know about on an appropriation bill where the rules of this house say it does not belong this is supposed to happen in the authorization bill this is very sad because what it is really saying is that if we do not do this if this body does not stop and do this women in this country can never be trusted to use any judgment officials cannot be trusted to use any judgment and i think that is why the passions are running so high here we think women do have judgment it seems to me that when the 19th amendment passed we should have been equal beings but we are hearing that we have got to go through these incredible procedural backflips to try to put all these restric

is one of the hardest bills i have ever had to work on how do you truly trim the budget deficit while providing citizens thd programs and services which are needed it is not an easy question and there is much of this bill that i do not agree with but as an appropriations member i am challenged with reducing our deficit and this bill will do that on the good side the bill makes major steps toward improving the health of our children it increases funding for wic to 3 47 billion it protects the safety and health of women by ensuring that the fda can implement the mammography quality standards act i am pleased we have made the changes necessary to ensure housing for our rural residents under the 515 program but this bill is just a start and must be changed in conference as a rural

from minnesota for yielding to me and congratulate him for his statement and i know that we share the same concern because i certainly was surprised as one who objected to the way in which the select committees were treated here but that became reality so i was somewhat surprised to find out that the standing committees still would be enjoying overall increased funding for 1994 that is not participating in shared sacrifices it seems to me that the standing committees also should realize cuts beyond the 57 000 out of a 55 million total budget that represents the 57 000 represents frankly the equivalent of one salary of a staff person on a committee so that is not a substantial cut now the truth is that when the select committees were abolished here in the house by default in the way in which it was handled the fact is that was a start toward deficit reduction but i gather that the majority on the committee on house administration has decided that it was not a start but rather an end to deficit reduction and i think that everyone would be surprised that the truth is that nine committees will actually see a real increase in committee funding and that the truth is that only 57 000 was reduced out of a 55 million total committee funding budget and the truth is that the excess funding from the elimlnation of select committees should not exempt the 21 standing committees from
