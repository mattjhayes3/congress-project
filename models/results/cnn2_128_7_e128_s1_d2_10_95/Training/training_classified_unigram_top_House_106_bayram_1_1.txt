that under our tax code 25 million married working couples on average pay 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married is that right is that fair of course not today we have the opportunity to address that issue of fairness the motion to recommit fails that fundamental test of fairness because according to the joint committee on taxation the motion to recommit which is basically identical to what this house has already rejected provides zero marriage tax relief the average marriage tax penalty is 1 400 i have with me a photo of shad and michelle hallihan two public

nothing to married couples any kind of help for those who itemize such as homeowners or those who give money to church or charity so we want to widen that 15 percent tax bracket that is how eliminate the marriage tax penalty for shad and michelle hallihan we also want to help those who do not itemize by doubling the standard deduction and for the working poor those who benefit from the earned

years tuition for a nursing student at joliet junior college our local community college it is three months of day care for a working mom and dad with children it is almost 4 000 diapers for a family with a newborn child it is real money for real people and there are of course some here in washington who say they would much rather spend that money here in washington than bring about tax fairness by eliminating the marriage tax penalty well i am proud to say this house is doing something about the marriage tax penalty last year we passed and sent legislation to the president which would have wiped out the marriage tax penalty for over 25 million couples and unfortunately president clinton and vice president gore vetoed that bill they had a lot of excuses they wanted to spend that money but this year there is no excuse we have valentines day approaching and what better gift to give 25 million married working couples who suffer the marriage tax penalty than to pass legislation wiping

suffer almost the average marriage tax penalty well under the legislation that the house is going to be considering this week shad and michelle will benefit because two public school teachers who chose to get married who now suffer the marriage tax penalty will essentially have their marriage tax penalty wiped out michelle told me the other day she says congressman tell your friends in the congress particularly those who believe it is not a good idea to eliminate the marriage tax penalty what wiping out the marriage tax penalty would mean for them they say 1 000 which is essentially the marriage tax penalty would buy 3 000 diapers for their newborn baby that is money that is currently going to washington that they could use to take care of their child frankly if we want to be fair it is their money we should eliminate the marriage tax penalty this thursday h r 6 the marriage tax elimination act will help couples like shad and michele hallihan we do it in several ways we double the standard deduction onehalf of married couples do not itemize their taxes they use the standard deduction so we double it for joint filers the marriage penalty is created when a married couple of course get married they file their taxes jointly their combined income usually pushes them into a higher tax bracket that is what pushes shad and michelle into the 28 percent bracket what we want to do of course is for the nonitemizers which is about half of the married couples who suffer the marriage penalty to double the standard deduction for joint filers to make it twice that of singles for those who itemize who are the other half of married couples who suffer the marriage tax penalty those who itemize are homeowners the average middleclass family itemizes their taxes because they own a home we want to help them and provide marriage tax relief as well so we widen the 15 percent bracket the basic tax bracket that every one of us pays we are all in the 15 percent bracket regardless of our income for the lowest bottom bracket of our income by widening the bracket so that joint filers married couples can earn twice as much as a single filer and be in that same bracket we help those who itemize we also help the working poor there is a marriage penalty for the earned income credit and we provide tax relief for them this thursday let us have an overwhelming bipartisan majority let

ago but shad and michelle are a typical example of the 1 1 million illinois married couples who suffer the marriage tax penalty now if shad and michelle stayed single and decided just to live together they would avoid the marriage tax penalty because the marriage tax penalty results when two people get married and they file jointly so for example shad and michelle have identical incomes of 31 000 michelle is making 31 000 a year under our tax code if she is single she pays at a 15 percent tax bracket but when she and shad chose to get married and suppose that shad has an identical income of 31 000 remember he is in the 15 percent tax bracket as well but when they get married they file jointly and their combined income pushes them into the 28 percent tax bracket so they are now paying a 28 percent tax rate on that same income is that right of course not it is time that we do something about the marriage tax penalty i am proud that this house this past week last thursday voted to wipe

work period conducting 15 town meetings and i wanted to report today on really the response to the republican agenda of good schools and low taxes and a secure retirement for all americans i have the privilege of representing a very very diverse district the south side of chicago in the south suburbs of cook and will counties as well as a lot of rural and bedroom communities and one always listens for the common concerns when they represent a diverse district of cities suburbs and country during the last two weeks i got a pretty good response people were very supportive of the republican agenda of strengthening our local schools of lowering the tax burden for the middle class of making for a secure retirement for all americans by strengthening medicare and social security i would like to take a few minutes just to talk about some of those specifics of our republican agenda and of course let me begin with the republican efforts to strengthen social security and to strengthen medicare for the next three generations i am often asked a common question over the last several years that i have had the privilege of being in the congress and that question is when are you politicians in washington going to stop raiding the social security trust fund i was pleased to tell my constituents that this is the year we are going to do that this is the year we are going to wall off the social security trust fund and say hands off and my constituents frankly were pretty shocked when they learned that the clintongore budget actually raids the social security trust fund by 351 billion i think it is important to note that when we compare republican efforts to wall off the social security trust fund which means 100 percent of social security according to this chart for social security versus the clintongore proposal for 62 percent of the social security trust fund going to social security and the other 38 percent being spent on other things that is what this means the president wants to spend 38 percent of social security on new government programs republicans of course want to wall off the social security trust fund essentially putting trust back in the trust fund with 100 percent of social security for social security and that is a big victory i also want to note that the republican budget sets aside almost 400 billion more than the clintongore budget for medicare and social security now our second priority in our agenda of course is lower taxes for the middle class and i am one who believes that when the tax burden for the average family in illinois is about 40 percent of their income going to local state and federal government for taxes that that tax burden is too high and we need to lower the tax burden particularly for the middle class and when we talk about the tax burden i find that constituents whether it is at the union hall or the vfw or the local chamber of commerce they tell me that the tax code is too complicated requires too much paperwork and the majority of people have to hire someone else to fill out the tax forms and i also point out that the tax burden is really unfair as we work this year to lower the tax burden i believe that our top priority should be to simplify the tax code to address the unfairness in the tax code and of course we need to begin by eliminating the marriage tax penalty is it right is it fair that 21 million married working couples on average pay 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married 1 400 more than an identical couple living together outside a marriage that is wrong that our tax code punishes marriage the marriage tax elimination act has 230 cosponsors let us get it done this year let us simplify the tax code and eliminate the marriage tax penalty of course the republican agenda a secure retirement and lower taxes also includes strengthening our local schools and we want to strengthen our local schools by empowering our local school boards and our local teachers and our local parents to run their schools and giving them the flexibility of course to meet the needs of local communities and that is an important shift because previously for 30 to 40 years all the power was moving to washington and i talk with local school administrators and school board members they tell me maybe in illinois 6 percent of our public schools budget comes from washington but so does twothirds of the paperwork and almost 100 percent of the mandates micromanaging how our schools are run we want to let local schools run themselves and meet the needs of their local communities and that is why we want to pass the ed flex legislation my hope it will be on the presidents desk fairly soon the other concern that local school board members also share with me is they say as my colleagues know youve increased funding at the federal level by 10 percent even while youve been balancing the budget increasing funding for education but if you look at how those dollars have been spent only 70 cents of every dollar actually reaches the classroom thirty cents is lost in the washington bureaucracy our goal is to ensure that more dollars get to the classroom with a goal of 95 cents on the dollar reaching the classroom and if we compare that to the current cost of delivering those funds to our looal schools that is a 25 percent funding increase above and beyond what they are currently receiving we are providing 22 billion in federal funding for our local schools it is just wrong that 30 cents on the dollar currently is lost in washington let us help our local schools

reported out of committee by the republicans in the united states senate the reason it will not happen this year is because of the veto threat of the clintongore administration not to do it but that is what stopped it the last couple of years this is not something that people are thinking about later on they are actively trying to do it we have seen it in our committee in the committee on resources we have seen effort after effort reported out by the republicans in the congress to undermine clean water to dndermine clean air to undermine the endangered species act to undermine the superfund act the reason they have not become law is because of the clintongore administration because they say they will not accept it that they will veto those bills and the republicans have to back down just in the bill we passed yesterday there were over 20 damaging environmental riders on that bill this is not abstract that was yesterday on a vote the reason those riders did not end up on that bill is because the president and the vice president said they would not accept them now think now think of washington d c and we have president george w bush no threat of a veto agreement on this

matter if one is going to drill in the arctic what is it that keeps mr bush from drilling off the coast of california where the citizens have said no off the coast of florida off the coast of the carolinas where people have said no we do not want our areas spoiled if he is prepared to go into the arctic national wildlife refuge what keeps him from going off the coast of florida and california

nondiscrimination act and i want to thank my colleague from virginia for his work on this importantissue the bill before us provides a moratorium on access taxes on the internet for 5 years i think this is important to allow the development of this new technology that is truly in its infancy stage there is an amendment that has been offered that would limit this moratorium to 2 years i believe that is too temporary it is not long enough and therefore i will oppose that amendment the present amendment that is offered makes that permanent or for 99 years and i appreciate my colleague from ohio for raising this point in the debate and allowing us to have this discussion but i think everyone here in congress knows that a permanent ban is probably not in the dictionary when it comes to the actions of congress because we can change that down the road so i think it is somewhat of a meaningless gesture however i believe it is important because of the other issues surrounding this moratorium that we do reengage in this debate down the road one of the issues that are on the periphery of this moratorium is the states concern that this somehow impedes their collection of sales taxes on distance sales i know that my governor of arkansas has written a letter expressing the concern about this moratorium impacting the collection of sales taxes by the states when in fact as it has been pointed out this clearly would not prohibit the states from trying to develop a means to collect sales taxes on distance sales via the internet or catalogue sales i am sympathetic to that concern and i believe it is important that the committee on the judiciary engage in hearings to address this issue to continue the debate on that we need to continue to watch to see the impact on sales tax collections by our states that impact our schools and other services provided but i am also concerned about the brickandmortar businesses the main street businesses those that rely upon instore shopping they are obviously concerned about the internet having a competitive advantage those engaged in ecommerce i think we need to wait and see but the debate is very important and i hope that will continue in hearings in the committee on the judiciary and i know legislation will be introduced to clarify and reduce the obstacles that states face in collecting the sales taxes it is not an obstacle created by this moratorium but it is an obstacle created by the fact that there are no collection methods at present that the supreme court has not found creates an undue burden on interstate commerce so therefore i think we need to look at what we can do to help the states make sure that there is not a burden as well as the problem with the brickandmortar businesses as i mentioned the internet development clearly should be encouraged i believe that if there is a possibility that taxes would be imposed on access to the internet that that would be a hinderment i believe that we should support this moratorium for thtt reason in my district in arkansas where middle america is rural america i be lieve the internet explosion the opportunities for ecommerce the development of dotcoins represents the future of rural america even we see it in the silicon valley we see it on the east coast but in rural america we have in my district a dotcom which has developed that is employed i think we are going to see more of that and so i do not think we want to hamper it right now with the potential for new taxes on access to that great future that is really in its infancy now for that reason i oppose the amendment to make the moratorium permanent i support the underlying bill and i ask my colleagues to join in that effort"]], "top_unsure":

that is not unique that has happened often in congress but i think something unique is happening which in my view no longer justifies voting for these continuing resolutions i do not intend to vote for this continuing resolution and i will vote against it continuing resolutions are supposed to be passed to give us more time to get our work done when they are passed we are supposed to be resolving our differences this is now the 19th time that we have had to come to the floor and ask for yet another extension of time i would not mind doing that if i thought we really were making progress i have read several newspaper accounts this morning of the alleged agreements which were reached at the white house yesterday i have read stories if i believed that those stories were true i would then feel fairly optimistic that in fact we could get finished within a few days over the weekend but in fact what i know to be going on behind the scenes is at huge variance with the newspaper stories that i have seen this morning so somebody has fed some information to a number of reporters information which is simply not accurate i suspect some of that misinformation has been spread by design but i suspect that some other of it has been spread simply through honest misunderstandings my interpretation of what is going on at the white house is quite different than the optimistic picture painted in the papers this morning when i talk to people who are in that meeting i get wildly varying and differing explanations about what the parties did or thought they were doing they all appear to be operating from different financial baselines so that when they use a specific number when one party in those discussions uses a specific number two other parties in the room have an erroneous understanding of what that number means and as a result we get the picture when people come out of the white house that everybody has played kissyface and it is all nice and wonderful and we are very close to a deal yet when you take a look at the actual differences that are being discussed we are still miles apart and i do not believe that passage of this or any other continuing resolution is going to lead to a narrowing of those divisions i think it will lead to a continuation of the drift and that drift is in no way the responsibility of the gentleman from florida or anyone else on the committee on appropriations if i may speak institutionally i believe if the committee on appropriations on both sides of the aisle were allowed to work these agreements out we could do so in 1 day but so far as i know there are no clean signals being given that we can in fact do that so i will make a flat prediction this resolution will pass it will probably have a majority of votes on both sides of the aisle and come monday we will be here having to pass another resolution because people will have peddled bafflegab over the weekend without doing very much real work i compare some of the numbers being discussed in the papers i see for instance that a number of the papers refer to the possibility of reaching agreement for the laborhealtheducation bill at the level of 107 billion there is not a chance of a snowball in hades that you would find a majority of votes in this house for that kind of a bill and it is important for people on both sides of the aisle to understand that i am perfectly willing to participate in an exercise which requires flexibility on both sides of the aisle but i know from talking to a number of my good friends on the other side of the aisle that they themselves would not be satisfied to vote for a bill which came in here at 107 billion now people will say well that is the number that the president asked for well if you take a look at what this congress passed so far this year it increased what the president asked for for agriculture by 1 3 billion it increased what the president asked for for energy and water many for members projects by 1 billion it increased what the president asked for in the interior appropriations by 2 5 billion it increased what the president asked for in transportation by 2 4 billion and defense by over 5 billion but when it comes to education we are now being told that we should go back to 106 we just had an election and the standard bearer for the majority party mr bush indicated that under republican governance there would be a bipartisan approach to government and yet the very first thing that we are being asked to do is to break the bipartisan agreement that was reached on funding levels in the laborhealth and education appropriations bill before the election when that bill came back to this floor i do not recall a single significant objection to a dollar number in the bill i do recall some quite vivid controversy as the gentleman from florida indicated yesterday about what were nonappropriation items in the bill language items that wanted to be attached by one side or the other and yet today after everyone ran on the idea that this congress was going to provide the biggest increase in education since the days of lyndon johnson now we are being told that we have to abandon that 22 percent increase in education funding well i would suggest to you that weaknesses in our schools are just as important as weaknesses in national defense i would suggest that weaknesses in our education system are just as important as weaknesses in our transportation system i would suggest that weaknesses in education are just as serious as weaknesses in our farm programs i would suggest that weaknesses in our education programs are at least as important as weaknesses in our locks and dams and river reengineering programs and yet we are being asked to cut the efforts to reduce class size in our schools we are being asked to cut the agreement that was reached on afterschool programs so that kids when they leave school have someplace to go besides an empty house because both parents are working outside of the home we are being asked to cut back on the promises that we have made in that conference report for special education and for education for disabled children we are being asked to cut back on the 500 increase in the pell grants that everyone claimed to be for earlier and that in fact mr bush campaigned on we are being asked to cut back on teacher quality initiatives so that we can reach the startling situation under which the people teaching mathematics to our kids will actually be trained in mathematics and the people teaching science will actually be trained in science and the people teaching history will actually be trained in history yet we are being asked to cut back on those initiatives we are being asked to cut back on a good many others from the levels reached in that agreement i am willing to sit down and work out some reasonable adjustments in those programs but i am not willing to vote for instruments that enable anyone on either side to pretend that we are making major progress when in fact we are not and what is happening is that we are being slowdanced to the end of the session when we will be given a choice of accepting a simple status quo education budget when in fact the situation on the education front demonstrates that is not what we need we need some imagination we need some forward progress and we need a lot more support for some of these initiatives than we have had so far i really believe that if that original agreement was put on the floor the dollar amounts i am talking about absent the language items that were at issue i really believe that if the dollar amounts for education and health care and worker programs contained in that conference were allowed to come to the floor by the republican leadership it would pass with a significant majority and we would have a lot of votes from both sides of the aisle that bill is not being allowed to come to the floor instead we are being asked to renegotiate a deal that was reached on both sides of the capitol with both parties and as i say in the interests of rational governance i am willing to help participate to a reasonable degree but i am not willing to savage these programs in order to get an agreement i am not willing to pretend that there is major progress when in fact there is not i want to say again none of the fault for any of the progress that has not taken place lies at the doorstep of the gentleman from florida as far as i am concerned he has been open at all times to suggestions and to requests from everyone regardless of party regardless of the branch of government i think the gentleman has genuinely tried to get us to a resolution of this problem but there are other people i will be blunt about this every time i was asked by members of the press before the election what i thought was happening to the labor health and education bill what i said was that i thought that the republican leadership was trying to at all costs avoid a vote on education until after the election so that they could hide their longterm intention to cut the amounts in this agreement then after the election they would then feel free 2 years in advance of another election counting on the publics ability to forget that they would then feel free to make large reductions in the education funding programs that we had agreed to now that is exactly what is now happening i do not believe that all members of the majority party agree with that i think there is a substantial number of members who do not want to do that but they have not been allowed to cast a vote on the floor and until they are or until we can get reasonably rapid progress i no longer intend to support these crs i have supported 18 of them in a row in order to keep negotiations going but i see no meaningful progress i see the leadership of the house and the senate and the president each trying to compete with each other in public relations terms to show who can be the sweetest in front of the tv cameras or the print press but i do not see any real decisions being made that reflect the honest view of a majority of people on both sides of the aisle in this house and so until i do i will vote no on this and subsequent continuing resolutions i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.0026861727237701416, 0.49731382727622986, 0, "i yield myself such time as i

strength of our nation lies with the individual and each persons dignity freedom ability and responsibility must be honored i believe in equal rights equal justice and equal opportunity for all that every single child has a right to live in an environment where they can achieve their fullest potential i believe that free enterprise and the encouragement of individual initiative have brought prosperity opportunity and economic growth to our country i believe that the government must practice fiscal responsibility and allow individuals to keep more of the money that they earn i believe that the proper role of government is to provide for people only those functions that they cannot perform for themselves and that the best government is that which governs the least i believe the most effective responsible and responsive government is the best for the people and closest to the people i believe americans must retain the principles that have made us strong while developing new and innovative ideas to meet the challenges of a changing world i do believe that americans value and should preserve our national strength and pride while working to extend peace freedom and human rights throughout the world finally i believe that the republican party is the best vehicle for translating these ideas into positive and successful principles of government as america faces tragedies like the shootings that we have seen across the country in the last few months i remain even more convinced that a return to traditional values and personal responsibility that made this country great are absolutely essential i think president reagan said it best when he said we must reject the idea that every time a law is broken society is guilty rather than the lawbreaker it is time to restore the american precept that each individual is accountable for his actions as a wife a woman a mother of two sons i believe that only a return to values and personal responsibility will end this sort of violence that is why i am a republican"], [0.009909868240356445, 0.5099098682403564, 0, "i thank the gentleman for yielding me the time i thank my colleagues from the other side who have talked about a spirit of bipartisanship and something i certainly agree with i am concerned that this bill is going to be vetoed by the president in the spirit of bipartisanship i would ask my colleagues on the other side and our vice president who is from tennessee not to allow this to happen to go to the president and to ask him to sign this bill because my state of tennessee really needs this legislation our medicare beneficiaries in tennessee will receive 4 3 billion that will help reduce their medicare copayments the money they have to pay out of their pockets and other assistance as well as they need the 1 4 billion that this bill provides for new preventive benefits under the medicare program and our tennessee hospitals need this legislation also altogether this bill will benefit hospitals to the tune of nearly 14 billion through direct and indirect funding if our hospitals in tennessee are forced to close or cut services the effect on our patients and on the more than 52 000 hospital employees could be devastating i also want this bill not vetoed because it contains 1 6 billion in critical funding for nursing homes and 1 8 billion for home health care and hospice service the legislation also expands medicare coverage for telemedicine services this is important to the rural areas of the state of tennessee that i represent using todays cutting edge technology telemedicine or telehealth has the potential to revolutionize the way we practice medicine in this country and it has the potential to erase the disparities in medical care and quality of care between rural areas and urban areas and last but not least i would hope the vice president would realize about his home state of tennessee that without this legislation we will lose in tennessee 27 million for our states childrens health insurance program or the schip program because tennessee had already covered many of our schip eligible children under our state medicare waiver program tennessee has had to work much harder to get children to enroll in schip as a result it has taken us longer to use all of the money allotted to the state for the schip program i hope the vice president realizes that this bill will allow tennessee 2 more years to use most of its schip money so that more tennessee children can be covered now i know that our vice president mr gore spent a lot of time on this campaign trail talking about health insurance for children in texas but i hope the vice president will consider the needs of tennessees children in his discussions with the president about whether or not to sign this bill i urge my colleagues to vote against this motion to instruct and i urge the president to sign h r 2614"], [0.013394594192504883, 0.5133945941925049, 1, "i agree with the gentleman from texas chairman archer this tax code is so perverse it even taxes sex marital sex that is now let us put the hay where the goats can reach it if one does not get married one pays less taxes one gets rewarded if one gets married one pays more taxes one gets hit over the head to me that is unbelievable is it any wonder we have so many unwed mothers in america so many kids on the street kids without guidance kids without stability kids without fathers government paying the bills and congress expecting schools to straighten them out to discipline them and to raise them beam me up now let us tell it like it is i think there is too much partisan politics here today and we should be dealing with the peoples business let us look at the facts our tax code subsidizes illegitimacy but taxes the institution of marriage our tax code promotes sexual promiscuity but taxes the institution of marriage beam me up one does not need to be a rocket scientist to see this is the right thing to do i will vote to override this antifamily antichild antimother antiwife presidential veto we are relegating people to the bottom end of the ladder and the only hope we are giving them is go to the next rung this is

many issues i am grateful to have a chance to talk for a few minutes to acknowledge not only his work but to acknowledge the need for additional medical research through the national institutes of health and other agencies of government which conduct medical research it is not a small matter that is defined and distributed to the national institutes of health for research only it is a very big issue for not only the human condition in our country but also for other agencies that coordinate with the national institutes of health and in doing some very very important research to try to cure diseases in this country i happen to have a very serious interest in diabetes and recognize fully the cost of diabetes to society twentyfive to twentysix cents out of every medicare dollar goes for paying for the consequences of diabetes in our society so to the extent that the gentleman from pennsylvania and others in this body both democrats and republicans engaged in adding preventive care to the medicare legislation that we set back in 1997 to allow for diabetes education and diabetes test strips to allow for mammographies and colorectal exams and prostate exams for people in the medicare population that is a money saver so with the preventive care effort that is undertaken by congress combined with the research that is being done at the national institutes of health not only on diabetes but on many other diseases we can reduce this cost to the medicare system so it is in our national best interest in my judgment that we devote more resources to the national institutes of health research and medical research through the national science foundation through the va hospital system through the department of defense and other agencies of government the centers for disease control for example and others if we are going to help the human condition i want to thank the gentleman from pennsylvania for his work and i am very serious about the hard work he has done to make increasing medical research funding a reality in our country it is a wise expenditure of money of the taxpayers dollars because it helps all of us diabetes for example is indiscriminate in touching not only minority races but the caucasian population it hits all ages and stages it hits native american populations disproportionately to the rest of the populations in our country and it is a cruel disease that affects so many people sixteen million americans in our country have diabetes and some 7 or 8 million of them do not know they have it so not only diabetes but cancer and alzheimers and all those diseases that touch peoples lives need to be cured i would say to the gentleman from pennsylvania i was out at the national institutes of health just last week and met with the director dr varmus and the other directors of the institutes talking not only about diabetes but increasing funding imentioned to them at the time that i felt the presidents budget which i think is around 2 3 percent is just inadequate i know we did an extraordinary increase last year in the appropriations process and i am proud to be on the committee on appropriations and supported it but we want to do better than 2 3 percent so that we take advantage of these great opportunities for research and cure some of these serious diseases that affect all of us"], [0.016235709190368652, 0.48376429080963135,

petroleum reserve i want to correct what i hope is a misunderstanding we have never had in this bill funding for the northeast energy oil problem that funding is in the subcommittee on interior not in this bill so we not only did not knock it out it never was in this bill there was an amendment passed on the floor of the house to do something in this area but that jurisdiction really belongs in the committee on interior and not in this committee this is to further clarify this whole issue the house did pass a separate freestanding bill the energy policy and conservation act and that would have dealt with the northeast oil issue but that bill is being held up in the senate by senator boxer and for that reason it has not moved it is on hold by the senator the administration claims however that as long as the appropriations exist they do not need legislation to release oil from the strategic petroleum reserve in fact the president announced last friday that he was releasing 30 million barrels from that reserve clearly he does not feel that legislation is necessary for this purpose i do not agree with him and frankly i do not think that is a wise policy but the fact is that is what he announced and so we did not need to include funding in this bill for that purpose and we did not include it in the bill it does not belong in our bill it belongs in the interior appropriations subcommittee bill so we have not included it on the rule itself however let me just make a comment i totally support the rule that is before the house i commend the committee on rules for providing us with this rule it should be very simple for us to move forward with this conference report under the rule and i hope that the house will unanimously vote for the rule"]]}
