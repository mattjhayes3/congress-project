innocent civilians so that a brutal dictator by the name of bashar alassad can ruthlessly heartlessly keep power for himself in a country that does not want him we know that bashar alassad used chemical weapons against his own people young kids were choking and gasping for air knowing that this was their last breath and knowing that their dreams of becoming a doctor a police officer maybe a teacher was cut short by this ruthless heartless man bashar alassad you know the president said a few years ago almost divisively that the opposition to bashar alassad is just a bunch of doctors lawyers and pharmacists as if that were a bad thing i believe that a bunch of doctors lawyers and pharmacists in charge of syria today would be a very good thing about 2 weeks ago i stood in this

finds itself in syria and that one reason is to prop up this brutal dictator bashar alassad now let me remind people that isis would not exist in syria had it not been for bashar alassad brutally cracking down on the opposition the peaceful opposition of his own people but today we see that isis calls syria home and we find ourselves engagedalbeit halfheartedlyin a war against isis because of this brutal dictator bashar alassad i stood in this chamber and warned that the reason russia is there is to prop him up now i told you that this morning i had no intention of coming onto the floor except this morning i saw the news that russia has begun airstrikes in the middle east now if they were striking against isis some could maybe argue that hey this is an opportunity to unite a world coalition but it appears that actually the russians have struck the doctors lawyers and pharmacists that are the loyal opposition for a free syria against bashar alassad this is not a russia interested in defeating isis for the sake of the peace of the world this is a russia interested in rebuilding the soviet empire and propping up their dictators in the middle east regardless of that dictator having killed a quarter million of his own people this is not a choice between bashar alassad or isis to defeat isis you must defeat bashar alassad the two choices are not separate they are one and the same sometimes in my partys presidential debate i hear candidates one or two in particular that say assad is our best choice in the middle east if you would allow me as a christian to say as a follower of jesus myself no jesus christ i follow would call a man who brutally murders 250 000 at least of his own people especially women and childrenno christ i follow would call that man an ally or a friend in any way this is not a choice that is just one layer deep this is a complicated situation in the middle east that must be handled with american leadership i hope that the president sees this as an opportunity to reassert americas role in the middle east it doesnt mean he has to send 300 000 troops back into the middle east not a single person i have heard on either side of the aisle has suggested even once another 300 000 troops in the middle east what is being suggested is that in the absence of american leadership chaos violence death and poverty follow suit what we are seeing in the middle east is a lack of american leadership and a situation spun out of control i know george w bush has taken his licks for his policy in the middle east but at the end of the george w

civilians must endure from both the russianbacked syrian offensive and terrorist groups like isis hospitals are deliberately targeted33 in aleppo aloneresulting in mass civilian casualties in blatant disregard of core human rights law starvation has systematically been used as a weapon of war over 450 000 people are currently trapped in besieged towns and villages in syria and thousands are at risk of starving to death schools and playgrounds and other public spaces are routinely shelled to inflict the maximum amount of terror on innocent civilians the report tells of attacks on a girls

mercenaries allied to them have continued against the syrian people despite the truce taking effect on the 27th february 2016 right from the onset of the truce a large number of violations have been committed by the regime and its allies in several parts of syria the regime has continued to target populated areas using helicopter raids to deploy explosive barrels resulting in a large number of fatalities and causing significant injuries most of whom were innocent women and children there were seven recorded incidents of such breach furthermore there have been twentyfour recorded breaches involving artillery shelling and five incidents recording offensive ground operations recorded breaches of the truce were registered in twentysix different areas held by the moderate opposition moreover today sunday 28th february russian fighter jets launched twentysix air strikes against territory held by opposition groups which have announced and entered into the truce disturbingly significant is the fact that cluster bombs as well as thermobaric weapons were deployed adding to the number of innocent civilian fatalities and horrifying injuries in light of repeated breaches by the regime and its allies since the commencement of the truce the growing number of fatalities which currently stands at twentynine documented deaths in addition to the dozens who have been injured as indiscriminate targeting of populated areas continues we wish to clarify the following it is most unfortunate that the russian ministry of defense presented an erroneous map riddled with false military information http youtu be mayvdeidszssent and attributed this map to the united nations for calculated political and military purposes as purported areas of political influence and distribution of forces on syrian territory the sole purpose of that exercise was to exclude certain areas from the truce and to continue their systematic bombardment and forced displacement given the serious consequences of these violations on the syrian people and on the unity and territorial integrity of syria we urge that you take the necessary measures to respond and counter false russian allegations and put a stop to such practices we call on the united nations and the friends of syria group to be mandated to specify the territory covered by the truce to prevent hostilities in the designated inclusion zones such a task must be assumed by an impartial and transparent party we also note that the absence of clear separation lines will result in the targeting of civilian populated areas by the regime and its allies and henceforth constitute yet another flagrant violation of security council resolutions jeopardizing the truce although the syrian opposition groups have demonstrated maximum levels of selfrestrain and have thus far continued to adhere to their obligations to the truce it seems likely that the regime and its allies persistent crimes against the syrian people will inevitably undermine international efforts for the continuation of the truce we have agreed to the temporary truce as a response to sincere international efforts aiming to ease the suffering of the syrian people and to assist in the implementation of the humanitarian provisions of unscr 2254 in particular articles 12 13 and 14 failure to achieve any significant progress in this

importance for the security council to stand firm and unwavering in its resolve the persistent violations of the regime and the forces allied to it will undermine security council efforts for a

out of the challenge that we have from a fiscal standpoint we need to grow the economy and the growth rate that we have had over the last 40 to 50 years in this nation average growth rate has been about 3 2 percent your constituents and my constituents and people all across this great country know that over the past 6 months we have seen a growth rate of 1 percent and over the past 8 years we have seen a growth rate in the neighborhood of 2 percent so we have had a 33 to 65 percent reduction in the level of growth in this country what does that mean to folks back home it means the jobs arent being created it means that there is parttime work instead of fulltime work it means that you have a son or a daughter that graduates from college and they cant find a job in the endeavor that they have chosen all these things that make it so that the economy is tamped down harmed by our current system so the fairtax does all sorts of wonderful things but one of the things that it does that would just reinvigorate and enlighten this economy is to incentivize the things that we say that we want incentivizing savings incentivize investment incentivize hard work incentivize entrepreneurship incentivize risktaking incentivize individuals who are out there trying to build a better mouse trap and we are going to reward them for trying to build that better mouse trap so i am enthusiastic about h r 25 enthusiastic about the support that you have continued to generate for this i want to commend john linder who is a dear friend of yours and mine and the work that he did to begin this project i know that we will ultimately get to this point of a fairtax of a consumption tax because it is the right thing to do and it is the only thing that we can do that actually solves many of the challenges that we have got so let me commend you for what you are doing god bless you it is a wonderful wonderful work and if you keep at it and we keep at it i know that the american people will ensure that they invigorate men and women in this chamber so that they support this commonsense logical exciting solution to the challenges that we face from a fiscal standpoint"],

follow section 4 c 2 of the endangered species act by conducting a review of all threatened and endangered plants and wildlife at least once every 5 years it prohibits any funds in the bill from being used to implement or enforce the listing of any plant or wildlife that has not undergone the review as required by law under the endangered species act the purpose of a 5year review is to ensure that threatened and endangered species have the appropriate level of protection the reviews assess each threatened and endangered species to determine whether its status has changed since the time of its listing or its last status review and whether it should be removed from the list delisted reclassified from endangered to threatened downlisted reclassified from threatened to endangered uplisted or maintain its current classification you can find all this on the web site of the unitedstates fish and wildlife service because the endangered species act grants extensive protection to a species including harsh penalties for landowners and other citizens it makes sense to verify if a plant or animal should be on the list in the first place despite this commonsense requirement the unitedstates fish and wildlife service has acknowledged that it has neglected its responsibility to conduct the required reviews for hundreds of listed species for example in florida alone it was found that 77 species out of a total of 124 protected species in that state were overdue for a 5year review in other words the government had not followed the law for a staggering 62 percent of species in that state in california the unitedstates fish and wildlife service acknowledged that it had failed to follow the law for roughly twothirds of the states species listed under the endangered species act and was forced by the courts to conduct the required reviews of 194 species by enforcing the 5year review which is in current law my amendment will ensure that the unitedstates fish and wildlife service is using the best available scientific information in implementing its responsibilities under the endangered species act including incorporating new information through public comment and assessing ongoing conservation efforts these are things we should all be in agreement with i encourage my colleagues to join me in ensuring that the unitedstates fish and wildlife service follows the endangered

heard excuses and we will hear excuses we are told this doesnt fund infrastructure it doesnt this is about funding the infrastructure of research and development and innovation but not through the government this is through our entrepreneurs like apple and microsoft and all the new research and groundbreaking drugs and medical breakthroughs that is how we are funding the infrastructure of our future roads and bridges we will tackle in another bill we are told this isnt comprehensive tax reform no it is not it is a critical step forward in that by taking a provision that has been temporary far too long and making it a permanent part of our tax code so that we can invest in r d with certainty so we can have honest scorekeeping in our budget and so we can take that first step toward real comprehensive progrowth tax reform we are told today as we have heard in the past that it is not paid for but in fact to the extensions since 1981 these provisions havent been paid for our democrat friends passed these bills and supported them they werent paid for we have done the same it was 1 year or 2 years at a time to say this is fiscally irresponsible when they voted so many times to do the same thing seems to me to be another excuse the cost of doing this permanently is no more than the cost of doing it 1 or 2 years at a time to think otherwise is sort of in the line of saying you know that dessert doesnt have calories if i eat it standing up well the cost of r d is the same but the cost of not making it permanent is very much not the same we know the impact will be fewer jobs here in america more r d in china and we will lose our lead in the world as the worlds innovator no more excuseswhat we are looking for today is a bipartisan effort to make sure those jobs are here in

there is a 4year lapse you are grandfathering this my own state of texas will lose 358 million wisconsin 120 million ohio 65 million and south dakota will lose about 13 million are we going to replace those moneys from the federal government what are we going to do to the retail industry that has bricks and mortar my friends i am going to support a cr but i do believe we should work together to do things that impact us positively and not negatively get rid of the riders and help our states which have a need to have this internet tax provision lifted as a senior member of the house judiciary committee as the ranking member of the subcommittee on crime terrorism homeland security and investigations and as the representative from houston i rise in opposition to the permanent internet tax freedom act being in this bill when originally enacted in 1998 the internet tax freedom act established a temporary moratorium on multiple and discriminatory taxation of the internet as well as new taxes on internet access this moratorium however is due to expire on october 1st of this year since 1998 congress has extended the moratorium on a temporary basis the bill before us will make that moratorium permanent unfortunately in doing so the bill also ends the acts grandfather protections for states that imposed such taxes prior to the acts enactment date the bill is problematic for several reasons first congress instead of supporting this seriously flawed legislation should be focusing on meaningful ways to help state and local governments taxpayers and local retailers the house can do that by addressing the remote sales tax issue in addition to extending the expiring moratorium on a temporary basis the house should take up and send to the senate legislation that would give states the authority to collect sales taxes from remote sellers such a proposal would incentivize remote sellers to collect and remit sales taxes as well as require states to simplify several procedures that would benefit retailers such legislation would enable states and local governments to collect more than 23 billion in estimated uncollected sales taxes each year the measure would also help level the playing field for local retailerswho must collect sales taxeswhen they compete with outofstate businesses that do not collect these taxes retail competitors should be able to compete fairly with their internet counterparts at least with respect to sales tax policy the house should do its part and address the remote sales tax disparity before the end of this congress second this legislation will severely impact the immediate revenues for the grandfatherprotected states and all states progressively in the long term the congressional budget office for example estimates that this bill will cost certain states several hundred million dollars annually in lost revenues indeed the federation of tax administrators has estimated that the bill will cause the grandfatherprotected states to lose at least 500 million in lost revenue annually for my home state of texas enactment of this bill will result in a revenue loss of 358 million per year texas will not be alone in these losses annually wisconsin will lose about 127 million ohio will lose about 65 million and south dakota will lose about 13 million should this bill become law state and local governments will have to choose whether they will cut essential government servicessuch as educating our children maintaining needed transportation infrastructure and providing essential public health and safety servicesor shift the tax burden onto other taxpayers through increased property income and sales taxes meanwhile the center on budget and policy priorities has estimated that the permanent moratorium will deny the nongrandfathered states of almost 6 5 billion in potential state and local sales tax revenues each year in perpetuity this bill will burden taxpayers while excluding an entire industry from paying their fair share of taxes finally this bill ignores the fundamental nature of the internet the original moratorium was intentionally made temporary to ensure that congress industry and state and local governments would be able to monitor the issue and make adjustments where necessary to accommodate new technologies and market realities the act was intended as a temporary measure to assist and nurture the fledgling internet thatback in 1998was still in its commercial infancy yet this bill ignores the significantly changed environment of todays internet the bills supporters continue to believe that the internet still is in need of extraordinary protection in the form of exemption from all state taxation but the internet of 2015 is drastically different from its 1998 predecessor and surely the internet and its attendant technology will continue to evolve permanently extending the tax moratorium severely limits congresss ability to revisit and make any necessary adjustments simply put a permanent moratorium is unwise in closing i urge my colleagues to oppose h r 235 and i reserve the balance of my time the bill is misguided legislation that will devastate state revenues especially for those states currently protected by the grandfather clause and could force state governments to eliminate essential governmental programs and services while increasing the burden on taxpayers for all of these reasons i urge my colleagues to reject this flawed legislation that makes the internet tax moratorium permanent in part"], [3.159046173095703e-06, 0.5000031590461731, 0, "i
