house the senate and the white house the american people and my constituents in particular have been asking what have you done what have you achieved for us and i want to tell you tonight the center of what we have achieved as republicans is an economic growth that has been unrivaled in our nations history and at the center of that economic growth are tax cuts those tax cuts have fueled our economic recovery over the last 6 years republican tax cuts have made an enormous difference and let us talk about this one hundred eleven million american taxpayers have seen their taxes decline by an average of 1 877 and for the average family that is real money here in washington d c they spend that in a minute but at home in my district in cherryville north carolina that is real money that is real money for an american family a family in cherryville or in hickory or in morrisville to spend on textbooks clothes maybe even a vacation that has fueled our economic recovery the fact that the american people have more in their own pocket now than they did 6 years ago i will also say that a family of four earning 40 000 received a tax relief because of president bushs tax cuts and republican leadership in the house they have received a tax cut of 2 010 per year that is for a family of four making 40 000 a year that is a wonderful wonderful thing that we have allowed the american people to keep more of what they earned well what we are trying to do now what this republican congress is trying to do with the help of our president is not only extend the tax cuts which i am very proud that we were able to enact just a few weeks ago we extended the presidents tax cuts for 2 more years but to make it permanent and what would making those tax cuts permanent do for the american people well in my state of north carolina between now and 2014 we would produce 22 000 new jobs because of extending and making permanent the presidents tax cuts our annual gdp would grow by over 111 billion higher after inflation if we make the presidents tax cuts permanent personal savings will grow by 163 billion per year on average over the next decade if we make the presidents tax cuts permanent and personal income will grow in the state of north carolina on average by 4 000 a year disposable income that is and beyond that we are going to see the economy continue to grow if we are able to extend these tax cuts and a strong economy will spread prosperity more evenly throughout our economy and that is very important the american people having more money in their pocket is a very vital thing that is a very vital thing now my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have been four square against this why they think of government solutions as the only alternative and i

republican majority for the last 12 years why mr speaker because they want more revenue for government they want government to expand beyond that republicans have worked very hard at growing this

pell grant has continued to lose value yes they say well we put more money in it every year that is because more students tragically are eligible for the pell grant because they dont have the family income and we now see that the pell grant now covers tl4 lowest percentage of costs for those students who have pell grants going to school it has dropped from 41 percent it covered 41 percent of those costs in 2000 it is now down it will be down to 25 percent by 2010 so the trend line is horrible the trend line ts horrible for those students most in need those families most in need more and more of them are showing up to get the pell grant but they are not getting enough money to cover the costs of their college education the trend line is horrible and the number of students who are pursuing graduate degrees in science math and engineering it is working against the american economy and american security but this bill doesnt address that the higher education act has lost its place in the priorities of this congress and the priorities of this nation about the future of education and that is a tragedy that is a tragedy for those students who will be saddled with higher costs because of the increase in interest rates with higher fees their parents will be saddled with higher costs those who will choose to take out direct loans to try to reduce the cost will find out they are paying fees now and so that is what the republicans decided their idea when every indicator suggests that college costs are getting out of the reach of americas families and students and workers their idea was to increase the cost to those families and to their students it is just unacceptable it was unacceptable 3 months ago and it is unacceptable today this bill should be returned to committee and we should initiate the debate that this country demands and that this country needs in terms of the future of these students our economy and our national security that is what this higher education bill should be about it should not be about the leftovers after the largest cdt in student aid accounts in history have already been pulled off 2 months ago"]], "top_unsure":

here tonight but really more importantly if i may i want to thank her for her incredible passionate leadership particularly on fighting waste fraud and abuse that is unfortunately still rampant in the federal budget she has been such a champion and it has been a privilege for me to learn from her see how she does it and she has been extremely effective so it is truly just wonderful to see how she works and it is wonderful that she is giving this special order to speak about issues that are important to the united states of america i was listening to the honorable gentlewoman from north carolina and she was talking about things that have happened in this chamber one of the things that is important is to highlight that it is not only legislation that we have passed here but it is legislation not for the sake of passing legislation it is legislation that has had real concrete positive results for the american people let us look at some of the results more than just the legislation but the results of that legislation look at for example the growth in the gdp the gross domestic product this is after 9 11 this is after the internet bubble burst this is after the recession that president bush inherited when he first got elected despite all that because of legislation that the president led on and that this congress passed the gdp the growth of the economy has been spectacular we have had 14 consecutive quarters of real growth in the economy a 3 5 rate in the first quarter of this year a 3 5 percent increase in the gdp again 14 consecutive quarters of real growth despite what this congress and our president found itself dealing with after 9 11 look at payroll employment it rose by 2 2 million jobs during 2004 2 2 million jobs that would be unemployed if it was not for the policies of this congress of this majority and of the president of the united states 3 5 million jobs over the past 24 months ask those hardworking americans who now have jobs if the policies that this congress has pursued and passed have not worked for them they have worked for them and we are grateful for the presidents leadership i think we have to always remind ourselves that with a little bit of help with a few democrats but with the leadership of the speaker of the house and the majority party great things have happened for our country for our working men and women in our great country look at again the fact that unemployment today right now is lower than it was than the average of the 1970s the decade of the 1980s and yes even lower than the decade of the 1990s hard to believe that that is possible after 9 11 after the scandals on wall street after the bubbleburst of the internet again that is because of the leadership of our president and because of the leadership of this house the homeownership rate is at record levels more people own homes than ever in the history of our country and by the way if we look at minority homeownership also that is at record levels now we have more to do we have more to do still and we are working hard to do even more all of us are concerned about the deficit we have to reduce the size of the deficit we know that the president has said and he has pledged to cut the deficit in half over the next five years the budget that this house passed does just that in a responsible fashion it gets a handle on the deficit it is going to reduce the deficit in half we do that by controlling spending hey folks this is not rocket science if you are spending too much money that is why you have a deficit hey what do you do spend less not rocket science well that is what we are doing but let me tell my colleagues what our friends in the democratic party have proposed as their solution to control the deficit we hear them here on the floor of the house continuously and even in the senate talking about oh the deficit is too high but then what do they propose they propose billions and billions and billions of dollars in additional spending which would go directly to increase the size of the deficit they have done so publicly they have done so with an amendment in the committee on the budget on which i have the honor of serving and also here on the floor of the house they cannot have it both ways they cannot be concerned about the deficit and then propose billions and billions of dollars of additional spending in the federal budget spending of federal dollars the president by the way has done a great job in looking for programs that are not working i do not think again it takes a rocket scientist to un derstand that there are federal programs that frankly are just not doing that well that are just wasting the taxpayers money once again i have to repeat what i said in the beginning i want to thank the gentlewoman from north carolina ms foxx for her efforts particularly in trying to fight waste in the federal government the president has also done agreat job he has created this assessment tool called part what he has done is he has gone through every single area of the federal budget the federal government looking for things that can be reduced or eliminated because they are not needed not doing a good job because there are other programs that are better and less expensive he has proposed eliminating a number of programs and to shift that money to programs that do work we also have to
