and republican budgets suffer from the same infirmities fiscal irresponsibility and selfserving and outoftouch priorities both are wholly inadequate to meet the needs of our nation and will pass along mounting deficits and debts to generations yet unborn first the 5year republican budget will result in a deficit of 376 billion in 2006 44 million over the presidents projection the republicans budget proposal also has many cost omissions because they know that their deficit numbers explode after 5 years as such this budget does not take into account the cost of fixing the amt which will cost at least 642 billion it does not take into account the 774 billion needed to pay for the presidents muchtalked about but yet unveiled social security privatization plan i suppose the republican budget proposal deserves a little credit for hiking its deficit projection as it at least includes 50 million in 2006 for the wars in afghanistan and in iraq the presidents budget proposal contained zero dollars as a matter of fact it reported that the costs could not be known however both figures are fantasy the realistic figure over the next 10 years in addition to the 80 billion that we just passed in the supplemental is likely to be 384 billion to pay for its misguided policies the house budget resolution cuts nondefense discretionary spending by 12 billion below the amount needed in fiscal 2006 just to maintain current spending levels and it cuts spending on mandatory domestic programs by 8 billion to add insult to injury the republican budget provides 18 billion in additional tax cuts these misguided tax cuts will actually cost much more when the tax cuts actually expire in 2010 in fact 97 percent of these tax cuts will benefit taxpayers with incomes above 200 000 i think most reasonable people can agree that these priorities are not americas priorities while little good can be said about the bush administrations budget it at least provides detailed information on the programs it seeks to cut the house resolution shrouds its cuts in darkness leaving the american people to wonder what vital programs will find their way to the ch6ppinig block next both the republican and bush budget proposals are travesties when the bush administration took office the nation was experiencing record surpluses it has managed to turn a 521 billion surplus into a 367 billion deficit in contrast the spratt alternative budget as well as the congressional black caucus alternative budget that we will consider tomorrow focus national spending on priorities that benefit all americans and get us on the road to economic recovery they do this by funding key domestic priorities which address the needs of working families while fully supporting the national defense and protection of our homeland and preserving medicaid social security pension programs and student loans let me speak particularly about the budget developed by the congressional black caucus which corrects the irresponsible fiscal and economic policies contained in the house budget resolution by supporting existing programs that are essential to closing disparities creating opportunities and helping our citizens build their future it will get our country on the road to recovery while funding meaningful national priorities for our children for our seniors for our veterans and for our communities importantly the congressional black caucus budget supports these priorities while also meeting our obligation to our troops in iraq and in afghanistan the cbc budget funds community development programs including restoring funding to the community development block grant program and supporting increased funding for elderly and disabled housing programs the congressional black caucus budget will also restore funding for veterans health care rather than imposing new copayments on them for essential services and prescription drugs importantly the congressional black caucus budget will reduce the budget deficit by 167 billion during the next 5 years below the deficit that will be produced by the house budget resolution theirepublican budget cuts educational housing and health programs for our children while bequeathing to them a public debt that has increased by 1 268 trillion over the last 4 years and that will exceed 4 6 trillion even before we begin fiscal year these

this poison imposes on our communities in other districts maybe the problem isnt meth but perhaps something just as sinister like cocaine or heroin but no matter what face narcotics takes in any

let me be clear we are not preempting state authority in this area what we are doing is establishing minimum standards for federal acceptance of such documents this is consistent with actions taken by individual states today nevada and new mexico do not accept as proof of identity a stateissued drivers license or identification card from states that do not meet their standards the federalism issue is one of extreme importance and that is exactly why the language has been crafted as it has drivers licenses have become the primary form of identification in the united states they permit people to apply for other forms of identification transfer funds to bank accounts obtain access to federal buildings purchase firearms and board airplanes the majority of the states have recognized the privilege that a license brings and have set high standards for obtaining them however 10 states including my state of north carolina 14 6 issue valid drivers licenses and identification cards without

shoulderfired missile defense for our passenger airlines i have been working closely with the gentleman from new york to address this very real threat to our passenger jets from shoulderfired missiles the global black market has been flooded with hundreds of thousands of these weapons that are now in the possession of 27 separate terrorist groups around the world al qaeda used them in 2002 to attack an israeli airliner in kenya and terrorists in iraq came close to shooting down a dhl freight plane leaving baghdad in 2003 according to the fbi more than 500 civilians worldwide have been killed in successful missile attacks against commercial aircraft the state department has stated that one of the leading causes of loss of human life in aviation has been from shoulderlaunched attacks our commercial aircraft passengers deserve from congress vigilance and commitment to their safety the technology to defend american passengers from this threat is almost a reality right now dhssponsored programs to apply the department of defenses research and technology to our domestic passenger jets are nearing their last phase of development and are ready to equip test aircraft for operational evaluation this research brings us very close to leveraging the proven technology that has successfully protected our military personnel to commercial aircraft and their customers cutting support for this program would be shortsighted at a time when we are just around the corner from a cutting edge defense against terrorists anticraft missiles now is the time instead to move aggressively forward to address this threat the president the dhs and the state department all agree that this is important research with important ramifications i urge my colleagues to support the

up front i do it rather reluctantly because i am a huge proponent of the national rail system and recognize up front the need for some subsidization fair and responsible and reasonable subsidization as we do in other transportation routes and a lot of speakers have addressed that issue and that point but just as the last speaker pointed out the inefficiencies in the system in the process both at amtrak and frankly how the federal government has provided oversight i think that passage of this amendment represents a premature move to acceptance of those inefficiencies at a point a critical point in negotiations that we cannot do that facts are facts and we have been asking for amtrak to reform itself for a number of years we have not gotten much of a response in fact we have gotten resistance and the inefficiencies in the system continue to atrophy downward how it really impacts on people in my district just outside the northeast corridor not part of the corridor because the tracks are not owned by amtrak there is a continued deterioration and there is no amtrak plan no amtrak plan to resolve those issues putting at risk an awful lot of people i know what the chairman is trying to accomplish in this particular piece of legislation is force amtrak back to the table to talk about what needs to be maintained what is critical infrastructure what are critical lines of connection that have to be in this and if we simply just say we are going to go on with business as usual we continue to promote the atrophy within the system now i think at some point in this process many of these lines that are eliminated in this particular bill are reinstated before this bill becomes law but we ought not to do it just willynilly we ought not to just give it away we need to force some people to make some tough decisions we need to force some people to live by their commitments of the past which they have not thus far i think this is one of the few pieces of leverage that the gentleman from michigan chairman knollenberg and this subcommittee will have as we continue to try to find a way to get to the answers now we have gone from zero to now 1 2 billion in this bill that

with distinction and established herself as an advocate for sound water policy in her home state of california and across the nation representative napolitano has supported this bill and she has utilized many efforts in shepherding it through the legislative process i became interested in this effort because california and other parts of this country need to move forward on two very important issues first we must increase our groundwater drinking supplies and we can do this by improving the safe infiltration of surface water and second we must reduce urban stormwater runoff that can carry trash and contamination to our beaches and oceans the water augmentation study was created to address important economic and scientific questions about water quality and water supply simply put this project is about taking the water that we lose andturning it iiito water that we can use this study will assess the potential of urban stormwater infiltration to augment water supplies this water augmentation study will determine the benefits costs and risks of infiltration it will help us understand what conditions we need to make infiltration work and assess the potential for larger water supply at the same time it will show us how to reduce water pollution and create additional environmental and social benefits this bill is designed to make southern california more water selfsufficient and less reliant on imported water from our neighbors in the central and northern parts of our state i am also very pleased that president bush has included funding for the water augmentation study in his last three budgets including this year this is a bipartisan effort in which there is agreement on the merits of the project throughout our government also the california staff of the bureau of reclamation has been very supportive of this project in fact they helped create it in the year 2000 because they see it as helping solve a real problem we face in california and
