very prayerful way today because we were all horrified at what happened in paris at what happened in beirut at what happened to the russian airliner to name a few recent incidences we recognize that that is horrible and that we have to protect the american people from it to do so we must be strong but our strength must also spring from our prayerfulness for those who lost their lives or for those whose security was threatened physically emotionally and in every other way in our country we have a relationship with france they were our earliest friends that is why in this chainber of the house of representatives any visitor can see there are only two paintings one is of our great patriarch george washington our hero our founding father the other painting in this chamber is of the marquis de lafayette it is in recognition of the friendship that the french government extended to the colonies in our war for independence just imagine george washington and lafayette a long long friendship so while we are concerned about violence wherever it exists in the world when paris was hit in such a vicious way in some ways it hit home for us not that the other lives were not equally as important as we come to the floor to talk about what we do next we take an oath of officeevery one of usto protect and to support the american people and the constitution of the united states keeping the american people safe is our first responsibility it is the oath we take if the american people arent safe what else really matters we understand the concern the fear in the country when an act of terrorism strikes in fact that is the goal of terrorists to instill fear to instill terror we cannot let them succeed so we have to take the measures necessary to protect the american people and to be very strong in how we do it that is why i have a problem with the bill that is on the floor today it is because i think we have a much stronger better option to protect the american people and that is in the form of the thompsonlofgren legislation unlike in the republican bill the democratic alternative applies tough scrutiny to all potential refugees not just to syrians and iraqis as the republican bill is limited to the thompsonlofgren secure refugee process act would require the secretary of homeland security to verify the identities of all refugee applicants any application that contains insufficient conflicting or unreliable information would be denied from day one the bill also requires that at least five federal agenciesthe department of homeland security the attorney general the federal bureau of investigation the secretary of state the secretary of defense the director of national intelligencecheck all refugee applications against their records any application that indicates a national security or a criminal threat would be deniedall not iraqsyriaall two former secretaries of homeland securitysecretary janet napolitano and secretary michael chertoffhave written about the process that is in existence now and which the thompsonlofgren legislation respects the process that is currently in place is thorough and robust and so long as it is fully implemented and not diluted it will allow us to safely admit the most vulnerable refugees while protecting the american people fortunately they say these goals are not mutually exclusive there are other things that we could be doing in a bipartisan way and i would have hoped that that would have been a place we could have gone with this one of them relates to closing loopholes in the visa waiver program today our colleagues on the senate side are putting forth their principles which state if an isis recruit attempts to travel to the united states on a fraudulent paper passport issued by a country that participates in the visa waiver program that individual would avoid biometric screening and an inperson interview how could we allow this loophole to exist if we are truly addressing this challenge in a comprehensive way if the republicans want to make the nation safer in the face of terror there is another clear area in which we should act and that is we should be voting on republican congressman peter kings bill in order to close the appalling loophole it is outrageous that a person who is on the terrorism watch listlisten to this if someone is on the terrorist watch list he could walk into a gun store and buy a gun his bill is called the denying firearms and explosives to dangerous terrorists act the visa waiver close the terrorist gun loophole according to the gao over the last 11 years more than 2 000 suspects on the fbis terrorist watch list bought weapons in the united states did you know that ninetyone percent of all suspected terrorists who tried to buy guns in the united states walked away with the weapons they wanted over the time period with just 190 rejected despite their having ominous histories listen 5 to 1 10 to 1 they were able to get these guns why cant we talk about guns when we talk about danger to the american people it is outrageous that we would be slamming the door to mothers and children while we still allow people on the terrorist watch list to walk in the door of a

from california i look forward to discussing with him his bill next week and seeing whether it is something that i can support i strongly believe in encouraging employee ownership through esops options this bill does part we can do a lot more it is a big thing that we can do to address the increasing income disparities that this country has in making sure that workers can participate in capital formation and capital growth along with owners and executives we look forward to working with the gentleman on that bill and contacting the gentleman as well the gentleman from ohio said that somehow legal operating businesses must have access to banking resources the goal of this bill he said oh wait a minute i mean federal ones not state ones not federal not state this is where you have a difference of course you wont have any disagreement that there is an ambiguity here with regard to types of businesses that are legal at the state level and are not legal federally but this is where you will find that most democrats believe very strongly in states rights most republicans believe here with the exception of the other gentleman from california who just spoke and a number of others who would allow a majority to support this bill but apparently the gentleman from ohio believes in an overarching federal definition telling states what they can and cant do indirectly through the banking system effectively constraining their ability to allow banks to serve businesses that might sell types of firearms that are illegal federally or types of marijuana or hemp or other products that might be illegal federally effectively they are arguing that the federal government should tell them what to do and impose a onesizefitsall solution on states that are as diverse as texas and california and colorado and north dakota i disagree with that premise as do most of the democrats here today we feel that while this body of courseand i agree with the gentlemanshould continue with the discussion about the regulatory structure of legal treatment of cannabis products federally that should in no way shape or form stand in the way of a simple fix that says whether you want it to be legal or illegal transactions should be traceable safe through the banking system for businesses that are legal at the state level let me address h r 1675 the encouraging employee ownership act also being named the capital markets improvement act it is a good piece of bipartisan legislation that i think can be made even better through the amendment process title i of this bill which will revise the secs rule 701 by raising and indexing for inflation the threshold under which companies can issue stock to employees without running into government red tape is a commonsense good piece of legislation i hope it is something that most of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle agree with i am an early cosponsor of this legislation and i think we should promote and applaud the structure the indexation and of course allowing employees to have a stake in their companies that is not the only solution the gentleman from california might have some other ideas i look forward to discussing as do i but if you want to help solve some of our nations issues with income inequality and the wealth gap then we should applaud and promote companies that incorporate employee stock or option ownership whether you issue stock in the manner under this bill or whether you operate in esop or any of the other forms that allow workers to benefit from the growth of your company we should find ways to work together to promote and encourage this style of corporate governance title ii is a safe harbor for investment research a bill that will help improve available market information for investors and something that has broad bipartisan support i know my colleague from delaware will also be pleased to see this pass as an original sponsor my colleague from ohio who is a cochair with me of the congressional caucus for middle market growth spoke yesterday and today about how this overall package of legislation will help grow companies in the allimportant middle market this is main street america these are companies that might not be big enough to be multinational multibilliondollar brand names and they are not startups or small companies but it is the engine of our economy the portion of the market that is a vital piece of our economic engine creating jobs on main street title iii of this bill will work to reduce red tape for these very middle market companies these provisions have broad bipartisan support and i applaud them the sec has largely agreed with this in fact the only argument against it has been we already do this and i think that is a weak argument because we ought to put it in statute the sec has agreed and has taken action but unfortunately some of their actions have added in some increased investor impediments as well i hope the administration can work with congress to improve this bill if there are specific issues they have with it but the bill is necessary it is better to fix things in statute i think that we can work together to reduce red tape to grow small and middlesized companies title v of the bill is another bipartisan piece of legislation that is in line with the sort of regulatory review that we already ask in many agencies it is the sort of good government legislation i think both sides of the aisle can find agreement on and hopefully support now title iv of h r 1675 unfortunately is a bit of a step in the wrong direction and it is something we discussed extensively in the committee yesterday fortunately for this provision there was an open process mr issa and mr ellison have amendments that will be considered that improve the portion of the bill or remove it entirely unfortunately the bill as written is a move away from searchable financial reporting that can be done digitally it is a step away from sortable and downloadable formats it is a return to the pen and paper and inefficient world of the 20th century rather than a step forward to the open data transparency world of the 21st century across the board market participants investors and regulators want information that is already requiredwe are not talking about any new requirementsinformation that is already required financial information to simply be available in a digital searchable format that is all we seek to preserve and not eliminate it is an odd and outdated use of government resources to deal with this information by hand by pen by paper it puts investors and others at an enormous disadvantage and it prevents and reduces the amount of information in the marketplace searchable and sortable data can be better used to track trends find anomalies find investment opportunities and help regulators notice trouble spots in markets and hopefully catch the next enron before it explodes just as importantly investors need information so do entrepreneurial folks who want to take this information and package it in new and interesting and exciting ways and sell it on to institutional and individual investors we heard yesterday from detractors who said investors arent asking for this information we also heard that the committee didnt include any investors in their testimony they only included operating companies i am not sure who they are speaking for but in my conversations i have never heard any investor say i want less information or i want information to be harder to search or find no investor says i want to know less about a companys earnings i want it to be in an archaic pen and paper format that argument that this information isnt welcome by investors is simply incorrect and it is counter to anything you will ever hear from anyone in the investment community hopefully we will fix these issues through amendment overall i believe this package should merit serious consideration and support from my colleagues on both sides of the aisle h r 766 the financial institution customer protection act does address a very important issue and that is the inexcusable actions of operation choke point which at best could be described as an overzealous use of the department of justices power or at worst as a pernicious attempt to root out activities that are determined to be politically unpopular unfortunately as we examine this bill it looks like it has some unintended consequences which are not addressed through the amendment process the amendment process also fails to include a simple amendment that would further the goals of this bill with regard to the regulated marijuana industry in 22 states i hope that we can address the operation choke point issue i hope we can prevent this administration and future administrations from engaging having doj engage in this kind of troublesome use of authority to coerce closures of accounts for otherwise legitimate and legal customers of local financial institutions if a bank or credit union has a legal business it is legal in the state they deem it creditworthy they are a good customer and they want to open an account with them they should be able to serve that customer the federal government should not use the bank itself as an intermediary in a dispute if the doj has a dispute with a banks customer that should be resolved between the doj and the customer not the bank i hope that there is groundwork for bipartisan legislation in this area that can ensure that this president and future presidents and the future department of justices do not abuse their authority in this area one reallife everyday issue where this concept comes up of the department of justice and the federal government interfering with the bank working with its legal customer would have been addressed by the perlmutter amendment that i spoke about earlier it is not just a colorado issue frankly if this bill addressed that issue despite it being overarching in other areas i would probably support it thus is the importance of this issue from local law enforcement in our state but unfortunately not even a minute not even a second of debate is allowed on the issue the gentleman from ohio claimed that we were having that debate to be clear we are not we are debating the underlying rule there is no time for the sponsors of the amendment to make their case or for opponents of the amendment to make their case we are outlaying the time for other amendments many amendments have 10 minutes many amendments have more there is not even a second for the debate of that amendment sponsored by mr perlmutter that is why i cannot support this rule 213 million americans live in a state or jurisdiction where the voters have allowed for some legal marijuana use colorado tried to solve the problem locally but we were rejected by federal banking regulators in courts so congress needs to be the one to make this change only congress can address this issue while there remains a need to align federal and state laws while the doj and treasury have issued some guidance some institutions are providing banking services to the doj and treasury guidance issues the guidance does not solve the problem which is why we need to change the law and provide certainty which this very simple amendment that has bipartisan support and likely would have passed on the floor would have done but it is completely shut down under this rule even though it furthers the actual goal of the legislation is germane to the legislation is consistent with the legislation and yet it is completely shut down in a closed process that runs contrary to the speakers stated goal of allowing members on both sides of the aisle to

housing needs hopwa combines housing support with additional services to help people living with hiv aids and their families stay in stable safe housing manage their illness and remain active in their communities housing interventions are critical in our continued fight against hiv aids and research clearly shows that stable housing leads to better health outcomes providing stable housing to people living with hiv aids reduces the risk of transmission to a partner by 96 percent it reduces emergency room visits and expense to the public by 36 percent and hospitalizations by 57 percent in other words investing a modest amount in hopwa today saves us millions if not billions of federal taxpayer dollars in the future hopwa is the only federal housing program to provide cities and states with dedicated resources to address the housing crisis facing people living with hiv aids and the program traditionally enjoys strong bipartisan support congressional support for hopwa is clear in this

funding during the committees consideration of the bill some hail the bills slim 332 million for hopwa as a victory i also applaud any additional funding for hopwa but i cannot call it a victory to fund this program below its 2010 funding level when wait lists for hopwa services continue to grow and thousands of americans die on the streets and in shelters because we refuse to provide a few

need 364 million to provide hopwa services to those who need them and to fund vital administrative support to improve the program to reach that goal we would need to find 32 million somewhere in this bill to transfer to hopwa but the funding levels we are considering today are so abysmally low it is nearly impossible to move that much money without gutting other important programs what we do at the very least is pass my amendment to restore hopwa to its fy10 funding level of 335 million a scant 3 million increase that funding level makes only a small dent in hopwas real need but it will give hundreds more people and families access to lifesaving services it is a very small step but it is in the right direction and i believe if we have the chance to save even one life let alone hundreds we

limit womens access to abortion it would interfere with the sacred doctorpatient relationship and substitute a physicians best judgment with the judgment of a handful of politicians we must not forget

impact on women especially women in rural communities lowincome women and women of color and it would deny women access to preventive care lifesaving cancer screenings and family planning services

contraception and other reproductive health services in the name of opposing abortion we would see more unintended pregnancies and therefore more abortions among its flaws h r 3504 proposes a standard of care for abortion providers that could interfere with the ability of physicians to make medical decisions for their patients in doing so the bill represents an unprecedented level of intrusion by the government into medical decisions for instance the bill requires an abortion provider to immediately transport a fetus to a hospital in some cases even if the fetus is not viable under existing law and under the standards of care applicable to neonatal physicians this requirement is so broad and the penalties so severeup to 5 years in prisonthat one can only conclude that the real purpose of the bill is to intimidate abortion providers out of service the bill also requires doctors and employees of hospitals and clinics that provide abortion services to report any violations of the bills standard of care to state or federal law enforcement authorities any person who fails to comply with these requirements is threatened with fines and up to 5 years in prison this is not just the doctors but the cleaning crew and the receptionists on top of this the language in this bill completely fails to distinguish between a viable and nonviable fetus which is the constitutional line that separates abortions that may be performed without restrictions from those that may be regulated or prohibited the bills vague and broad mandates combined with severe penalties will effectively intimidate doctors and ultimately drive them away from the abortion practice which appears to be the true intent of this troubling bill this is why so many organizations are opposed to this bill those like the national womens law center the aauw the aclu and physicians for reproductive choice and health in fact the american congress of obstetricians and gynecologists which represents 58 000 physicians opposes h r 3504 because it represents a gross interference in the practice of medicine inserting a politician between a woman and her doctor by intimidating doctors and thereby making abortion unavailable as a practical matter abortion opponents seek to accomplish in fact what they have not accomplished in the courts or in public opinion simply put h r 3504 is yet another attack on womens health and rights when the bornalive infant protection act or baipa became law 13 years ago the bills sponsors clarified that the law was not intended to affect abortion practice or a womans right to choose we did not want to constrain or chill medical decisions regarding patient care that is why judiciary committee democrats voted to support it the bill before us today appears to

the epa to regulate any air pollutant from any class or classes of new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines which may be reasonably anticipated to endanger public health or welfare congress further defined motor vehicle as a selfpropelled vehicle designed for transporting persons or property on a street or highway any reasonable person would understand that selfpropelled vehicle means a vehicle that can propel itself of its own initiative one would think of pickup trucks semis vans or cars one thing that does not come to mind is the back portion of a tractor trailer being the trailer portion which has no way of selfpropelling itself unfortunately the epa doesnt seem to see it that way in last years proposed rules for greenhouse gas emissions and fuel efficiency standards for onroad heavyduty vehicles and engines the epa attempted to regulate truck trailers as selfpropelled vehicles furthermore the epa has a voluntary program called smartway that provides engineering guidelines for aerodynamics and reduced truck weight smartway which is voluntary is intended to improve fuel efficiency for combined tractor tailers however smartway only improves fuel efficiency when tractor trailers are traveling at highway speeds of more than 50 miles per hour smartway provides no benefits whatsoever when the tractor trailers are traveling at less than 50 miles per hour around towns which are where most of the tractor trailers are used in the united states but epa wants to mandate all trailers to be governed by smartway even those that travel less than 50 miles per hour in fact if the government manipulates the weight of trailers cargo gets displaced which results in more tractor trailers on the road higher consumer prices and more greenhouse gas emissions just to meet current freight demands the trailers that epa is proposing to regulate are highly customized to the individual specifications of each customer trailer manufacturers should not be forced to comply with a onesizefitsall standard especially when given that so many trailers do not gain any fuel efficiency benefits from smartway my amendment would prevent the epa from using any funds in the bill to regulate trailers under the greenhouse gas rule not only should these guidelines remain voluntary because they only benefit some trailers epa has no business regulating trailers under the clean air act given that they are not selfpropelled this proposed regulation by the epa is another example of a federal agency overstepping its bounds and attempting to enact a regulation that benefits some parts of the economy but harms others if this attempted overreach by the epa is enforced it will be costly and counterproductive because the private sector is moving faster to improve fuel efficiency and reduce air pollution than the epa can move congress would be wise to stop this regulation and keep the smartway program voluntary and let trailer manufacturers do what they know is best for their

take for granted we cherish them because we know the alternative we need look no further than just 60 miles south of the united states to see the alternative where the castro regime has been entrenched for over 55 years and ruling the island with an iron fist this is berta soler one of the leaders of las damas de blanco the ladies in white a peaceful dissident group berta has been detained so many times she says to me that she has lost count that is why we stand united in a bipartisan manner in steadfast opposition to any attempts by the obama administration to normalize relations with the castro regime president obamas audacity of hubris has resulted in one exercise in folly after another and engagement with cuba is the height of that folly what have we gotten in return let me turn to the next poster this poster has a list of some of the many wanted criminals who have sought refuge and have gotten it in castros cuba we havent gotten any reforms from this deal we havent gotten the return of these dozens of criminals that castro has been harboring because they have fled from justice in america like convicted new jersey state trooper killer joanne chesimard after this deal was announced the castro regime said oh no all of these people we will give them asylum the fbi has put her on the most wanted terrorist list yet castro says we will give them asylum what have the cuban people received as a result of this administrations concessions well 53 political prisoners supposedly were released like some of these activists who were rounded up in a catch andrelease program of the castro regime the administration hails this list of 53 as a victory ignoring the fact that hundreds of political and antiregime activists like these were arrested and detained immediately before and after the announcement of the changes and almost 2 000 people were arrested or detained last year alone this infamous list of 53 that has been praised by this administration and the castro regime is another ruse over a dozen individuals on that list were released prior to the december 17 announcement including carlos andres sanchez perez he was released over 1 year ago some were arrested even before june catch andrelease is the new program the new playbook of the castro regime and obama deliberately has fallen for that ruse now the regime will feel emboldened because the united states has just signed off on its mistreatment of its citizens and president obama has extended an economic lifeline to the regime that will allow it to continue this repression before there can be any discussion of changing our policy toward cuba all political prisoners must be released not this fake list of 53 fair and multiparty elections must be held and the fundamental human rights of every cuban must be respected i warn my colleagues to pay close attention to what the obama administration is attempting to do in cuba because this will track with its attempts at reconciliation with iran another rogue nation and state sponsor of terrorism the administrations efforts in cuba have been the test case for iran and the two have paralleled each other while the administration was holding secret talks with the castro regime we know that he was penning secret letters to irans supreme leader khamenei and conceding to iran the right to enrich uranium these concessions to cuba are just the tip of the iceberg and it will open the doors to similar measures in iran where the supreme leader will see what is happening in cuba and says hey we can get away with that as well both have serious consequences for our national security as other nations see that we lack the courage of our convictions and they will be willing to test us in fact nicolas maduro after the prisoner exchange said we will exchange leopoldo lopez a human rights activist whom nicolas maduro has imprisoned in venezuela for one of the criminals in prison here in the united

legislation and i thank those who are really talking about trying to create jobs really what we are talking about here is in terms of the exim bank the exportimport bankit is a bipartisan piece of legislation that we are looking to reauthorize we are looking to make sure that again we are creating jobs as for the reauthorization of the bank for those who might have forgotten and for those who may be tuned in in 2012 the reauthorization passed on a suspension vote of 33093 it passed in the senate 7820 this was not three decades ago this was 3 years ago there is a reason to support the reauthorization of the exim bank and i appreciate my good friend mr collins for talking about how exim equals jobs i do believe that is the case you have all heard the statistics i mean 83 percent of the loans nationwide from the exim bank are going to small businesses small businesses create twothirds of the net new jobs in our nation i have to tell you in talking to my colleagues around this very body the number one issue that we encounter is the fact that it is jobs and the economy we want to create and make sure that there is a robust number of good highpaying careers the exim bank enables those small businesses to be able to keep their doors open to be able to ship to 96 percent of the worlds consumers which happen to be outside of the united states it is interesting to me when we talk about this because there are a lot of big businesses out there that have the ability and the resources to put a plant over in places like malaysia or germany or those other places it is the small businesses that oftentimes dont have that ability you heard me having a conversation with mr collins earlier about someone who came into my office who was talking about the fact that he manufactures tractors the tractors arent big tractors they are fairly small tractors but the tractors cost about 1 million apiece if they arent able to manufacture those tractors here in the united states in getting that exportimport bank financing they will go somewhere else they have a facility in france that they will be able to use those are jobs that are going to leave the united states i do believe that when we talk about the economic growth in manufacturing my district and i know many of the other districts of my colleagues here are heavy in manufacturing we are the fourth largest manufacturing district in the 10th district of illinois we have literally hundreds of jobs54 000in the district that rely upon exports i recognize that there are a lot of people who want to talk about boeing but boeing actually has three dozen suppliers in the 10th district of illinois these are three dozen businesses and hundreds of employees who support making things that go into a boeing plane you have heard the adage that when a boeing plane lands 21 000 small businesses land with it this is important this is talking about good highpaying jobs things that the exportimport bank absolutely helps support the thing that is interesting to me is that if we choose to not reauthorize the exportimport bank who loses our competitors overseas have export financing our small businesses will be the ones that lose we are going to in essence tie one hand behind our back and make us less competitive i cant think of a crazier thing that of making us less competitive we want to be more competitive we want to give our small businesses every advantage possible to be able to go out and compete and win this is what we have an obligation to do this is what we have an opportunity to do i am delighted to be able to stand up here with my friends to talk in a bipartisan way actually about why it is important that we reauthorize the exportimport bank it is because there are jobs and there are businesses in vernon hills in wheeling in lincolnshire in northbrook in waukegan in glenview in des plaines in gurnee in elmhurst in lake villa in bannockburn and in mount prospect these are all towns in the 10th district that have companies that utilize the exportimport bank this is not some random deal this is something that small businesses utilize in order to make sure that they can sell their goods to places all over the globe to places like france germany india and china it is super important that we give them the opportunity to not only make it here in america but to be able to send it all over the globe if we are looking for an opportunity to end a government program listen i am all for government accountability and for trying to make sure that the government is smaller and more responsive lets not focus on a government program that brings billions of dollars into the federal treasury and creates jobs we have heard about the crony capitalism frankly i think that we need to be focusing on how we help small businesses because again if we shut down the exportimport bank who loses it is our small businesses not the small businesses that they compete against that may be overseas because they will have an export financing arm as my friend mr collins was talking about before if the private sector and the private sector banks would do it i understand but there are a lot of those private sector banks and a lot of those local community banks even those midsized banks that see the collateral go overseas that they cant touch and that they cant get back when they walk in for 1 million of financing to send that tractor overseas the answer is no guess what they cant hire that next individual to create and make that tractor we need export financing we need to make sure that the exportimport bank has some restructuring this bill does some of that in terms of the bill that we are looking for to try to have some changes that go into the exportimport bank to make sure that we are having that appropriate oversight to make sure that we are holding them accountable but it is absolutely vital for good highpaying careers that the exportimport bank is reauthorized and

orlando should bring into sharp focus the growing threat that our nation faces from islamic terrorism and that begins with realizing that although islam is a religion it is often accompanied by a poisonous political ideology that is antithetical to everything that our country stands for that ideology now poses a direct threat to the liberty and safety of our people and we have every right to defend ourselves against it we knew for years that the terrorists father was broadcasting protaliban and antiamerican rhetoric aimed principally at a large and growing afghan islamic population within the united states we knew that the terrorist himself had traveled repeatedly to saudi arabia under mysterious circumstances associated with known terrorists and islamic radicals in the united states and expressed the most virulent antiamerican views and we took no action because there are far more instances of such threats than we can begin to assess or address this administration has drastically increased the admission of refugees from regions where overwhelming majorities believe in imposing sharia law those who are fleeing sharia law and islamist political ideology should be welcome in this country at assimilable levels but those who are coming here to impose it are a direct threat to our constitution and they have no business being admitted to our shores yet this administration makes no distinction between the two indeed earlier this year when governor rick scott of florida acting on behalf of law enforcement requested information on the islamic immigrants being inserted into his state he was refused that vital public safety information while seeking to rapidly increase the number of islamists being admitted to this country this administration has failed not only to enforce our immigration laws but it has actively undermined those laws as a result of these deliberate government policies we are enduring islamist attacks within our borders that will continue to increase in both frequency and severity there is no blinking at the fact that these policies have encouraged a large and growing fifth column that is violently hostile to our country and it has become deeply embedded within our communities san bernardino and orlando were just the first bloody foretaste of what is to come until and unless these policies are stopped and reversed last year the house passed the safe act that is an acronym for safety against foreign enemies it was the first tentative step toward properly screening refugees from hotbeds of islamic extremism it merely required affirmative verification of a refugees lack of hostile intent if they were coming from islamist strongholds in iraq and syria 135 democrats in this house opposed the safe act and senate democrats killed it in january at the behest of their president the very same politicians who will not allow us even to confirm the intent of islamists entering america are at the same time using the orlando atrocity as an excuse to disarm loyal and lawabiding americans within minutes of the attack the left began to use this terrorist atrocity to justify more restrictions on the rights of americans to defend themselves they would have us believe that terrorists who are bent on destroying our country by violently killing americans will somehow make one exception to their contempt for our nation by meticulously obeying our gun control laws the leftists tell us to leave it to the police really in orlando it took 3 hours for police to secure the scene and confront the attacker while hostages were being shot and the wounded were left to bleed to deaths hours in san bernardino the terrorists had already fled before police even arrived at the scene the first line of defense against an armed terrorist is an armed american yet the democrats seek to make it harder for americans to arm themselves while increasing the threat posed by mass immigration from those countries where islamist ideology is rampant is it possible that they dont understand that there is an international arms market and that terrorists can get their hands on any kinds of weapons they want as effortlessly as teenagers can buy pot while the orlando terrorist got his guns legally he could just as easily have gotten them illegally but that is not the case of lawabiding american citizens lawabiding citizens obey our laws terrorists do not the lefts vision for our country is one in which americans cannot shoot back and must helplessly wait to be rescued while they are being terrorized by islamic extremists who should never have been in this country in the first place and that is going to continue in this country until it wakes up to the danger that it faces and takes decisive action at the ballot box that is

bipartisan support h r 30 the save american workers act is designed to address a critical flaw in the affordable care act which is causing workers to lose hours at their jobs and thus lose wagesthose wages that help put food on their tables those wages that help feed their families pay their utility bills heat their homes during the winter and cool their homes during the summer h r 30 fixes this flaw by changing the newly created labor rule in the affordable care act which defines fulltime work at 30 hours a week and places that definition back where the american public has believed it to be for the last 100 years that is at 40 hours the second bill contained in todays rule is h r 3 the keystone xl pipeline act and that would put an end to what has been a 6year process for approving a pipeline that should have simply been common sense for americas economy a long time ago the rule before us today provides for 1 hour of debate for each of the bills this allows the house to fully debate these crucial issues these bills are targeted pieces of legislation dealing with one single provision in the affordable care act and one single pipeline respectively no one is trying to repeal the affordable care act today for that stay tuned but i have no doubt that members of the minority will claim that this bill is an attempt to repeal the affordable care act but in fact it simply makes changes to a definition and interpretation by the department of labor in the bill as always the minority is also afforded the customary motion to recommit on each of the bills as a result of the affordable care acts requirement that businesses with 50 or more employees provide health insurance coverage to those employees working 30 hours per week employers across the nationfrom schools to universities to municipalities to restaurantsare being forced to cut workers hours or face unsustainable employment costs to their businesses and to their organizations as a result we are seeingand this is what republicans predicted prior to the controversial and contentious passage of the affordable care actbut what we are seeing is the bill has fundamentally changed labor law in this country creating a new standard 30hour workweek as a result workers hours are being cut and productivity in this countrya country that has always prided itself on the work ethic of its citizenswill decrease over time this is what onerous government regulations dosuppress innovation and hamper businesses many members of the democratic party have been outspoken in clamoring for an extension to longterm unemployment benefits which would extend government assistance to all unemployed americans well beyond a years worth of benefits yet there is something that can be done now there is something that can be done today which will have an actual practical effect of putting more money in more peoples pockets we have heard story after story from every state in the union that employers are dropping workers hours from less than 39 hours a week to perhaps less than 29 hours or fewerpotentially 10 work hours a week that workers wont see in their paychecks which could mean hundreds of dollars that men and women wont have to feed their families and pay their bills increasing workers hours increases money that people have to spend the affordable care act fundamentally changed labor law in this country and the repercussions of this may not be felt for years to come this is a dangerous slippery slope what other labor laws will be reinterpreted now to define fulltime employment as 30 hours per week do people intend to impose overtime rules on employers who employ people for over 30 hours per week this is yet another regulation which would only result in businesses cutting more hours what will the national labor relations board reinterpret knowing that the very fabric of labor law is now based on a 30hour workweek instead of the 100year standard of the 40hour workweek prior to the affordable care act employers were already overwhelmingly providing health insurance to their employees working 40 hours per week making the change contained in mr youngs legislation will cause the least amount of disruption to the labor market and that is an important thing the congressional budget office estimates that the affordable care act will reduce the total number of hours worked on net by about 1 5 percent during the period from 2017 to 2024 almost entirely because workers will choose to supply less labor because of this the congressional budget office projects a decline in the number of workers of about 2 million in 2017 rising to 2 5 million in 2024 as a result of the affordable care act the latest congressional budget office figures show that the affordable care act will increase spending by almost 2 trillion double the estimate from 5 years ago and the joint committee on taxation says that taxpayers will be on the hook for over another 1 trillion over the next decade americans earning as little as 25 000 annually will pay more because of the law even after accounting for the 1 trillion in premium costsharing subsidies h r 3 the keystone xl pipeline act is an issue that congress and

that make the headlines or the unseen violence that happens daily on our streets gun violence takes the lives of more than 30 000 of our nations citizens each year a number that far exceeds other industrial countries now all these countries have their share of violent extremists and madmen but only our country gives easy access to weapons of mass killing and that makes all the difference for america rather than seeking out commonsense solutions to address this crisis the republican majority continues to cower to the gun lobby and the firearms manufacturers now they plead the second amendment but constitutional law 101 would tell us that all of our rights including the precious freedoms of religion and speech must be balanced to protect innocent third parties and to protect the safety of the wider community one commonsense measure we should all agree on is background checks to keep guns out of the hands of criminals domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill you cant shout fire in a crowded theater because of your freedom of speech and neither should you be able to buy a weapon if you have a history of violence and criminality in fact almost 90 percent of americans including the majority of gun owners support universal background checks for all gun purchases the problem is that our present background check system is rife with loopholes background checks are not required for private sales at gun shows they are also not required for internet sales bipartisan legislation has been introduced by representatives peter king and mike thompson that would finally close this egregious loophole it is an entirely sensible reform that would have a measurable impact on the safety of our schools homes and neighborhoods without preventing lawabiding citizens from using guns for selfdefense or recreational purposes despite attracting 186 cosponsors including several republicans the background check legislation has never been brought to the floor or even received a hearing in committee it has been languishing for more than 15 months meanwhile the shootings and the suicides and the massacres continue to accumulate my colleagues we must do better our fellow citizens are totally fed up both with the unspeakable killing and suffering and with a feckless congress that hasnt lifted a finger to prevent it now this week after intense public criticism and a historic protest by democrats on the house floor republicans seemed for a while to be willing to hold a vote on legislation they claim would prevent suspected terrorists from purchasing firearms after all nearly 2 500 individuals on the terrorist watch list have successfully purchased weapons in this country but rather than embrace existing bipartisan legislation to actually fix the problem republicans put forth a woefully inadequate proposal that would require law enforcement and courts to grapple with unworkable processes unreachable standards to be completed in an unreasonably short period of time their bill would allow suspected terrorists to receive firearms by default after only 3 days if the court is unable to work through a complicated process that is the same flaw that allowed the white supremacist charleston shooter to obtain the weapon that he used to murder nine people at emanuel ame church in other words the bill is totally inadequate now under pressure from their most extreme members republican leaders refuse to even put this bill on the floor what should be on the floor is bipartisan legislation h r 1076 that would permit the attorney general to block gun sales to suspected terrorists this legislation based on a proposal from the bush justice department would still allow individuals to challenge the government in court to restore their gun ownership rights we dont have to choose between protecting our communities and respecting due process and so we ask our colleagues how much longer must we wait how many more people have to die to move us to act how many more american towns and cities must be added to the constantly growing list of places like orlando and columbine and aurora and charleston and newtown moments of silence arent enough thoughts and prayers are not enough in fact the scriptures teach us that such pieties give grave offense when they mask a refusal to do what we know is right we need action i call

is an amendment that she actually authored and i would like to present it in so doing i want to remind us that this amendment deals with two programs that are near and dear to my heart the affordable housing trust fund and the home program these programs are near and dear to my heart because the greatness of a nation will not be measured by how we treat people who live in the suites of life how we treat the well off the well heeled and the well to do the greatness of a nation is often measured by how we treat people who live in the streets of life those who are too often among the least the last and the lost this amendment seeks to provide aid and comfort for those who but for the grace of god could be you or me but those who find themselves living in the streets of life this amendment in dealing with the affordable housing trust fund will restore it the current bill would actually eliminate the affordable housing trust fund this amendment provides some degree of aid and comfort for those who are living at 30 percent of the area median income wherever they happen to live in ms maxine waters district this would mean an annual income of 20 200 for a family of four i would dare say that there are few among us who would dare attempt to live off of 20 200 as an individual this helps a family of four with 20 200 this is what the affordable housing trust fund does it helps people who are extremely low of income my hope is that we will be able to prevent this elimination of the affordable housing trust fund and this amendment does it this amendment also will help those who can benefit from the home program the home program can serve a family of four that earns up to 53 900 per year this program is a partnership if you will between state municipal and federal government it has been a program that has been of great benefit across the length and breadth of this country there is not a state in the country i would dare say that has not benefited from the home program it is my hope that we can meet the presidents request for the home program right now it is about 293 million short of the presidents request this amendment would add that 293 million that the president has requested i started by indicating that these are two programs that are near and dear to me i believe that ruth meltzer was right when she indicated that some measure their lives by days and years others by heartthrobs passions and tears but the surest measure under gods sun is what for others in your lifetime have you done these programs afford us an opportunity to do for others to be a

it reiterates the longstanding policy of the united states to not recognize territorial changes effected by force as dictated by the stimson doctrineestablished in 1932 by then secretary of state henry l stimson in georgia and elsewhere in the region russia has committed gross violations of these principles by fomenting unrest and aiding separatist movements in the countries along its periphery foundational multilateral agreements reached for the purpose of maintaining a peaceful and stable international order such as the helsinki final act of 1975 and the charter of the united nations have been willfully disregarded by russia at putins behest this resolution condemns strongly the forcible and illegal occupation of the abkhazia and south ossetia regions in georgia and calls on russia to withdraw its troops from the territories russian forces continue to harass civilian communities along the administrative boundary line and impede the right of return of internally displaced persons this resolution is about restoring the territorial integrity of a sovereign state and upholding the commitments and promise of the unitedstatesgeorgia charter on strategic
