deadline i point out one was recently when the gentleman from wisconsin was chairman it is true that we did not make this deadline this year however it is also true that keeping our fiscal house in order does take a little longer than the freewheeling bigspending days of the past because we must ensure that all funding is spent efficiently and where it is needed the most the conference report before us this afternoon not only holds the line on the presidents additional spending requests but also responsibly funds areas important to every american citizen and protects the american people from waste fraud and abuse across the entire federal government earlier this year the republican congress made a commitment to end the 30year raid on social security and according to the congressional budget office we have now completed that task the president began the budget negotiations by taking a large step toward our position on the social security issue and joined us in locking away every penny of social security we worked with him in a bipartisan fashion to protect retirement security we were determined to protect american seniors and this congress and its leadership denied any piece of legislation on the house floor that spent one penny of it to achieve our goal of protecting american seniors and responsibly funding important programs we are including in this bill a plan to direct every federal agency to reduce spending by less than onehalf of one percent 38 percent of 1 percent by routing out waste fraud and abuse surely the government can save less than about half a penny out of every dollar this republican congress is simply asking those who run federal agencies to make fiscally responsible budgeting decisions with the money taxed out of our paychecks we all know the agency directors and executives know where the waste is and i am relatively certain they will be able to weed out at least that much in savings with this sensible plan in addition to meeting the fiscally responsible objectives this conference report also ensures that our principles of quality and flexibility in the funding for teachers have been met in the laborhhs section of the bill this congress ensures that funding may no longer be used to hire unqualified teachers provides that schools will have more flexibility in using their funding for improving the qualityof uncertified teachers and increases the amount of funding that may used for professional training for teachers the administration pushed for a onesizefitsall mandate in which washington controlled the 100 000 new teachers program not every district needs new teachers some need bettertrained teachers other districts need books hightech equipment and updated math and reading programs i think it is foolish for the washington bureaucracy to tell every school district in america that washington knows best how to spend tax dollars to educate our children the debate in washington is not only about money it is also about how that money should be spent this bill moves us closer to the right balance of education funding by providing additional funds for americas students through programs like pell grants and special education while lowering the bureaucratic burden imposed by washington through programs like goals 2000 the commerce justice state section of the conference report maintains our commitment to enhancing local law enforcement without involving washington bureaucrats we also provide funding for 1 000 new border patrol agents funds for increased criminal and illegal alien detention and the resources necessary to end the severe naturalization backlog at the ins the district of columbia continues to receive the high level of funding provided in each round of this process the conference

compromise on the environment in the interior appropriations section of this conference report republicans rejected attempts to impose the restrictions of the kyoto global warming regime on americans

in strong support of the house and senate going to conference and sending to the president this week legislation that wipes out what i consider to be the most unfair tax of all we have often asked from the well of the house a pretty simple basic question that is is it right is it fair that under our tax code 25 million married working couples pay higher taxes just because they are married is it right is it fair that 25 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 in higher taxes just because they are married and today the only way to avoid that marriage tax penalty when both the man and the women that are in the workforce is either not get married or get divorced it is wrong that under our tax code one pays higher taxes just because they are married i was so proud of this house just this past week when we passed and sent to the senate legislation which wiped out the american tax penalty for 25 million couples this afternoon the senate by a vote of 61 to 38 an overwhelming vote including democrats joining with republicans voted to eliminate the marriage tax penalty of course the bills are a little bit different we have to work out the differences the bottom line is we want to eliminate the marriage tax penalty let me give an example of a couple from the district that i represent in the south side of chicago in the south suburbs who suffer the marriage tax penalty this is michelle and shad hallihan they are two public school teachers they live just outside joliet illinois shad teaches at joliet high school michelle teaches at manhattan junior high they suffer about 1 000 in marriage tax penalty their combined income is about 62 000 they are homeowners and i would point out that since we introduced the bill to eliminate the marriage tax penalty a year and a half ago shad and michelle have since had a little baby if the democrats have their way this child will probably be out of college before we eliminate the marriage tax penalty because there is always an excuse not to do it today the bottom line is for michelle and shad hallihan and for their new little baby ben 1 400 the average marriage tax penalty is real money in the joliet area 1 400 is 3 months of day care at a local child care center for little ben 1 400 is 3 000 diapers for little ben 1 400 is one years tuition at a community college called joliet junior college in joliet illinois it is a washer and dryer for their home our legislation that passed the house of representatives will help people like michelle and shad hallihan the democrats talk about their alternative it would leave michelle and shad hallihan out they would still be stuck with the marriage tax penalty under our legislation which passed the house of representatives with the vote of every republican and also 48 democrats who broke with their leadership to support the elimination of the marriage tax penalty we helped couples two public school teachers like shad and michelle hallihan as i pointed out earlier shad and michelle are homeowners they also have a baby and of course they give money to church and charity so that means they itemize their taxes under our proposal we double the standard deduction to twice that for single people under our proposal that helps those who do not itemize but if we are going to help people like michelle and shad hallihan we have to help itemizers that means we need to widen the tax bracket so in the 15 percent bracket two joint filers a couple with two incomes have to be able to earn twice as much as what a single person can earn in that tax bracket under our proposal in the 15 percent tax bracket we widen it so that twoearner households can earn twice as much that will help shad and michelle hallihan i would point out that the proposal that the gentleman from massachusetts talked about would not help those who itemize and think about it most middleclass families who itemize their taxes itemize because they own a home or they give money to church and charity we as members of congress can all think of our neighbors back home middleclass working families who pursue the american dream they buy a home and because of their mortgage interest costs and because of their property taxes they itemize their taxes the democrats say if one itemizes their taxes they are rich so they should continue to suffer the marriage tax penalty now michelle and shad make 62 000 a year back in the south suburbs of chicago that is kind of a middleclass working family under the democrat definition of rich they are rich making 62 000 a year our goal is to make the tax code more fair when i am in the south side of chicago at a steel workers hall in the tenth ward or a legion post in joliet or at a local iron workers hall in la salle or a chamber of commerce function or coffee shop people tell me theirs taxes are too high but they also point out that the tax code is unfair that is why we should help people like michelle and shad hallihan let us

that i represent is so very very diverse i find there is a common message and that is the folks back home want us to come here republicans and democrats and work together to find solutions to the challenges that we face that is why i am so proud that over the last 5 years we have done so many things we were told we could not do we balanced the budget for the first time in 28 years we gave a middleclass tax cut for the first time in 16 years we reformed our welfare system for the first time in a generation and a great accomplishment just this past year was we stopped the raid on social security for the first time in 30 years that is progress on our agenda and we are continuing to move forward to find better ways to help find solutions our agenda is pretty simple paying down the public national debt saving social security and medicare helping our local schools and we also want to bring fairness to the tax code that is one of the issues i want to talk about today because i believe that as we work to bring fairness to the tax code particularly to middleclass working families that we should focus first on the most unfair consequence of our current complicated tax code and that is the marriage tax penalty which is suffered by almost 21 million married working couples let me explain what the marriage tax penalty is under our current tax code if they are married both husband and wife are working they pay more in taxes than they do if they stay single let me give this example a marriage tax penalty example a machinist and a schoolteacher middleclass working folks in joliet illinois with a combined income of 63 000 paymore and here is how they do it if they have a machinist making 31 500 he is in the 15 percent tax bracket if he marries a schoolteacher with an identical income of 31 500 under our tax code they file jointly their combined income of 63 000 pushes them into the 28 percent tax bracket and for this machinist and schoolteacher they pay the average marriage tax penalty of almost 1 400 more just because they are married under our tax code now if they chose to live together instead of getting married they would have saved that 1 400 our tax code punishes them if they choose to get married that is just wrong it is a pretty fair question is it right is it fair that under our tax code this machinist and schoolteacher in joliet illinois pay more in higher taxes let me give my colleagues another example here of two schoolteachers also of joliet illinois michelle and shad hallihan they were just married in the last couple of years a wonderful young couple i have had a chance to sit down and talk with them and of course i have a nice wedding photo the point is that shad has taught a little longer than michelle and he makes 38 000 a year his wife michelle makes 23 500 because they chose to get married to live together in holy matrimony they suffer the marriage tax penalty because their combined income when they file jointly pushes them into the 28 percent tax bracket for them for michelle and shad hallihan in joliet illinois two schoolteachers they pay almost a thousand dollars more michelle has pointed out to me since they have just had a baby that is almost 3 000 diapers that 1 000 of marriage tax penalty would pay for in that family if they were allowed to keep it now the republicans in this congress believe that eliminating the marriage tax penalty should be a priority and we believe that in this era of budget surpluses when the federal government is taking in more than we have been spending that we should give some of it back we want to focus that on bringing fairness to the tax code this past year we sent to the president legislation that would have wiped out the marriage tax penalty for people like michelle and shad hallihan unfortunately the president and vice president gore chose to veto that legislation because they wanted to spend the money on new government programs my colleagues should it not be a priority to help people like michelle and shad hallihan married working couples who work hard and who are unfairly treated by our tax code we have legislation today which now has 230

and tell us that a lot of our policies that have been a part of our federal government over the years have encouraged farms to get bigger and bigger and bigger or get out of business this is one of the few areas in the recommendations of 146 recommendations that they said to work with farmerowned cooperatives to give them the tools and resources so that they can band together to add value to their natural resources so they are not just dependent on fluid milk so that they can try to process add value to it to compete in a global world market force and not just to allow individual farmers to go out on their own to be able to negotiate prices with a dairy interest and large corporations in some cases multinational corporations to think that they are somehow going to get a fair deal and to purport that the small cooperatives farmerowned cooperatives are somehow going to destabilize those market forces is not being accurate what we are referring to here is more like a credit union in the international finance world in allowing them to be able to have at least some opportunities to take care of the small farmers and be able to allow them to group together that is what is being attacked today the ability of them to be able to group together to band together in cooperatives to improve their marketing position is being attacked milk receipts are the only source of revenue for

this time the republican budget as we have heard tonight has six key features and i want to take a moment to talk about one of them which is tax relief for hardworking americans when we talk about federal taxes it is useful to consider the overall context of the federal budket here let us remember federal spending is higher than it has ever been federal taxes are higher than any peacetime in our nations history as we heard earlier about 21 percent of our entire economic output goes to the federal government what the republican budget does is it says after we set aside all of the social security funds for social security and to retire debt and after we pay down 1 trillion in debt over the next 5 years and after we set aside 40 billion of additional funding for medicare over the next 5 years and after rebuilding our national defense and reprioritizing funding for elementary and secondary education after all of that there is still an unprecedented surplus projected as far as the eye can see when taxpayers are paying more money than it takes to fund all of that then it is obvious to me that taxes are just too high so the republican budget offers a modest but a meaningful measure of tax relief and tax fairness we need to lower taxes and restore to working americans some more of their freedom to decide how they want to spend their pwn money our colleagues with this amendment are offering a tiny little merely symbolic but not a real meaningful tax cut it is just not enough let us remember when the federal government takes peoples money away from them it is taking part of their freedom away this is money that the government takes from hardworking americans that they will never be free to spend for themselves as they see fit it is money that takes time to earn and that means time taken away that folks could spend doing other things like maybe spending more time with their children maybe caring for an elderly family member maybe volunteering in their community or just enjoying some leisure time at a time of already huge government spending record high federal taxes it is unconscionable at this point not to provide the american people with the opportunity to keep a little bit more of the money that they earn the republican budget strikes the right balance no more raiding of the social security surplus for the second consecutive year funding

columbine high school in colorado i spoke with my freshman colleague from the state of washington my colleague from washington is a trained psychologist so i asked him for his thoughts about the columbine tragedy since mr baird is a trained psychologist i was expecting a long academic explanation using lots of psychological terms regular people do not understand instead he had a simple solution an explanation he looked at me and said baron our schools are too big and these kids do not know one another the columbine tragedy and other recent events of violence in our schools have made all of us take a serious look at our children our schools and ourselves these recent tragedies have forced us to think about how we educat6 our children and how we can make our schools safer and better this is a personal issue for me for my wife betty is a middle school teacher and my youngest daughter is in the eighth grade at a public school in my hometown of seymour indiana i do not believe that there is one easy solution to all of the problems our schools and our children face today nor do i believe that we politicians in congress could pass some law that would solve every schools and every childs problem i strongly believe that the people who work with children every day the parents the teachers and local school administrators are in the best position to make decisions about their schools but this week i am introducing a bill that i hope will make some small contribution to addressing a problem that i and other people have been talking about for many years it is a problem that the recent episodes of school violence in colorado and georgia and other places around the country have once again brought to the forefront of our national debate it is the problem that my colleague dr baird was talking about our schools are too big and too impersonal too many of our children wake up every day aifd go to schools that make them feel disconnected and detached from their teachers their parents and their communities the goal of my bill that i am introducing the smaller schools stronger communities act is to make our schools smaller and to help parents teachers and administrators and students strengthen the sense of community that many of our schools today are lacking my strong feelings about this issue come from my own experience growing up in southern indiana when i was growing up in jackson county there were more high schools than there are today in towns like tampico and clear spring and cortland there were high schools that local kids attended and local families supported these communities were proud of their schools their schools brought people together and helped keep their towns strong and vital places to live these schools were the hearts of the communities and when we consolidated when school consolidation forced their high schools to close it tore the heart out of these communities these high schools along with thousands of other smaller schools around america were closed because for many years educators have followed the rule that bigger schools are better for a long time we all assumed that bigger schools were better because they could offer students more courses more extracurricular activities and could save school districts money the statistics on school size show how dramatically this biggerisbetter approach has changed the way we educate our children in 1930 there were 262 000 elementary middle and high schools in america today there are only 88 000 schools in 1930 the average school had 100 students todays average school has 500 students some education experts are now arguing that school consolidation has gone too far more and more educators today believe that our children do better academically and socially in smaller schools that are closer to their homes and their parents than in the big schools with thousands of students because many schools have become too big they sometimes harm the students they are supposed to be helping many students in big schools never develop any meaningful relationships with their teachers and never experienced a sense of belonging in their schools when i start looking at the issue of big schools i was surprised to find that some of the biggest critics of big schools are high school principals the men and women who run our high schools who work with our teenagers every day say that schools are too big and too impersonal in 1966 the national association of secondary school principals released a report criticizing the bigness of todays high schools the principals recommended that the high school of the 21st century be much more student centered and personalized here is what the high school principals said students take more interest in school when they experience a sense of belonging some students cope in large impersonal high schools because they have the advantage of external motivation that allows them to transcend the disadvantage of school size many others however would benefit from a more intimate setting in which their presence could be more readily and repeatedly acknowledged experts have found that achievement levels in smaller schools are higher especially among children from disadvantaged backgrounds who need extra help to succeed a recent study of academic achievement and school size concluded that high schools and smaller schools perform better in course subjects of reading math history and science students in smaller schools also have better attendance records are less likely to get in fights or join gangs a principal of a successful small high school recently wrote that small schools offer what metal detectors and guards cannot the safety and security of being where you are well known by the people who care for you the most the bill that i am introducing the smaller school strong stronger communities act provides grants to school districts that want to develop school size reduction strategy this bill does not introduce a new mandate or try to micromanage local education authority it simply supports education leaders in school districts who decide they want to implement a plan to reduce the size of their school units either through new building space or through schools within schools i hope this bill will encourage local school districts to take a look at this idea and perhaps think about ways they can make their schools smaller and to find ways to help students feel connected again to their schools and their communities and their parents this bill and the academic research i have been discussing here today make a very simple point about our schools our kids and ourselves our lives are better when we feel connected to the people we live and work with"],

what the jacksonvanik waiver does and what it does not do by law the underlying issue here is about immigration based on vietnams record of progress on immigration and its continued cooperation on unitedstates refugee programs over the past year renewal of the jacksonvanik waiver will continue to promote freedom of immigration disapproval would undoubtedly result in the opposite the jacksonvanik waiver also symbolizes our interest in further developing relations with vietnam having lifted the trade embargo and established diplomatic relations 5 years ago the united states has tried to work with vietnam to normalize incrementally our bilateral political economic and consular relationships this is in americas own shortterm and longterm national interests it builds on vietnams own policy of political and economic reintegration into the world this will be a lengthy and challenging process however now is not the time to reverse course on vietnam vietnam continues to cooperate fully with our priority efforts to achieve the fullest possible accounting of american powmias the jacksonvanik waiver supports this process the jacksonvanik waiver certainly does not constitute an endorsement of the communist regime in hanoi we cannot approve of a regime that places restrictions on basic freedoms including the right to organize political parties freedom of speech and freedom of religion on may 4 however this body passed a resolution condemning just such violations of human rights the jacksonvanik waiver does not provide vietnam with new trade benefits including normal trade relations ntr status with the jacksonvanik waiver the united states has been able to successfully negotiate and sign a new bilateral commercial trades agreement with vietnam congress will have an opportunity in the future whether to approve it or not and whether to grant ntr or not but that is a separate process the renewal of the jacksonvanik waiver only keeps this process going nothing more renewal of the jacksonvanik waiver does not antomatically make american exports to vietnam eligible for possible coverage by unitedstates trade financing programs the waiver only allows american exports to vietnam to be eligible for such coverage the war with vietnam is over and we have embarked upon a new although cautious expanded relationship with vietnam now is not the time to reverse this constructive course accordingly this member urges a no vote on the resolution having summarized the key reasons to oppose the resolution this member would like to expand on a few of these points first the issue of emigration which indeed is what the jacksonvanik provision is all about since march of 1998 the united states has granted vietnam a waiver of the jacksonvanik emigration provisions of the trade act of 1974 as this is only an annual waiver the president decided on june 2 2000 the renew this extension because he determined that doing so would substantially promote greater freedom of emigration from that country in the future this determination was based on vietnams record of progress on emigration and on vietnams continued cooperation on unitedstates refugee programs over the past year as a result we are approaching the completion of many refugee admissions categories under the orderiy departure program odp including the resettlement opportunity for vietnamese returnees former reeducation camp detainees mccain amendment subprograms and montagnards the vietnamese government has also agreed to help implement our decision to resume the odp program for former unitedstates government employees which was suspended in 1996 the renewal of the jacksonvanik waiver is an acknowledgment of that progress disapproval of the waiver would undoubtedly result in vietnams immediate cessation of cooperation second the jacksonvanik waiver also symbolizes our interest in further developing relations with vietnam having lifted the trade embargo and established diplomatic relations five years ago the united states has tried to work with vietnam to normalize incrementally our bilateral political economic and consular relationship this policy is in americas own short and longterm national interest it builds on vietnams o n policy of political and economic reintegration into the world in the judgment of this member this will be a lengthy and challenging process however he suggests that now is not the time to reverse course on vietnam third over the past five years vietnam has increasingly cooperated on a wide range of issues the most important of these is the progress and cooperation in obtaining the fullest possible accounting of americans missing from the vietnam war those members who attended the briefing by the distinguished ambassador to vietnam a former prisoner of war and former member of this body the honorable pete peterson learned of the significant efforts to which vietnam is now extending to address our concerns regarding the pow mia issue including their participation in remains recovery efforts which are physically very dangerous fourth the jacksonvanik waiver does not constitute an endorsement of the communist regime in hanoi we cannot approve of a regime that places restrictions on basic freedoms including the right to organize political parties freedom of speech and freedom of religion however our experience has been that isolation and disengagement does not promote progress on human rights new sanctions including the symbolic disapproval of the jacksonvanik waiver only strengthens the position of the communist hardliners at the expense of those in vietnams leadership who are inclined to support more openness engagement with vietnam has resulted in some improvements in vietnams human rights practices though we still remain disappointed at the very limited pace and scope of such reforms as this member mentioned on may 4 2000 this body adopted a resolution condemning vietnams human rights record given the strong reaction to our resolution by hanoi it is evident that our actions and concems did not go unnoticed fifth the jacksonvanik waiver does not provide vietnam with any new trade benefits including normal trade relations ntr status however with the jacksonvanik waiver the united states has been able to successfully negotiate a new bilateral commercial trade agreement with vietnam this agreement was signed two weeks ago in washington in the opinion of this member this agreement is in our own short and long term national interest vietnam remains a very difficult place for american firms to do business vietnam needs to undertake additional fundamental economic reforms this new bilateral trade agreement will require vietnam to make these reforms and will result in increased american exports supporting jobs here at home in a separate process with a separate vote congress will have to decide whether to approve or reject this new trade agreement and to grant ntr status to vietnam given that the agreement has yet to even be transmitted to congress and there are only a limited number of legislative days before the bodys scheduled adjoumment this member believes that these decisions will not be made until the 107th congress meets next year thus the jacksonvanik waiver simply ensures that the modest trade opportunities currently available to american businesses will continue until congress considers the agreement sixth contrary to the claims of some opponents of the jacksonvanik waiver renewal of the jacksonvanik waiver does not automatically make american investment in and exports to vietnam eligible for coverage by unitedstates trade financing programs such as those administered by the overseas private investment corporation the exportimport bank and the unitedstates department of agriculture the waiver only allows american exports and investments to be eligible for such coverage each must still face separate individual reviews against each programs relevant criteria americans must conclusively recognize that the war with vietnam is over with the restoration of diplomatic relations in 1995 the united states and vietnam embarked on a new relationship for the future it will not be an easy or quick process vietnam today remains a communist country with very limited freedoms for its citizens significant reforms must occur before relations can be truly normal the emotional scars of the vietnam war remain with many americans in the mid1960s this member was an infantry officer and intelligence officer with the first infantry division within a month of completing my service members of my tightknit detachment of that division were in vietnam and taking casualties the first night after arrival like other vietnamera veterans this member has emotional baggage a great many americans have emotional baggage about vietnam but this member would suggest that it is time to get on with our bilateral relationship and not reverse course on vietnam passing this resolution of disapproval of the jacksonvanik waiver would represent yet another reflection of animosities of the past at a time when vietnam is finally looking ahead and making changes towards its integration into the international community a retrenchment on our part by this disapproval resolution is not in americas short and long term national interests

transportation infrastructure programs and is spending mandated under tea21 and air21 funding for airport constructionis up 64 percent or 1 3 billion over last year funding for highways and transit is up 2 6 billion or 8 percent over last year nearly threefourths of the outlays in this bill are now guaranteed as a result the appropriations committee had no choice but to provide these funds these tea21 and air21 mandates have made it more difficult to allocate resources in a balanced fashion among competing aviation coast guard highway rail and transit needs this year as a result of the air21 and tea21 guarantees the transportation subcommittee needed a generous 302 b allocation in order to avoid squeezing the coast guard and to protect vital air traffic control and safety operations we were able to address these operating needs but only at the expense of other subcommittees whose 302 b allocations were not as generous this bill also provides amtrak with its full capital appropriation of 521 millionan amount that is 70 million below last year but essential if amtrak is to remain on a path toward operational self sufficiency by 2003 the bill does not include a number of legislative authorizations that were requested by the administration that proposed to divert excess gas tax revenue or revenue aligned budget authorityto a variety of other purposes thus the bill does not include the 468 million requested for new infrastructure investments in high speed rail corridors across the county as many members are aware there is tremendous interest among the governors in expanding amtrak high speed rail serviceminnesota wisconsin illinois michigan and others have formed the midwest regional rail coalition and there are other high speed rail corridors in california new york in the southeast and in other parts of the county to try to address the great interest in this area the bill includes provisions to provide greater flexibility for governors at their option to use cmaq and surface transportation program funding to help finance these rail projects we believed this would be a small but important step forward this year the committee received a tremendous number of requests from members to help with grade crossing removal projects to help address this need the bill includes provisions eliminating the state and local matching requirements so that states can more quickly use the 142 million in outstanding federal funds available but unspent for this purpose i would urge your support for these provisions finally i want to mention my concerns about one aspect of the bill dealing with funding for the large transit projects we call new starts this year the committee received more than 2 7 billion in funding requests for discretionary section 5309 new starts projects even though the program is funded at an historical high of 1 058 billion the amount available to fund new starts projects is a fraction of the current demand and this problem will only grow worse in coming years the new starts pipeline is huge and growing the federal transit administration has already committed the federal government to multiyear section 5309 funding of 2 9 billion over the remaining life of tea21 for 16 transit systems and the costs for another 47 projects in the pipeline will reach a staggering 25 billion still more projects are in the planning stage the allowable federal share of these projects under tea21 is 80 percentclearly more than we can afford in the near future in fact the presidents proposals for this fiscal year if the committee had adopted them would have completely exhausted all available discretionary federal support for new transit systems through 2003 that is why i have advocated that we should move toward requiring communities to foot at least 50 percent of the bill for these projects rather than the minimum 20 percent local share required under tea21 i acknowledge that this is not a popular point of view but i believe that it will become necessary to fairly provide federal assistance to new start projects across the country if we dont move in this direction many communities with worthy transit projects simply will be left out in the cold this bill does not include a 50 percent cost share requirement but far from serving as a disincentive to build transit as some have suggested i believe that sending a clear message that more robust local and state financial participation is expected will help to address the new starts funding logjamand more fairly distribute new starts assistance to communities in need in

words equal access under the law equal justice for all the compassionate nation providing legal resources to obtain these things for the poor and the itinerate in this population these are great principles they are honorable principles they are principles we all embrace and principles we are willing to support these are principles that we have entrusted to the legal services corporation we have said this is an important job it is a job where you are trusted to reflect the heart the compassion the commitment of the american people do it right be of service make us proud the legal services corporation has failed in this duty they have failed in such a way as to inflate the statistical data for the purpose of getting more of that money that might be otherwise used in february of 1999 john mckay the president of legal services corporation said and i quote case statistics play an essential role in budget requests and the performance plan submitted by the legal services corporation to congress each year he went on to say therefore the reliability of case statistics therefore the reliability of case statisticsreliability that it be true and accurate that is what reliability means here true and accurate reporting of real cases really handled that reflect our compassion and our commitment to equal justice under the law for all americans the reliability of case statistics submitted by programs to lsc is vital to obtaining continued federal funding for legal services this type of information holds great promise for securing increased federal funding i could not agree more give us great reliability and we will fulfill great promise for increased funding but what did we find out the inspector general of legal services corporation and the general accounting office audited 11 grantees what did they find out these 11 grantees reported 370 000 cases handled the ig and the gao invalidated either because the case was not handled it was merely a phone call and a referral or that the case was in fact a case taken on by legal services for somebody with means not intended to be covered by this service under the law or that the case was counted more than one time 175 000 invalid cases that is not the judgment of the gentleman from texas that is the general accounting office the accountability test the committee quite rightly saw this took mr john mckay at his word and engaged in a further endorsement not only of what this agency is supposed to do but the standard by which they should demonstrate their achievement as reported by the agency themselves and cut their budget back to their actual caseload a fair thing to do a necessary thing to do accountability is not a passing fancy my colleagues in the government of the united states we are given a trust to create agencies of compassion and service and then to hold them accountable to the fulfillment of that promise and the law by which we created agencies that fail in their duty should not be rewarded yes indeed if our favorite charity was not in fact doing the things for which we voluntarily give our money we would cut back and we as members of congress given the trust to represent the compassion of the american people must do the same for a federal governmentagency that does not fulfill its promise that is what is going on here do not reward them for giving us data that is not reliable for inflating the caseloads now one final observation if we are going to in fact restore money to legal services corporation by this amendment in order to let them continue to operate in such a fashion as to report so many more cases than they actually do where does this amendment suggest we take the money from all funds to run the seized asset program vital to the battle against drug traffickers twenty million from the fbis investigative expenses 44 million from ins border enforcement 44 million from violent crime initiative 32 million from federal prisons and 10 million from operations of the federal court this is a serious moment in oversight accountability and service are we in congress going to take money from these agencies with these precious necessary duties so important to the safety and security of our citizens and say no we will take that fund away from them and give it to an agency that has been proven to squander their money and report falsely for me to falsely represent my misdeeds is unacceptable but for me to exaggerate and falsely report my virtue in the quest for the taxpayers dollar is wholly unacceptable and frankly undignified let us vote for the dignity the service and the compassion of the american people through its government and vote down this amendment"], [0.003235161304473877, 0.5032351613044739, 1, "i thank the ranking member very much for yielding time to me and again let me thank him for his leadership during a process of which we have as members of the committee on the judiciary and this congress and this nation lived with for many days and many months this morning i had the privilege of listening to the new speaker of the house and he asked that we get down to the peoples business so i rise to oppose the appointment of managers because i believe that i want to ask or answer the question affirmatively to the american people who have asked me repeatedly as i have traveled about this nation when will we this congress listen to the will of the american people and what i want to say to the american people is that you have not only good sense but good judgment for the constitution of the united states does not prohibit does not prohibit the censuring of the president of the united states it does not provide for but it does not prohibit but yet on this floor this lame duck congress forbade some 200plus members of this house as well the american people to have fully debated a censure resolution that would heal this nation i recollect what the constitutional framers had in mind when they offered the provision that said treason bribery and other high crimes and misdemeanors would be the grounds for impeachment what they meant was what george mason stated so eloquently these are offenses that would undermine the constitution and destroy the government what we have here are private indiscretions we have the politics of undermining of the individual yes we recognize the wrongness of the acts of the president we recognize that they are unacceptable but we also understand that if this country is to survive if we are not to lower the bar of impeachment for the year 2020 or 2030 if we are not to accuse someone who is president because of your religious beliefs or because you are divorced you want to impeach if we are not to give credence to the partisanship of this impeachment we must now vote against the appointment of these managers i would simply say i speak really to the new members who have come i speak in all humility and respect for each of you who have been elected to this great body you now hate a very historic opportunity to stop these divisive and unfair and partisan accusations on the grounds that this president should be impeached because there is no substance to it you can now vote to censure this president and heal this nation a legitimate constitutionally founded censure resolution that would not in fact let the president go free it would indicate that he had done wrong i ask that we heal this nation vote against the appointment of the managers and do what is right for the nation"], [0.0035913586616516113, 0.5035913586616516, 0, "on behalf of the gentleman from pennsylvania and the committee on transportation and infrastructure i raise a point of order against section 3602 of the bill on page 58 lines 9 through 17 on the grounds that it constitutes legislation on an appropriations bill in violation of clause 2 of rule xxi of the rules of the house of representatives section 3602 of the bill provides that the executive draft on federal transportation in the national capital region has been submitted to the office of management and budget and shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this bill the section further provides that within 60 days of enactment the secretary of transportation shall transmit to congress a report on implementation of the executive draft this provision would enact into law a policy that congress has not reviewed a policy in fact that is still in the process of being written by the administration although the latest version of the draft executive order referenced in section 3602 has not been made available we understand that it sets forth a variety of requirements for federal agencies in the national capital region in an effort to reduce the number of employees who drive alone to work we understand that the draft executive order would require federal agencies to develop and implement transportation management plans designed to reduce vehicle miles traveled by federal employees and various other requirements in addition the draft executive order would apparently require all agencies in the national capital region to provide maximum taxfree transit benefits to all employees this transit benefit alone is estimated to cost 60 million to 80 million each year for this region and would ultimately be extended to other regions across the country and be even more costly the cost of complete implementation of the policies set forth in the draft executive order may be far greater while some of these requirements may have merit they are nevertheless significant policy changes not only have no congressional hearings been held on the draft executive order its contents have not even been made known to congress costly and significant policy changes such as these should be subjected to the normal congressional authorization and review process not approved sight unseen clause 2 of rule xxi of the rules of the house of representatives prohibits the reporting of a provision changing existing law in a general appropriations bill including a supplemental appropriations bill such as we are dealing with here tonight in other words this rule prohibits legislation on an appropriations bill for the reasons stated previously section 3602 of this bill on page 58 lines 9 through 17 constitutes legislation on an appropriations bill in violation of clause 2 of rule xxi
