folks about they decided well we dont care what they want we want the carbon emissions so they starting in december i believe of last year they started issuing new regulations about carbon emissions and then they started passing them on through the clean air act to the various states now im telling you this because its going to have a direct effect on your life every member of congress here and every person that might be watching this discussion someplace else will see that when you start talking about what is maybe happening in texas you have to realize that as you watch the price of gasoline go up at your pump you have to realize that there can be a direct relationship between whats going on in the market and what happens to the prices for the american consumer heres what has happened in texas when they created the clean air act they gave the epa the ability to promulgate rules and standards for air quality but the act specifically says that the local authority and the states have a better means of policing up this act than the federal government so the implementation of the rules of the standards set by epa will be done by the states rather than the federal government and each state is to come up with a plan and that bill was passed i believe in 1974 or 1976 something like that anyway it was in the 1970s and it had nothing to do with carbon it had to do with noxious gasses and other really bad things that were getting into our air and reducing the air quality and the standards were important and each state had the ability to structure their permitting system to fit the needs of their state and then submit that permitting system to the epa for approval and the epa would say yeah i think thats a good system or no we dont think it is a good system one of the things that happened when they put together this clean air act and set these emission standards was what they call a grandfather clause and companies that were already in existence long before the time of the passing of this act were grandfathered out of the act so basically some of these big refineries electricity power plants manufacturing facilities automobile plants had been around long enough that they would be grandfathered in some certain areas on these emission standards and the requirement for permitting under the law that was just the way this act was written so texas had a lot oftexas is the largest energy producing and energy manufacturing state in the united states and has the largest refinery capacity in the united states i used to be able to name the refineries in texas but im afraid id fall way short today but needless to say there are a multitude of refineries and chemical manufacturing facilities just in the houston area alone and in corpus christ and in other parts of our state both great gigantic refineries and midsize and small refineries and manufacturing facilities and theyre all dealing with basically the petrochemical industry the oil and gas industry is the base product that they are refining manufacturing things from and so forth so in texas looking at what it would take not only to clean up the industries that would fall under the act which would be the newly permitted industries but also would start to police up the grandfatheredthe folks that could get out under a grandfather clausepolice up those facilities too the people in texas got together and they came up with a concept called flex permitting and heres the way it works lets just take a refinery baytown has a gigantic refinery that i have visited they passed a rule that says theres lots of sources of emissions from some form or fashion inside of a refinerycomes from a little thing the size of a faucet to great big smoke stacks can be emitting something into the air so what we want them to do is take that site and reduce their emissions down to the standard that is required by epa and so were going to let them so long as their site reduces emissions and meets the goals set up by the clean air actnot every individual place that emits will have to have a permit but just one permit to cover the whole site and then as the site reduces its emissions it all falls under one permit and its called a flex permit so it allows the refinery to go in fix this first and then fix this second and this third and this fourth and find the big bad ones first and fix those and then work down to fix the plant and by the way there is a recent letter from the epa saying that texas has met and exceeded the standards under this flex permitting but then along comes greenhouse gasses and they passed the rule about carbon emissions and they say now you have to put that under your permitting systems and the other 13 states plus texas were kind of taken aback by this but texas said no way we dont think you should be imposing carbon emission standards on us when the congress refused to impose these standards and they as i understand it started contesting this in the court so heres where the rub comes in the epa then announces to texas we dont approve your flexible permitting system and every industry in your state is now out of compliance and you are going to have to have a new permitting system and were taking over how thats going to workeven though the act says texas or any state shall be people who administer there now you may say well thats not too bad theres a kicker here texas created this permitting system in 1994 and since that time they have been asking epa to tell them yes or no do you approve it or you dont approve it and tentatively they sort of said well well approve it but were going to study it and look at it fifteen years this flexible permitting system has been in place and now as the dispute over carbon emissions comes along to batter texas into compliance they have depermitted the whole state theyve announced they depermitted the whole state now the state went to court and at least got a stay on that temporarily but think about that if you had something that you were doing that the government said now well have to approve that to do it and you say fine heres what were doing would you please approve it or disapprove it and they waited 15 years to do it and then when they announced theyre disapproving it they say oh by the way we plan to go back and fine you for the last 15 years for carbon emissionsthats what i understand its going to besomething is wrong with this picture im joined by my good friend and fellow judge louie gohmert from texas and id like to hear his take on this and if i got anything wrong he can tell me about it"], [3.337860107421875e-06, 0.4999966621398926, 1, "some have argued that the firsttofile provision in this bill violates the constitutional provision giving congress the power to promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times for authors and inventors the exclusive rights to their respective writings and discoveries the first key point to note is that the text does not define inventor under h r 1249 one still has to be an inventor to be awarded the patent as the constitution requires indeed former bush administration attorney general michael mukasey noted in a may 2011 letter to patent office director david kappos that the second inventor is no less an inventor for having invented second and former attorney general mukasey correctly points out that the constitution grants congress the power to promote the progress of the science and useful arts but does not say how it can or should do so congress deciding that awarding patents to inventors who are the firsttofile is consistent with that constitutional power the patent act of 1793 makes no mention of needing to be the firsttoinvent a patent was valid as long as the invention was not an invention already in the public domain or derived from another person it was not until 1870 that there was a specific process put in place to even determine who the firsttoinvent was the

about the regulations from the executive in need of scrutiny or the reins act this bill which i have cosponsored restores accountability to the regulatory process by requiring an upordown vote in congress and the presidents signature on any new major rule before it is enforced on the american people overregulation is devastating our economy and hindering job growth of the current administrations new regulations 200 are expected to cost more than 100 million each seven of those new regulations however will cost the economy more than 1 billion each at the current pace the current regulatory burden for 2011 alone will exceed 105 billion and the federal government has created more than 81 9 million hours worth of paperwork this year alone costing employers 80 billion just in compliance its no wonder a recent gallup poll found small business owners citing complying with government regulations as the most important problem they face nebraskans have not been immune to the reams of red tape being handed down by federal regulators just yesterday it was reported the city of grand island nebraska population 51 000 will be saddled with a 3 2 million compliance cost due to a new federal emissions regulation this epa crossstate air pollution rule was finalized june 1 and will be enforced but this is only one example there are additional even more costly rules and unworkable timelines coming down the pike all of which mean a much longer winter for americans struggling with high energy costs but it doesnt stop there recently the department of labor proposed a misguided rule which would restrict youth involvement in agriculture work yes anything from milking cows and feeding calves to hauling and detassling corn would come under fire under the departments current rule everyone agrees the safety of these young people and workers everywhere is of the utmost importance but by allowing such heavyhanded thoughtless regulation were greatly restricting opportunities for rural youth these jobs often seasonal teach young people responsibility and the value of hard work and theyre able to earn a little spending money in the process im also a proud cosponsor of the farm dust regulation prevention act of 2011 h r 1633 which the house is slated to consider later this week this bill would prevent the epa from regulating farm dust or the type of dust which naturally occurs in rural areas farmers and ranchers already are subject to strict federal and state regulations to control dust it makes no sense for the epa to impose costlier requirements on top of the existing standards while the epa has backed off without legislative action nothing certainly prohibits the agency from regulating farm dust in the future during a time of economic hardship keeping the door open for additional regulatory overreach is not the answer actually im often reminded of a meeting i had in southeastern nebraska with representatives from a federal agency good people they are one of them said it had been more than 20 years since hed ridden on a gravel road for me this meeting certainly emphasized the disconnect between washington and rural america these are only a few examples of the regulatory burden and uncertainty facing nebraskans who recognize economic growth ultimately depends on job creators not regulators i encourage my

powerful message that makes a difference in terms of how people live in their communities large and small they were delivering a message that congress ought to deal meaningfully in a comprehensive fashion with the transportation legislation that has been stalled they were delivering a message of dont attack cycling embrace it as part of a comprehensive approach to transportation it is after all the most efficient form of urban transportation ever designed burning calories instead of fossil fuel doesnt just save you money and make you feel better its good for our communities its the cheapest fastest way to reduce congestion and air pollution a very simple illustration is you can park eight to 10 bicycles where one automobile resides its good for the economy over 6 billion a year is involved with the cycling industry employing over a million people they brought very specific examples a study from wisconsin 1 5 billion of economic impact and 13 200 jobs in an industry that too often does not get its attention in my community of portland oregon a mediumsized city its 100 million a year in our economy and well over 1 000 jobs cycling is also very good for our children and our families being able to walk or bike safely to school helps kids actually perform better parents are less stressed it could save some of the 6 5 billion trips a year of over 30 billion miles just shuttling kids back and forth to school people frankly were outraged that my republican friends had targeted in their transportation bill elimination of the safe routes to school program other than them i havent met anybody in america who is against this program that empowers our children and helps our families now is a golden opportunity as the transportation bill collapsed and were back at the drawing board to look at how we leverage that 8 billion that we have invested in federal money over the last 20 years that has touched every state and hundreds of communities now is the time to

republican colleagues have taken a stance against class without proposing any real solutions for longterm care access in america and i strongly oppose h r 1173 and consider it to be a blatant disregard of a growing crisis in this country republicans continue to propose repeal of various aspects of the affordable care act we heard my colleague from georgia today and how many other times how many on the other side have said well lets just repeal the affordable care act lets repeal pieces of the affordable care act but they never come up with any meaningful alternatives and the same is true today theyre talking about outright repeal of class without any meaningful suggestion of an alternative my message to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle is that we should mend the class act and not end it this country is already facing a longterm care crisis but the problem is only going to get worse as our population continues to age an estimated 15 million people are expected to need some sort of longterm care support by 2020 if we dont solve the need for affordable longterm care in this country soon we will also jeopardize our entitlement programs currently medicaid pays 50 percent of the cost of longterm services and that price tag is quickly rising every year the class program was designed to allow people to stay at home and prevent the cost of nursing home care that burdened medicaid now i want to correct one thing i know in the rules committee some of my colleagues talk about the administrations position on this bill the administration made it quite clear in a hearing that we had on this bill that theyre opposed to repeal of the class act they acknowledge that there are workable solutions under the class program but didnt feel that they have the legal
