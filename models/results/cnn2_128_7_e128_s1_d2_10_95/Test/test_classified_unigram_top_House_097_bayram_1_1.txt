economic importance to our nation representing over 30 billion a year in unitedstates imports with some 31 billion a year in regional exports this region has attracted some 13 billion in unitedstates direct investments and it should be noted that the caribbean region has become the main source of immigration to the united states both legal and illegal it is obvious that we do have a vital stake in this important region but unfortunately the caribbean basin has been suffering serious economic difficulties due to the escalating cost of imported energy and declining prices for their major exports such negative trends in the economic area only increase concern about the regions deeply rooted structural problems and increases pressures of inflation unemployment declining growth balance of payments and liquidity problems in response to these mounting pressures on the political economic and social fabric of the region president reagan has proposed the caribbean basin initiative the first

relentless growth of soviet military capabilities and i see no way to trade off between these twin dilemmas i know there is a strong temptation to think that we can shave a little out of defense without really cutting muscle in order to reduce the deficit or to redress the most severe impacts of budgetary cuts in other areas we all want to believe that because no one wants to be the bearer of bad news during an election year unfortunately we have gone to this particular well too often every year until last year we shaved a little out of defense not enough to hyrt we thought just the fatjust the waste fraud and abuse to borrow last years catch phrase but how we did it is instructive in the case of the army we did it by deferring a decade of modernization the end result is that todays army is equipped largely with the same weap ons systems with which it fought the vietnam warm60 tanks introduced in 1962 m113 armored personnel carriers in 1960 cobra helicopters in 1965 chaparral air defense missiles in 1969 and the hawk missiles in 1960 the army tried for a decade to field a new tank before congress canceled the xm803 program in 1971 because it supposedly cost too much now we hear the same kind of arguments about the m1 the army tried for a decade to field a followon to the cobra attack helicopter before congress killed the cheyenne program in 1973 because it supposedly cost too much now we hear the same kind of arguments about the ah64 the army has been trying for 20 years to develop and field the patriot air defense system to replace the hawk and nike hercules that were fielded before some of you in this chamber were even born and now we hear that it costs too much well maybe we were fiscally responsible in some of those past actions i do not know all i know is that wars in the final analysis are not won in the air or at sea they are won by troops on the ground and this will be particularly true if our enemy is a eurasian land power and today we have an army superbly equipped to refight the korean war but sorely pressed to contend with the modem army possessed by the sovet union i wish modern weapons systems did not cost as much as they do but if you think american systems are expensive i suggest you price out the new german leopard ii tank or the european tornado multirole combat aircraft the fact of the matter is that equipping a modern army is expensive for more than a decade we avoided facing up to this fact by canceling army modernization programs every time they became ready for procurement we can do that again if we feel comfortable with an obsolescent army in a volatile world but if we do notthen i submit that it is time for us to stop looking for a solution on the cheap it is time to stop taking cheap shots at

authority of the secretary of the treasury to make such loans while this legislation provides for the third extension of borrowing authority since the home rule act was passed it is essential to insure that the capital improvements program of the district will remain on track the district of columbia has had the authority to borrow funds from the federal treasury for many years including years prior to home rule it was the view of the congress that by providing the authority in the home rule act to issue taxexempt general obligation bonds the need for the district to continue borrowing from the federal treasury would be eliminated at the same time however congress realized that an abrupt interruption in the flow of funds from the treasury to the district could cause undue and unnecessary harm to the districts capital improvement program the home rule act thus eliminated the permanent borrowing authority and at the same time provided for 2year interim borrowing authority the interim borrowing authority was extended by the congress in 1977 and again in 1979 the wisdom which supported the need for enactment of the initial interim authority and the two previous extensions is still present without another extension many of the districts critical capital improvement programs will be derailed programs such as improving the water system metro and other major

provision that encourages greater management control of contracting out practice~s at our military bases and installations historically since about 1955 the executive branch has supported and even encouraged the agencies to use the private sector to the maximum extent possible in 1966 the office of management and budget omb issued guidelines to be used by the executive branch in determining whether a particular activity should be performed by a private contractor these guidelines are outlined in 0mb circular asimply stated the guidelines require that a cost comparison of the agencys cost versus contractors cost be made before a decision to contract out any commercial or industrial type functions examples of the types of commercial and industrial functions which have been contracted out a military bases are security guard services aircraft maintenance and refueling sei vices motor vehicle maintenance operation of ammunition depots custodial services selected commissary services and medical equipment maintenance services the committee continues to be increasingly concerned about the advisability of contracting out activities at our defense installations and the potential for adversely impacting readiness furthermore the committee received information that suggests there mayhave been cases where the department has used contract services to circumvent civilian personnel ceilings in order to insure that contracting out would have l minimum effect on readiness last year the congress placed additional management and reporting requirements on the department of defense as outlined in the fiscal year 1981 defense authorization act these requirements were intended to prevent the department from using contract services to circumvent civilian ceilings however as importantly the bill directs the secretary of defense to report to the congress any intention or decision to contract out commercial or industrial activities during testimony on the fiscal year 1982 defense authorization bill witnesses indicated that in some cases performance by the contractor has been less that acceptable when this occurs it adversely affects the ability of both the base and unit commander to accomplish their missions one of the military witnesses indicated that contracting out in some cases would effect unit readiness as an example if a contractor who is contracted to perform vehicle maintenance or aircraft maintenance fails to perform this clearly effects unit readiness it is clear that contracting out may have an adverse effect on unit readiness however i would

words this is the fifth full day that we have been engaged in this most extensive and comprehensive discussion and votes on the budget as i listened to the comments on the subject of salaries it raised basically this one issue and that is should we try to plan all of the financial affairs of this country through the budget procr s in other words what i wondered was how did all of this budget system get started for instance let us review this subject of comparable pay we talked about comparability of pay back home we discussd it at great length 2 weeks ago and i was interested to learn back in texas that people working in civilian jobs wanted comparability in pay like the washington area they told me the highest pay in america is in farifax county va and montgomery county md and they kept saying why can we not get pay in our area up to their washington level now comparability is a real problem but we cannot solve it here in congress with 435 viewpoints i went back and looked up the background on how congress got started in this budget business because i was one who voted for this budget process i had been in business all my life and i thought now this is a highly desirable thing to do to draw up a budget because we can do two things when we draw up the budget if the members will recall this was the budgetary inpoundment and control act of 1974 it passed 401 to 6 everylody in congress wanted to see it work for two big reasons the first one was that we would get our budget done very early every year we would know exactly where we were going the first thing that this law mandated was that by april 15 of every year congress would have completed the budget that was april 15 now we are out here knocking on the door of june and we have not yet passed or gone to conference the second thing is they said we would be able to effect tremendous savings in cutting spending because by doing all of this planning that we would be able to do we would be able to make its operation much more efficient we would be able to cut spending everywhere i looked back then to see where we were in 1974 when we started this budget process congress was spending 270 billion i think 269 8 billion or something like that to be exact 270 billion we were spending at that time now we are talking about 750 billion so obviously the budget process was a complete failure in cutting spending or in planning now last night we were here in session until 1 oclock our group has been working we have all worked hard chairman jones the distinguished leaders on our side including the gentleman from ohio and so many have worked worked worked we were here until 1 oclock last night we have stayed on we have deliberated but what is the fallacy of the budget system well it is very obvious you cannot accomplish anything through a large committee i knew that when i vas in business you know that when you are in the government and the bigger the committee not only causes confusion you have complete chaos we have 435 members trying to work out the complete financial plans of america i was thinking about our situation and compared it to a football team because i love football when they have football games usually the quarterback calls the plays sometimes the coach calls the plays but i tell you if you had 11 men trying to run that team at the same time it would be just like this congressional budget a 435person committee is a certain complete and total disaster what we need we need to go back to fundamentals we need to go back to our basic committee system we have a good ways and means committee and they should work on taxes we have an excellent appropriations committee when i heard the gentleman from mississippi the chairman say that he thought it might be a good idea to strike the enacting clause i thought that is the most logical statement i have heard when we talk about education it ought to be done by the education committee and when we talk about commerce and business it ought to be done by those committees but to have 435 people think they can talk continously and come out with anything other than utter confusion or financial bankruptcy for

think in closing what we ought to add quite frankly is why this proposal in the other body is before the congress tonight i think the answer is very simple the administration is now recognizing that as a consequence of policies which it has insisted that this congress adopt we are now facing deficits this yeari even if all of the presidents suggestions of september 30 were taken of approximately 73 billion if we follow the presidents program to a t that is 30 billion off from the presidents estimates last january i would suggest that most of the difference in those numbers has occurred simply because of the administrations fiscal policy which has resulted in incredibly high interest rates which have added greatly to the amount in the federal budget which we have to pay for interest and also has resulted in the now much higher unemployment figures which are projected those also cost us a great deal in terms of both additional expenditure for unemployment and welfare and fewer revenues because unemployed people do not pay taxes i think w e have this proposal here simply because the administration was looking at its own program admitting that its own program is now out of control not knowing where to go trying to appear that they are doing something and because they will not face up to the major obligation that we have to correct the economic package or the economic problems we have the administration is going after the minnows instead of the whales if the administration were looking at the major problem it would recognize for instance that the tax proposals which were adopted just last year were simply too expensive people who make more than 50 000 a year make up 1 out of every 20 persons in this society yet they will get back 1 out of every 3 in that

or more will add 160 billion to the national debt over the next 5 years if we want to deal with the major problem that we have to face in balancing the budget that is the number we ought to deal with
