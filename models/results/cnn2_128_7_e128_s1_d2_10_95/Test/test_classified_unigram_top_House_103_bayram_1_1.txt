much worse the federal debt is so bad that 1 out of every 5 that the american taxpayer sends to washington goes for nothing but interest payments on a national debt and now the democrats in this congress are going to increase the national debt under this bill things will only get worse it is an insult to the american people because the democrats in this house are raiding the social security

years as they endlessly adjudicated and appealed their cases access to this preferential process would have cost them had title xii not been dropped a mere 600 what this section would also have done is to undermine both the quota system that has been in place for decades and the process in which the state department screens visa applicants that responsibility for all practical purposes would have been shifted to the ins the ins simply doesnt have the ability to determine if the person already in the united states is a terrorist a felon or otherwise excludable and the 600 fee would not allow a proper investigation of these illegal immigrants i am convinced that these provisions would have seriously undermined our efforts to control illegal immigration and would have been completely unfair

or cotne illegally and get a visa for 600 i remind my colleagues that we have overwhelming problems with the costs of millions of new illegal aliens annually unitedstates embassies now receive between 7 and 8 million visa applications each year most of these are tourist visas that are routinely investigated and approved inclusion in this bill of title xii amendments would have doubled or tripled

should not be handled in such a belowtheboard fashion the process is wrong and i say also the substance is wrong how can we say that the vietnamese are cooperating with us about powmia efforts when they have not released the records of the prisons in which our returned pows were held let me make this clear our colleague the gentleman from florida who was held in vietnam in prison for 7 long years just spoke the records for the prison in which he was held have not been made available to us by the vietnamese government they are not cooperating as long as they do not release those records as far as we know those records will tell us what we need to know about our mias and pows that may have been left behind how can we condone lifting the embargo when they do not give us those kind of records and that kind of cooperation and they do not even permit us to go where we need to go in vietnam to investigate a few month ago we heard testimony from general needham the pentagons point man on this issue and he confirmed that there are a number of areas his investigators cannot go in vietnam that is after the embargo has been lifted one of the conditions of lifting the embargo was cooperation with the vietnamese in our search for powmias the embargo is reversible and if anything right now because they have not permitted us to go into areas and have not released these documents we should be talking about reimposing the embargo rather than commending hanoi for its cooperation yesterday i met with americans who were thrown out of vietnam because they wanted to visit a prison just north of hanoi let us get that yesterday i met with americans who wanted to go someplace in vietnam to investigate powmias and they were not permitted to go to those areas would that be called

thank my distinguished colleague from kansas our fearless leader on the commit tee on agriculture tonights debate for me is really the whole reason why i ran for congress the whole reason i got into this crazy business in the first place is because i recognized what the deficit and the national debt was doing to our kids and maybe selfishly doing to my kids in fact when my son mark was born there was a bill in his crib because of the deficit and debt in thiscountry of 15 000 you might think well jny son is what paying more than his fair share no every person in this country has that kind of bill sitting at their table right now to pay as a result of our problems so what do we do what do we do we hear about cutting we hear about fair share well fair share has definitely been provided by farmers in fact over the past decade as my colleague for kansas indicated farmers have contributed 57 billion to deficit reduction 57 billion are we complaining no maybe a little bit only because we feel that maybe some other sectors have not contributed as much but we will take that and we will even up the ante farmers have told me we will contribute more in deficit reduction through more spending cuts so the committee on agriculture this year was asked to make a few cuts we did we cut 12 9 billion out of farm progranis for farmers in the committee on agriculture we went along with it only because we knew we had to provide our fair share but only until we found out what that savings was going for you know what it was going for the same thing farmers across the country complain about all the time the fact that we use farm program reductions for food stamp increases increases 7 3 billion was increased in this agriculture budget because 6f the effect of get this the btu tax you might ask what is going on here the clinton administration believes that because of the effects of the btu tax that they are going to have to increase food stamps 7 9 billion just to make up the difference the committee on agriculture cannot stand for that republicans stand firm on the fact that those cuts should not go if we are going to cut in agriculture programs it needs to go to deficit reduction and not toward food stamp programs when there has been no reform of the program no revitalization no streamlining no efficiencies that is promised down the line just like everything else has been promised in this country but nothing was done today the btu tax is supposed to bring in 70 billion over the next 5 years but in order to offset that we have increased welfare programs 40 billion because we expect because of the btu tax more and more people to be dependent on welfare forced into that dependency we heard just a moment ago the majority leader indicate that arent we special we are increasing the earned income tax credit why somebody needs to ask him that because the btu tax is driving people into poverty the farmer must take the risk the farmer must grow the food the farmer must transport the food then he has got to finance the food then he has got to market the food then he has to sell the food and now we are telling farmers stand in line in order to earn food stamps so you can buy back your food and that is ridiculous in this kind of economy what are we telling the young farmers out there we are telling them dont come back to the farm dont come back to the farm we dont need you we dont need you just make farmers get bigger get bigger spend more money that is what we are encouraging them to do none of those young farmers that iowa has lost or any other district in this country are going to come running back to the farm in order to grow food under this kind of a plan that is ridiculous that is not economic growth and revitalization clinton talked about patriots in his state of the union address he talked about all americans being patriots farmers are patriots they are not patsies and we cannot stand for a btu tax that is offset by welfare programs to drive farmers into welfare so that they can in fact be eligible for those same programs in a recent tax foundation study that just came out today iowa alone because of the effect of the btu tax according to this independent foundation is going to lose 4 779 jobs that is economic growth folks in fact my district alone if this btu tax passes is going to lose 890 jobs in just my district is that economic growth ask yourself who of you out there is willing to give up your job for this btu tax there are a lot of congressmen i think who are probably going to lose their job over this let me tell you this about the state of the union address the state of the union address for me was exciting because i felt as a newcomer to congress that we had a president that was willing to stand up to the plate and deal with the budget deficit you know what happened when he went out to sell this plan to people not the republicans but the people they said cut spending first what did he do he abandoned his sales pitch now what happens we have democrats by the droves running to the floor of the house to save the presidents plan when he himself is not selling when he himself is not out advertising when he himself is letting democrats fall on the sword people ask me gridlock in congress jim how do you get around gridlock in congress folks gridlock is over gridlock is over on this side we cannot stand in the way of their plan how many do they have they have more than 218 dont they if they dont maybe the gridlock is on their side of the aisle and maybe they have to face up to that fact not on the republican side of course we are not going to vote for it are you crazy we are not going to drive people out of work but if you want to you provide the votes you pass the presidents plan he is not calling republicans he has not called me he has not asked me to support the plan he has not asked me how it affects farmers in iowa they say be specific we have got kasich we even have two amendments that we are willing to introduce this week if they will let us will they let us have an open rule people out there watching they say what is an open rule that doesnt make any sense that is procedural an open rule means we get to debate this we get to offer our amendments and we get to offer our specifics we will see if they let us put your money where your mouth is so to speak i think what we have to do is face up to the reality of what this plan is really going to mean i think it is probably put best in the words of president clintons barber president clintons barber probably would say clinton is hair today and gone tomorrow what is most disturbing about the past 4 months is that the way of doing business in the house of representatives has not changed my constituents tell me they are willing to sacrifice to reduce the federal budget deficit they have said repeatedly they are willing to step up to the plate and take their fair share of the hits to fight the red ink spending in washington but thars not what has happened first rural america took its share of hits when agricultural programs were cut 2 9 billion but the hits didnt end there they were also informed that in addition to 2 9 billion in cuts for agriculture they would get hit with a btu tax that will cost farmers between 1 000 and 4 000 per year and they will get hit again with a barge tax that is expected to increase the cost of each bushel of corn between 5 and 10 cents but the hits dont just end there either the money resulting from the cuts in farm programs and increased taxes will not go to the 4 trillion debt hanging over our heads instead congress has decided that any savings resulting from farm program cuts and tax increases will go to fund new federal programs after the house of representatives votes on the budget reconciliation package this week and the dust settles it is rural america that will carry the burden of increased taxes rural america no doubt

nations child nutrition programs the federal child nutrition programs are authorized by the education and labor committee of which i am the ranking republican member as a former educator i am well aware of the link between proper nutrition and a childs ability to achieve in school for this reason i am very pleased that the conference agreement provides 4 1 billion for the school lunch program and over 1 billion for the school breakfast program these two programs provide many of our nations poor children with the only nutritious meals they receive each day they do therefore play a major role in education reform and in our ability to raise the educational achievement of our nations children ukewise the summer food program provides meals to children in lowincome areas during the summer months when the school lunch and breakfast programs are not available to meet their nutritional needs in this way we prevent any nutritionalrelated health problems which could impact on their ability to do well in the next school year of course one of the most important nutrition programs is wic the special supplemental food program for women infants and children i am pleased to note that the conference agreement contains an increase which allows for growth in this successful program wic also plays a major role in the ability of children to do well in school when mothers receive appropriate prenatal health care and nutrition there is a reduced likelihood that they will give birth to children with low birth weight and related disabilities wic then pro vides supplements to mothers aftertheir children are born to insure that their nutritional needs are met during their first few years of life thus assuring they come to school ready to learn finally i would like to thank

outlet through which our nations farmers can sell their fresh produce as we attempt to improve the eating habits of our nations families to assist them in meeting the dietary guidelines it is important that we increase consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables among wic participants the farmers market coupon program has been successful in accomplishing this goal since many of the wig

emotions i do that because this amendment and this bill represents the first time in 13 years on the education and labor committee that bill goodling and i have disagreed and very frankly bill goodling is one of my best personal friends in the congress he is without question my leader on education issues and i do not take any joy in rising in opposition to a goodling amendment and i want him to know that and frankly i want all of my colleagues to know that publicly as well but i rise because bill goodling more than anybody in this house of representatives would want me and you and everyone else to be true to your convictions and bill goodling and i see national service in just very different ways if members believe that national service legislation is student financial aid they should vote for the goodling amendment and i mean that sincerely if on the other hand they see national service as not paid volunteerism nor student financial aid but rather a unique response of this country and its people to find innovative creative and yes even less costly ways to respond to those unique and unmet problems because we do not have the resources at the federal state or local level and we are going to find new and different ways to do it then they should vote no probably probably the administration made a mistake i do not think so but listening to this debate probably they made a mistake when they said instead of giving people 12 000 plus salaries for national service on a fulltime annual basis we are going to break the mold and we are going to say what everybody republican and democrat in this town has said for years which is education is a lifelong learning necessity in the 1990s and into the 21st century so we are going to do something very different what we are going to do is we are going to pay them the vista level of roughly 7 400 for a fulltime national service commitment on an annual basis but what we will do is above and beyond that we will say if you choose to pursue additional education or to pay off educational debts you already have we will give you an educational stipend of up to 5 000 i think that is a dramatic change in public policy in this country for all of the right reasons but i am wondering listening to this debate if some agree the second reason i oppose the goodling amendment is because i absolutely believe the diversity of national service participants is essential if this program is going to succeed in all due respect i hope no one here wants a national service corps made up of only lowincome people that is as prejudiced in reverse as it would be on the other side and i say that because income alone cannot be the criterion for a diverse corps that wants to succeed doing very different things look at what we are talking about ladies and gentlemen we are talking about four primary areas education health care law enforcement and the environment now we are talking about education primarily in the inner city do we only want lowincome people to participate in education programs in the inner city of this country i know nobody here believes that in any way shape or form we have got to have that diversity but think about it people say that this bill is costing toomuch i tell you what costs too much what costs too much is a whole classroom of young people in the inner city of l a new york or elsewhere who drop out and become a part of crime under this bill where there is not a teacher today we are saying we will invite that teacher and their ideals to national service to come and give a year of their time and their talent and to take those innercity kids and for that we will give them 7 400 in salary to live on and if and only if they have a student loan to pay off or they want to go back to

is room to cut some of the spending in this bill there has also been an increase in entitlements or what i believe is an entitlement regarding the child nutrition programs or about 671 million we as a country cannot sustain these kinds of increase in appropriation bills indefinitely i mean this is an increase of 16 2 percent in 1 year last year the food stamp part of this bill went up by about 20 percent fortunately the food stamp program did not increase to that extent this year but nevertheless we have had quantum leaps in expenditures in this particular appropriation bill in the past so we have to start making some economies the amendment that i have before the body right now would save only about 14 25 million granted that is just a drop in the bucket but it is a step in the right direction this amendment deals with rural development grants some of the examples of how the money would be spent are contained in the report language in this legislation i cannot understand why we are spending money for kentucky public television some industrial parks in the country and immigration counseling in arizona we have about 2 2 to 2 3 million illegal aliens coming across the border per year right now i was just in mexico city and found that out last week about half of them are being sent back so we are having an increase of about 1 1 to 1 2 million illegal aliens coming into the

illegal aliens and the illegal immigrants from coming into this country in the first place and i doubt seriously if the amount of money appropriated in here would really be able to counsel many of those illegal aliens coming into the country or deal much with the immigration problem so i would just like to say to my colleagues the bill contains 35 million for rural development grants last year it was 20 75 million all i am doing is reducing it to last years spending level this is not a cut below last year it is just taking it back to last years spending level that would reduce the spending

reconciliation act of while there is language allowing the secretary to select institutions in addition to those who apply to participate in the direct loan program this language does not penalize institutions for refusing the secretarys invitation furthermore this language is a holdover from the direct loan pilot program the opponents of direct lending wanted to ensure that in selecting participants for the direct loan program a representative crosssection of institutions were selected to participate in direct loans therefore the department was required to ensure a representative sample of the guaranteed program because of the conffusion over the purpose of this selection language i have included language to clarify that the secretarys selection authority contained in section 453 b of the higher education act pertains only to his ability to reach a representative crosssection and this language does not give him the authority to draft institutions into the direct loan program in order to meet any legislated percentages of participating institutions i would like to draw to your attention a few of the other clarifying changes that are included in this legislation at the request of the department of education we included a 1year waiver of a provision of the master calendar regarding the effective date of regulations published after december 1 this waiver would affect the integrity provisions in parts b g and h of title iv only this would allow the numerous integrity provisions contained in the higher education amendments of 1992 to go into effect prior to

associations statements made on the house floor during consideration of the higher education amendments of 1992 clarifled that this separation was not required for accrediting bodies with no title iv

of pell grant funds in light of this policy the committee agreed that this sentence was no longer necessary the committee intends that the department continue its current policy of advancing institutions 85 percent of their pell funds section 2 c 26 clarifies the skiptracing provision in the higher education act current law requires a guaranty agency to demonstrate to the secretary that it has attempted to locate defaulted borrowers before it can be reimbursed for defaulted loans this provision would change the word demonstrate to certify it is not the intent of this amendment to

policy instead new and creative thinking must be applied to the myriad multifaceted challenges that confront us in this rapidly changing world as i stated in the context of the debate on south africa the cold war doctrine allows the world to understand what we stand against but do we stand for what is in our national interest that is open to debate and exploration the days of cookiecutter foreign policy formulation are over all of us in this chamber must now meet with courage and clarity of thought the new challenges that are being thrust upon us in this rapidly changing postcoldwar world in the period that operation uphold democracy has been in existence united states troops have managed to provide hope where there was once only desolation installed restraint where brutality had long held sway and conveyed to all haitians the importance of forbearance and selfcontrol during this very sensitive period of transition towards the restoration of democracy in haiti it is now up to the congress to ensure that the united states stays the course long enough to ensure that our participation in the multinational force and the u n led mission yields lasting results i commend general shelton and the thousands of men and women in the unitedstates armed services currently serving with compassion and professionalism in haiti and i commend president clinton and the many analysts advi sors and practitioners throughout our government who found a way to enable the united states to face this postcoldwar challenge during the cold war american power and global preeminence were measured in terms of our capacity to confront the thenmighty soviet union either directly or through surrogate wars in third world nations multibilliondollar weapons systems and the worlds best trained fighting men and women set our nation apart from the worlds other military establishments it is my hope however that the end of the cold war will heighten our awareness that americas greatness can also be demonstrated in ways other than we grew used to during decades of cold war rivalry our readiness to work with the world community to devise strategies to uhdergird democracy promote individual liberty and halt macabre and sustained brutalization of peoples leyorid our shores are also worthy of our consideration and support the use of unitedstates troops in such actions raises many difficult but important questions do we have the means to accomplish the mission are the political economic and humanitarian consequences of inaction considered unacceptable by the the united states and the international community are our nations interest in promoting democracy and economic stability abroad advanced in the process what is the required level of consultation between the legislative and executive branches of our government for which types of operations is congressional authorization required these are important questions with which we are now forced to grapple now that the cold war is over with regard to the operations aspects of operation uphold democracy i must commend the flexibility that our troops have exhibited under the leadership of general shelton this has facilitated the correction of operational weaknesses as soon as they have become obvious and as result the operation has proceeded thus far without any major setbacks nonetheless there will be moments of crisis this operation is not free of danger there will be casualties and so it is incumbent upon us all to prepare the american people and ourselves for these difficult momentsif moments of crisis and setback are not to give way to despair and defeat the important point to remember is that operation uphold democracy represents a new global commitment in the postcoldwar world to uphold and defend democracy and this is an effort in which the united states of america and every person in this chamber should be proud to be a part i have never heard any of my colleagues from either side of the aisle even suggest that the united states become involved in every or even most of the lowintensity conflict that will continue to emerge around the world nonetheless we must be prepared to recognize

have risked life and limb over many years to free themselves of dictatorship via the electoral process a goal they managed to achieveagainst great odds in december 1990 undergirding their determination to reenter the world community of democratic nations despite years of extreme oppression is indeed worthy of unitedstates sup port we must allow united states troops in haiti to stay long enough to complete the task at hand free of congressionally mandated withdrawal dates i am not advocating a multiyear presence but i am urging that we allow our president and the unitedstates troops now on the ground the time needed to ensure that operation uphold democracy will succeed this would not only in the best interest of the people of haiti it would also be in the best interest of our own country"], [0.006506145000457764, 0.49349385499954224, 0, "madam speakei i rise in support of the dunn motion to instruct conferees on the crime lill to ensure that the conference report includes national tracking and registration of released sexually violent predators community notification of the presence of these released individuals immunity for law enforcement agencies that act in good faith to notify communities a sexually violent predator is a person who has been convicted of a sexually violent offense and who suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder that makes the person likely to engage in another such offense this measure targets the small group of violent sexual offenders who are released into society after serving time for rape or child molestation despite the fact that they are a continued threat after a determination has been made that a person is a sdxually violent predator it is simply a commonsense precaution for law enforcement officials to monitor the persons whereabouts and warn communities where the person may commit another offense currently law enforcement officials often fail to communicate the presence of a sexual predator in their communities because they either have no way of ensuring his residence or lack the legal protection to do so this measure gives our law enforcement officials the tools to protect their communities from some of the most violent and brutal criminals according to the congressional budget office the cost of this measure is negligible the dunn motion to instruct is a commonsense motion which will serve to protect women and children in the future and i urge my colleagues to support it"], [0.007801473140716553, 0.5078014731407166, 1, "i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time the budget resolution for fiscal year 1994 provided reconciliation direction to the armed services committee in two areas first the committee was directed to report legislation that saves outlays equal to the amount that would be saved by a freeze on military pay in fiscal year 1994 i should point out that the committee was faced with the requirement this yearfor the first time everto reconcile pay because of the way the cbo baseline was constructed second the committee was directed to report legislation to achieve savings in direct spending of 2 4 billion for fiscal years 1994 through 1998 these savings were premised on the notion that all federal civilian and military retirees would receive only a halfcolaor costofliving allowanceuntil they reach age 62 after lengthy and heated debate the armed services committee reported legislation that achieved the required savings but redesigned the retiree cola to provide a series of delays over the 5year period in the committees view this rolling cola as we dubbed it was far more equitable because it did not single out one segment of the retiree population to bear the brunt of the required savings in the conference deliberations the senate conferees stressed that the question of a pay raise was under the socalled byrd rule extraneous to the reconciliation process and therefore subject to a point of order as a result the house receded to the senate dropping the issue of pay from the bill instead each armed services committee dealt with the military pay raise as a part of the defense authorization bill on the issue of retiree colas the conference agreement meets the required direct spending savings by melding the house and senate versions of the cola delay applicable to all retirees both over and under age 62 while continuing t6 exempt survivors and the disabled heres the payment schedule the fiscal year 1994 cola would be delayed 3 months from january 1 1994 until april 1 1994this is the same as the cola delay for federal civilian retirees included elsewhere in this bill for fiscal years 1995 through 1998 the cola would be delayed until the following october i know that a number of members are starting to get mail from military retirees asking why they seem to have been singled out in the reconciliation process we have worked with our senate colleagues to make the federal civilian and military retiree cola delays the same for fiscal year 1994 beyond 1994 the cola payment dates for military and federal civilian retirees are not the same because the required savings in the budget resolution for the two groups of retirees were very very different"]]}
