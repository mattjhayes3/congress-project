black caucus to celebrate the birth and honor the memory of the reverend martin luther king jr this man in his brief lifetime achieved a moral political and religious revolution in the united states he dreamed of a revitalized renewed america based on love and brotherhood he worked to achieve this america through a nonviolent movement dr kings mission is still unfinished as it was during his lifetime racism and inequality distrust and misunderstanding still divide us and terrible occasions of hatred and violence still erupt to remind us that it remains for us to fulfill dr kings dream martin luther kings dream was the american dream dr king said we are simply seeking to bring into full realization the american dreama dream yet unfulfilled a dream of equality of opportunity of privilege and property widely distributed a dream of a land where men no longer argue that the color of a mans skin determines the content of his character the dream of a land where every man will respect the dignity and worth of human personalitythis is the dream when it is realized the jangling discords of our nation will be transformed into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood and men everywhere will know that america is truly the land of the free and the home of the brave some people would have us celebrate this holiday by praising martin luther king while we neglect or forget his words and deeds they would have us honor him as the prophet of a completed revolution as a representative of an historical movement whose time has passed but we do not honor dr king by just praising him and memorializing him if atthe same time we neglect his message we do not honor him if we act as though the civil rights movement has no relevance for us today our words of praise are not sufficient if they are formal and hollow the martin luther king federal holiday commission has set a theme for this years observance it is living the dream the theme is appropriate it is not giving lipservice to the dream or remembering the dream it is living the dream that means making it part of all of our lives today keeping it alive continuing it advancing it and fulfilling its promises we honor dr king today because of his message because of his commitment to nonviolence and reconciliation because of his dream of an america united in brotherhood thus we truly honor him only if we apply his standards to the challenges and difficulties that face us today and only if we attempt to live up to his standards last month on december 20 in the howard beach section of new york city there occurred a terrible incident of racially inspired violence in the howard beach incident three black men were chased and beaten by a white mob in queens simply because they were black and simply because they were passing through a predominantly white neighborhood one of these men michael griffitha constituent of mine from the bedfordstuyvesant neighborhood in brooklyndied when he ran from the mob into speeding highway traffic the violence of howard beach and the actions accusations and acrimony that have followed it have torn at our hearts they have refocused our attention on the issue of racism in america they require us to pay renewed attention to the failings of our society and to the unfinished agenda of the civil rights movement the howard beach incident is not unique however it is simply one of the latest of a string of racial outrages that have occurred in new york city over the past few years in 1978 according to the new york times victor rhodes a 16yearold boy was stomped to death by a gang of hassidic students in the crown heights section of brooklyn in 1982 william turks a black transit worker was killed by a gang of white youths in the gravesend section of brooklyn in 1984 widespread public support for the subway vigilante bernard goetz was based largely on the fact that the boys he shot were black in 1986 gary moy an asian man was stabbed to death by a mob of white brooklyn youths who said chinks dont belong in this neighborhood and on new years eve this year a gang of 20 to 25 black youths chanting howard beach howard beach robbed and beat white teenagers returning from the celebration in times square and beat an indian and a pakistani bystander it would be easy to fall into a morass of anger and despair at this racial pre dicament it would be easyand even understandableto preach the coming of the whirlwind and to help to bring about the whirlwind thus at times like this it is both a great comfort and a great source of hope to go back to the words of dr king to seek his guidance in this terrible situation that would have been so familiar to him i have recently asked myself what dr king would have said about the racial predicament in which we find ourselves both in new york city and in the nation and have gone back to his speeches articles and books to find what his advice to us would have been dr king would not have been surprised that this racial quagmire has arisen in a nothern city with a liberal heritage he wrote in an article that appeared after his death today the northern cities have taken on the conditions we faced in the south police national guard and other armed bodies are feverishly preparing for repression they can be curbed not by unorganized resort to force by desperate negroes but only by a massive wave of militant nonviolence nonviolence was never more relevant as an effective tactic than today for the north it also may be the instrument of our national salvation and years before he wrote about the white leadership of northern cities northern white leadership has relied too much on tokens substitutes and negro patience the end of this road is clearly in sight the cohesive potentially explosive negro community in the north has a short fuse and a long train of abuses if the white leadership were committed to true change in the northern cities where would they begin dr king knew that change must start among other places in the police departments of these cities in the howard beach incident as well as in other racial incidents in new yorkincidents such as the eleanor bumpurs shooting and the stun gun abuse of suspects by police in the headquarters of the 106th precinctquestions have been raised about the behavior of the police investigations and about the integrity of their investigation serious charges have been made about police officers discourtesy to and mistreatment of cedric sandiford and timothy grimes the two black survivors of the howard beach attack this is one of the most distressing elements of the whole affair dr king knew well the doubts that black americans have about the police in their communities he wrote this is a sensitive and touchy problem that has rarely been adequately emphasized virtually every riot has begun from h 354 co some police action if you try to tell the people in most negro communities that the police are their friends they just laugh at you obviously something desperately needs to be done to correct this i have been particularly impressed by the fact that even in the state of mississippi where the fbi did a significant training job with the mississippi police the police are much more courteous to negroes than they are in chicago or new york our police forces simply must develop an attitude of courtesy and respect for the ordinary citizen if we can just stop policemen from using profanity in their encounters with black people we will have accomplished a lot in the larger sense police must cease being occupation troops in the ghetto and start protecting its residents and what about the black leadership dr king had the best possible advice for those who would aspire to lead black people under these trying conditions he had the highest standards for judging these leaders he wrote in this period of transition and growing social change there is a dire need for leaders who are calm and yet positive leaders who avoid the extremes of hot headedness and uncle tomism the urgency of the hour calls for leaders of wise judgment and sound intergrityleaders not in love with money but in love with justice leaders not in love with publicity but in love with humanity leaders who can subject their particular egos to the greatness of the cause what attitude should the black community take toward the white community of howard beach how can the black community and the black leadership use this sad occasion constructively when we see the fear and anger in the pitiful white crowds that have gathered in new york this past month we recall dr kings wise counsel of nonviolence as an opportunity for reconciliation dr king could well have been thinking of howard beach when he wrote nonviolence is power but it is the right and good use of power constructively it can save the white man as well as the negro on another occasion dr king noted it is evil that we are seeking to defeat not the persons victimized with evil those of us who struggle against racial injustice must come to see that the basic tension is not between races the tension is at bottom between justice and injustice between the forces of light and the forces of darkness and if there is a victory it will be a victory not merely for e negroes but a victory for justice and the forces of life we are out to defeat injustice and not white persons who may happen to be unjust dr king knew the problem of meeting the fears and anger of the white community with the hatred and violence of blacks he wrote the problem with hatred and violence is that they intensify the fears of the white majority and leave them less ashamed of their prejudices toward negroes in the guilt and confusion confronting our society violence only adds to the chaos it deepens the brutality of the oppressor and increases the bitterness of the oppressed violence is the antithesis of creativity of wholeness it destroys community and makes brotherhood impossible"],

possible for civilization to flow backwards while there is youth in the world the challenge before us is that of providing all our children the opportunity to become productive citizens the relationship between the family home and the workplace has a profound effect on the lives of our children in 1955 60 percent of the households in the united states consisted of a working father a housewife mother and two or more schoolage children in 1980 that family unit was only 11 percent and in 1985 it was 7 percent an astonishing change more than 50 percent of women are in the work force with the percentage increasing according to the census 59 percent of the children born in this country in 1983 will live with only one parent before reaching the age of 18 the united states has the highest adolescent birth rate of any idustrialized nation each year half a million children are born to children under the age of 17 in fact every day 40 teenage girls give birth to their third child being the third child of a child certainly puts ones future very much at risk as we are well aware the statistics about children and poverty are staggering one child in four is born into poverty singleparent femaleheaded households living in poverty in this country have increased dramatically from 2 4 to 3 4 million between 1975 and 1985 nearly 40 percent of all such households live in poverty in 1986 of households with children under 6 years old 2 8 million were headed by women and 1 7 million of these families were poor being supportive of a childs development under these circumstances is difficult at best to permit large numbers of citizens to grow up uneducated illhoused and underfed not only limits future productivity but undermines the integrity of our strength as a nation public policy debates regarding the welfare and future of our children cannot ignore the interrelationship of the family structure our system of education and training and the workplace environment the education and training individuals receive influence and often determine the type of job they can hold their jobs in turn contribute heavily to the standard of living enjoyed by their families public policy changes made to revamp or retool the workplace will also have a major impact on the home the stakes in this debate are particularly high for children one program that has been part of the public policy debate in this area over the past 20 years is the work incentive program it was established in 1967 with the purpose of providing skill assessments job training and employment placement to help afdc recipients become selfsupporting unfortunately the program has not achieved its potential it has however managed to weather criticism and serious efforts to eliminate its funding recently though new support has surfaced for the win program this support is due to the great strides made in recent years under the win demonstration program authority as part of the provisions of the 1981 omnibus budget reconciliation act states could for the first time as part of their regular programs require afdc recipients to work in public or nonprofit agencies in return for their welfare benefits in addition greater flexibility was given to the win program to fund onthejob training programs by diverting recipients welfare grants into wage subsidies for private employers the intent of these innovative programs has been to provide the means by which welfare recipients can be moved into gainful employment with the flexibility permitted under win demonstration programs states have begun to offer a mix of services ranging from basic skills education to sophisticated training as well as more traditional community work experience and what is now known as workfare in which clients undertake public service for a period of time in exchange for their grants the most discussed of these programs is the massachusetts etchoices program which has placed more than 30 000 welfare recipients and applicants in unsubsidized jobs the program is expected to save massachusetts taxpayers 107 million in reduced welfare benefits and increased tax revenues this year since its inception the et program has helped to reduce the welfare caseload by 4 percent my own state of vermont has initiated a similar program called up reach which is designed to consolidate at the state level many existing employment and training programs including win registration for the program is required of all afdc recipients who do not have federally defined exemptions it is voluntary for all other recipients training education career planning support services and job seeking opportunities are provided to program participants there is close interaction with potential employers so that meaningful jobs are available for program participants upon completion it is reasonable to expect that ablebodied individuals seek employment and that federal policy should encourage individuals to choose a life of selfsufficiency for many inadequate education and lack of training and work experience constitute major barriers to obtaining productive employment the opportunity to obtain education training and work experiences under win should be strengthened we also cannot ignore the issue of child careits availability affordability and quality unless we address in a comprehensive manner the education training and support needs of this significant segment of our population the longterm results could jeopardize our productivity competitiveness and standing as a world leader not only do we lose the contribution of the adults already dependent on government subsidy but we increase the chances that their children will be at even greater risk of continuing this dependency as a nation we

we have seen on national television in the past few days since last sunday what we have read in the national press has given us a clear idea that something is wrong radically wrong in haiti when we see bloodied bodies in polling places people who have been gunned down for no other reason than that they desire to cast a ballot we can understand that something is radically wrong in haiti there is a human tragedy that certainly is obvious and evident we do not need an analysis to tell us about that we do not need anybody to explain the human tragedy but beyond the human tragedy there is a diplomatic tragedy there is a tragedy in terms of the international struggle for democracy i would like to take a few minutes to talk about that tragedy first i would like to quickly review the facts the haitian people are quite fortunate in that after more than 30 years of tyranny by the duvalier family first francois duvalier who made himself president for life and then when he died he made his son president for life francois duvalier and jeanclaude duvalier were dictators of the most ruthless and primitive kind haiti is the poorest country in the western hemisphere haiti probably rivals countries anywhere in the world in terms of poverty yet not long before jeanclaude duvalier was forced to step down as the life time president of haiti jeanclaude duvaliers wife went to new york city and she spent 2 million shopping when jeanclaude duvalier was pressured out finally by the actions of the haitian people and with the help and assistance of the united states government it was discovered that he had hundreds of millions of dollars in banks throughout the world while the country was sinking further and further into poverty and there are five million of the poorest people on this globe who live in haiti that is the kind of ruthless heartless primitive crude dictatorship that the haitian people were up against our government is to be congratulated i congratulate the reagan administration i congratulate the state department not only did they remove at least play a major role in pressuring jeanclaude duvalier to leave but they did it with a minimum of bloodshed in fact it was the haitian people who first rose up haitian people who had very little to fight with but made it clear that they would not tolerate any longer the kind of oppression that they lived under with the duvaliers they made it clear they rose up they were murdering them in large numbers but they would rise up again and more numbers would be massacred and they would rise up again it was the unitedstates government that said that this is not going to stop it is obvious that unless somebody does something we are going to have one bloodbath after another and i say to my colleagues our government is to be congratulated that they moved to make it clear to jeanclaude duvalier that the unitedstates government which is the prime support in terms of economic aid and military assistance for haiti that they would no longer support a government which was massacring its own people in order to stay in power so as we did in the philippines and again i think the reagan administration is to be congratulated they brought a new kind of diplomacy and a new kind of intervention into being which there should be no limit on the amount of applause for which is showered upon them for it as they did in the philippines against a cynical brutal dictator ferdinand marcos they used their influence and used their power in the way that a great nation should use its influence and power that is without firing any shots without sending any marines in they merely sided with the majority of the people and when the majority of the people are given an opportunity they elected corazon aquino they moved on from there to establish a whole new constitution and a whole new government so our state department is to be congratulated and our president should be congratulated some very decisive actions were taken some very important precedentsetting decisions were made in the case of the philippines and again in the case of haiti to move jeanclaude duvalier off the scene with a minimum of additional bloodshed was an accomplishment to be applauded so that was accomplished the problem was when that kind of change takes place what does a government establish to maintain law and order as a substitute it was a dilemma never before faced by this government and very few others they had to go through a process and i do not know what the process was but i can understand i sympathize with the dilemma that they faced of installing a set of leaders to replace jeanclaude duvalier that set of leaders originally included some people from the civilian sector as well as military leaders the person who emerged of course as the strong man and as the leader was general namphy as is to be expected in that kind of a situation the vacuum would be filled inevitably it would be filled with military power but there was an understanding that a process would go forward by which the haitian people would be allowed first of all to write a constitution to vote on that constitution to establish an elections process and eventually to elect their own new government in a democratic process i think some of the generals quite cynically looked at that process and said that it will never happen in haiti they expected the ordinary people who helped to make the revolution lead to the point where duvalier had to be forced out they expected them to fall flat on their faces and not produce a constitution let alone an elaborate one which had some provisions in it which showed that people clearly understood the tyranny they were living under but the people did it they got a constitution they voted for it and set in motion an election process part of that constitution specified however that all of the people who were close to the obvious colleagues of the duvalier family would not be allowed to run in that election that was a provision of the constitution which i think was a stroke of genius there are some people who criticized it and said that they made a mistake by putting a provision in which closed out the old duvalier regime totally they set up a desperate situation out of desperation the people who are the remnants of the duvalier regime have to turn to violence therefore they should never have frozen them out of the electoral process my reply to that is if they had not frozen the duvalier people out of the electoral process if they had allowed the old duvaliers to run for election they would have had a different kind of scenario and the scenario would have been as follows there would have been elections in haiti they would have followed the timetable but the same guns the same bullets that were used to gun people down at the polls would have been used to terrorize any people who did not support the candidates of the duvalier remnants they would have guaranteed that there was an election even if only 10 percent of the population came out and they would have terrorized the other 90 percent they would have gone to the world and said we gave them an opportunity to come out and vote but they did not here is our election result here is our candidates now leave us alone we have freely established democratic government in haiti they would have used their power and might to rig the election and to guarantee that they stayed in power so a wise group of people the haitian people stood behind that provision in the constitution and said that under no circumstances would they waive this provision they insisted despite the fact that 12 people who were identified as old members of the duvalier regime those 12 were not allowed to become candidates they struck them off the ballot they would not allow them to be candidates in accordance with their own constitution at that point the cynical ruling military junta understood that they had to resort to violence either they would carry out violence directly as they did in some places on sunday november 29 or they would permit the civilian terrorists those who do not wear uniforms but who have the same kind of firepower the same guns the guns that duvalier brought in when he was there and distributed and some of the guns that we have recently paid for for them to maintain law and order in haiti the guns and the bullets that were used to murder haitian citizens on sunday november 29 were guns paid for and bullets paid for by the american taxpayers when they understood clearly that the legally established constitution would not bow to them they determined that they would wreck the whole process step by step they showed this it was not anything that should have taken our government by surprise when you had a candidate hacked to pieces in broad daylight a presidential candidate gets hacked to pieces in broad daylight that should send you a clear signal and nobody was ever punished for it further when an internationally known lawyer who happens to be a haitian citizen is running for presi dent volel went to make a speech he chose to make a speech about certain kinds of things that were happening that were not correct in front of the police station in downtown haiti because i think he reasoned that that was the safest place to be in a place where terrorists were known to be abroad he figured he could stand in front of the police station and be safe and the police station is not far from the palace where general namphys government sits so i think it was good reasoning he also invited journalists from all over the world to come and listen to him with their cameras their notebooks so we had a scene where a candidate is standing in front of the police station with journalists from all over the world they are taking notes with television cameras he began making a speech plainclothesmen they say they were policemen men in plain clothes walked out of the police station gunned him down walked away and to this day nobody has apprehended them or punished them the presidential candidate volel lay dead is dead and he died in front of the central police station is downtown haiti not too far from the palace that was a clear signal in my opinion that the namphy government would tolerate terrorism and was cooperating with terrorism if they came out of the police station obviously there was a plot or a conspiracy which involved the powers who were supposed to keep law and order despite all of these clear signals we dragged our feet our ambassador our government did not obviously make it clear to namphy and his government that we would not tolerate a disruption of the electoral process namphy cynically cynically insisted until the last minute that he would cooperate despite what we saw developing he would guarantee that there would be law and order on november 29 election day but of course we know on election day there were massacres not only did they massacre haitian people but they went after foreign journalists and some of the observers so cynical was general namphy that he invited many international observers he did keep out some congressmen because he did not like the way they had been making speeches or signing statements about developments in haiti but there were large numbers of people brought in from all over the world certainly the caribbean region who were there to observe the elections and he cynically invited them in and then they saw the display of the collaboration between the government and the terrorists before their very eyes this is where we are today the problem is where do we go from here it is clear that namphy and his government the military junta will not permit free elections in haiti they have disbanded the electoral council the provisional electoral council and they are insisting that they will conduct elections oversee elections and guarantee a new government by february 7 the date the election process was to have been completed if it had been allowed to proceed normally they have disbanded the provisional electoral council however the provisional electoral council was created by the constitution of haiti the provisional electoral council has as much authority as the namphy government the namphy government was an extralegal makeshift entity of temporary status until the constitution was written and when the haitian constitution was written they wrote in a provision that the military junta the namphy government could continue until february 7 so they were given by the constitution some status that same constitution gave the provisional electoral council its own status and did not subject it to the namphy government one part of a constitutionally established government one body established by the constitution cannot eradicate another body established by the constitution so the provisional electoral council has been illegally in defiance of the constitution declared null and void by namphy already i understand recent developments are such the pressures on him are such that he has reinstated the provisional government he does not have the power to declare null and void so he does not have the power to reinstate it it exists and much to the credit of the men who serve on this muchthreatened and maligned provisional electoral council they are still insisting that they are there they are legal they have authority from the constitution and they intend to continue they will not recognize any election that is conducted by this namphy government also many of the candidates have made it clear that they will not participate in any election which is overseen and supervised by the namphy government the defiance of the people of haiti is still there it is still strong despite the massacres on sunday november 29 in embarrassment our government has decided now to get tough they have been outwitted they have been hoodwinked in the streets of my district we would say that they have been psyched out and they are upset the government would like to do something beyond what it has done already they said they are cutting off all military aid all economic aid except humanitarian aid they said that and i assume that that is true i assume that they are bringing maximum pressure to bear on the namphy government through the discussions that have been held with them recently i understand the ambassador in haiti has met with the military rulers recently we do not know what kind of conversations took place people in a number of places in this hemisphere and throughout the world are upset they want some action the question is what do we do now some people are calling for immediate military intervention i have all along called for peaceful intervention and i repeat that peaceful intervention is possible and peaceful intervention should go forward what do i mean by peaceful intervention because of the fact that intervention has been used in so many ways by so many different people i would like to take this time to explain what i mean by peaceful intervention intervention in haiti means providing maximum assistance for the free election process intervention in haiti means providing maximum assistance for the provisional electoral council to carry out the free election process the provisional electoral council has as much authority as the namphy military junta if the provisional electoral council wants help from the outside they should be able to get help from the outside by merely requesting the help from the outside intervention which is peaceful legal and respectful of the constitution is possible in haiti circumstances in haiti are unique and they must not be loosely compared to other situations involving tyrannical and oppressive governments it must be remembered that since the fall of the dictator jeanclaude duvalier haiti has been a nation with a government in transition the government is a government in transition right now the ruling military group is not a permanent government instead it must be viewed as makeshift a temporary arrangement that it is the namphy government was put in place by the unitedstates state department this temporary arrangement was made legal only when the writers of the new constitution of haiti recognized this group as an interim government until february 7 1988 and that is when the free election process was to have been completed the same constitution which made the military junta legal for a temporary period and conferred upon it the authority from the haitian people also created the provisional electoral council this council does not exist subject to the approval of the namphy government the electoral council exists with authority derived from the haitian people who voted to approve the new constitution this same constitution also clearly spelled out the function and the role of the electoral council this constitution established a timetable for free elections to be conducted interference with the electoral council by the namphy government constitutes a gross violation of the haitian constitution the electoral council has the authority and the right to act independently such independent authority of the electoral council includes the right and the authority to call on outside agencies to call upon outside organizations and to call on nations the provisional electoral council can legitimately request help from anyplace it wants to seek help the provisional electoral council can call on the rest of the world to help it by sending in equipment or a new printing press to print new ballots for the election the electoral council can call on the outside world to give it help in terms of trucks to transport ballot boxes and any other equipment it has to move or helicopters to reach remote parts of the country the electoral council also has the right to call upon nations and organizations for armed guards or police or troops if necessary to guarantee the protection of the election process to guarantee the protection of the personnel working in the election to guarantee the protection of the candidates and also on election day to guarantee the protection of the voters we do not need military intervention we do not need intervention forced upon the people of haiti we need to ask the electoral council what it is they want and we need to respond to the electoral council that is not illegal intervention that is not forcing ourselves on a nation and violating its sovereignty that is coming to the rescue of the majority of the people that is obeying the will of the constitution facilitating the constitutional process established by the haitian people this call for outside help which might include armed guards or police or troops this call should be made in terms of a multinational approach no one nation should answer the call by itself it is preferable that if personnel have to come in they come from the caribbean

the part of congress relative to the budget process while we had an omnibus continuing resolution that contained all federal spending last year at least that cr was enacted by midoctober 1986 only a couple weeks after the start of the fiscal year this years bickering for 3 months after the start of the fiscal year over the specifics of deficit reduction and program funding is totally unacceptable i have made clear my objection to the use of the omnibus cr as a way of skirting the budget process and forcing a show down at the 11th hour on contentious issues that couldnt survive on their own this process forces members to accept bad legislation because the only alternative is to shut down the entire federal government i am a cosponsor of legislation h res 271 introduced by my friend congressman amo houghton that would require each full year appropriations bill to be passed by congress individually and sent to the president in that form in lieu of separate movement of appropriations bills i have also cosponsored congressman mickey edwards bill h r 3199 that would require separation of any cr into the 13 individual appropriations bills upon presention to the president for signature i would hope that in view of the fiasco of this budgetary cycle there will be much greater pressure for responsible consideration of the appropriations bills in the coming year the specter of grammrudman sequestration and the scare of the stock market crash have forced congress and the white house to get down to specifics and come up with a deficit reduction package that eliminates the need for acrosstheboard cuts as i said when grammrudman was first approved by the house in 1985 the only good thing about it is that it is so bad in the final hours of november 21 the date sequestration began the budget summit negotiators announced the framework of an agreement without grammrudman it is hard to believe that this consensus would ever have been reached implementation of this agreement has proved difficult but i am pleased that we are finally able to vote on a package that makes sufficient cuts in federal spending to allow the repeal of this years sequestration order the budget agreement requires defense spending to drop 5 billion from the grammrudman baseline established in the july fix while i would have preferred the house defense figures that were 1 2 billion below the summit level at least defense is contributing a substantial share to deficit reduction nondetense discretionary programs are cut by about 2 6 billion from the grammrudman baseline because this baseline assumed an increase in all programs equal to the anticipated amount of inflation the 2 6 billion reduction allows for an overall increase in nondefense discretionary spending if we are to make serious progress on reducing the deficit again next year we will unfortunately have to make greater cuts in spending next time around lets turn to some specific provisions in this 600 billion bill my greatest objection to this bill is the inclusion of 8 1 million in aid to the contras i initiated a letter to house leaders on the conference committee signed by seven likeminded republicans expressing our strong support for the house position of no contra aid at this time unfortunately due to overwhelming support in the senate for 15 billion in aid and the white house threat to veto the entire funding bill if it didnt contain contra aid the house conferees gave in to demands to accept a scaledback level of aid at this point it appears that failure to pass the cr as it currently stands could result in disintegration of the agreement to provide only 8 1 million at which point the senate would insist on its full 15 million in aid members opposed to all contra aid are therefore caught between a rock and a hard place i am pleased that this legislation officially blocks the 2 percent pay raise for members of congress it came to membera 3tention earlier this year that the proposed cola increase for federal employees would apply to members of congress executive officers and judges unless these individuals were specifically separated from all other federal employees if we are going to ask many americans to sacrifice for the good of fiscal responsibility the least that members of congress can do is to contribute their 2 percent cola to that effort this legislation also contains language applauded by environmental groups that allows an 8month delay in sanctions for noncompliance with clean air act standards on ozone and carbon monoxide emissions this will pressure congress to reauthorize the clean air act this coming year instead of letting it slip into the next congress as some members had wished the cr also contains a provision that is very important to our nations dairy farmers the conferees on the agriculture appropriations section have included the text of my bill that will ensure that grammrudman sequestration does not unfairly impact dairy farmers back in 1986 congress and the president approved legislation i introduced h r 4188 public law 99260 to correct a flaw in the original grammrudman that would have cost dairymen 360 million in lost income in order to produce only 80 million in budget savings unfortunately in approving this years grammrudman fix the conferees neglected to incorporate this change senator bob kasten who was also instrumental in helping gain passage of public law 99260 back in 1986 inserted the language of h r 3344 in the senate version of the agriculture appropriations bill s 1900 i want to commend the

michel amendment they can simply wait out the congress he told me for instance that if we had just left them alone that they could have been in managua in 7 months i do not know of anyone who seriously believes that the michel amendment has two telltale provisions first it sets up a new vote a fter april 15 second it allows delivery of tools of war such as helicopters and logistics equipment it would send the message to the contras just wait boys and after april 15 the cavalry will be on the way and so will the bullets and so will the artillery and we will be back at war the delivery of military equipment would send the message to the sandinistas that they ought to move away from the bargaining tuale because we are trying to gin up the war again both messages should not be sent under the bonior amendment we would deliver only the truly humanitarian assistance which is consistent with the arias peace plan as indicated by president arias himself the next vote is far enough away on the calendar so that neither side can wait us out because both sides will know that their conduct is going to be judged and that we will be making another determination down the road to those who like myself have always opposed contra aid and who would like to simply say no as has been suggested today i would simply make this point it is nice to be able to say no if one has the votes but if one does not have the votes one has to have a strategy that is a little more innovative and a little more involved this is the third step in a threestage process to create momentum for peace the first came on the continuing resolution when we set up a freestanding vote on this issue so it would not be encumbered by other budgetary considerations we also at that time were able to cut off remaining military deliveries after february 29 we won that freestanding vote in the second stage on february 3 this is the third stage today to fulfill the promise we made to those on the fence when the question arose when we said that we would bring to this floor an alternative to let people be for something not just against something if they voted with us on february 3 that is what we are doing today in addition to that we are providing assistance directly to some of the kids who are the most sad victims of this war the kids in nicaragua who have lost arms and lost legs because of that light if we pass the bonior amendment we will preserve the cutoff of military aid which is now in effect since february 29 it is supported by a whole host of religious organizations who up to this time have opposed any kind of assistance to the contras and i think we ought to listen to them and vote for that package today it is not enough to simply hate war one also needs tactics and strategy to win the fight for peace we have to recognize that as long as ronald reagan is president we are going to be voting on this again and again so it is important that we not just win the vote today but keep together the coalition that can preserve the best options for peace in june in july and in october when those future votes come along let me simply make one additional point if the peace effort eventually fails in central americaand i hope to god it does notbut if it does let it be because it failed on the ground in the region do not let that failure be because congress failed to recognize a critical opportunity to keep the flow of military aid shut down and to push both sides to the negotiating table leadership requires determination it requires courage it also requires the ability to distinguish between morality and mere moralizing it also requires us to measure every event to determine whether or not there are changed circumstances which requires a change in approach and strategy

atmosphere of the american people yet perhaps the single most egregious exposure to air pollution can be done away with free tobacco smoke has some 4 000 chemical constituents forty of these are known

constituents are present in far greater volume in passive smoke than they are in the direct smoke taken in by the active smoker we have a bill that we have introduced in a couple of congresses that prevents smoking in public buildings except in designated areas the reason we have done this is to confine the smoke so that those who do not want to smoke are not exposed to it but if you are in an airplane it is not like a public building or it is not like a restaurant you just cannot walk out you cannot leave the national academy of sciences report found that separating the nonsmokers from the

tobacco smoke several investigators have shown that certain hazardous chemical constituents are present in much greater concentration in the passive smoke inhaled by the nonsmoker than in the filtered smoke inhaled by the active smoker for the past two congresses i have introduced bills to protect the health of nonsmokers working and visiting in unitedstates government buildings from the hazards of involuntary smoking by restricting smoking to designated areas the purpose of those bills is to prevent secondhand smoke from reaching nonsmokers in enclosed spaces well the cabin of an airplane is a

that separating smokers and nonsmokers in the airplane did not prevent passengers and flight attendants from being exposed to significant amounts of cigarette smoke the air space within an airplane is too small for such sectioningoff to do the job of protecting nonsmokers the academy recommended that smoking aboard domestic commercial flights be prohibited for health and safety reasons the

released a study last year concluding that exposure to secondhand smoke substantially increases the risk of lung cancer and respiratory diseases in nonsmokers by 13 to 31 percent preliminary data also

ii would have the effect of transferring jurisdiction over unfair and deceptive practices by airlines from the department of transportation to the federal trade commission the effect of this change would be to give the committee on energy and commerce jurisdiction over an important area of civil aviation this would reverse the decision which was made in 1974 to transfer jurisdiction over civil aviation from the committee on energy and commerce to the committee on public works and transportation this proposal for a change in jurisdiction over airline advertising is based on the widespread public concern over the recent deterioration in airline service the committee on public works and transportation shares this concern we have been working all year on legislation to deal with the problem and the house within the last week passed two major bills reported by our committee to improve airline service last week the house by a unanimous vote of 396 to 0 passed our bill to reauthorize the airport and airway trust fund this bill will make 28 billion available over 5 years to modernize the air traffic control system and improve our airports with this increased capacity there should be reductions in the delays and missed connections which have plagued the airlines in recent years earlier this week the house passed by voice vote our committees consumer protection legislation for airline passengers this legislation takes a variety of steps to improve airline service including monthly reports on airline service a prohibition on the cancellation of scheduled flights for any reason other than safety compensation to passengers for lost or delayed baggage a requirement that the department of transportation establish and enforce capacity limits at the nations 41 largest airports a requirement that the department of transportation establish and enforce performance standards for connections at airline hubs and a requirement that the airlines and the department of transportation establish tollfree telephone lines for consumer complaints i strongly believe that these two bills will go a long way toward improving airline service we are committed to continued oversight and to further legislation if it is required i strongly believe that this type of legislation is the best way to improve airline service service will not be improved by legislation which brings new committees into the act and which creates undesirable and unecessary splits in authority between executive branch agencies turning to the merits of the energy and commerce bill there is no reason to believe that the federal trade commission would do an effective job in regulating airline advertising and deceptive practices the ftc has not been fulfilling its responsibilities to regulate advertising and deceptive practices in other industries as is detailed in our committee report ftc inaction has been widely criticized by a variety of persons including state consumer protection officials and representatives of consumer groups similar sentiments have been expressed by our colleague congressman florio chairman of the subcommittee on commerce consumer protection and competitiveness of the committee on energy and commerce congressman florio stated in an extension of remarks on february 5 1986 that one of the saddest aspects of the washington scene in recent years has been the failure of federal agencies to enforce the law a good example of this is the backlash arising from the federal trade commissions relaxed approach to advertising abuses state and private litigants have moved into the enforcement void because the enforcement breakdown in washington cannot and will not quell the publics demand for action to restrict abuse since the ftc has not been fulfilling its responsibilities for other industries the agency cannot be expected to vigorously regulate airline advertising indeed a recent press release indicates that ftc has already made up its mind that there is no need for strong regulation of airline advertising in the release ftc is quoted as opposing airline advertising guidelines proposed by the national association of attorneys general on the grounds that the proposed guidelines would bury consumers in disclosure these comments suggest that ftc would be less than vigorous in regulating airline advertising even if ftc would regulate airline advertising effectively it would be impractical to give ftc this authority the department of transportation authoritys over consumer deception is only one part of a comprehensive regulatory scheme for aviation administered by the department this system cannot be divided without impairing its overall effectiveness for example when dot regulates airline advertising dot must be certain that the regulations do not adoctoblr 7 1987 versely affect safety for which dot is also responsible if dot establishes rules requiring airlines to meet their advertised schedule times dot must be certain that these regulations do not place undue pressure on the airlines to operate flights in unsafe conditions similarly dots regulation of advertising for airline charters is part of a comprehensive regulatory scheme under which dot also regulates the authority of charter operators to change itineraries the rights of passenagers to obtain refunds and the obligation of rcharter operators to maintain escrow accounts and performance bonds to ensure that sufficient funds are available for refunds advertising cannot be separated out of this regulatory system without creating confuson and less protection for consumers the need to have a single agency regulate all aspects of aviation has been fully recognized by the office of management and budget and the department of transportation fon october 5 omb issued a statement of policy that it would recommend a veto of h r 2897 unless it was amended to delete title ii in ombs words title li would inappropriately fragment regulation of air carriers advertising and consumer protection between the department of transportation and the ftc the department of transportation has taken a similar position in a letter of october 6 opposing h r 2897 the problem of fragmented responsibility was the main reason the fcongress decided in the civil aeronautics board sunset actof 1984 that authority over unfair and deceptive practices should be exercised by the department of transportation rather than a federal trade commission in conclusion the bill reported by the committee on energy and commerce would make major changes in a comprehensive regulatory system which congress specifically refused to change only 3 years ago because the energy and commerce committee bill would make major changes in the regulatory system governing civil aviation the bill was sequentially referred to the committee on public works and transportation we reported the bill with an amendment to delete title h the title transferring jurisdicition over airline advertising and deceptive practices from dot to ftc when the bill is open for amendment i will be offering an amendment 0to support the recommendations of the committee on

airlifter to be justified and correct that view has been endorsed by the armed services committee at both the subcommittee and committee level the short of it is the c17 will meet our airlift demands

will require far less personnel to operate according to the air force the cost of flying a c17 will be far less than the c5 and this will result in savings of at least 16 billion over the life of the

complimenting my two colleagues from the great state of california who have worked together to develop legislation that will benefit the citizens of this country the bill before us today reflects compromises on all sides and is the result of their diligent efforts this legislation represents the many compromises resulting from the extensive hearings and markups held on this legislation in sum 51 amendments were offered to this legislation in subcommittee and full committee out of these amendments a total of 30 were adopted by the committee the testing and counseling provisions of this bill differ considerably from h r 3071 the original bill introduced by mr waxman last year the proposal we are considering today deletes the very broad discrimination provisions in h r 3071 that provided a federal prohibition of discrimination against individuals who test positive for the aids virus in employment housing public accommodations and government services i believe this is a major concession thai makes enactment of this important legislation into law considerably more likely h r 5142 contains three titles title i authorizes the establishment of a voluntary counseling and testing program for hiv infection funds for this program would be allocated between a state block grant and a categorical grant program states would be required to carry out a program of contact tracing and to assure that testing sites report sufficient information to the state public health officer to permit analysis of the incidence of hiv infection and actual cases of aids this title also contains informed consent protections for the individuals undergoing testing and establishes a federal confidentiality standard for the protection of aids testing and counseling records i strongly believe that individuals suffering from aids or hiv infection are entitled to such protection at the same time however i believe public health concerns demand exceptions to the general rule of absolute confidentiality i am pleased that the bill before us today allows for these public health exceptions in order to provide notification to individuals who may have boon exposed to the disease such as health care providers funeral directors spouses sexual contacts needle sharers victims of sexual assault and by court order of the publirc health officer additionally believe it is important that the bill provides for the routine notification of emergency medical personnel if it is determined these personnel have been involved in the transport of an infected patient further the bill provides for mandatory testing of persons convicted of prostitution sexual assault or crimes related to iv drug abuse finally this title also includes language prohibiting the use of funds for counseling that promotes or encourages directly homosexual or unsafe heteiosexual activity or iv substance abuse title ii contains provisions addressing aidsrelated research activities i believe these provisions are worthwhile and will prove important in our fight against aids i am pleased these provisions were substantially modified during committee consideration to delete provisions mandating the bypass of budget review by the office of management and budget and to delete a number of inappropriate managerial directives i did not support this title of the bill when it was reported out of the energy and

activities i am pleased to report that the chairman of the health and the environment subcommittee and i have worked out our differences on this point i will be offering an amendment that reflects our agreement to modify these provisions title iii of the bill establishes a national commission on aids the text of this title is identical to a bill that passed the house last year by a substantial margin essentially the purpose of the national commission will be to continue the work of the presidents commission on aids given the projected impact of this disease in our society in the very near

dannemeyer which would require hospitals to routinely offer aids testing to patients admitted for surgery or blood work between the ages of 15 and 49 such testing would be required in states where at least 0 1 percent of the population is infected with the aids virus proponents of routine testing of hospital patients have advocated such testing on the basis of protecting health care workers yet the major organizations representing health care workers and providersincluding the american medical association the american nurses association anal and the american hospital associationhave argued that the best means of protecting workers is to require that such workers use barrier protections whenever they handle any blood or body fluid current hhs guidelines require that all hospital patients be treated as hiv positive and that appropriate precautions be taken through the use of barriers such as gloves gowns and masks public health experts and hospital administrators feel that if general testing programs were instituted health care workers might stop using precautions around patients who test negative this would be a significant problem because the hiv antibody test sometimes mistakenly identifies certain people who are infected as uninfectedfalse negativesand because the test does not immediately identify hivinfected persons who have not yet developed antibodies to the virus in general hospital inpatients represent a population of low risk for aids since virtually all persons admitted to the hospital have blood drawn this amendment in effect requires routine testing of all persons admitted to hospitals between the ages of 15 and 49 in selected states according to the american hospital association over 20 million persons under age 65 were admitted to unitedstates hospitals obviously offering routine hiv testing to such a large population will be extremely costly even though this amendment will only apply to states where more than 0 1 percent of the population

and research of the select committee on hunger at site visits to shelters and soup kitchens across the nation we consistently heard from service providers of the need to increase food assistance to the homeless the select committee on hunger report hunger among the homeless prepared last week reveals that the major federal food assistance programthe food stamp programis not serving a large percentage of homeless people the legislation before us today would address this concern by authorizing federal funding for food stamp program information directed to homeless persons the substitute also raises the ceiling on the excess shelter deduction from 152 to 168 in fiscal year 1988 this provision is intended to prevent hunger among the lowincome population whose scarce dollars are spent in a market where rents are going up and affordable housing is diminishing if they buy enough food for a sufficient diet they will be unable to pay their rent and thus eventually they may join the ranks of the homeless the select committee has repeatedly received testimony that rising housing costs are forcing lowincome families to choose between paying the rent and eating third shelter payments made by state or local welfare agencies to homeless shelters would be precluded from being counted as income therefore reducing food stamp benefits for homeless families homeless families are without food storage and preparation facilities they must shop daily for meals and must purchase expensive food in small quantities we must not allow homeless persons who have been denied the right to

commodities are distributed because the vast amounts now in storage depress prices and farm income commodities deteriorate in inadequate storage while homeless people forage in dumpsters for sustenance some may be concerned that the food assistance provisions of this measure will require limited new moneys in fiscal year 1988 and beyond by assuring access to food assistance for the homeless and assuring that rising shelter costs do not cause hunger among lowincome families we will undoubtedly save the longterm costs of the health and social consequences of homelessness again i
