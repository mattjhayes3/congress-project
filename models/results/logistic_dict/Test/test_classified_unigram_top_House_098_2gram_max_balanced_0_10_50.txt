hazardous wastes and they found that experts emphasize for the protection of underground sources of drinking water like those found in kansas the need for direct monitoring of the water source itself successful underground injection provisions in florida for example include the use of monitoring wells at varying distances from underground injection sites the lack of clear direct monitoring provisions in h r 5959 is the cause of my concern in looking over the senate counterpart to this bill s 2649 it appears that the proposed monitoring sections are much stronger calling for direct monitoring of downgradient undergroun4 sources of drinking water we cannot fully protect the drinking water of a community unless it is tested directly for contaminants that might invade the source

its research facilities will deal with the issue of experimentation on fetuses that are destined our are in the course of the abortion process today regulations are in existence that speak to this issue those regulations i submit create a loophole that a society in good conscience should not tolerate and so the choice that will come before us with this amendment is whether we want to permit experimentation on the unborn in the abortion process for whom there is no one to speak because they are in the nature of you might call societys unwanted garbage in the eyes of some but some of us believe that there has to be someone around who speaks for these human beings and that is the thrust of this amendment the opponents will say well we need the experimentation and we will hear from them at the appropriate time the amendment that i am offering to the committee says as a matter of policy as a conscience of our society we choose not to permit experimentation on the unborn who nobody really wants i want to make clear that this amendment does not in any way preclude experimentation or testing on a fetus that is not in the course of abortion why because the language of this amendment makes it obvious in such a case there are parents who are looking out for that child to be born who will utilize judgment when they sign a consent as to whether or not they want to approve a particular process or a particular test this amendment speaks to those fetuses that are in the course of the abortion process only a little bit of history is appropriate as to why this amendment is needed in the early 1970s experimentation on these fetuses began and prospered and grew to an alarming extent in this country and abroad and so congress back in the mid1970s addressed this issue and by an amendment which was adopted almost unanimously in 1975 this type of experimentation was precluded it went to the senate the other body and it was finessed a little and it ended up in the form of regulations being developed which regulations are in existence today as i mentioned earlier i think we in this house should set policy and that policy should not be set for us in the halls of the hhs in 1982 this house considered this matter the committee considered it last december when we took up this bill and it passed by an overwhelming vote 260 to 140 the other body did not get around to considering this matter and as a result the legislation died last year in the 97th congress and we are now taking uip the matter again the exceptions or rather the language that will be offered by way of an alternative is really an interesting exercise to analyze and i want you to listen to this because it really poses the question on whether or not the regulations that are being offered by my friend from california and colleague mr waxman really establishes an ethical standard at all tbe way he would like the law would authorize the experimentation if the risk to the fetus imposed by the research or experimentatiun is minimal and the purpose of the research or experimentation is the development of important biomedical knowledge which cannot be obtained by other means well now think about that for a moment if this human being in the course of an abortion is destined to die anyway can there be any risk that can be conjured in the mind of an experimenter that is anything less than minimal the answer to that is really no and therefore this is no restriction at all there is another element of the regulation they would like to have that would give a waiver to hhs and i submit as mentioned earlier that the waiver process is something that should not be permitted in our law policy questions of this magnitude should be set by elected representatives not appointees in the

republic of estonia estonia has long been a february 2d 1984 co proud nation with a rich and fruitful culture estonian identity comes from a varied and stormy history since the 13th century estonia has often been occupied and ruled by distant landlords yet the estonians have always preserved their tradtions language and culture it takes a strong people to protect their heritage during outside occupation but the estonians have done so their strong will is based in the dream that one day estonia will once again be a free and independent republic currently estonia is a captive under the rule of the soviet union the soviet union has repeatedly tried to strip the estonians of their culture in a systematic campaignto diffuse and eradicate estonian beliefs the soviet government has flooded the towns of estonia with russian workers who have been taught the tenets of communism these workers raise their children without the teachings of estonian history and identity thus the rich culture of estonia is slowly being slaughtered through the heavy importation of russian citizens and soviet ideology and yet estonia and its baltic neighbors strive to overcome their oppressor daily their love for freedom and dignity presses them on through any hardship the united states has never recognized the forced annexation of estonia by the soviet union on this 66th anniversary of estonian independence we commemorate the estonian struggle for independence our actions may remind the nations of the world of the helsinki agreements and our support for these freedomloving people in their will to once again become selfgoverning e"], [0.0006486773490905762, 0.4993513226509094, 1, "i would like to allude first to the colloquy that started out between mr edgar and myself apparently there is some misunderstanding about the administrations policy on new water projects marh 20 1964 and i quote from the letter that the gentleman from pennsylvania was referring to earlier on the bottom of page 3 in which the president says the water project financing and costsharing policy of this administration i and then they go on to the bottom of page 3 and to the top of page 4 and among the points that are made is that cost sharing of all prbposed projects the word proposed meaning and this was my clear understanding new water projects the letter goes on each such agency will negotiate reasonable financing arrangement for every project within its respective area of responsibility speaking again of the new projects on page 4 it says project beneficiaries not necessarily government enltiles should ultimately bear a substantial part of all costs of project development they are talking about future water project development so very clearly the administration while the letter is not as explicit as i would like has come down on the side of cost sharing the formula they suggest is not one that i would approve but it is a big step forward on the part of the administration i think perhaps we will want to review and maybe revise when the appropriate bill is before us this costsharing proposal but it is very clear now that the administration does support cost sharing for new projects and underlines the distinction i tried to make earlier between old projects repair of old unsafe dams and the planning and construction of new projects and the payment by the beneficiaries there seems to be one other misunderstanding with regard to this amendment that congressman mccain alluded to previously this is not an environmental issue there is not an environmental issue here as far as i can see when you press some of the organizations supporting the solomon amendment they say well the environmental issue is thitt we have to jack up the price of water and that will force conservation of water and conservation is good environmentalism and therefore that is the importance of this amendment well the fact is that in phoenix for example which is threatened by two unsafe dams the people who use water and whn under this kind of an amendment would be supposedly going to bear the additional costs are the farmers and there are maybe 3 000 or 4 000 or 5 000 of them in the phoenix area they are not going to get hurt most of them by a dam that fails they are served by canals that are 20 miles 10 15 20 miles away from the river itself the people who are going to get hurt are the tens of thousands of people in the lowlying areas of phoenix who would be drowned and have their homes and other property destroyed in the event of a failure of that dam this amendment is not going to produce costsharing of repair of dams it is going to sball actions for the future because the main water user groups are really not the ones going to be affected by flood i think the time has come to get on with this legislation we passed it 2 years ago but it never emerged from the other body on the other side of the capitol largely because of this amendment and largely because of the hostile position of the administration i am glad to see the administration has come around on this and i hope we can pass this legislation today i really worry about regional divisions in our country we ri the west think maybe that some folks would like a double standard when you improve the harbor in philadelphia or when you build a levee along the mississippi or the ohio or when you build the st lawrence seaway the great intercoastal canal all of this is in the infrastructure all of this makes us better america and we do not say to every little town in missouri along the mississippi river you got to piak up and pay for your share of the levee that protects your town we do not say with the intercoastal waterway that the local people have to pay there we do not even hit the users very hard the locks and dams that make all this barge traffic along the ohio and mississippi system possible these are paid for by the taxpayers of the whole country the idea being that we build our resources and undegird ourselves with a sound infrastructure that helps all of america yet we come to the west which has got more problems than most areas of the country and out there they have to collect every nickel"]]}
