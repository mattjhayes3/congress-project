representatives and the senate released a new set of estimates and it does verify that for the first time since 1969 we are going to have a surplus in fiscal year 1998 this is great news for america the first time since 1969 i was a sophomore in high school the united states government spent less money than what they had in their checkbook to me when i came here 3 years ago this was deemed an impossible dream when we said we were going to balance the budget by the year 2002 people looked at us yawned and basically said we do not believe you because they had made so many broken promises in the past today we stand here with final documentation and verification that in fact the budget is not only balanced but we are running a surplus cbo the scoring agency or the agency responsible for making predictions here in washington is suggesting that we have about a 5 maybe a 10 billion surplus i would like to go a step further than that i believe the surplus is much more significant than that i believe that we will run a surplus in fiscal year 1998 in excess of 25 billion i think it is worth talking about where we are from a budgetary point of view where we are going to and especially how social security fits into this overall picture because i have just spent days in wisconsin where we were in about eight or nine different cities and everyplace i went the social security issue came up so i would like to begin with where we are today and how we got here then i would like to look at what we can do in the near future and then i would like to look at the bigger picture of where we are going to i would like to start today by just taking a look at how fast and how rapidly the federal debt facing our nation has grown what i have in this chart is i have a picture of the growing debt facing the united states of america it can be seen that before 1980 the growth in this debt was pretty minimal as a matter of fact it is not quite a flat line but it did not grow very much between 1960 and 1980 but from 1980 forward the growth of the federal debt is very very substantial as a matter of fact when i left the private sector i had never been in office before when i left the private sector we were about here on this chart i realized that if this growth pattern of federal debt was not stopped that our children did not have a very bright future in this great country we live in so that is really the primary reason for leaving the private sector and coming in was to change this picture here today if we had said a while ago that this was going to flatten out and it was going to steady out here and actually start coming back down because we are running a surplus people would not have believed us as recently as 3 years ago when we looked at 1980 at the point at which the debt started growing dramatically in this country all the democrats blamed ronald reagan and all the republicans blamed the democrats for not being able to control spending again i would like to point out that the fact of matter is that we are here on this chart it is not a republican problem it is not a democrat problem it is an american problem the only way we can solve this problem is if we as americans step forward and put forth solutions to the problems that is what our last 3 years here in washington have been all about for members that have not seen how large this debt is i would like to point out the number we are 5 5 trillion in debt today translation if we divide the debt by the number of people in the united states of america the united states government has literally borrowed 20 400 on behalf of every man woman and child in the united states of america or for a family of five like mine the united states government has borrowed 102 000 the real kicker in this picture is down here on the bottom line this is real debt just like any other debt in the united states of america interest is being paid on this debt in fact for a family of five like mine i have got three kids and a wife at home for a family of five like mine we are paying 580 a month every month to do absolutely nothing but pay interest on the federal debt when we think about a family earning 40 000 to 50 000 a year from wisconsin or anywhere else in the great country that we live when we think about that family being required to send in 580 bucks a month an average family of five to do absolutely nothing but pay interest on the federal debt it is a pretty staggering number the amazing thing is people do not even realize they are paying all this money in one dollar cut of every six that the united states government does absolutely nothing but pay interest on this federal debt one dollar out of every six the united states government spends does nothing but pay interest on this debt when a family does something as simple as buy a pair of shoes for the kids and the family they go into that store and they buy the pair of shoes the store owner makes a profit on the sale of that pair of shoes to the kids and when the store owner makes a profit on the sale of that pair of shoes part of that profit gets sent to washington and of course what it does is nothing but pay interest on the federal debt i emphasize that one dollar out of every six that the united states government spends today goes to pay interest on the federal debt let me put that a different way so it makes a little more sense one dollar out of every six that the united states government collects in tax revenue from our working families all across america one dollar out of every six does absolutely nothing but pay interest on that federal debt i think the question begs asking how in the world did we get to this kind of a situation where we are 5 5 trillion in debt 20 400 for every man woman and child and to a point where a family of five in america pays 580 a month to do nothing but pay interest on the federal debt when we look back at this picture how we got here i have a picture here of the grammrudmanhollings act and most folks remember either the grammrudmanhollings of 1985 or maybe the one of 1987 or maybe they remember the 1990 budget deal when we look back in the past and how we got into this mess time after time the people that were in washington promised they were going to get to a balanced budget this blue line on the chart shows the grammrudmanhollings promise of 1987 but the one for 1985 is the same thing they had a blue line that said they were going to balance the budget 1987 is the one i have shown the 1990 budget deal they are all the same this red line shows you what actually happened to the deficit the american people got very cynical looking at this picture time and time and time and time again they had been promised a balanced budget and it was not delivered by washington d c and by our government so in 1994 the people looked at this picture and they said we are really fed up with these broken promises we need a change in washington d c 1993 was the year we had the biggest tax increase in american history it was the year they looked at this picture and said the only way we can solve this big deficit that remains out there in 19931994 it was still 350 billion of deficit that is the government was spending 350 billion more than it took in they looked at this picture and said we know how to solve that let us go to the american worker let us take more money out of their pocket that way we can maintain washington spending and while we maintain washington spending of course we will just collect more tax dollars from the american people that was the 1993 solution so it was the broken promises that led to 1993 that was the 1993 solution of raising taxes to solve this problem what we found out in 1993 what i knew all along because i was in the private sector working our tail end off when we were in the private sector we did not want government to take more money from the people to balance the budget that is not what we wanted what we wanted was government to control their own appetite for spending to reduce the size of washington and lead us to a balanced budget not by higher taxes but by less washington spending so in 1993 the people saw this picture they survived the tax increase 4 3 cents a gallon for gasoline it was not even spent to build roads it was put into social welfare programs social security tax increase marginal tax bracket increases the taxes went up on virtually every american citizen in that 1993 tax increase so what did the american people do this is america and a great country the people in this country had the opportunity to change that and they did in the 1994 elections in the 1994 elections they saw their way clear to put republicans in charge of the house of representatives and the senate for the first time in a long long time 40 years to be exact now we are 3 years into this changed group of people in charge of washington or our government i think the american people ought to be asking the question is there really any difference or are these people the same and are they breaking their promises like before i would like to answer that question when we got here in 1995 we laid out a plan again to balance the budget we said we were going to get there by the year 2002 i have to be honest with my colleagues what the people said they yawned and they said yes sure we will believe it when we see it the time has come to believe it we not only got the job done by 2002 as promised we have actually hit our first balanced budget since 1969 4 years ahead of schedule we not only got the job done i think it is very important in the picture form to see that the red line is now below the blue line that is we are outperforming what we said we would do as opposed to what happened before we got here it is a very very different picture in washington d c let me emphasize this once more for the first time since 1969 for the last 12 months running the united states government spent less money than they had in their checkbook this is a monumental accomplishment and it has been done in 3 short years well ahead of schedule of what was initially promised in 1995 when we got here an interesting thing happens when i am out in wisconsin at a town hall meeting talking to our constituents about this what happens is they go hey marx the economy is so strong you politicians are taking credit and you couldnt have messed it up if you tried the facts are the economy is very strong lots of extra revenue is coming into the united states government because hardworking american families are busting their tail ends and being successful out there in the private sector and of course the more income that they earn for their family they send extra tax revenue to washington that is true there is no question about it but that is not the end of the story because between 1969 and today there have been other time periods in this government where the economy was strong and extra revenue came in and every time in the past when washington got their hands on more revenue they figured out exactly what to do they spent it and that is the difference i brought a picture here to help see that a little easier and clearer in the past every time the economy got strong and extra revenues started coming in in the past every time that happened washington just spent more money so that we still did not balance the budget that is why the budget has not been balanced since 1969 this government was different the people that came here and were put in charge in 1995 were different newt gingrich john kasich some of the others that were here deserve a lot of credit for this picture bob livingston to mention another name before we got here growth in spending and this red column shows you how fast spending was going up before we got here in 1995 in the face of this very strong economy with extra revenue coming in the spending growth rate was reduced to 3 2 percent in our first 3 years so you see in the face of this strong economy sending extra revenue to washington instead of increasing the growth rate of spending this government saw fit to decrease the growth rate of spending it is a combination of the strong economy coupled with the reduced growth rate of washington spending that has put us in the position where we have actually balanced the budgetfor the first time in 30 years and we have done its 4 years ahead of schedule it is this distance from here to here that has put us in this wonderful position where the budget is in fact balanced for the first time in 30 years and a tax cut has been provided forthe first time in 16 years and i would just mention that a lot of folks say well we should not want to be cutting taxes until we get the debt paid off we should not be cutting taxes but then they put in a because i want to point out that the tax cut came about because instead of this blue column being way up here the spending growth rate being the same as it was before we got here by bringing that growth rate down to here it provided money available to reduce taxes on working families all across america and does a tax cut matter sometimes i get out there and people start complaining that the tax code is so complicated they do not even understand the tax cut let me just walk through a couple of things that are very real to the folks in my district and to the folks all across america let me start with the 400 per child and remember when we talk about this 400 per child it is less washington as seen in this picture this distance from where this red column was down to here is less washington so these families can keep more of their own money in their own home a family with three kids three kids under the age of 17 from wisconsin earning 50 000 a year in that family sounds like a lot of money well 50 000 a year and three kids is not a lot of money it goes very fast that family under the tax cut package that was passed last year will keep 1 200 more in their own home instead of sending it out to washington twelve hundred dollars is 400 per child more in the home instead of being sent to washington i always ask the question out there too and i show this kind of chart and i say look we could have done more here in washington we could have spent more money and kept this blue column up here even with the red column so the spending growing was the same as it was before we got here we could have done more in washington we chose instead to let families keep more of their own money then i ask if we had spent more in washington instead of doing the tax cut package for the families 550 000 in wisconsin alone get to keep more of their own money if we spent more in washington would we do a better job in washington of spending those families money than the families would themselves there is not a single person anywhere we have seen so far that would be willing to stand up and say the united states government in washington can do a better job spending those families money than the families can i will give another example of a family from wisconsin we had at a town hall meeting they have one in college a freshman in college and they have two kids under the age of 17 still at home for that family under the tax cut package and they are a middleincome family they did not tell me exactly but between 40 000 and 60 000 a year that family with three kids at home one in college a freshman and two kids under the age of 17 still at home when they get a 400 credit on the bottom line for each of the kids still at home that is 800 for the two kids and they get a 1 500 assist for the college tuition because in a middleincome family in america today sending a child off to college is very very expensive so the tax cut package contained a provision that if a family hasa child that is a freshman or sophomore in college they can subtract 1 500 off of what they would have sent to washington and keep it in their own home to help pay that college tuition so for this family of five that we are talking about two kids at home under the age of 17 and a freshman in college this family of five is going to keep 2 300 more in their home this year rather than send it to washington and again when we ask a family like this do they really think washington could have spent that money better than they can do they think washington could make better decisions on how to spend that money or do they think they can make those decisions themselves we have not found anybody in wisconsin that is willing to stand up and say send the money to washington we do not think we pay enough taxes and washington knows best how to spend it better than we do that just does not make sense in wisconsin and i do not believe it does anywhere in this country so i am happy to be here to talk about the things we have accomplished when we look to the past and see the broken promises of grammrudmanhollings promises repeatedly of a balanced budget that did not occur and then we look to the past where they raised taxes to try to solve this problem like in 1993 and then we compare that to the present where for the first time in 30 years we are actually spending less money than we have in our checkbook this is really great news the first time in 16 years taxes are coming down capital gains we did not mention before but for those people investing in stocks and bonds and mutual funds all over america and by the way i hope they make a profit because that is what investment is all about it is not evil and rotten to invest in a stock or a bond or a mutual fund and make a profit that is not bad that is good and when they make the profit the capital gains tax rate has been reduced from 28 down to 20 and if they are in the lower income bracket the rate has been reduced from 15 down to 10 so this idea of looking into the past and seeing the broken promises and the higher taxes and understanding something different is going on in washington today i think that is a very important idea as we look at the changes that have occurred out heresince 1995 so we have what is called a balanced budget we have taxes coming down i think we have to ask ourselves what next and i think to answer that question we need to describe and this is not going to be quite as positive from here on out i think we need to keep it in perspective this is very positive thus far and actually balancing the budget 4 years ahead of schedule by washington definition that is good and the definition they are using here in washington is the same as it was all the way back to 1969 but we still have some problems and as we look to the future we will have to address those problems to explain this i want to start by defining exactly what is meant by a balanced budget in washington d c let me preface this by saying i am a home builder and we had a home building company and we had employees working with us in that company and my definition of a balanced budget in my home building company would be very different than washingtons definition of a balanced budget but having said that let me define what washington calls a balanced budget washington says their budget is balanced when the dollars collected in taxes equal the dollars sent out in checks so if we look at all the dollars coming into washington the dollars in equals the dollars out that is washington or the governments definition of a balanced budget now on the surface that makes a pretty good amount of sense but i want to get beneath the surface and look at what isactually going on when we talk about this balanced budget and let this not take any credit away from reaching this point after 3 short years but let us recognize we still have a very serious problem facing our country the reason it is important to understand that is because social security plays into this picture dramatically in the social security system which is part of those dollars in and it is part of those dollars out what is going on in social security today is the social security system is collecting 480 billion out of the paychecks of workers all across america so when we look at our pay stubs and see there has been money taken out for social security if we add up all the money coming in for social security it is 480 billion if we look at the money being paid back outto senior citizens in benefits so we have 480 coming in the amount going back out to senior citizens in benefits is 382 billion the difference the surplus is 98 billion if we are looking at just the social security system and again this is very important it is pretty easy to understand if this was our checkbook at home and we are sitting down to do our bills and we had 480 in our checkbook and we wrote out a check for 382 we would in fact have 98 left in our checkbook that is social security today it is collecting 480 billion paying 382 out and there is 98 billion left now just as many people out there in america might be saving this 98 or 98 billion in the case of the social security trust fund for when they reach retirement so that when they do not have enough money coming in they can go to that account that they have been building and saving over a period of time and get money out in order to still pay their bills that is how american families do this all across our country social security is supposed to work the same way we know in the not too distant future that when the baby boom generation gets to retirement this number of dollars coming in as compared to the number of dollars going out is going to turn around and the dollars coming in is not going to be enough to pay the dollars going out that is when the problem hits in social security now in washington and in many government agencies they have misled our seniors into believing this does not happen until the year 2029 that is absolutely not true the amount of dollars coming in versus the number of dollars going out turns around in the year 2012 and perhaps sooner so what we are really saying here is that the shortfall occurs in social security in the year 2012 now the reason they talk about 2029 as opposed to 2012 is they assume between 2012 and 2029 that they can get their hands on this money that is supposed to be in the savings account just like in our families when we run short we go to the savings account get the money and put it into our checkbook and make good on our checks so once more through this today there is 480 coming in there is 382 going out there is 98 supposed t6 go into a savings account between now and 2012 these two numbers turn around and there is not enough money coming in too much going out and we have to be able to get our hands on that money in the savings account now i find when i am out in my district and i ask the next question with 98 billion extra coming into social security what do you suppose the united states government does with that 98 billion i find that the people in my district generally say they spend it and the people in my district are absolutely correct the 98 billion that has been taken in for social security goes into think of this as the big government checkbook or the general fund they then spend all the money out of the general fund and at the end of the year we have actually been running deficits since 1969 so after that 98 billion comes in and they write all the checks out of the general fund there is no money left to put down here in the social security trust fund so what they do is put an iou in the social security trust fund instead now it is important to understand that when washington says they are balancing the budget what they mean is that this circle right here is balanced they mean that after the 98 billion has been put into the checkbook and then all the checks have been written out that the remaining balance is zero that is a balanced budget in washington the problem with that is there is still no money being put into the social security trust fund now in my business in the home building business if this would have been the pension fund we absolutely could not have gotten away with this it would have been illegal and we would have been arrested for doing this but in washington that is the way this program is set up i want to be specific on this and please do not shoot the messenger we are trying to solve this problem in some groups i am with in wisconsin i almost feel like i am going to get shot when i tell them about what is going on it is important to understand that what is going on down here is an iou it is a nonnegotiable nonmarketable treasury bond the significance of nonnegotiablenonmarketable is that when those two numbers that we just had up here turn around and there is not enough money coming in for social security we cannot take what is in this account and sell it and get the money we need or we cannot go to our savings account and get the money out now in this town it is great people run around and they say those ious are backed by the full faith and credit of the united states government so why should i question the value of those ious in the social security trust fund i always ask the next question they are backed by the full faith and credit of the united states government so when we need the money in 2012 or sooner where is the united states government going to get that money from to make good on those ious that is when the lights begin to dawn and they see how serious the problem is because when we need that money in 2012 and perhaps sooner and the united states government has to make good on those ious there is only a very limited number of things that can happen one is they could raise taxes on our children and our grandchildren i do not find that very inviting i think the tax rate is too high as it stars the second thing they could do is put off the date when those ious come due and of course that could be done by changing benefits to our senior citizens i do not find that very desirable so if we do not raise taxes and we do not put off the date the ious come due what is the other option the other option really is to go into the private sector and start borrowing money out and when we start talking about that picture we are right back to this chart i started with i do not know of any american citizen that is going to suggest that the right solution to the social security problem is to recreate this climbing debt chart that has been given to us over the last 15 to 20 years i do not know of any american citizen that would contend that this is the right thing to do as we look to the future of this great nation so the question should be asked what are we doing about it in our office we have introduced a piece of legislation it is called the social security preservation act it is bill number h r 857 and this may seem pretty obvious to most people in america i notice when i am in wisconsin it seems to be an obvious solution we simply take that 98 billion that is coming in extra for social security and we put it immediately into the social security trust fund we do that by buying treasury bonds the same kind of thing that any senior citizen could buy at any bank in the united states of america the advantage of doing it this way number one we start reporting honestly what is going on in the budget process because the money now does not get into the big government checkbook or the general fund and number two when those numbers turn around and there is not enough money coming in and we have to make good on those ious we will now have an asset in this trust fund much like a savings account that could simply be sold to generate the money we need to make good on the social security payments to seniors so again the solution to this problem apd i am happy to say there are democrats and republicans both supporting this bill it is h r 857 it is called the social security preservation act i would encourage my colleagues that have not joined with us yet to join us on this bill as soon as possible so that we get the support necessary to bring this bill to the floor of the house if this bill is passed social security becomes solvent for our senior citizens all the way to the year 2029 now i might say after 2029 there is still a problem but at least between now and 2029 social security would once again be solvent for our senior citizens as we look at this picture then i think it is reasonable to ask we have got this balanced budget at least on balance by the definition that has been used v the government over the last 30 years where are we at and where are we going as a nation in the future i think the first thing we need to recognize and do to solve the social security problem is our bill h r 857 the social security preservation act but there are other problems still facing our country one of the problems as i see it is taxes are too high i have been having fun with this in wisconsin i ask the question repeatedly is there anyone in the room who thinks taxes are too low to their credit no one has raised their hand and said yes i think taxes are too low raise taxes please so i think when we look at the problems that are still facing us as a nation taxes are too high the social security trust fund needs to be restored and we still have that 5 5 trillion debt hanging out there over our heads to solve these problems we have introduced a second piece of legislation it is called the national debt repayment act as it relates to social security let us remember that even if we start putting away the cash from this year we still have this 700 billion that is supposed to be in this counted already that is ious so when we start talking about this 5 5 trillion debt part of it is that money that has been taken out of social security over the last 15 to 20 years in the national debt repayment act what we do is look at any surpluses coming into the united states government we allocate twothirds of those surpluses to debt repayment specifically restoring the social security trust fund so twothirds of it goes to debt repayment including social security and prioritizing social security the other onethird is dedicated to reducing taxes on working families all across america we are here in the present now we have our first balanced budget in nearly 30 years as we look down the road and think about these problems that are still staring us in the face a 5 5 trillion debt the social security trust fund taxes are too high it seems to me to make sense that what we do is dedicate twothirds of our surpluses to debt repayment prioritizing social security so we pay off the social security notes that is 700 billion that belongs there and we dedicate the other onethird to the tax rate le t me just say on the tax rate because i think this is very important today we have a 37 percent tax burden on our working families if you take all the taxes paid in in this country take the state taxes the property taxes the local taxes the sales taxes and the government taxes washington government taxes the tax burden on our families today is 37 percent back in 1955 it was about 25 percent the outcome of that is seen all through our society because the tax rates are so much higher than they used to be we find that our families that would like to make decisions to allow one parent to stay at home or one of the spouses to stay at home and raise the children are forced into the workplace because the tax rate is so high and they wind up actually working just to pay more taxes i understand that in a lot of families both spouses want to work for whatever reason they may want to work because they want a better lifestyle and that is fine but what is wrong with that picture is that when they start doing it simply so they can pay the extra tax burden so the government can get bigger and bigger and bigger that is what is wrong with the picture as we look ahead to the future the concept of reducing the tax burden as i know speaker gingrich has called for from the 37 percent back to a 25 percent i would like to again lay this out as part of our vision for the future as we look forward in this country would it not be great if we could get to a point where the tax burden on families was again reduced to 25 percent or maybe even lower would it not be great if we could have a onethird reduction in the tax burden what we are really saying here is that in the future the government might do less and we might leave more money in the pockets of people and then if the people still want some of those extra services they canmake the decision that with the extramoney in their pocket they go out and buy it but the concept is that government is less involved in the lives of the american people and the people get to keep more of the money that they have earned i might add that that is just one of the problems that we face here in washington it seems to me sometimes we forget that the money we are talking about out here it is not our money here in washington that money belongs to the hardworking americans who have earned that money and it ought to be treated in that way and with that respect i would like to just address a little bit more on the tax cut package that has already been passed i know i am kind of jumping out of this vision for the future and back into the present but i would like to do this because i find in wisconsin that when i talk with folks a lot of them do not understand that a tax bill has been passed i would just like to run through just a few of the provisions that are in this tax cut package because folks generally do not understand that this bill is already passed what happens i find when i am there is they kind of look at me almost as a politician and that scares me because i am a home builder and a math teacher and not a politician they start looking like you are making us these promises but are you really going to do any of this the fact is the tax cut package is passed into law it is done it is on the books and it should be reflected in your current taxable income let me just start with the 400 per child tax credit i described this briefly before starting this year for every child under the age of 17 with certain income limits for moderateincome americans for every child under the age of 17 when you figure out your taxes next year and you get down to the bottom line how much you would have sent to the united states government you subtract 400 off the bottom line if you have got a college student a freshman or a sophomore again you figure out how much you would have sent to washington but if that freshman or sophomore has spent more than 2 000 on room board books and tuition you subtract 1 500 off the bottom line for juniors seniors grad students et cetera you subtract 1 000 or up to 1 000 off the bottom line for homeowners in america and this is a very dramatic change in the tax code if you have lived in your house for 2 years or more and you sell it there are no federal taxes due when we think about our senior citizens and the benefit to our senior citizens of this tax code change it is very very dramatic many seniors took the old onetime 55 exclusion sold the bigger home that they raised their children in bought a smaller home and are now ready for whatever reason to go to some sort of different home either a nursing home or some sort of skilled care facility t hey are now selling this home and they took that onetime exclusion back when they were 55 and there would be a gain at least i hope there is a gain on the house they have owned in the interim period there are no longer any federal taxes due on the sale of that home medicare another dramatic change under the tax code and the revisions that were written last year for senior citizens when i took office in 1995 medicare was headed to bankruptcy the fix for medicare in the past was always to go out to the american people and raise taxes our government in their wisdom was treating senior citizens in exactly the wrong way in solving the problem of medicare by simply throwing more money at it what we needed to do is what has been done in the last 3 years sit down look at the situation and see if there was not maybe a better way to do the same thing let me give one example of how this improvement took place diabetes is a major problem for seniors what the government did in their wisdom is they wafted until some sort of a complication developed in diabetes they would not pay for screening what they did is waited until something dramatic happened to a senior whether it was a heart problem or an amputation or eye problems or any of the other negative outcomes from diabetes many of these things were treatable if they were caught earlier what the government was doing in medicare was saying we are not going to pay for screening diabetes that is destroying your life but if you get good and sick and you need a good and expensive procedure then we will help you pay for it through medicare it is not only the right thing to do for the health and the wellbeing of our senior citizens to do the advanced screening it is also much more cost effective to find the problem early and treat it early so the senior citizen can live a healthier life of course that eliminates the high cost burden on the medicare system so instead of just throwing more money at medicare and leaving the system the way it was we looked at what was going on and looked for better ways to spend the same money that was being spent in the diabetes situation alone they are saying as much as 14 billion a year will be saved and again let us not transform this into medicare cuts by providing our seniors with the opportunity to live a healthier life by this advanced screening for diabetes alone we are talking about a 14 billion a year change in the cost of medicare to the united states government that is not all though there are also things like screening for breast cancer colon cancer a wide variety of other preventive care was very similar to what i just described with diabetes that was changed in medicare rather than just looking at medicare and saying okay we are going to raise taxes on the people and throw more money at medicare we looked at how the same dollars could be spent in a better manner that is very very different than the people that were here in control in the past it is a very different model for solving solutions as we go forward the other dramatic change in medicare is in the past the united states government in their wisdom said we here in washington know what is best for all our senior citizens so we are going to develop this plan called medicare and our seniors get the plan like it or not what has happened in medicare is that now if our seniors do not like the governmentrun plan they have the opportunity to take the same money the government was spending on their behalf in the government plan and use it to purchase private insurance of their choosing we not only revise the plan to make it much more effective providing preventive care to seniors we also put what type of insurance and what type of medical coverage they would like back in their hands where it belongs i think what it says is really a statement of respect that we have for the senior citizens in the united states many of these senior citizens are the same people that fought in world war ii that preserved this country and got it to where it is today and those people deserve to be treated with that respect while i am on medicare and it does not directly relate to the changes of last year there are a lot of nasty rumors going on out there about what has happened in medicare that if a citizen for example would like a second mammogram in a year and medicare says you only can have one that is covered but a citizen would like a second one there is a lot of rumors going around out there that if a citizen wants to buy additional coverage for some procedure that is not covered under medicare that somehow if the doctor provides that coverage and charges the patient that the doctor is kicked out of the medicare program for 2 years let me just say definitively that that is absolutely not true there are a lot of different groups putting this information out it is absolutely not true let me give this in a specific example let us just say someone had a mammogram and for whatever reason 3 months later they decided they would like a second one medicare says i am not going to cover the second mammogram and the patient says well i want it done anyway and i will pay the doctor for doing it and the doctor says okay i will do it that is perfectly legal it is permitted there are no repercussions back against the doctor the doctor makes that decision to do it if the patient decides they would like to pay for it outside of medicare so specifically on things that are not covered under the medicare program if a doctor provides those services there are absolutely no ramifications back against the doctor i just mention that as it relates to medicare because we have heard so many different stories when i have been out there in public so i am going back now to the tax code change and just a few other details in it one other one that is very important to me i had mentioned capital gains before but i did not mention the adoption tax credit i think this really says something about where we are going as a nation i have got a lot of charts and graphs here and they talk about numbers and they are showing lines and different things that happened but that is not really what this government is about this government is about people it is about values it is about where we are going as a nation what kind of a country we are going to have it is about how much government is going to be involved i think when we look at that we need to understand that the government does in fact have a heart and that we understand that there are tough situations out there in a lot of places in this country we also should understand that when we changed this tax code we looked at the possibility of adoptions in this country what we found is that to have an adoption in america it costs roughly 10 000 so if we have got a middleincome family say they are earning 40 000 or 50 000 a year and for whatever reason that family finds out they cannot have their own children 10 000 might have been insurmountable in terms of adopting a child so what we did in the tax code is we changed the tax code there is now a 5 000 tax credit to assist that middleincome family with the process of adoption and paying the bills that are involved in the adoption so this tax code change it is not all about numbers and it is not all about these charts i have here there is a large degree of feeling involved in these and we recognize that things like the 400 per child leaving that money in the familys home as opposed to having it out here in washington it is not just about numbers it is about people it is about the impact that this money in the family will have on these families another example on the 400 per child i was in with a group of people who had many of their children enrolled in parochial schools i talked to them about the potential of government providing them some sort of tax assistance for parochial schools and right away they reacted no no no no we do not want any government support for our school because they are afraid with government support come government rules and regulations that may not match up with what our parochial schools are teaching my own kids included that go to a parochial school so i explained to them how the 400perchild tax credit allowed them to make the decision on what they were going to use their own 400 for if they choose to use that 400 to help pay tuition at a parochial school well so be it that is money that would have been sent to washington that is now in their home and they can then choose to make the decision to send their kids to a parochial school if they so desire but it is not washington telling them what to do with the money and it is not washington telling their parochial school what to teach in their school but rather it is now the parents in their own home making the decision as to how to spend their own money i would like to wrap up my time here on the floor today with kind of just a brief summary of some of the things we have talked about we have looked at the past and we have looked at how in the past we had a series of broken promises to balance the budget before 1994 we had grammrudmanhollings the budget deal of 1990 we looked at how in 1993 they reached the conclusion on how to solve this problem rather than control washington spending the conclusion was to reach into the pockets of american citizens i know for all the people out there it was not the first time i know it was part of the 1990 deal i know it was part of the 1993 deal but i also know that every timethey reached in the pockets and took more money out here to washington all it did was allow them to spend more out here in washington and that is not what the people wanted that path of broken promises of the balanced budget and the path of higher taxes that is over it ended in 1994 when the american people stepped up to the plate and said enough is enough it is going to stop they put a new group in charge out here in washington we are now 3 years into that new group the new group has brought us a balanced budget not in 2002 as promised but 4 years ahead of schedule the announcement today great news cbo from the organization that watches budgeting out here we are in fact running a surplus for fiscal year 1998 the first time since 1969 we are going to have a budget surplus great news three years into this thing we have done it by controlling the growth of washington spending we have been effective enough at slowing the growth rate of washington spending that we have not only gotten to a balanced budget 4 years ahead of schedule we have been able to provide the american people with a tax cut when i say we provide shoot it is the american people that earn that money all we are doing out here in washington is saying keep more of your own money it is yours to start with just do not send it out here to washington the present the present has a balanced budget for the first time since 1969 the present the present is lower taxes for the first time in 16 years the present the present is a restored medicare and done the right way with feeling and understanding for our senior citizens the future as we look forward to this we have 3 major problems remaining the first is we still have a 5 5 trillion debt staring us in the face the second is the social security money that needs to be put aside for social security and the third is taxes are still too high so as we look down the road to the future in this great nation the national debt repayment act which we have introduced in our office bill number h r 2191 takes twothirds of any surpluses that develop and it uses it to pay off the debt prioritizing repayment to the social security trust fund for our senior citizens the good news under this bill is that by the year 2026 and maybe sooner we will have repaid the entire federal debt that will restore the social security trust fund for our senior citizens and it will allow us as a generation to pass this country on to our children debtfree i can think of no higher goal that we might have in this government today than to work to a point where we repay the federal debt so our children can inherit a nation that is absolutely debtfree in doing so we also restore the social security trust fundfor our seniors the other onethird of the surpluses that are developing let us use those to lower taxes and let us set our vision for the future that we get the tax rate from 37 back to 25 percent would it not be great if onethird of all taxes paid by all americans at every level of government was reduced and those american citizens could keep it in their own pocket to decide what they would like to do with it whether it be to help their children whether it be to put their kids through college whether it be to provide their kids with a private school if that is what they would like to do if they in their own wisdom think that is better for their children but the bottom line is to leave that money in the hands of the people that earned it in the first place would that not be a great vision for america paid off debts so our children get a debtfree nation a restored social security trust fund for our senior citizens and lower taxes a onethird reduction in the overall tax rate all across america lest anybody think we cannot do it i just remind the american people of what was said in 1995 when we were first elected they said you cannot balance the budget and lower tax here we are three years into it four years ahead of schedule with the budget balanced taxes coming down and medicare restored it can be done if it is the will of the people and if the people get actively involved in making sure that this government does what they want this government to do"], [0.0001490277936682105, 0.0001490277936682105, 0, "for purposes of debate only i yield the customary

[0.00023925397545099258, 0.00023925397545099258, 0, "i rise tonight to talk about a lot of the issues that are facing the country today and what we are hearing about as it relates to the presidents budget plan i rise in particular to talk about an issue that i think many of our senior citizens many of our folks in their 50s and 40s and many of our young people are also concerned about and that is social security my son who mowed lawns last summer and earned a reasonable amount of money doing it like 1 500 because he did a lot of them talked to me about whether or not he should pay any taxes on it and of course for a young person in their teenage years who mowed lawns last summer and earned some money there is no federal taxes due but then i said to him you still have got to file matt you have still got to file a tax return and my 15yearold son who is going to file his tax return has to pay into the social security trust fund as a matter of fact he found that he paid over about 15 percent of all of his earnings into the social security trust fund because he would be treated as a selfemployed person so when we talk about the social security issue it is certainly very important to our young people to understand very clearly that they are putting this money away for retirement but in fact it does not seem to affect them because they do not believe social security is going to be there for them and they are certainly at age 15 are not very interested in thinking ahead to retirement they are more interested buying a car and their college education than they are in thinking ahead to retirement so when we think about this social security issue i start with the younger group to understand that it does have an impact on them when we get to the folks in their 30s and 40s they are putting this money away it is being taken out of their paychecks but instead of being put away in a fund for them it goes into the social security trust fund i would like to spend a little time tonight talking about how the united states government handles this money that is being taken out of their paychecks and how that affects our senior citizens and the potential of social security actually being there for them when they reach the retirement age if i could ask one of our pages to bring that stand over i brought a couple of pictures with me for any of my colleagues that have seen these numbers before we took the time today to update the social security numbers so that it reflects what is actually going on in the social security system in 1998 this whole thing becomes relatively easy to understand as it relates to social security if we just take a look at how much money is actually coming in and how much is going out to our senior citizens in social security virtually every worker that has a paycheck has money taken out of their paycheck for social security altogether the united states government in 1998 will collect about 480 billion in social security money from the paychecks of workers in america the social security system will write out checks to our senior citizens of 382 billion this is pretty straightforward they are collecting 480 billion and they are paying 382 billion out to our senior citizens that leaves a 98 billion surplus that is to say they are collecting 98 billion more than they are paying back out to our senior citizens in benefits that money is supposd to be put away it is supposed to be put into a savings account so that when they are these two numbers turn around the babyboom generation is clearly headed toward retirement and eventually we reach a point where there is not enough money in and too much money being written out in checks to our senior citizens well this money that is supposed to be put away in a savings account today is not actually happening today i would like to talk about this and the reference of what the president referred to in his budget address and something tl h many of us in this congress feel very strongly about that 98 billion that came in goes directly into the big government checkbook the general fund now we spend all the money out of the general fund and when we are all done spending that money there is not enough money left to put the 98 billion down in the social security trust fund so instead what our government does is it makes an accounting entry and simply puts an iou down here in the social security trust fund the technical name for this is a nonnegotiable treasury bond but the bottom line is that 98 billion of surplus goes straight into the big government checkbook they spend all the money out of the biggovernment checkbook and there is nothing left to put in the social security trust fund so they simply make an accounting entry it is called a nonnegotiable treasury bond that goes down here it is important to understand what nonnegotiable treasury bond means nonnegotiable treasury bonds means it cannot be sold so when we come back to this other picture and we take a look at what happens down the road a little ways when the babyboom generation gets here remember the revenues the amount of money that is coming in today is higher than the amount of money that is being paid out to our seniors in benefits so today it works the idea is that when those two numbers turn around there is not enough money coming in we are supposed to be able to go to this trust fund and get the money to make good on the social security payments the problem is this since that trust fund is full of ious or nonnegotiable nonmarketable something you cannot sell it is full of ious and since it is full of ious when the time comes that there is not enough money coming in and too much going out where is the money going to come from and at that point in time we reach the point where we either have to raise taxes on workers or we have to reduce benefits to our senior citizens and neither one of those are very desirable now what has happened in the budget plan we heard the president say that he was going to put social security first in our consideration and when we listened to the rest of the state of the union address social security first and then we heard about a whole series of new spending programs now i think it is important to understand that when we say we are going to put social security first and then we describe a whole raft of new spending programs that what is actually happening is social security is not actually being put first but someplace else down the list so let us look at what happened inthe state of the union address and in the budget that the president presented this week the extra social security money that 98 billion it is stillgoing in the government checkbook we are still spending virtually all of the money out of that big government checkbook but the president said okay we are going to run a surplus for the first time and that is good we should not downgrade this or say this is all bad the good news is that this is the first time since 1969 that even with the social security money they got to a point where they balanced the budget according to washington definition here is what the president proposed he proposed to keep putting the 98 billion into the big government fund when we are all done spending all the money that we spend for a year out of the big government checkbook whatever is left over we will put aside for social security today i sat in the committee on the budget and i had a chance to listen to mr raines describe exactly what was going to happen i think it is very very important that my colleagues understand the 98 billion still goes into the big government checkbook the money gets spent out of the big government checkbook the only things we are talking about is that small surplus or 9 billion that is the leftover amount out of this checkbook and it does not even get put into the social security trust fund what they actually are going to do is pay down debt with that money now paying down debt is good getting to a balanced budget is good spending less money than we have in our checkbook that is good but the idea that the only thing we are going to do for social security is put the leftovers down there that is not okay and that is the reason i am here tonight talking about the social security issue about 2 years ago we wrote in my office a bill called the social security preservation act and i am happy to say many people on both sides of the aisle are now cosponsors on the social security preservation act here is what it does the social security preservation act simply takes that 98 billion and directs it straight down here into the social security trust fund what we want to do is cut off that cash flow into the big government checkbook so that social security in fact is treated first now what this would do is put all 98 billion down into the trust fund this year and that would mean that instead of reporting a 9 billion surplus we would instead be reporting approximately an 87 billion deficit i do not want to take anything away from the people that have done a lot of hard work good hard work out in this city to get us to a balanced budget we need to understand in washington when they say balanced budget what they mean is the dollars coming into the federal government is equal to the dollars going back out from the federal government by that definition their budget was balanced here for the first time since 1969 and again that is good that is important and it is good but what we really need to do is start putting this money right straight down here in the social security trust fund so we honestly reflect the situation that exists out here i come from the private sector before 1995 i never held a public office in the private sector when we ran a business if we would have taken the pension money put it in our general account and spent all the money out of the general account and put an iou in the trust fund the way social security is working today they would have arrested us in the private sector it would be absolutely illegal to do the same thing in the private sector that we do with social security today so i am here tonight to call on my colleagues to join us in the social security preservation act i do not consider it an einstein kind of bill it is pretty common sense pretty straightforward it simply says the extra money coming in for social security ought to be put down here in the social security trust fund it is bill h r 857 and i am asking tonight that my colleagues join me in this bill we have been working at this for 3 years out of my office and i am happy to say it has now come to the fore front let us not accept anything less than truly putting social security first as we look at the budget this year there is no good reason at this point in time that we cannot be putting true money real dollars down here in the social security trust fund so that our senior citizens are once again safe i should add in this conversation this is not only about preserving social security for our senior citizens this is about people in their 40s and 50s who are expecting to get social security when they retire and equally important it is about those same people in their 30s and 40s and 50s that if this is not done and we reach a point where there is not enough money coming in for social security to pay the benefits that choice between cutting social security benefits for our senior citizens or raising taxes for workers is going to be a very tough choice and it is something that we need to head off right now by simply doing what the social security system was set up to do in the first place i think it is time that h r 857 our social security preservation act gets brought to the floor of the house of representatives and i think it is time that we have enough cosponsors of this bill we have got 85 or 90 and again i want to emphasize that there are both republicans and democrats on this bill this isnot a partisan issue this is an issue about what is right for the seniors of this country what is right for the workers of this country and what is right as we look forward into the future as it relates to social security having said this i think it is important that we look at where we are at in this budget before we hear lots of new proposals for spending if i could ask to bring those other charts and just take a little look back on where we have been and a little look forward of where we are going to and again for any of my colleagues who have seen parts of this presentation before we have updated these charts i always show the first one which we have not changed that is the growing debt facing our country what this shows is the growth in debt from 1960 all the way up to where we are today we will notice the debt is still rising today even though in washington we are hearing that the budget is balanced most people would think that when the budget is balanced the debt stops growing but again i talk about the social security issue remember that even when the budget is balanced that is to say the dollars coming into washington are equal to the dollars going out of washington and again remember that is the first time in nearly 30 years that has happened that is good but even when we get to that point there is still a debt to the social security trust fund that is why we see that even though we are hearing about a balanced budget the debt is still rising i think it is also important to understand just how big this debt is for anybody that has seen parts of this presentation before a week ago i brought the numbers out here that were approximately a year and a half old and it was 5 3 trillion the reality is the debt the united states government debt has now grown to 5 5 trillion let me put that another way the united states government has spent 5 5 trillion on behalf of the american people more than what they collected in taxes that is an awful big number so let me translate that into english if we divide that debt by the number of people in the united states of america the debt is now 20 400 for every man woman and child in the united states of america or for a family of five like mine the debt is now 102 000 the kicker of this whole thing is really the bottom line here we see a lot of people say so what if we are in debt but the so what part is that we are paying interest on that debt and a family of five like mine or any group of five in america they are actually paying 580 a month every month to pay nothing but the federal interest on that debt we need to put this in perspective of where we are at today and what is really going on in this country as we listen to budget discussions we saw the president on tv recently where he put that big zero in there the budget is balanced we need to not forget that this debt is still out there and that our families are paying 580 a month every month to pay nothing but interest on the debt and for any of my colleagues who think their families are not paying that much every month to pay interest on the debt just think about walking in the store and buying a pair of shoes for your kids the store owner makes a small profit when you buy that pair of shoes and of course part of that profit gets sent out here to washington d c 1945 as a matter of fact 1 out of every 6 that the united states government collects from taxpayers gets spent on nothing other than interest on this federal debt the beauty is we are going forward and they start talking about running surpluses and as we eventually start running true surpluses surpluses that allow for the social security money to be set aside if we start running true surpluses we can start paying this debt down a second bill i would like to mention tonight is called the national debt repayment act what the national debt repayment act is is really the second part of restoring social security it is much like a home mortgage payment i come from the home building business before i was elected to office so it is kind of like the same thing we used to do with folks when they moved into a house this debt is much like a home mortgage for many people what we suggested we do in the national debt repayment act is simply set up a home mortgagetype repayment plan and pay the debt off under our plan under the national debt repayment act the entire federal debt would be paid off by the year 2026 and maybe sooner it could go faster we use twothirds of any surpluses to go to debt repayment we dedicate the other onethird to the other problem that i think is very real in this country and that is taxes are too high so twothirds of any surpluses that materialize go to debt repayment i have dedicated much 6f this tonight to social security let me talk about how this affects the social security system the theft of that social security trust fund money the taking of that money and spending it on other government programs that has been going on since 1983 there is about 600 billion that is supposed to be in the social security kitty today that is not there the first thing we need to do for social security is what i described earlier the social security preservation act we need to stop taking the money out this year 9 billion we need to put that money into the social security trust fund but that doesnt solve the problem of that 600 billion that has been taken since 1983 so the second thing we need to do is recognize that 600 billion is part of this 5 5 trillion now as we repay this debt our national debt repayment act would put the money back into the social security trust fund let me say that again because it is a little confusing because it is a little difficult to understand that this 5 5 trillion it represents a whole bunch of different things but one of the things that makes up this 5 5 trillion is the social security trust fund money the 600 billion that has been taken out since 1983 so under our national debt repayment act as we are paying down the federal debt we are also restoring the social security trust fund that bill again is called the national debt repayment act and what it does is dedicate twothirds of any surpluses to reducing the debt paying the debt back like a home mortgage repayment plan and the other onethird to another big problem in our country which is taxes are too high on the american people so twothirds to debt repayment onethird to lowering taxes now as we start repaying this federal debt i think a couple other things happen first as the debt goes down the amount of interest we need to collect fromthe taxpayers goes down so as the debt goes down we should be able to provide tax relief to the workers out there the overall bill when we lookat the national debt repayment act it pays off the debt in its entirety by the year 2026 so we can give this nation to our children debtfree it restores the social security trust fund it puts the money back into social security that has been taken out and for the people in the work force today there will be no need to collect the additional tax money because we will not need the money to pay interest on the debt as we keep paying this thing down it is also significant to just take a look at some of the things that have changed from before to where we are at today this will probably make a little more sense rightside up than it does upside down i think it is important to take a glance at least briefly at this chart to understand how it is we got to where we are today i have heard a lot of discussions about who gets credit it is the democrats the president it is the democrats in the house it is the republicans in the house i think it is time as americans we recognize it really doesnt matter who gets credit the fact is we have reached for the first time in nearly 30 years a point where the united states government did not spend more money than they had in their checkbook we still got problems the social security trust fund is a huge problem it needs to be put first and it needs to be put truly first not first after we create a whole bunch of new spending programs i would like to show this chart because it helps people understand just exactly how we got to where we are today when i took office in 1995 we had just lived through the 1993 tax increase and more broken promises of a balanced budget than i care to think about you can start back to grammrudmanhollings act in 1985 or 1987 or the budget deal in 1990 or the 1993 deal where they raised taxes significantly the bottom line is the theory was that if we could take more money out of the pockets of the american people the people that were here in office they were going to take more money out of the pockets of the american people and somehow if they took enough money from the american people that would lead us to a balanced budget when we were elected in 1995 that changed that theory that raising taxes was going to balance the budget was thrown out as a matter of fact that 1993 tax increase is why a lot of us are here the american people did not want higher taxes and more washington spending they wanted a balanced budget by controlling the growth of washington spending they wanted less washington and more money in their own pockets they wanted less washington a balanced budget and lower taxes that is what they wanted that is why there was a changeover in 1995 in 1995 before we got here the spending growth rate in washington was 5 2 percent that is this red column that is how fast spending was going up each year on an average basis over the previous seven years since we have been here it is going up by 3 2 percent so the growth of washington spending has been dramatically slowed over the last three year period of time it is down by 40 percent the good news is the year we just completed it was not only below 3 2 but actually down to 2 6 percent it is the first time in a long time it has been actually under the rate of inflation let me say that again so it makes a little more sense the rate of growth of spending in washington was actually less than the rate of growth of inflation in our country so washington did actually shrink perhaps for the first time in a generation last year in real dollar terms now do not let anybody mistake me saying that that means washington is small enough washington still takes way too much money from the american people they spend too much money out here and there is all kinds of waste that should be eliminated so i am not trying to lead anybody to believe the job is done this job is not done we have a long ways to go are we on the right track slowing the growth of washington spending by 40 percent in two years getting us to a point where we actually have a balanced budget and spent less money than we have in our check book for the first time since 1969 that is all good stuff we need to keep this in perspective of the social security trust fund we need to understand we have a long ways to go we need to recognize the progress that has been made but at the same time we are recognizing that progress we need to recognize how far we still have to go there is one other topic i would like to briefly discuss today we talked about the past and how we had broken promises and how we had tax increases from 1993 we have talked about our new theory of less washington leading us to a balanced budget and more money in the pockets of the people i would like to talk specifically about that more money in the pockets of the people because last year for the first time taxes were cut for the american people i was somewhat shocked this weekend i was at a particular place in our district we had about 200 people there in our state we had about 200 people there not many people actually knew that the tax cut package had been passed into law and was available right now in january 1998 for virtually any taxpayer with a child under the age of 17 earning less than 110 000 a year right now today january 1998 if a child under the age of 17 is in your family you can fill out a new w4 form and start taking home 33 a month more right now this january it is a 400 per child tax credit now if you do not do anything you are still going to get the tax credit but you are not going to get it until 1999 by going in and filling out a new w4 form any parent or constituent of ours or my colleagues out there in america can literally start taking home 33 a month more right now the 33 a month is the 400 tax credit divided up amongst the 12 months all we have to do all that has to be done is a new w4 has to be filled out let me make that very clear if we have a family in our districts that has a child under the age of 17 and they go in and fill out a new w4 and then they look at their december paycheck and they compare it to their january paycheck their january paycheck should be 33 bigger than their december paycheck for a family with three kids that is 100 a month all a family has to do is simply go in and fill out a new w4 and a family with three kids under the age of 17 starts taking home 100 a months more immediately there is more to the tax cut package we put education as a top priority if you have a freshman or sophomore in college in virtually all cases they are eligible for a 1 500 tax credit again let me translate that because if the people do not do anything they are going to get the 1 500 dollars back at the end of the year april of 1999 but you can start getting that money back in your pocket right now the college students i know they have got college tuition bills to pay right now and in the fall of this year if a senior in high school is looking ahead to college that college bill comes due in fall of this year not in april of 1999 so what the parents need to do is go in and change the w4 forms if you are going to have a freshman or sophomore in college you start taking home 125 a month right now january 1998 there is no reason to wait there is another problem with not doing it if you do not fill out a new w4 form to take that extra money into their home right now today that means that washington is going to be getting 33 per month per child or 125 a month for a freshman or sophomore in college and that money is going to be coming out here to washington instead of the people keeping it in their own homes when washington sees this big pile of money that actually belongs out there in the homes of the american people when washington sees that big pile of money they are going to want to spend it so the problem with this waiting until 1999 to get the tax credit is that washington gets the peoples money in the interim and it is very difficult in this city when people see this money to get them to not spend it so it would be a tremendous help to all of the elected officials all of my colleagues here and myself in washington if the people would very simply keep their own money in their homes for juniors and seniors in college it is 20 percent of the first 5 000 cost up to 1 000 total if folks own their own home and i am going on with some of the other tax cut provisions that are included if folks own their own home and they sell it they have been there for two years or longer there is no longer any federal taxes due in the vast majority of the cases if someone has made an investment in stocks and bonds and again i spend a lot of time with people in wisconsin and as i ask people in wisconsin i ask rooms full of people how many own a stock or bond or mutual fund and virtually every hand in the room goes up we are in a day and an age where people have made investments into stocks and bonds and mutual funds i talk to them about the fact if they make a profit and i tell them i hope they make a profit i do not know of anybody who invests in stocks or bonds or mutual funds with the intent of losing money i hope they make a profit that means the economy is good that is what this is all about so when they make that profit instead of sending 28 cents out of every dollar to washington they now only send 20 cents because capital gains is reduced from 28 percent to 20 and if you earn less than 41 000 a year it was reduced from 15 percent down to 10 these are very significant changes then i talk to a lot of folks in the room where the kids are grown and gone and they are starting to think seriously about retirement i talk to them about the roth ira it is a new kind of ira where you can put 2 000 per person per year into this account and you do not get the tax break up front but all of the interest and earnings that accumulates on that 2 000 between whenever you put it in and retirement it accumulates absolutely taxfree and when you take it out there is no taxes due a monumental change in the tax code one other thing to mention in the tax code change there are a lot of middle income families in america today that for whatever reason to find out they cant have their own children and would like to adopt a child i think this is a very important very significant tax code change in america today it costs about 10 000 to get through the legal red tape to adopt a child so what we have done in the tax code is provided a 5 000 adoption tax credit so that if a middle income family finds themselves in a situation where they cannot have their own children and they would like to adopt a child that tax credit is now available to assist and to help in that particular situation i have talked about a lot of issues here tonight if i could close with where we started basically and that is the social security issue i think it is very very important as the people listen to the debate here in washington and my colleagues talk about social security and putting social security first i think it is very important that we remember social security is collecting this year alone 98 billion more than it is paying out our seniors in benefits that money is being spent on other government programs right now at this point the proposal is simply to give the leftovers to social security it does not have to be that way the social security preservation act would require that that 98 billion not ious real money gets put directly into the social security trust fund so social security would once again be safe and solvent for our senior citizens there is 600 billion that has been taken out of the social security trust fund and spent on other government programs between 1983 and today our national debt repayment act we do not have to ignore that money it is not gone we do not have to say we cannot pay that money back that 600 billion that has been taken out of the social security trust fund that is all part of the national debt the 5 5 trillion all we have to do is pass the national debt repayment act and as we repay that federal debt we find ourselves in a position where part of that debt is the social security trust fund so the money gets back into the social security trust fund so tonight i am encouraging my colleagues to join me in two separate bills the social security preservation act which truly would put social security first and the national debt repayment act which would pay off the entire federal debt by the year 2026 so our children inherit a debt free nation it would restore the social security trust fund so social security would again be solvent for our senior citizens and it would lower taxes taking oner third of any surpluses and dedicating it towards tax reduction"],

whatever you have given is a tiny token of what you have saved that is what he is paying them back with today their bill what they have saved who is paying for this giveaway to the rich americas working families under the republican tax bill the working parents of almost 1 4 million children in michigan in my state will be excluded from the child care credit that is almost half the children in michigan under the republican tax bill the value of the hope scholarships is slashed in direct violation of the budget agreement the republicans are taking money away from family credit away from education credit away from working americans so that the corporate interests the corporate titans can avoid paying taxes at all according to the treasury department the republican tax bill gives more

quote a bonanza for the affluent crumbs for the working class if the republicans were not writing this lopsided tax bill into law we would call it robbery this tax bill rolls back the corporate minimum tax which says to big corporations you have got to pay something like the rest of us we had in the 1980s corporations like texaco and boeing and at t that were not paying any federal income taxes the corporations in the early 1960s would pick up about 25 percent of the tax load in this country that has decreased because these large corporations paid no income taxes to the point that they were down to about 7 percent of the load in the mid1980s everybody was embarrassed so we passed a corporate minimum tax where they were required to pay something now under this bill the republicans

"i rise today in support of the taxpayers relief act and to talk about the class envy and the class warfare and the strategies that the american people and the producers in this country are absolutely sick of i want to talk about it in the context of three particular taxes that we will be debating tomorrow in great detail first the capital gains tax cutting capital gains helps middleclass people clear and simple people who pay capital gains need the ability to understand that they should not be penalized for being successful in this society consider these important facts from the congressional budget office about half of all families in this country own assets such as stocks bonds real estate and businesses that generate capital gains the elderly and this is bad news for the generational warfare types in this house the elderly realize a disproportionate amount of capital gains in 1993 those over 65 in this country realized 40 percent of all capital gains although they make up just 12 percent of the population they also paid 18 percent of all capital gains taxes a joint economic committee report in 1993 found that onethird of all taxpayers reporting capital gains had incomes of less than 30 000 why do folks in this country who love to punish producers who love to punish people who undertake risk in this society why do they want to not index capital gains inflation is an unfair tax on producers in this country to fight the indexation of capital gains in my view is grossly unfair the nonrefundable tax credit we have heard other speakers tonight talk about this aspect of the child tax credit democrats claim the ways and means bill is unfair because it offers a nonrefundable credit to middleincome families over 18 million lowincome families in this country receive a tax break already it is called the earned income tax credit and we spend 26 billion on that earned income tax credit now folks on the other side of the aisle say that lowincome workers should receive another tax break because they pay fica taxes and i hope the american people are listening to this argument tonight and tomorrow and in the weeks ahead payroll taxes are different from income taxes income taxes which lowincome workers do not pay because of the earnedincome tax credit go to general revenues and are used for government programs for general revenue purposes fica taxes are earmarked for social security and medicare revenues from fica taxes go to the social security trust fund and are used to pay benefits under medicare and social security today lowincome workers like all workers are required to contribute to the social security system they will receive all of what they pay into that system and more in the years ahead and it is a very interesting difference between the parties when it comes to fairness this concept of fairness the democrats seem to define fairness as follows middleincome earners in addition to financing the earnedincome tax credit should also subsidize the retirement and health benefits of lowincome workers in essence they say it is unfair for the working poor to contribute to the social security and medicare system which will return benefits to them when they retire those of us on this side of the aisle define fairness as follows all working americans with kids deserve a tax break middleincome workers should not be responsible for subsidizing the payroll taxes paid by lowincome workers we all benefit from social security and medicare and we all need to contribute our fair share last the great class warfare attack of 1997 the alternative minimum tax the amt passed originally in 1986 as part of the tax reform act of 1986 with all good intentions to make sure that truly individuals wealthy and corporations could not avoid paying taxes and i am fully in support of that have goal but i go to the factories as many of us do we talk to the small business people in the capitalintensive industries in this country and they have got a problem with the alternative minimum tax like so many provisions of the tax code the amt has produced unintended consequences let us be clear what the bill of the committee on ways and means does not do in the way of alternative minimum tax under current law the alternative minimum tax treats investment in business machinery and equipment as income rather than as an expense under the proposal it does not exempt the wealthy from paying taxes it does not exempt companies from paying taxes no companies with taxable income will

house resolution after years of determined and dignified struggle the people of india finally gained their independence at midnight on august 14 1947 that midnight hour evoked by indias first prime minister nehru in a stirring speech to the parliament marked the beginning of an inspiring effort by the people of india to establish a republic devoted to the principles of democracy and secularism in the five decades since then despite the challenges of sustaining economic development while reconciling her many ethnic religious and linguistic communities india has stuck to the path of free and fair elections a multiparty political system and the orderly transfer of power from one government to a successor anyone who doubted indias lasting commitment to these values would have had to be converted into a believer in indian democracy after witnessing the elections of the spring of last year in 1996 in what proved to be the largest exercise in democracy in world history half a billion people voted to shape their countrys direction heading into a new century the coalition governments that followed that election in the spring of 1996 have shown their commitment basically not only to democracy but also to representing the broad spectrum of the indian population and continuing on the path of economic reform although many americans may not necessarily recognize it there is a rich tradition of shared values between the united states and india just as the united states proclaimed its independence from the british colonial order so was india born of the struggle for freedom and selfdetermination india derived key aspects of its constitution particularly its statement of fundamental rights from our own bill of rights and the indian independence movement under the inspired leadership of mahatma gandhi had strong moral support from american intellectuals political leaders and journalists in turn dr martin luther king in his struggle to make the promise of american

to this amendment i have had an opportunity to discuss this with the gentleman from california it would have been appropriate for this issue to come before the subcommittee on housing and community development and for us to be able to determine the facts of the specific request made by the gentleman from california pertain ing to the building of lowincome housing in his district the purpose of this rural housing initiative funded by the farmers home administration is really to provide in most cases in the area that it is being built permanent housing for the farm worker community there is an underlying concern that many people have voiced to me that what this amendment is about is keeping a farm worker community out of a specific part of the district of the gentleman from california the area of galt ca if that is in fact what this amendment is attempting to do then i would oppose the gentlemans amendment with every ounce of strength i could and i am sure other members would as well the gentleman from california assures me that that is not what it is about the difficulty is that we have no evidence to suggest whether it is or whether it is not and it puts us in a very difficult position i have tried to work out with the gentleman an agreement that i think the chairman of the committee as well as the ranking member would have supported the gentleman has insisted upon taking this to a vote i think it is a mistake i think that if in fact the subcommittee on housing and community development could have had an opportunity to hear directly from the people involved get a sense of where the farm worker community was coming out get a sense of what the needs are i understand from the statistics cited by the gentleman from california that 67 percent housing in his community in fact is considered affordable but i also understand that there are only 335 units of subsidized housing in that area the truth is that if we are going to stabilize the farm worker community of this country i believe that it is important that we provide permanent housing for that community it has worked throughout the state of california and other states around the country and i think if what this is is a veiled attempt to push those people out that all of us should understand exactly what the policy being pursued is trying to attempt now as i say i have been assured that that is not what the policy is and i would just hope that the chairman of the committee if he would enter into just a brief colloquy with me and make certain that if in fact the subcommittee on housing and community development working in a bipartisan way determines that in fact this is an attempt at a snob zoning requirement that the gentleman from new mexico would in fact try to make

and protection act i have the great privilege to represent a district in northern california that includes all of or parts of nine national forests historically these forests were filled with stands of large trees the forest floors were less dense and were often naturally thinned out by fires that would clean out dense underbrush and would leave the big trees to grow even larger however because of decades of aggressive fire suppression and modern handsoff management practices these forests have grown out of hand creating an almost overwhelming threat of fire according to forest service estimates approximately 40 million acres of the agencys lands are at a high risk for catastrophic fire the cause of this fire threat is an unnatural accumulation of vegetation and small trees on western forest floors the unitedstates forest service estimates that the forests are 82 percent denser than in 1928 dense undergrowth combined with increasingly taller layers of intermediate trees has turned western forests into deadly fire time bombs under these adverse conditions fire quickly climbs up dense tree growth like a ladder until it tops out at the uppermost or crown level of the forest and races out of control as a catastrophic fire because of its high speed and intense heat a crown fire has the capability of leaving an almost sterile environment in its wake with almost no vegetation wildlife or habitat left behind we must then ask ourselves what habitat do we have left if everything in the forest burns the legislation of the gentleman from oregon takes a much needed first step in the right direction toward prioritizing efforts to restore forest health this legislation prioritizes areas at greatest risk of destruction while working in compliance with all environmental laws and forest plans it establishes an independent scientific panel to ensure that all activities are applied in a way that improves forest health using the best available science not politics it establishes agency accountability for ontheground results and ensures fiscal responsibility by requiring annual reports to congress and creates independent audits of agency performance but most importantly this legislation creates incentives for the forest service to make timely efficient management decisions before our forests burn up i urge my colleagues to vote yes on the forest

desperately to find ways to get schools open but an extraordinarily rigid and restrictive court ruling made this impossible shortly before we were due back it became clear to me that all options had

had only a handful of students i then put aside this process with the energetic help of atlarge board of education member tonya kinlow we went straight to the source we enlisted principals to call some of these students directly on september 2 we had so many students that we had to give each student a number and some had to be called by phone at home as our own phone calls to members of the

significant tasks they spoke of the energy enthusiasm hard work and collegiality of the students some members have already invited students to continue to work in their offices not every member could

house has passed a clean energy and water bill without controversy over antienvironmental legislative riders which have bogged down interior and other appropriations bills the vento motion to instruct would put the house on record in opposition to a 20 million alaska grant program which has been included as a rider in the senate bill it is my understanding that the original intent of authorizing these funds was for the purpose of improving sanitation drinking water and other basic needs of remote native villages in alaska let me clearly state that i recognize the serious problems in rural alaska and support responsible congressional efforts to address them but the senate rider as presently drafted is not limited to using federal funds to meet priority needs of native alaskans instead the senate would empower a fiveperson commission to develop a statewide comprehensive plan for economic and infrastructure development no native alaskan nor rural alaskan is directly appointed to the commission rather the chamber of commerce the alaskan municipal league the university president all of which are urban dominated are given a vote in distributing 20 million in federally funded grants with no strings attached let us not allow ourselves to be fooled here this is a blank check to use federal funds to promote road building resource extraction and other favorite causes of development proponents in alaska this is a recipe for federally funded antienvironmental mischief the senate would spend 20 million in federal funds for alaska development grants in 1999 and authorizes unlimited amounts for the next 4 years so the next 4 years we would see a repeated habit of the senate adding money for this purpose as the appropriations bills come from the senate as the gentleman who has offered this motion points out we have not been stingy with alaska in 1996 they insisted upon 110 million in emergency economic disaster relief in southeast alaska communities impacted by the closure of two pulp mills because of poor markets some of that money was used to hire lobbyists to come down here and ask for more money i think what we have seen here that is 110 million now there is 20 million for this study then there is openended appropriations for the next 4 years i do not think that the taxpayers of this country can afford to do business this way i do not think that we can ask for another 20 million if this was important then why did they not use some of the 110 million we gave them 2 years ago to do economic and infrastructure studies i would also point out very clearly as the gentleman who offered this motion has pointed out and that is alaska has a permanent fund of 23 billion that 23 billion fund is supposed to be there in perpetuity for the future of alaska and its residents i have no problem with that but maybe alaska and its residents concerned about their economic development in the future could find it in their heart to spend 20 million of their 23 billion for the purposes of ensuring the kind of infrastructure and development that they think they need to go into the future this is a permanent fund that is currently spinning off 1 300 for every man woman and child who is a resident of the state of alaska that is fine that is what they decided to do with the fund but because they decided to have the fund make those expenditures does not mean that the federal government and all of the rest of the taxpayers of this country need to come in and fill behind those decisions with 20 million in a study that is very loosely constructed and without limitations as to the future appropriations for it i think it is fair to ask the state legislature to step up to the plate and contribute to addressing the problems of rural alaska but the senate rider does not even require matching funds from the state of alaska in the state of california we have huge infrastructure problems we have huge problems trying to meet our water needs our transportation needs our airport needs all the things that so many of us in other states experience but we are not getting 20 million from the federal government to study that and we are not getting 4 years of unlimited appropriations to study that in the future clearly there ought to be some effort to try to focus this study on the problems of rural alaska there ought to be some effort to have the state match the money for this study there are many many studies and many many projects in this bill that are worthwhile but local communities are matching those states are matching those private
