remarkable report that an antarctic ice shelf the size of rhode island just shattered and collapsed into the sea scientists say that they have never seen as large a loss of ice mass and that the disintegration was all the more remarkable because of the extraordinary rapidityof the collapse an ice mass 1 200 square miles in area and 650 feet thick that had existed for 12 000 years disintegrated in 35 days i bring this to my colleagues attention because the disintegration of the federal governments budget position over the last year has been neariy as staggering eight years of hardwon budgetary gains and fiscal discipline were thrown out the window in a single year last years projected tenyear budget surplus of 5 4 trillion dollars collapsed literally before our eyes sacrificed to the irresponsible tax and budget policies of the administration and the republican majority in congress just nine months ago the chairman of the budget committee said this congress will protect 100 percent of the social security and medicare trust funds period no speculation no supposition no projections this promise echoed similar pledges by the speaker the majority leader and the majority whip to place the social security and medicare surpluses in a lockbox and build a firewall between the social security and medicare trust funds and the rest of the budget well here we are twelve months later and 4 trillion poorer the lockbox has been smashed open the firewall has been breached the promises of the republican majority have been broken the budget before the house today raids social security and medicare this year it raids social secdrity and medicare next year it raids social security and medicare the year after that it raids social security and medicare for as far as the eye can see last years budget resolution placed our nations finances in a deep hole the budget before the house today digs the hole deeper it robs us of a chance to address critical needs like a real prescription drug benefit for seniors and adequate funding to modernize our kids schools and reduce class size the return of large multiyear budget deficits will also make it much more difficult to strengthen the social security and medicare programs in advance of the baby boom generations retirement which begins in 2008 when the leading edge of the baby boom enters their retirement years i urge the house to vote down this budget so we can begin work on a bipartisan budget resolution that meets our responsibilities restores our fiscal health and keeps faith with the promises all of us have made to the american people mrs meekof florida i rise in strong opposition to the republicans fatally flawed budget resolution here we go again the republican resolution is simply smoke and mirrors its a pretend budget so deceptive that if it were an ad the public would suq for violations of the truth in advertising laws and they would win not even the transparent ploy of using fiveyear budget estimates from the presidents office of management and budget rather than the usual tenyear budget estimates from the nonpartisan congressional budget office can hid the fact that the republican budget resolution would raid virtually all of the social security and medicare surpluses over the next five years in order to pay for the fiscal chaos caused by last years irresponsible tax bill five times last year here in the house we voted almost unanimously for a social security lockbox the president and the republican leadership repeatedly pledged their commitment to that social security lockbox in this budget the republicans dont just pick the lockbox they shatter it with a sledge hammer dont be fooled when you get rid of the accounting smoke and mirrors in the presidents budget the nondefense domestic spending is not even a current services budget this budget is replete with severe program cuts cuts that low income americans simply cannot take we are left with much less than we had to begin with where is the money for a real prescription drug benefit for affordable housing for head start for education for job training for worker health and safety thedeceptive pretend republican budget ignores the cost of the supplemental that will be offered as soon as this budget resolution leaves the house it ignores the cost of providing relief to millions of middle class taxpayers to keep them from being subjected to the alternative minimum tax it ignores the cost of the republican proposal to make permanent the tax cuts from last years bill it provides woefully inadequate resources for a prescription drug benefit and makes any prescription drug benefit compete with both the cost of provider givebacks and the costs of unspecified medicare modernization we need a budget that provides a real prescription drug benefit improves education ensures the solvency of social security and medicare and pays down the national debt we need an honest budget not this

issues i am pleased to join the gentlewoman from california the other cochair of the womens caucus and my other colleagues in celebrating march as womens history month women accomplished so much in the 20th century and i am fortunate and proud to cochair the first womens caucus of the 21st century let us hope that this century is productive for our daughters and granddaughters as it was for our mothers and us the last 100 years have seen women make important advancements in the area of public service notonly did our predecessors gain the right to vote but in recent years we have been considered a decidedly important voting block we now have more women serving in the house and the senate than ever before 61 women in the house and 13 in the senate i think we will keep seeing these numbers increase we have women serving as supreme court justices governors attorneys general and in many other elected offices but we still have a long way to go for all the accomplishments that women have achieved in the 20th century we should not be complacent we still have a lot to do one of the areas where females have made important strides is in the area of education women currently make up over 50 percent of college freshmen in the country to think that in 1872 over 100 years ago only 97 educational institutions even accepted women the national center for education statistics report that females are now doing as well or better than males on factors measuring educational attainment nevertheless women continue to trail their male counterparts in the areas of mathematics anfd science this is something that i hope through my position on the house committee on science to help rectify what is more women are still underrepresented in doctoral and first professional degree programs although as the ncec points out women have made substantial gains in these areas during the last 25 years there are other areas of education where improvements need to be made most notably in the area of school access for socalled disadvantaged students a group of disadvantaged students whose needs are often overlooked are homeless children homeless children face unique problems when attempting to access a quality education some schools do not allow homeless children to register for classes without school or medical records others will not enroll children without a home address and there is nobody in the schools whose job it is to help them as a result homeless children wait days and even weeks just to get into the classroom obviously this has serious and negative consequences for their educational advantages some may be wondering why i am talking about homeless children during this recognition of the achievements of women well it is because as data shows educating homeless children is a womens issue according to a federal study released in 1999 84 percent of parents or guardians of homeless children are femaje the average homeless family is composed of a single mother in her twenties and two children under the age of 6 single mothers are vulnerable to homelessness because of the high cost of housing for families the high cost of child care and lack of housing assistance we must work together as women as leaders in our community and as public servants to find answers to the destructive cycles caused by homelessness and poverty that is why i have introduced h r 623 the mckinneyvento homeless education act of 2001 this bill will ensure that all homeless children are guaranteed access to public education so that they can acquire the skills needed to escape poverty and lead healthy and productive lives it will also strengthen the parental rights at a time when mothers of homeless children find themselves most vulnerable it will help homeless mothers pay for school supplies and other emergency items that children need to participate in school such as clothes eyeglasses and hygiene products many mothers have expressed gratitude through letters and cards for these items which they could not otherwise afford at such a difficult point in their lives working hard now to ensure a brighter future for all americans is something that we as women learn the importance of during our struggle to gain equality in the 20th century during the month of march it is fitting that women take time to reflect back upon and celebrate our collective accomplishments over the last 100 years we must use every opportunity to show how we are going to use the lessons learned in yesteryears battles to eliminate illiteracy increase educational opportunity for all and promote high academic achievements if we do so that would give women 100 years from now something to crow about"], [0.963043212890625, 0.963043212890625, 0, "devised was in large part reasonable and i could have supported it however because this bill is laden with extraneous provisions that limit victims rights and does not address some of the core issues that i believe are essential i cannot embrace this legislation in its current form it did not have to be this way first h r 3210 does not impose an industry deductible instead it creates a program under which the federal govemment finances industry losses from the firstdollar and calls for those funds to be recouped over time through industry assessments and policy surcharges second the bill does not require by its terms that property and casualty coverage be part of commercial property and casualty coverage as it normally is now third it egregiously limits victims rights by eliminating punitive damages limits noneconomic damages caps attorneys fees and creates a federal cause of action these provisions are extraneous represent a wish list for those who have long wished to restrict the rights of victims in our civil justice system alienate most democrats and many republicans here and in the senate and therefore imperils this legislations ultimate enactment the advocates of radical tort reform in the white house and in the republican leadership are using this terrorism risk bill to promote an aggressive antivictim agenda section 15 of the armey bill entitled litigation management may constitute the most radical and onesided liability limitations ever even worse the provision bears little relationship to the issue of insurance and is not even limited to cases involving insurance coverage the republican bill diminishes the protections that americans enjoy under state law by restricting the availability of noneconomic damages and by eliminating punitive damages these limitations on damages apply not only to insurance companies but also to the wrongdoer as well adoption of these provi sions rewards wrongdoers at the expense of innocent victims of terrorist attacks if an airport screening firm hires a known terrorist who allows a weapon to slip on board a plane this bill would protect that company punitive damages are rare and only awarded in the most egregious cases where a defendant willfully or intentionally disregards the safety of the american public the elimination of punitive damages takes away incentives for businesses to do everything they can reasonably do to protect the american public noneconomic damages are real damages the loss of a limb eyesight constant pain and loss of a loved one are real lifealtering events limiting their recovery harms the most severely injured victims and discriminates against children the elderly and homemakers who do not receive much in the way of economic damages the republican bill tries to limit victims access to the civil justice system by capping the fees available to pay the victims attomeys and threatens their attorneys with criminal sanctions for violations of the cap this particular provision reveals the real motives of the proponents because the provisions does not impose any cap on the fees paid to defendants it bill takes away all judicial review relating to the issue of whether terrorism caused the injury an unprecedented and very likely unconstitutional limitation on victim rights it eliminates prejudgment interest which takes away any incentive for negligent parties to reach settlements it mandates collateral source which forces victims to choose between seeking money from charities and pursuing a grossly negligent party in court and permits wrongdoers to take advantage of life and health insurance policies purchased by the victim or the victims employer the republicans claim that the provisions are needed to protect the taxpayers from paying for excessive damages through the reinsurance mechanism but under the republican bill every penny of assistance is recouped through assessments on the industry tf they were really concerned with limiting taxpayer exposure rather an aggressive and radical tort reform agenda why is there no limitation on property damages under the bill does making a family whole means less to my colleagues than making a corporation whole for the loss of a luxurious building while i firmly believe these victim compensation restrictions have no place in this bill we on our side sought to find some common ground on this tort reform issue so we could report out a bill that is vitally important forthe economic recovery of this nation we presented to the rules committee three amendments to modify the provision but the republican leadership was unwilling to give the house an opportunity to refine these provisions and reach a compromise on an issue that also has the senate tied up in knots instead they insist on pursuing a radical partisan agenda to limit the compensation needed to make the victims of terrorist attacks whole later in this debate ranking member kanjorski and i will offer a substitute which cures many of the defects of the republican bill and presents this body with a clean piece of legislation that members on both sides of the aisle can support first my bill would require a real upfront deductible the insurance industry would pay the first 5 billion of insured losses in the first year increasing to 10 billion in the second and third years individual company liability would be capped at 7 percent of premiums the insurance industry has made clear that it can afford a deductible of this magnitude and they were prepared to embrace it when it was under consideration in the senate the administration too supports such a deductible it is a sensible mechanism that protects taxpayers and imposes underwriting discipline it is a necessary part of any legislation that we ultimately send to the president at the same time my bill maintains the sensible assessment provisions of the oxley billfor losses in excess of the deductible and imposes a discretionary surcharge on policyholders for losses above 20 billion i believe these provisions fairly protect the american taxpayer while not overly burdening industry second to prevent insurance companies from cherrypicking the safest properties and leaving sites which presegt greater risk uncovered our substitute unlike the republican bill would require that terrorism coverage be part of property and casualty coverage this is essential to avoid a situation where insurers would only insure good risks and leave large portions of the economy uncovered this provision would also eliminate any incentive for small businesses to opt out of insurance coverage finally my bill does not limit victims rights by denying them the legal redress that they deserve although i cannot support the bill in its present form i hope we can engage in a bipartisan collaborative process going forward despite our present differences i do see common ground and i do see how we could meld our approaches but if we are to get there it will take

paying tribute to a leader in harris county tx who is retiring from office this year harris county commissioner jim fonteno in his 27th year of service to the county has earned the respect and admiration of his colleagues and his constituents with his tireless devotion to his job the jim fonteno post office is our small way of repaying him for all he has done over the years a veteran of the unitedstates army and the unitedstates merchant marine commissioner fonteno has a long history of public service he has served as a municipal judge for the city of baytown served two terms as the commissioner of the port of houston and since his swearingin on january 1 1975 has represented the residents of precinct two in harris county over the years commissioner fonteno has been an advocate for those often neglected or forgotten in our society when he took office he recognized the need for programs aimed at senior citizens and when he realized that the county did not have the money he formed east harris county senior citizens a nonprofit corporation the most critical need seniors faced was adequate transportation because seniors had limited transportation many of them were inactive and isolated from the rest of the community in 1976 commissioner fonteno along with four area businessmen signed a note on a 32passenger bus nicknamed the fun bus today the fleet includes 21 buses five of which are equipped for the physically challenged these buses are used to transport senior citizens to various places and activities east harris county senior citizens sponsor various activities throughout the year including trips to sporting events such as houston astros comets and aeros games and the houston livestock show rodeo one of the most popular events sponsored by the east harris county senior citizens is the senior citizen olympics held annually throughout precinct two these funfilled events provide both social and physical interaction among senior citizens however not every senior is able to attend these events the distinctive needs of the seniors in the 18 nursing homes located throughout precinct two are addressed by the nursing home program special activities such as movie parties manicures and the ms golden years pageant are offered to nursing home residents in addition the handicap buses are utilized for field trip outings all of these activities are funded solely by grants fund raisers and private donations made to the 501c3 corporation another cause that commissioner fonteno devoted a great deal of time to was the wellbeing of our youth the east harris county youth program which he founded is dedicated to serving the needs of the harris county precinct two youth the program originated as a pilot program comprising a summer camp at j d walker community center and an afterschool program at cloverleaf elementary school the single most important role of the east harris county youth program is to serve as a vehicle that makes learning fun designed to be a resource not a substitute for school systems the program is a strong proponent of students staying in school although academic achievements receive top priority the east harris county youth program also puts an emphasis on physical activity i am proud to know jim fonteno proud to call him a friend and honored to be his representative in the unitedstates house of representatives my only regret is that after all these years in public service we will no longer have commissioner fonteno his experience and his wisdom at the commissioners court fighting for the people of precinct two i thank jim fonteno for his service and wish him the best as he settles into a welldeserved retirement"], [0.001078784465789795, 0.5010787844657898, 1, "today is world refugee day for many years numerous countries all around the world have set aside a day for remembering the plight of refugees one of the most widespread is african refugee day celebrated june 20 in several african countries in 2000 as an expression of solidarity with aftica a special u n general assembly resolution was passed naming june 20 of every year world refugee day some of my colleagues may be thinking why do we need a day to celebrate refugees why because today right now there are over 21 million refugees worldwide people displaced by conflict humanitarian disasters and crises men women and children whose lives are starkly different from those we lead because they find it very difficult to meet just basic needs such as food shelter and water many times men women and children find themselves living in destitute conditions in camps that leave them vulnerable to attack and to disease there are anywhere from 3 million to 6 million refugees and approximately 10 6 million internally displaced refugees in africa more than half of all african refugees have fled from four countries sierra leone somalia sudan and angola these four countries along with eritrea burundi and liberia each produce over a quarter of a million or more of refugees the numbers are staggering too large even to imagine and difficult to connect to human lives so what do we do whatdoes it mean to be a refugee who needs to be resettled let me tell my colleagues the story of one jean pierre kamwa a student activist from cameroon fled to the united states in 1999 seeking asylum from imprisonment and torture evils visited upon him because of his activism ethnic background and prodemocracy rhetoric after arriving at jfk airport from the long trip and treacherous ordeal he was immediately taken into custody fingerprinted photographed and handcuffed by an ins officer mr kamwa was told to remove his clothes and was subsequently searched then he was taken still handcuffed to the wackenhut detention facility in queens new york where he was detained for 5 months until granted asylum in april of 2000 mr kamwa now works with refugee visitation programs such as first friends a communitybased network that coordinates visits to the elizabeth new jersey immigration facility where 300 refugees are being held waiting for their cases to be judged and might i add at a facility that still does not reach the standards in my opinion that it should this one mans story shows that even refugees who find their way to our shores have a long way to go before they can lead normal lives again now imagine that you are a refugee seeking asylum in the united states imagine how difficult life is held in detention while you are being processed since september 11 that wait has become even longer understandably the tragedy that occurred created a delay in the processing of immigration and refugee resettlement cases on november 21 2001 president bush authorized the admission of 70 000 refugees into the united states for fiscal year 2002 yet as of may 31 of this year slightly less than 13 800 refugees have been admitted given the current pace of processing it is highly unlikely that the allocation admissions level will be reached by september 30 of 2002 and therefore those people will not have an opportunity to come into this country what is even more disturbing is that while 28 percent of the refugees worldwide are africans in origin less than 7 percent of the refugees admitted into this country in fiscal year 2002 are of african origin a mere 891 african refugees have been admitted this year while 14 089 refugees from the near east and south asia have been resettled in the same amount of time and a staggering 6 470 have come from the former soviet union there is clearly an imbalance here and it has to be redressed testifying at a february 12 hearing held by the senate immigration subcommittee the head of the state departments refugee bureau assistant secretary dewey and ins commissioner james ziglar committe d their agencies to working very diligently to admit the 70 000 refugees that president bush pledged to bring to the united states of america in his testimony ziglar said the terrorist attacks of september 11 were caused by evil not immigration we can and will protect ourselves against people who seek to harm the united states but we cannot judge immigrants or refugees by the actions of terrorists our nation must continue in its great tradition of offering a safe haven to the oppressed and persecuted i ask all of my colleagues to join into try to make the processing of refugees more humane the refugee resettlement program has proved to be a success for many individuals seeking asylum from terrible situations in their own countries such as the thousands of dinka youths that have come to be known as the lost boys of sudan the treacherous war in sudan fueled by the lust for oil has forced thousands of southern sudanese to flee to neighboring countries like kenya and ethiopia as the war rages on thousands of sudanese boys went from one country to another and 5 000 survivors of the 33 000 who originally fled sudan ended up in a refugee camp in northern kenya called kakuma they have since become known as the lost boys of sudan john tot and 109 other sudanese teenagerg arrived in philadelphia and other cities around the unitedstates in late 2000 part of a humanitarian effort of the state department and the un high commissioner on refugees these young boys have overcome numerous obstacles to learn english graduate from high school and even make their way to college the refugee resettlement program can work and can mean the difference between barely surviving and leading a full productive life we must do what we can to urge the processing of african refugees its a matter of life and death"]]}
