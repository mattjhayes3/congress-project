report that an antarctic ice shelf the size of rhode island just shattered and collapsed into the sea scientists say that they have never seen as large a loss of ice mass and that the disintegration was all the more remarkable because of the extraordinary rapidityof the collapse an ice mass 1 200 square miles in area and 650 feet thick that had existed for 12 000 years disintegrated in 35 days i bring this to my colleagues attention because the disintegration of the federal governments budget position over the last year has been neariy as staggering eight years of hardwon budgetary gains and fiscal discipline were thrown out the window in a single year last years projected tenyear budget surplus of 5 4 trillion dollars collapsed literally before our eyes sacrificed to the irresponsible tax and budget policies of the administration and the republican majority in congress just nine months ago the chairman of the budget committee said this congress will protect 100 percent of the social security and medicare trust funds period no speculation no supposition no projections this promise echoed similar pledges by the speaker the majority leader and the majority whip to place the social security and medicare surpluses in a lockbox and build a firewall between the social security and medicare trust funds and the rest of the budget well here we are twelve months later and 4 trillion poorer the lockbox has been smashed open the firewall has been breached the promises of the republican majority have been broken the budget before the house today raids social security and medicare this year it raids social secdrity and medicare next year it raids social security and medicare the year after that it raids social security and medicare for as far as the eye can see last years budget resolution placed our nations finances in a deep hole the budget before the house today digs the hole deeper it robs us of a chance to address critical needs like a real prescription drug benefit for seniors and adequate funding to modernize our kids schools and reduce class size the return of large multiyear budget deficits will also make it much more difficult to strengthen the social security and medicare programs in advance of the baby boom generations retirement which begins in 2008 when the leading edge of the baby boom enters their retirement years i urge the house to vote down this budget so we can begin work on a bipartisan budget resolution that meets our responsibilities restores our fiscal health and keeps faith with the promises all of us have made to the

budget so deceptive that if it were an ad the public would suq for violations of the truth in advertising laws and they would win not even the transparent ploy of using fiveyear budget estimates from the presidents office of management and budget rather than the usual tenyear budget estimates from the nonpartisan congressional budget office can hid the fact that the republican budget resolution would raid virtually all of the social security and medicare surpluses over the next five years in order to pay for the fiscal chaos caused by last years irresponsible tax bill five times last year here in the house we voted almost unanimously for a social security lockbox the president and the republican leadership repeatedly pledged their commitment to that social security lockbox in this budget the republicans dont just pick the lockbox they shatter it with a sledge hammer dont be fooled when you get rid of the accounting smoke and mirrors in the presidents budget the nondefense domestic spending is not even a current services budget this budget is replete with severe program cuts cuts that low income americans simply cannot take we are left with much less than we had to begin with where is the money for a real prescription drug benefit for affordable housing for head start for education for job training for worker health and safety thedeceptive pretend republican budget ignores the cost of the supplemental that will be offered as soon as this budget resolution leaves the house it ignores the cost of providing relief to millions of middle class taxpayers to keep them from being subjected to the alternative minimum tax it ignores the cost of the republican proposal to make permanent the tax cuts from last years bill it provides woefully inadequate

and does not address some of the core issues that i believe are essential i cannot embrace this legislation in its current form it did not have to be this way first h r 3210 does not impose an industry deductible instead it creates a program under which the federal govemment finances industry losses from the firstdollar and calls for those funds to be recouped over time through industry assessments and policy surcharges second the bill does not require by its terms that property and casualty coverage be part of commercial property and casualty coverage as it normally is now third it egregiously limits victims rights by eliminating punitive damages limits noneconomic damages caps attorneys fees and creates a federal cause of action these provisions are extraneous represent a wish list for those who have long wished to restrict the rights of victims in our civil justice system alienate most democrats and many republicans here and in the senate and therefore imperils this legislations ultimate enactment the advocates of radical tort reform in the white house and in the republican leadership are using this terrorism risk bill to promote an aggressive antivictim agenda section 15 of the armey bill entitled litigation management may constitute the most radical and onesided liability limitations ever even worse the provision bears little relationship to the issue of insurance and is not even limited to cases involving insurance coverage the republican bill diminishes the protections that americans enjoy under state law by restricting the availability of noneconomic damages and by eliminating punitive damages these limitations on damages apply not only to insurance companies but also to the wrongdoer as well adoption of these provi sions rewards wrongdoers at the expense of innocent victims of terrorist attacks if an airport screening firm hires a known terrorist who allows a weapon to slip on board a plane this bill would protect that company punitive damages are rare and only awarded in the most egregious cases where a defendant willfully or intentionally disregards the safety of the american public the elimination of punitive damages takes away incentives for businesses to do everything they can reasonably do to protect the american public noneconomic damages are real damages the loss of a limb eyesight constant pain and loss of a loved one are real lifealtering events limiting their recovery harms the most severely injured victims and discriminates against children the elderly and homemakers who do not receive much in the way of economic damages the republican bill tries to limit victims access to the civil justice system by capping the fees available to pay the victims attomeys and threatens their attorneys with criminal sanctions for violations of the cap this particular provision reveals the real motives of the proponents because the provisions does not impose any cap on the fees paid to defendants it bill takes away all judicial review relating to the issue of whether terrorism caused the injury an unprecedented and very likely unconstitutional limitation on victim rights it eliminates prejudgment interest which takes away any incentive for negligent parties to reach settlements it mandates collateral source which forces victims to choose between seeking money from charities and pursuing a grossly negligent party in court and permits wrongdoers to take advantage of life and health insurance policies purchased by the victim or the victims employer the republicans claim that the provisions are needed to protect the taxpayers from paying for excessive damages through the reinsurance mechanism but under the republican bill every penny of assistance is recouped through assessments on the industry tf they were really concerned with limiting taxpayer exposure rather an aggressive and radical tort reform agenda why is there no limitation on property damages under the bill does making a family whole means less to my colleagues than making a corporation whole for the loss of a luxurious building while i firmly believe these victim compensation restrictions have no place in this bill we on our side sought to find some common ground on this tort reform issue so we could report out a bill that is vitally important forthe economic recovery of this nation we presented to the rules committee three amendments to modify the provision but the republican leadership was unwilling to give the house an opportunity to refine these provisions and reach a compromise on an issue that also has the senate tied up in knots instead they insist on pursuing a radical partisan agenda to limit the compensation needed to make the victims of terrorist attacks whole later in this debate ranking member kanjorski and i will offer a substitute which cures many of the defects of the republican bill and presents this body with a clean piece of legislation that members on both sides of the aisle can support first my bill would require a real upfront deductible the insurance industry would pay the first 5 billion of insured losses in the first year increasing to 10 billion in the second and third years individual company liability would be capped at 7 percent of premiums the insurance industry has made clear that it can afford a deductible of this magnitude and they were prepared to embrace it when it was under consideration in the senate the administration too supports such a deductible it is a sensible mechanism that protects taxpayers and imposes underwriting discipline it is a necessary part of any legislation that we ultimately send to the president at the same time my bill maintains the sensible assessment provisions of the oxley billfor losses in excess of the deductible and imposes a discretionary surcharge on policyholders for losses above 20 billion i believe these provisions fairly protect the american taxpayer while not overly burdening industry second to prevent insurance companies from cherrypicking the safest properties and leaving sites which presegt greater risk uncovered our substitute unlike the republican bill would require that terrorism coverage be part of property and casualty coverage this is essential to avoid a situation where insurers would only insure good risks and leave large portions of the economy uncovered this provision would also eliminate any incentive for small businesses to opt out of insurance coverage finally my bill does not limit victims rights by denying them the legal redress that they deserve although i cannot support the bill in its present form i hope we can engage in a bipartisan collaborative process going forward despite our present differences i do see common ground and i do see how we could meld our approaches but if we are to get there it will take respectful bipartisan dialog not the gratuitous and unnecessary pushing of ideological agendas we have little time and a

accomplished so much in the 20th century and i am fortunate and proud to cochair the first womens caucus of the 21st century let us hope that this century is productive for our daughters and granddaughters as it was for our mothers and us the last 100 years have seen women make important advancements in the area of public service notonly did our predecessors gain the right to vote but in recent years we have been considered a decidedly important voting block we now have more women serving in the house and the senate than ever before 61 women in the house and 13 in the senate i think we will keep seeing these numbers increase we have women serving as supreme court justices governors attorneys general and in many other elected offices but we still have a long way to go for all the accomplishments that women have achieved in the 20th century we should not be complacent we still have a lot to do one of the areas where females have made important strides is in the area of education women currently make up over 50 percent of college freshmen in the country to think that in 1872 over 100 years ago only 97 educational institutions even accepted women the national center for education statistics report that females are now doing as well or better than males on factors measuring educational attainment nevertheless women continue to trail their male counterparts in the areas of mathematics anfd science this is something that i hope through my position on the house committee on science to help rectify what is more women are still underrepresented in doctoral and first professional degree programs although as the ncec points out women have made substantial gains in these areas during the last 25 years there are other areas of education where improvements need to be made most notably in the area of school access for socalled disadvantaged students a group of disadvantaged students whose needs are often overlooked are homeless children homeless children face unique problems when attempting to access a quality education some schools do not allow homeless children to register for classes without school or medical records others will not enroll children without a home address and there is nobody in the schools whose job it is to help them as a result homeless children wait days and even weeks just to get into the classroom obviously this has serious and negative consequences for their educational advantages some may be wondering why i am talking about homeless children during this recognition of the achievements of women well it is because as data shows educating homeless children is a womens issue according to a federal study released in 1999 84 percent of parents or guardians of homeless children are femaje the average homeless family is composed of a single mother in her twenties and two children under the age of 6 single mothers are vulnerable to homelessness because of the high cost of housing for families the high cost of child care and lack of housing assistance we must work together as women as leaders in our community and as public servants to find answers to the destructive cycles caused by homelessness and poverty that is why i have introduced h r 623 the mckinneyvento homeless education act of 2001 this bill will ensure that all homeless children are guaranteed access to public education so that they can acquire the skills needed to escape poverty and lead healthy and productive lives it will also strengthen the parental rights at a time when mothers of homeless children find themselves most vulnerable it will help homeless mothers pay for school supplies and other emergency items that children need to participate in school such as clothes eyeglasses and hygiene products many mothers have expressed gratitude through letters and cards for these items which they could not otherwise afford at such a difficult point in their lives working hard now to ensure a brighter future for all americans is something that we as women learn the importance of during our struggle to gain equality in the 20th century during the month of march it is fitting that women take time to reflect back upon and celebrate our collective accomplishments over the last 100 years we must use every opportunity to show how we are going to use the lessons learned in yesteryears battles to eliminate illiteracy

was best articulated by a patriot from new england who served as secretary of state in 1837 daniel webster he stated that the need for selfdefense must be instant overwhelming and leaving no chance of means and no moment for deliberation i would add that the quantum of evidence necessary must be compelling and convincing not the higher criminal standard of beyond a reasonable doubt but at least compelling and convincing because of the obvious magnitude of the consequences that are implicated here the resolution before us permits the president to take us into war without satisfying either of these requirements in terms of the clear and present danger test only last friday the cia stated publicly that without material from abroad iraq probably would not be able to make a weapon until the last half of the decade and further the evidence needed to support the proposition that iraq is a clear and present danger is not compelling and convincing but rather murky and speculative i was particularly disturbed to learn that a national defense intelligence estimate had not even been done before the option of unilateral preemptive military action had become administration policy it is as if a policy had been crafted and there was no need for a factual basis based on our own historical precedents the evidence and the rule of law a conclusion in search of facts if you will now the factual basis for congressional authorization is incorporated in the preamble of the resolution before us but the allegations that are recited therein could be made about a number of countries such as iran and north korea the other original members of the axis of evil club both of whom are further along in the development and capacity to deliver a nuclear device and both of whom possess biological and chemical weapons our own intelligence for years has claimed that north korea has enough plutonium for several nuclear bombs so why the focus on iraq it is asserted that saddam has used chemical weapons and thereby demonstrated the necessary intention well in fact we do know of at least 10 occasions in the 1980s that he used chemical weapons during the war with iran because we supported him yet we still took him off the terrorist list opened an embassy in baghdad shared intelligence with the iraqi military and provided billions of dollars in agricultural credits but since the last incident occurred in 1988 i would submit that that evidence is stale and fails the clear and present danger test what is not mentioned is that he did not subsequently use weapons of mass destruction during the gulf war because he was told that our response would be devastating yes he is despicable and truly evil but he is not stupid he can be deterred he is not an al qaeda fanatic seeking martyrdom that is not saddam hussein rather he is a survivor and his only concern is maintaining power now the president in his remarks last night mentioned links between al qaeda and saddam hussein but that conflicts with reports that both the fbi and the cia have failed to corroborate any relationship between saddam and al qaeda with credible evidence the president further noted that some al qaeda leaders who fled afghanistan went to iraq and that is true but they are in northern iraq they are in northern iraq protected by iraqi kurds who are opposed to saddam it is difficult to imagine such an alliance because they are natural enemies one of the goalsof al qaeda is the destruction of secular muslim regimes such as iraq because they believe they have corrupted islam remember iraq did not recognize the taliban unlike our allies pakistan and saudi arabia and the united arab emirates like all members i fervently hope that if this resolution passes and i am sure it will a preemptive

first want to thank our new chairman the gentleman from arizona for his tenacity and his bipartisanship as we put together a very good bill i thank the gentleman from arizona very much for his leadership and to our ranking member the gentlewoman from new york for her hard work as we worked together to craft a bill that is a good one and is also bipartisan in the development assistance account this bill does address the problems and the rule that we have before us today helps to implement the bill that comes forward in the child disease account and health account we find that we have 1 4 billion there to begin to help with some of the diseases in the world i wish there could have been more money for the diseases and i am hopeful that we will work to find more money as we move into this process airborne diseases such as tuberculosis and others need more attention and i would hope that as we move forward we will be able to address more dollars into those accounts the andean counterdrug initiative last year this initiative was called plan colombia we put in 1 3 billion for plan colombia today less than 25 percent of that has been spent we hope that because 90 percent of the cocaine and heroin that comes into our countrycomes from colombia that we would begin to spend this money for interdiction of these drugs and to begin to meet the drug crisis here in america unfortunately it has not begun i would hope that our committee would call a hearing and that we would hear how that 1 3 billion is going to be spent this bill gives an additional 600 plus million for that same counter initiative of drug control i am hopeful again that we are able to spend this money for the interdiction of drugs which is a cancer in america drug treatment is a must we must put more money into drug treatment i do not think yet our country has gotten that yes you must cut off the supply through interdiction but you also must put money in treatment treatment on demand i know we will see a few amendments here that speak to some of that we have not yet addressed that in this entire budget and certainly not in this foreign operations budget but overall it is a good budget and it is a good bill i do have some concerns about those things that i have mentioned i will work with the chairman and our ranking member as we go forward to increase funding for hiv aids and increase funding for the attack on the cancer drugs in our community i rise today to support the rule bill and thank the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee mr kolbe who has worked extremely hard to try and craft a bipartisan bill in spite of extremely limited resources and wide and varying demands by both sides i would also like to acknowledge the work of the ranking member mrs lowey who

leader on this issue from new jersey let me say to my good friend from arkansas mr ross i am from the fourth largest city in the nation and when it comes to the crisis in prescription drug benefits take a rural area with 3 400 people and no mass transit and take an urban center and that is the nature of the crisis and that is what it is all over this country what i would like to say to my friend as well i am a supporter of family pharmacies and family pharmacists because we have a few in our community and i thank the gentleman very much i had the opportunity to visit with a number of pharmacists who have come up to try and discuss various issues and i say pharmacists who open these local family pharmacies and they have been very sensitive to the plight of our seniors to the extent that i know and i know that my good friend the gentleman from arkansas mr ross has probably yielded a little to some of the seniors who have come into his store and probably had their request or their prescription drugs on credit for awhile so that they could manage to keep their health where they did not find themselves in hospitals so my hat is off to the gentleman and off to the family pharmacies around the nation i want people to know that this is not an issue of your family drug store or your neighborhood drug store where you go into the pharmacists who try to do the best they can with the prescription that the senior has it is a national crisis that we have and that is why i thought it was important that we again raise our voices and speak to this question of why we have not been able to make headway on this i wanted to refresh our memory and i am also reminded of the idea of changing medicare for these times let me say that whenever medicare is discussed we do not make friends i believe in 1965 whatever the time frame when medicare first was established under president johnson there were a lot of people in the health care industry good friends of ours of course that is senior to me but in any event individuals in the medical profession that thought that medicare was not going to work it was going to collapse the system how in the world are you going to have a government systemto pay physicians there was a great fear and debate about medicare now we find out that medicare has extended the lives of seniors and when it works right for the purpose our physicians it is a system that provides better health care and the opportunity for our physicians to treat the elderly in a way that gives them a longer life now we talk about reforming medicare in a way that is long overdue and i want to refresh my colleagues memory if we could and refer back to the state of the union in 1999 now we have been talking about this for a very long time but usually when things get elevated to the level of the state of the union then the congress takes its lead begins to formulate policies in a bipartisan manner and it was in january 1999 when president clinton announced an initiative to create a medicare prescription drug benefit in his state of the union this was declaring to the nation that this was not only a crisis but it was utmost important when he delivered his state of the union address in 1999 he laid out that one of the key goals of the year was creating an affordable prescription drug benefit under the medicare program i would say to my friend the gentleman from new jersey"]]}
