lbadership on so many issues and for her consistent and i mean consistent opposition to this war from day one also i would like to thank the chair of our congressional black caucus congresswoman carolyn kilpatrick for your outstanding leadership and also for your commitment in changing the presidents failed policy on iraq and for making sure that the congressional black caucus speaks in one voice thank you congresswoman kilpatrick let me also salute all of our colleagues from the congressional black caucus who have opposed this war from the start including congresswoman maxine waters who actually boldly started the out of iraq caucus if our voices had been listened to we would not have embarked upon this unnecessary immoral war i once again stand here as the daughter of a 25year veteran who fought in two wars it is past time to end this war last week the president once again took to the air waves to make his case for the same old stay the course strategy he said that he will return the number of troops in iraq to presurge levels by july of 2008 he wants us to believe that by getting back to where we were last january sometime next summer he wants us to think that that is progress the american people arent buying that they know how to count it is the same song and dance from the people who told us that there were weapons of mass destruction who assured us that we would be greeted as liberators who declared mission accomplished and said really it is mission impossible but he declared mission accomplished and who said we were turning the corner and that the insurgency was in its last throes the fact is that the bush stay the course strategy put us on the path for 10 years of occupation in iraq at the minimum it is time to call this what it is it is really the presidents plan to run out the clock on his failed policy to move the goal post once again so that he could sneak out the back door and leave the american people holding the bag after he leaves the white house well let me ask you how many of our troops should die so the president can save face how many iraqis must die to convince the president that the occupation is bringing disaster to hundreds of thousands of iraqis how much of our tax dollars should we spend so the president can avoid admitting that his policy failed we are now spending 12 billion a month in iraq for the price of 1 month in iraq we could be paying for 1 5 million children to go to head start for a year for the price of 1 month in iraq we could have hired 200 000 new school teachers for a year for the price of 1 month in iraq we could have insured 7 million of the 8 7 million children living in this country without medical insurance for a year that is just the cost of 30 days in iraq and the president thinks we should be staying yet another 10 years that is far too high a price to pay for him to save face all the talk about military progress in iraq is a distraction it is a smoke screen that only serves to obscure the basic fundamental fact that there is no military solution to the situation in iraq our brave troops are trapped in a civil war and an occupation our continued presence there is not only challenging our military it is undermining our national security and our efforts tc fight international terrorism that is why every member of the congressional black caucus really cosponsored a resolution which we sponsored banning military bases and control at least unitedstates control of the iraqi oil this resolution passed this body on a very large bipartisan vote and in fact it sent a strong message that we do not intend to occupy iraq at least this house doesnt intend to have that as our policy despite this administrations though efforts to frame this as an issue of victory and defeat the fact remains that redeployment of united states troops from iraq is really a precondition its aprecondition to restoring ournational security and our efforts to fight terrorism and putting us on a path toward a foreign policy that provides real solutions for global peace and security redeployment is a precondition a precondition for engaging iraqs neighbors and the international community in a regional stability plan we have a moral obligation to help build iraq we bombed the country and we for the most part destroyed it but neither iraqs neighbors nor the international community will truly engage in a regional stability plan as long as they believe that the united states intends to maintain an indefinite occupation redeployment is a precondition for any successful effort to combat global terrorism the united states occupation of iraq has become a rallying point for terrorist recruitment training and fundraising a factor that actively undermines our antiterrorism efforts congress has the power to end the bush administrations failed policy in iraq but it means it really means that members of congress are going to have to make a choice are we going to stand with the president for an openended occupation that sacrifices our troops lives so he can save face or are we going to act to bring this disastrous policy to a conclusion the choice is simple congress should not provide another dime not another dime for the presidents failed policy we should provide the money necessary to fully fund the safe timely and responsible redeployment of troops and contractors from iraq and let me tell you the american people support this in closing let me remind you that members of the congressional black caucus saw this disaster coming and tried to stop it if you recall we had an amendment when the authorization to use force came before this body it was my amendment that would have allowed the united nations inspectors to complete their inspection process for weapons of mass destruction congress then however voted to go to war members of the congressional black caucus voted for that resolution members of the congressional black caucus continue to oppose the occupation and ork day and night to bring our young men and women home and we will continue to be that voice that reminds our country that we truly we really we honestly we do support and love our troops and the best way that we can demonstrate that the only way that we can demonstrate that is by bringing them home and making sure that they have their economic security their health care and their mental health care and the resources they need to take their lives back thank you congresswoman kilpatrick for your leadership and for calling us together tonight thank you congresswoman stephanie tubbs jones for pulling us together and making sure we all stay on time and for your leadership on so many issues"], [8.83340835571289e-05, 0.9999116659164429, 1, "i thank the chairwoman for yielding to me the rule allows for the supplemental to be considered in two parts part 1 is funding for the war and iraq and part 2 includes expanded benefits for gi education expanded unemployment compensation disaster relief food aid and other measures i want to begin also by thanking chairman obey for his incredible leadership in trying to forge a decent and fair compromise he has more patience than i let me start with talking about amendment no 2 i strongly support the measures contained in this amendment it expands the gi benefits for the education of our veterans including those serving in iraq and afghanistan and extends them more equitably for all of our service branches including the guard and reserves the amendment also extends unemployment benefits by up to 13 weeks in every state for workers who have exhausted their benefits it places a moratorium on six medicaid regulations the costs of which are fully offset it provides emergency funding to meet critical needs especially in addressing the global food crisis and disaster and refugee assistance it includes many other measures that are worth supporting that are important that are vital and so i urge all my colleagues to support amendment no 2 let me now just say a few words about funding for the war in iraq under amendment no 1 funding for the iraq war is provided without conditions a blank check with no requirements about how or when we might begin removing our military forces from iraq or prohibiting the bush administration from moving forward with a status of forces agreement that could tie the hands of the next administration to design a new policy and a new future with iraq how can anyone in this chamber give this president another blank check for the war in iraq this is the same president who rushed us into war under false pretenses there were no weapons of mass destruction and no ties to al qaeda everything he and his administration have told us has been wrong where is the accountability for me this is one compromise too many it represents one cavein too many it asks congress to roll over and be blind to the consequences of the war for the next 9 months or so five years after the invasion of iraq the bush administration continues the occupation of iraq with no end in sight more than 4 500 american soldiers and tens of thousands of iraqi civilians have been killed and over 30 000 americans wounded it is long past time for a change in course and this bill does absolutely nothing to bring that about this is george bushs war and he should end it while he is still president i urge my colleagues in the strongest possible terms to oppose this amendment amendment no 1 and demand that this president and his administration begin the safe and orderly withdrawal

integthat are out there but every time rity and greater honor than the genthere is a good idea you have a price tleman from south carolina his disthat has to be attached to that and it trict was very wise to send him to the is not only a price as to what we are united states house of representaspending here but it is also the price tives i want to thank the gentlelady that is paid because neither the private from tennessee who preceded me who nor notforprofit sector is going to fill is one of the most dynamic members we have in this entire body for the clarity and persuasion of her speech a lady who knows how challenging it is for families to be able to put food on the table put gasoline in the car pay for their health care expenses and knows that ultimately it is the family budget that ends up paying for the bloated federal budget now i didnt join the budget committee because i enjoyed numbers in fact i think probably the worst grade i ever made in my life was in an accounting course at texas a m university many many years ago but i joined the budget committee because ultimately the budget is about priorities and i came to this body because j believe america needs greater freedom and greater opportunity and you cant have more freedom and more government you have to choose between one or the other and sometimes especially at a time of challenging economic times you have got to decide which is more important a government check or a paycheck and right now government increasingly is taking a bite out of that family paycheck to pay for bloated washington spending well i dont know if the american people know it but right now the federal government is spending over 23 000 per american family it is the first time since world war ii that the government has spent that much money over 23 000 i wonder how many families that are listening to this debate tonight think they are getting their 23 000 worth out of the united states federal government now some will say government has great needs but you know what its not always how much money you spend in washington that counts its how you spend the money and i want a federal government that does a few things well like guards my family and the families of all americans against radical islamic terrorists i want a federal government that can control our borders i want a federal government that will provide a social safety net for those who are too old too young and too disabled to help themselves but outside of that i want people to go out and have greater freedom and greater opportunity and have the greatest welfare system known to mankind and when i say welfare i mean greater education greater housing greater nutrition that program is called the american free enterprise system and it is under assault and one of the things that is assaulting it is the federal budget now lets talk about the fight that is taking place in congress right now and that is a fight about whether or not americans ought to receive a huge automatic tax increase that our friends on the other side of the aisle the democrats have passed into legislation right now over the next 3 years there will be a huge automatic tax increase on the american people now is that what this economy needs now when people are concerned about their job losses when they are having trouble filling up their ford f150 pickup trucks when they are having trouble buying milk at the grocery store i have a 5yearold and a 4yearold and theyre very thirsty and they drink that milk and it is expensive and so the question right now is should there be a huge automatic tax increase on the american people well the republicans think that there shouldnt be that we shouldnt have a huge automatic tax increase let me tell you what the democrats have passed right now if we dont change this the top tax income bracket will go to 39 6 percent an increase of 13 1 percent now why is that important we always hear well you know this is the wealthy and they need to pay more taxes well you know who files at this rate is small businesses and guess what you cant have capitalism without capital i used to be a small businessman i signed the front of a paycheck i used to sign the back of the paycheck but i signed the front of the paycheok and i have risked capital so now all of a sudden the democrats have put into law a 13 1percent tax increase on hundreds of thousands of small businesses across our nation at the very time when they are trying to meet their payroll what sense does that make madam speaker capital gains the capital of capitalism democrats want to increase taxes on that 33 3 percent if you want to talk about something thats going to send more jobs overseas its increasing the tax rate on capital gains dividends go up 164 percent thats right 164 percent under the automatic tax increases that the democrats are going to impose on us the death tax you have already paid taxes on it once you shouldnt have to visit the undertaker and the irs on the same day and yet that is going to go from zero up to 55 percent the child tax credit is going to get cut in half and the lowest tax bracket for the lowest wage earners in america their taxes are going to increase 50 percent under the democrat plan it is going to go from a 10 percent bracket to a 15percent bracket now is this the recipe that our economy needs i dont think so i dont think so but yet democrats tell us well we need more money because we ve got to do all this washington spending well if you look in the rearview mirror you wilt see that over the last 10 years government has grown by about 75 percent and yet the family budget which has to pay for that federal budget has only grown 30 percent now ultimately something has to give and so again our democrat colleagues tell us well we have to raise taxes and all those tax increases that they want to impose right when the economy is having troubles they say well weve got to raise taxes to somehow balance the budget well if people would look at this chart we dont have a taxation problem we have a spending problem right now the difference between this blue line and red line is this huge massive tax increase that the democrats want to impose upon hardworking american families on farmers on teachers on small businesses and look at how much revenue it gains you and this not to get into too much inside baseball is what we call a static analysis this assumes that raising peoples taxes has no impact on economic growth we know thats not true so given the democrats every single assumption if they do this massive tax increase which is going to amount to roughly 3 000 per american family over the next 3 years it doesnt get anywhere close to the green line thats the spending line that is the line that represents the federal government on automatic pilot that is if no new programs are added that is how much is going to be spent and what does that represent dont take my word for it take the comptroller generals word for it the chief fiduciary officer in the united states government he says that line right there represents either number one a doubling of taxes on our children or it represents a federal government that consists of almost nothing but medicare medicaid and social security and anybody in charge of counting money for the federal government will tell you the same thing where is the ethic in that where is the morality in that imposing that kind of burden on the next generation but no we have so many colleagues that care about the next election and not the next generation almost 6 years ago i got in the next generation business because i have a 5yearold daughter and a 4yearold son and i care desperately about their future so we have to do something about outofcontrol spending and yet our colleagues on the other side of the aisle the democrats every single day they add a new program completely oblivious to the cost on our children and grandchildren the least of these those who cannot vote and those yet to be born if we are to work our way out of the economic challenges we have today much less spare our children and grandchildren a doubling of their taxation to where we would be the first generation in american history to leave the next generation with a lower standard of living if we are going to keep our faith with our forefathers if we are going to show fidelity to the future generations and be good stewards of the american dream we have to defeat these massive democrat tax increases we have to defeat their massive increases in spending it all starts with something we call earmarks congressional earmarks as a dear friend of mine in the senate tom coburn of oklahoma said earmarks are the gateway drug to spending addiction there are too many bridges to nowhere there are too many indoor rainforests there are too many teapot museums and the american people are waking up that all too often somebody in this body has taken a bite out of their paycheck so that some member of congress can keep his the system is broken republicans in this body have called for an earmark moratorium they have called for a select committee to clean up this system where the american people too often see money going into campaign contributions money coming in one end of washington dc and they see earmarks coming out the other end the system is broken it has to be changed and all the democrats have said is nq we are not going to join you they have gone the complete opposite direction i am proud to be a member of this republican conference that is trying to clean up this earmark mess trying to control spending and control taxation so we can get this economy going and americans can keep their jobs and have a brighter future for themselves and their children and their grandchildren i thank the gentleman from south carolina for his leadership and thank the gentleman for yielding me this time"], [0.00022470200201496482, 0.00022470200201496482, 0, "i thank the gentlewoman for yielding i certainly appreciate the gentlewomans leadership at the republican study committee congresss conservative caucus it is a very timely issue that we are discussing today since indeed today is the first day of the fiscal year for the federal government i think for many of us it is easy to sum up the actions of the new democrat majority that is they spend too much and they tax too much it bodes ill for the future of our nation i think that it is important that we step back for a moment and figure out just how much of the peoples money is being spent and it is the peoples money it is not the governments money it is the peoples money today right now the last figure i saw is that the federal government is now spending 23 289 per family of four this is just about the highest level that has been spent since world war ii since i have been on the face of the planet since i was born the federal budget has grown four to five times faster than the family budget ultimstely it is the family budget that has to pay for that since we have been in this 110th congress with the new democrat majority rarely does a day go by that there is not a new opportunity to begin a new government program on top of the roughly 10 000 federal programs spread across 600 agencies that already exist it kind of begs the question how much government is enough because we know that as government grows our freedoms and our opportunities contract this is supposed to be the land of opportunity this is supposed to be the land of freedom yet all we do under this new democrat majority rule is add program after program after program unfortunately all of this new spending imposes a new tax burden on the american people in the budget that the democrat majority passed they includedin it the single highest tax increase in american history when fully implemented over a 5year period this budget will impose approximately 3 000 of additional taxes on the average american family now every single day we come to this floor and we debate and our friends on the other side of the aisle the democrats want to talk about great investments in education great investments in housing and great investments in nutrition that they are going to use all this money for well the challenge is though that every time that they increase some federal budget they are having to decrease some family budget to take it and right now to the tune of 3 000 per american family i often hear from people in the fifth district of texas that i represent i take great pride in representing these people who have entrusted me with their representation in congress i hear from people like the flores family in garland texas i heard this lady say i am a divorced mother with a child in college and a child in day care an increase in taxes of this magnitude would wipe out hope of the first college graduate in the family dont let this happen lets hold the budget down so again what we have here is the democrats are taking money away from a family budget in order to give it to some federal budget we are not always debating how much money we are going to spend on these items but we are debating who is going to do the spending democrats in washington want the bureaucrats in washington to do the spending republicans want families to do the spending the people who actually roll up their sleeves and work hard they work hard trying to make ends meet they have got decisions that they have to make around the kitchen table and this is just one example i hear from lots of my constituents i heard from the lopez family in mesquite i would like to let you know that if our taxes are increased this may mean that we could not continue to finance our childs education i heard from the winters family in tennessee colony stop the wasteful spending i am retired and disabled i am raising three grandchildren sometimes i cant afford my own medicine and here we are this new democrat majority wants to take 3 000 a year away from these hardworking families to fuel their budget not these families budgets but the federal budget now ultimately though it is not just the tax increase that we see right over the horizon that is so challenging it is what is going to happen to future generations and rarely does a day occur that somebody doesnt come to the floor and talk about the need to help the least of these well i often think that the least of these are those who cannot vote and those yet to be born they dont seem to have a sayso in this great debate that we are having today for example dont take my word for it but all this spending that we have seen in washington here is the result dont take my word for it but we right now are literally on the verge of doing something to the next generation that has never been done before imposing such a draconian economic burden on them something that has never been done before that according to the comptroller general the chief fiduciary officer in america we are on the verge of being the very first generation in americas history to leave the next generation with a lower standard of living as the father of a 5yearold and a 4yearold i will not sit idly by and let that happen again dont take my word for it listen to the words of our chairman of the federal reserve who said without early and meaningful action to address federal spending the unitedstates economy could be seriously weakened with future generations bearing much of the cost listen to the gao the general accountability office they talk about government spending particularly entitlement spending as a fiscal cancer that threatens catastrophic consequences for our country and could bankrupt america listen to the famous economist robert samuelson who writes frequently in newspapers all across the nation he says the rising cost of government retirement programs could either increase taxes or budget deficits so much that they could reduce economic growth and this could trigger an economic and political death spiral the congressional budget office the office of management and budget the general accountability office the liberal brookings institution the conservative heritage foundation they all agree that spending is out of control and what is going to happen is in the next generation either the federal government will consist of nothing to speak of but medicare medicaid and social security or youre going to have to double taxes on our children and grandchildren just to balance the budget now we see that hurricane coming over the horizon we see it coming towards us and yet this democrat majority every single day adds to the problem just last week the democrat majority took an insurance program the national flood insurance program that is already going broke was supposed to be selfsustaining through premiums its 20 billion in the red and they add additional coverage to it that could expose the taxpayer to 17 trillion 17 trillion of new liability in just one program alone so that is why its so important that we start tackling the pennies and the nickels and the dimes because we are talking about the priorities of american families we are talking about their opportunities we are talking about their ability to send their children to college we are talking about their ability to save that nest egg to launch their version of the american dream and start their new business we are talking about their ability to pay for their health insurance premiums again every time you increase the federal budget youre having to decrease some family budget i just often wonder when will the madness stop when will we finally figure out that this isnt investment in the future that is divesting our childrens future by spending all of this money the federal budget should not be allowed to grow beyond the family budgets ability to pay for it that is why conservatives in the republican study committee the house conservative caucus support a limitation on the growth of the federal government to force congress to decide amongst some of these priorities among these competing 10 000 federal programs i defy any man woman or child in america to tell me what they all do 10 000 of them it reminds me of what president reagan once said there is nothing as close to eternal life on earth as a federal program they all cost money and they take away from our childrens future so that is why i am so happy that members of the republican study committee have gathered here this evening to talk about the challenges of spending for the future generations and to get together to ensure that we let the american ppople know that we are working to hold the line on spending to bring more accountability to bring more transparency to try to stave off this tax increase of 3 000 per american family and thats for the families today and we are fighting just as hard if not harder to ensure that the children and grandchildren of todays taxpayers are not saddled with a doubling of their taxation so that they would see a lower standard of living that is not the america that we grew up in that is not the moral obligation we have we cannot be that first generation in americas history to leave the next generation with a lower standard of living that is why i am happy to join my fellow members of the republic study committee who have come here to debate this important subject tonight i especially want to thank the gentlewoman from tennessee for her leadership in this hour"], [0.00023334422439802438, 0.00023334422439802438, 0, "this afternoon i want to discuss criminal cases three criminal cases that have occurred in these united states all three of these criminal cases have to dowith law enforcement officers that were prosecuted by thefederal government for alleged crimes that they committed on the southern border with mexico and i want to discuss the facts of each of these cases so that we have a clear understanding on what has occurred on the border and the border war with mexico and how our federal government is so relentless in prosecuting the border protectors and not prosecuting those who come across the border illegally the first case has to do with the border patrol by the name of david sipe david sipe patrolled the texas mexico border down in what is called the mcallen area pinedas texas is exactly where it occurred that is on the tip of texas on the gulf of mexico that borders mexico in april of 2000 he was on patrol as he did for many years as a border patrol agent and a sensor goes off on the border what that means is that people are coming across the border without permission illegals if we can use that phrase david sipe goes to the area where the sensor goes off and he sees 12 to 15 illegals coming across the border agent sipe orders them to stop now first of all we have one patrolman and 15 illegals it takes quite a law enforcement officer to have the courage to stop that many people coming into the united states but he did sobecause that was his responsibility three of those illegals however ignored agent sipe and ran into a brushy area there on the texas mexico border he caught those three individuals and one of those individuals who was illegally in the country a jose guevara attacked border agent sipe and according to border agent sipe guevara was going for the agents weapon while he was being attacked by this illegal so agent sipe pulled out a flashlight it is not just a little flashlight that we normally get over at walmart it is one of those long flashlights and he hit guevara in the head defending himself and the wound on guevaras head required about five stitches later now instead of prosecuting guevara for assaulting the border agent instead of prosecuting guevara for being in the country illegally our unitedstates federal government swoops on the scene and charges agent sipe with using excessive force in the arrest of this illegal the government then gave guevara the illegal and two other illegals what i call get out of jail free cards in other words their crime illegally coming to the united states their crime in my opinion of assaulting a border agent was forgiven with some kind of backroom deal with the promise of those individuals to testify against agent sipe in federal court for using excessive force against these individuals but that is not all your federal government did for these illegals giving them get out of jail free cards also gave them social security cards witness fees and permits allowing them travel back and forth across the border to mexico without any type of intervention and further gave them living expenses or money and finally gave them free government phones to use while they were waiting to testify against sipe so this is the deal they got to testify against the border agent now it has been my experience as a judge in texas for over 22 years trying only criminal cases only serious felony cases that when the prosecution starts making deals with witnesses or law violators and giving them some benefit for testimony they usually get the testimony that the government wants and so what happened in this case the agent was tried he was convicted and the three illegals who got immunity testified against him he was convicted in the year 2006 during the trial the mexican government was involved in this case pursuing and demanding prosecution of agent sipe now lets talk about the rest of the story he is convicted and his case is on appeal but it turns out while his case is on appeal he files a motion for a new trial with the trial judge telling the trial judge that at his own trial the jury should have heard about the deal made to the illegals you see the jury was never told about this backroom deal made with these witnesses the federal judge agreed and ordered a new trial during these hearings the unitedstates attorneys office of course never told the defense that they had given the illegals money or unitedstates documents or imniunity or green cards or social security or cell phones see the government never told the defense that during the trial and they didnt know this deal was made with these illegals and it is found out after the trial and once this is found out brought to the attention of the federal judge the defense saying the jury should have known about this so they could hear and judge the credi bility of these illegals a new trial was ordered and sure enough he was tried again the second jury hearing all the truth the second jury hearing the evidence that the prosecution suppressed in the first trial and the second jury found agent sipe not guilty of any wrongdoing in january of this year so the facts of this case federal government prosecutes the border agent for using force the federal government hides evidence in the trial they are caught hiding evidence a new trial is ordered the new trial occurs the jury hears about the deals made with the illegals and the second jury finds the agent not guilty and properly so agent sipe is trying to get his job back as a border agent but of course our federal government is fighting that situation as well it makes you wonder why our federal government is so relentless in prosecuting border agents especially in a case like this where the person was found not guilty and why must our federal government withhold and hide evidence that is favorable to the defense in a criminal case is it just so they can have convictions of border agents it makes one wonder does it not madam speaker the second case involves one that most americans have heard about two border agents once again on the texas mexico border their names are ramos and compean both of these individuals i have met i have met their families they are wonderful people and both of them all they ever wantedto be was a law officer protecting the unitedstates border from people illegally coming into the united states so while these two individuals are on patrol as border agents on the southern border with mexico agent ramos responded to a call for backup from agent compean along the texas mexico border he had noticed a suspicious van coming into the united states texas if we will and it looked funny and based upon his experience as a border agent a van coming across the river at this desolate area only means one thing to most people that means it is a drug dealer bringing in drugs in the van was an individual by the name of aldretedavila he was a drug smuggler and when he comes across the river he notices the border agents see him he tries to turn the van around and head back to mexico he abandons the van takes off running he gets in a scuffle with one of the border agents right there in the rio grande riverbed he runs on back across the rio grande river shots are fired by both border agents and davila as he is going into mexico is shot in i believe the left cheek and the bullet coming out the right cheek of course no one at the scene neither ramos or compean the border agents knew that they had hit this individual because he disappears he already had somebody waiting for him on the mexican side to pick him up and take him back into mexico someplace they go to the van and in the van sure enough 800 pounds of marijuana now that doesnt mean much to most of us but if we give you a money figure it will be relevant the marijuana in the van was worth approximately 1 million and it is recovered and then the border agents after other border agents appear on the scene are eventually charged with using excessive force against the drug dealer how did this all occur since no one even knew the drug dealer was hurt well it turns out once again our federal government gets involved in this case goes to mexico finds the drug smuggler aldrete brings him back to the united states takes him to a hospital in el paso texas and pays for his recovery and his surgery paid for it that means american taxpayers paid for his surgery and paid for his treatment and while there he decided he is going to sue the federal government that means us the taxpayers for 5 million for being shot by two border agents now it is true ramos and compean probably did not follow appropriate policy in the way they handled the reporting of this incident and so they were suspended they are tried but they are not tried for violating border patrolpolicy they are tried for using excessive force in firing their weapon at this drug dealer as he is fleeing back to mexico part of the reason that they were prosecuted was because like in the first case with sipe the mexican government in its selfrighteous arrogance demanded prosecution of these two border agents and that is exactly what happened they were prosecuted they were tried in federal government court it took forever for us in congress to receive the trial transcript of that trial and they were sentenced to 11 and 12 years in the federal penitentiary for alleged civil rights violations now the federal government the prosecutors in this case made another deal a backroom deal with the drug smuggler they forgave him of his sins of bringing in 1 million worth of drugs if he would testify against the border agents in this trial and he did what was expected of him he testified just exactly the way the federal government wanted him to testify in this case but now there is more to the story it turns out that the drug dealer while waiting to testify after picking up the first case getting immunity from being prosecuted and before the trial it seems as though that our little friendly drug dealer from mexico brings in another 750 pounds of marijuana and the federal government knew about this case the dea investigated the case they made a report i have that report i have seen the report that case is simple to be made in other words it could be a simple prosecution a thirdyear law student could prosecute that case but the federal government doesnt prosecute the drug dealer on the second case they just ignore the second case he is never charged he is never arrested nothing ever happens in the second case and more importantly the jury never heard about the second case and the second deal that our federal government implicitly made for the drug dealer now why is that important first of all it is withholding evidence from the jury and as we discussed it is basic american law that the prosecution may not withhold evidence favorable to the defense they may not withhold it on purpose they may not withhold it because of their negligence and they may not withhold it because of their incompetence if you withhold evidence from the jury that is beneficial to the defense normally the defense is entitled to a new trial also in the trial the drug dealer was made out to be by the prosecution as he testified just a mule and that he was bringing drugs in the united states to get a little money to help his poor sick mama down there in mexico well we understand of course that wasnt the truth he was more than a mule he brought over at least two different times drugs into the united states it kind of puts him up on the ladder a little bit each time the drugs around 1 million of drugs going into our streets and our highways and byways and the prosecution ignored the second case and the jury should have heard about the second case to judge the credibility of the witness and whatdo i mean by judge the credibility of the witness you see when the witness comes in and testifies the jury needs to know what deal the prosecution made with the witness to get him to testify because as i mentioned earlier you usually get the testimony you want when you make a deal with some criminal and in this case the prosecution obviously got the testimony they wanted because ramos and compean were convicted and so the question is why did our federal government in this case choose not to prosecute the drug dealer assume if you will that the border agents violated some policy they probably should have been suspended given some days off for not filling out the forms correctly or reporting it correctly but here on the other hand you have got a drug smuggler bringing in 1 million worth of drugs now why did our federal government choose to prosecute border agents and not prosecute drug smugglers we dont know the answer to that question we may never know the answer to that question but we do know the mexican government in this case as well was involved in relentlessly wanting these two border agents prosecuted they are both now in federal penitentiary serving their 11 and 12year sentences one of them shortly after he went into custody was beat up by people in the local prison because of the fact that he was a border patrol agent and arrested many drug dealers in the past and let me give you a little more information on this particular case when this all came to public light about these two border agents myself and other members of congress wanted to know the facts because the trial transcript had not been produced yet so we met with members of the office of inspector general to try to get a briefing if you will on what happened down there on the border and during that briefing we were told certain things that did not occur we were told that ramos and compean had decided that day they were going to shoot a mexican national at the trial there is no evidence that that ever occurred or any statement was ever made is that misleading members of congress misleading the american public we were also told that ramos and compean did not think the drug dealer had a gun not so during the trial both agents testified they had thought the drug dealer had a gun thus the way the angle of the bullet went through one buttocks and came out the other side as if somebody is pointing a weapon at you that was a falsehood as well it makes us wonder as elected officials why our federal government is not candid with members of congress about the truth of this particular case so in this particular matter the jury didnt hear about the second case and now they are both in prison while their case is on appeal and hopefully the appellate courts will review the entire matter reverse the case order a new trial and let the jury hear all the truth in the second trial like the jury did in the david sipe case now the third criminal case which is even more recent than agents ramos and compean it also occurs in texas it also occurs near the texas mexico border it occurs in a place called edwards county texas probably most americans havent been there edwards county is about the size of delaware and on any given day there are three deputy sheriffs on patrol that is all li 1700 and one of those deputy sheriffs is a person by the name of gilmer hernandez gilmer hernandez was on routine patrol by himself of course they dont have enough manpower to put two people in a patrol car and in the middle of the night he is in the small town of rock springs texas and he notices a truck a suburban runs a red light deputy hernandez pulls over the vehicle he approaches the vehicle and he notices a bunch of people are laying down on the floorboard of this vehicle as he approaches the vehicle according to deputy hernandez the driver takes off swerves around and tries to hit and run over deputy hernandez so what does he do well he pulls out his p0istol and he starts shooting and what is he shooting at the tires just like in the movies i guess deputy hernandez not only shot at the tires he hit them and he blew out at least one maybe two tires the vehicle stops seven or eight illegals jump out and take off running deputy hernandez calls the sheriff tells him exactly what happened what he did the sheriff arrives on the scene the sheriff calls for an independent review or investigation of this entire thing since a shooting was involved and in come the texas rangers many people arent too familiar with the texas rangers but they are in my opinion as fine a law enforcement agency as there is anywhere in the world they work independently of everybody the texas rangers investigate this case and they find that deputy hernandez acted properly throughout the entire matter now one thing i must mention is that while he was firing his weapon at the vehicle one of the bullets ricocheted and hit a passenger in the lip causing minor injuries and that passenger stayed in the vehicle when the others fled but then here comes the mexican consulate with another demand letter to our federal government demanding prosecution of gilmer hernandez for firing his weapon even to protect himself and then the federal government our federal government even though an investigation had already been done by local law enforcement like the cavalry they show up to save the day and gilmer hernandez is prosecuted for unlawfully discharging his firearm even though in my opinion and the opinion of the other law enforcement agencies he did exactly what he was supposed to do now gilmer hernandez was tried and he was convicted and on monday he is going to be sentenced by a federal court for firing his weapon let me tell you a little bit about gilmer hernandez he is a deputy sheriff he is 25 he is married and has a child and patrolling the west texas sands between mexico and texas earns him 21 000 a year he has always wanted to be a lawman he is proud of his service and now he is in jail for enforcing the law so what do we know about the illegals in this case remember they are illegally in the country just like the drug dealer was illegally in the country just like the other three individuals in the sipe case were illegally in the country well our federal government doesnt deport them back to mexico our federal government makes a deal with these illegals and gives those seven or eight illegals green cards so they can stay in the united states and testify against deputy hernandez so it is interesting that these three cases are so similar it is interesting how our federal government has such zeal to prosecute border protectors and why does our federal government immediately take the side of the person that is illegally in the country whether they are an illegal or whether they are a drug dealer or whether somebody assaulted one of our border patrol agents i dont know the answer to that question but they do and what has the effect of that been on our border protectors what effect do you think it is on our border protectors border patrol agents and deputy sheriffs that patrol the southern border with mexico when in doubt they back off why because if they do their job and protect the border as we expect them to do the federal government doesnt back them up the federal government backs up the illegals that come into this country all the while we have got the mexican government back here demanding prosecution of our border protectors it is very disturbing to see this trend and as i mentioned before i was a judge in texas for 22 years i heard about 25 000 felony cases everything from stealing to killing and i heard every kind of defense every kind of story and every kind of accusation against individuals and before that i was a prosecutor in houston texas for 8 years and i dont have any sympathy for criminals i dont care if they are what we consider regular criminals or peace officers that violate the law i even prosecuted five houston police officers one time for beating up an individual of hispanic descent and throwing him in one of our bayous where he later drowned i have no sympathy for criminals whether they wear the badge or dont wear the badge but looking at these three cases makes me wonder why our government is making the choices that it is making i guess as long as we will continue to pursue these three matters we may find the answer now many members of congress on both sides of the aisle have asked the president to pardon ramos and compean that is the presidents decision he hasnt said one way or the other what he is going to do he has the authority under the constitution to pardon people that is his authority and whatever choice he makes i respect that choice but we are also asking for there to be congressional investigations into this entire matter of the prosecution of the~e cases especially in light of the fact that we now find out that the office of inspector general misled several members of congress like myself of what the facts were on the border between mexico and texas and in the ramos and compean case because we just want to get to the bottom of it and find the truth in these matters and especially why our government makes the choices that it does you know last year and this year we are hearing a word tossed around the word is amnesty i am personally opposed to granting amnesty to people who are illegally in the country rewarding them for illegalconduct but we hear about that amnesty all the time but before we start talking about giving amnesty to 15 to 20 million people that are illegally in the country why dont we just give amnesty to about three people two border agents and a deputy sheriff that are behind bars that happen to be american citizens give them amnesty because in my opinion what they have done deserves either a pardon or some form of amnesty and it appears to me that besides really telling our law enforcement officers to back off on protecting the borders this sends a message to other people and those are peopla who want to come into the united states illegally now we hear all of that about people coming over here and looking for a better life and that sort of thing that may be true with some people but not everybody coming over here is looking for a better life people like aldrete are coming over here to make a little money selling dope qver a million dollars worth of it in two cases and failure to protect the border encourages those people to come across the border illegally as well and then there is that other group we havent even talked about t ose people that we still use the phrase of terrorists but since the border is un protected it is much easier to just come right into the united states that way instead of fly ihto reagan international airport right down the street so when we have lawlessness on the border that breeds more lawlessness and failure to protect the borders increases illegal activity failure to support law enforcement agents that are doing their legal job encourages illegal activity into the united states i think all of this is telling us that it appears to me the federal government doesnt have the moral will to protect the borders why do i say that because this is the most powerful country that has ever existed but yet we cannot protect our borders why not becaise we dont have the moral will to do so the united states defends the borders of other nations we send our troops all over the world to defend the borders of other nations korea we have got troops in iraq afghanistan bosnia all over the world but yet we dont protect our own borders why not because maybe we dont have the moral will to do so if we did we could close the borders to any illegals coming into the united states so our federal government needs to get on the right side of the border conflict and that is the american side and what is best for the united states not what is best for illegals not what is best for some foreign country not what is best for drug dealers coming into the united states but what is best for the united states and our federal government needs to get on the right side of the border conflict when i was a judge i always wanted to make sure that in that particular case that justice occurred to quote willie nelson not that he was a great legal mind but he made the comment that justice is the one thing we should always find and that is true justice is the one thing we should always find and hopefully if we bring more light to these law enforcement cases where law enforcement officers are prosecuted for doing their job bring light to the american public that justice will prevail because i do believe in our system i believe in our system of the trial court and the jury and the appellate courts but i also believe in openness and that the jaosecution cannot and should not ever hide evidence that is favorable to the defense and down the road hopefully we will see justice occur that these wrongs will be righted that the innocent will be set free and that the guilty will be prosecuted for their crimes against the united states and against law enforcement officers that protect our border day in and day out now i have been down to the texasmexico border seven or eight times i have been to the californiamexico border i hope all members of congress especially those that live in other parts of the country go to the border to see what it is like it is a volatile area of our country and all you need to do is go down there and see it when i was down at the nuevo laredo sector where there is a high volume of crossings into the united states both legal and illegal i asked a former texas ranger i said what is it like down here give me your opinion and he said well congressman poe after dark on the texasmexico border it gets western it gets western what he meant by that is it gets violent it gets violent sheriff rick flores of webb county texas and webb county is also on the texasmexico border stated not too long ago that it is not unusual to be down on the texas border on the american side and get gunfire from the mexican side coming across shooting at his deputies whom is that from drug cartels fighting over turf it gets western and the people we have asked that have sworn an oath to protect ourborder are the peace officers they wear the badge they are all that stands between us and the lawless and we have the duty to make sure they have the equipment to do that job and fulfill that mission and we have the duty to make sure that when they are in conflict and they have not committed any violation of the law that we totally support them and that we dont give in to the political pressures of other nations i

enjoy widespread bipartisan support but there is controversy and opposition to this legislation because of the manner in which democrats have chosen to conduct the business of this house first there are concerns expressed about the increased setaside for these two programs which will come at the cost of other important research concern and opposition of this bill has come from the head of the small business administration from the white house and from the association of american universities among others which represents 60 leading researech universities across the country typically there would be an opportunity to address these types of concerns through committee action before any bill comes to the house floor but the democrats have chosen to skip past a hearing of the full house science committee on this scientific research legislation theyre just bypassing that step and sending it here to the house floor where the democratcontrolled rules committee decided to further restrict action on the legislation by limiting the number of house members who can offer amendments and they just limited it to just 17 out of 432 members in the house now it is true that my democrat friends on the rules committee have allowed some amendments to be offered on this bill but they have certainly treated themselves very well under this rule democrat members of the rules committee get to offer onethird of the amendments allowed to the entire house out of the 17 amendments that would be made in order under this rule the rules committee democrats get six of them but under the rules that the rules committee wrote 415 members will not be allowed to offer even one amendment restricting debate on the house flopr is really becoming an old habit for the new democrat majority the new democrat majority that pledged to run a more open bipartisan house when they won the election in 2006 the democrat majority has not kept their promise to the american people and have instead passed more closed rules denying all amendments on the house floor than any congress in history and they did it in record time despite this record of shutting down debate in the house the new majority has failed to complete its work and address matters critical to american families small businesses and the economy they failed to meet last weeks april 5 deadline to write a budget for the next fiscal year for example the current farm bill ended last september and our farmers are still waiting for that bill to be finished house democrats have refused to pass the senates bipartisan bill to modernize fisa and to protect our country vital tax relief is set to expire while democrats propose the largest tax increase in american history families workers and small businesses dont need a record tax

according to the aaa the national average for regular unleaded gasoline has gone up 1 18 the cost of gas has gone up more in 15 months than it had gone up in the prior 6 years two years ago tomorrow on april 24 2006 house speaker nancy pelosi then the democrat minority leader issued a press release claiming that house democrats have a commonsense plan to bring down skyrocketing gas prices this was 2 years ago tomorrow two weeks after that press release then minority leader pelosi said that democrats have real solutions that would lower the price at the pump that was 2 years ago just less than 2 years ago but now theyve controlled the house for over a year yet the real solutions and the commonsense plan promised by democrats are nowhere to be seen they pledged to lower gas prices and theyve done nothing gas prices keep climbing i think its time for speaker pelosi to reveal the democrat plan and for this house to be allowed to consider ways to address the rising price of gasoline therefore i will be asking my colleagues to defeat the previous question so that i can amend the rule to make in order any amendment to the underlying bill that would have the effect 9f lowering national average gas price per gallon of regular unleaded gas this house can then debate the rising cost of gas and we can have that debate by defeating the previous question at this time i will

report earlier when the house considered the defense supplemental bill itself i voted for it to ensure that americas soldiers get the equipment and resources they need and the topquality health care they may require when they come home and i think the conference report is an improvement on that house bill as i said when the house debated the initial bill and again during debate on the motion to instruct conferees i did not believe it was a good idea for the bill to include a date certain for withdrawing unitedstates combat troops from iraq so im glad that language has been made more flexible in the conference report it includes a goal of march 2008 for completing the redeployment of unitedstates combat troops and allows sufficient troops to remain to protect unitedstates military and civilians in iraq conduct counterterrorism operations and train iraqi security forces i remain convinced that we should steer clear of arbitrary public deadlines for military actions and focus instead on realistic diplomatic and political goals our military needs flexibility to be able to link movements of unitedstates troops to the realities of the situation on the ground and successful diplomacy requires such flexibility as well my vote for the conference report is not a vote to support the bush administrations policy in iraq we are 4 years into a war the bush administration assured us would be short and decisive the administrations misjudgments lack of planning and poor leadership have made a bad situation worseand the tactic of increasing troops for a temporary surge is no substitute for what is needed namely a strategy for containing civil war and a wider regional war but whatever may be said about the wisdom of invading iraq 4 years agoand i am one who believed it was a mistake to do sothe fact is that we are still deeply engaged in iraq so long as our troops are ih the field we must provide them what they need beyond supplying our soldiers however we must extricate them from what objective defense experts have characterized as an emerging civil war disengaging from that civil war is the purpose of the provisions in the conference report designed to hold the president accountable to the benchmarks set by his own administration and the iraqi govemmentricluding enactment of a hydrocarbon law conducting of provincial and local elections reform of current laws governing the debaathification process amendment of the constitution of iraq and allocation of iraqi revenues for reconstruction projects i strongly support that approach because i am convinced that holding the president and the iraqi government accountable for achieving these benchmarks will provide us with the leverage necessary to pressure the iraqi government to forge the political solution we all know is required in fact defense secretary gates has acknowledged that this provision in the housepassed bill has been helpful by showing the iraqis that american patience is limited this conference report is an important step toward what i think must be our goala responsible end to the war in iraq based on a strategy of phased withdrawal of troops accelerated diplomacy and redeployment that is based on iraqi stability and not arbitrary deadlines the conference report fully funds our troops providing 4 billion more for the troops than the president requested it honors our veterans providing 1 8 billion more for our veterans unmet health care needs including additional funds for treatment of post traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury care and research it strengthens our military providing 2 billion more to create a strategic readiness reserve and address the serious readiness crisis our military is facing it also protects our troops by limiting deployment schedules and setting minimum readiness standardsbased on current defense department standardsfor unitedstates troops deploying to the region the president could waive these requirements but only by certifying in writing to congress that waiving them would be in the interest of national security the conference report also provides 52 5 billion for military operations in iraq and afghanistan and provides 9 7 billion for the afghan and iraqi security forces to help them assume greater responsibility for their nations security and the conference report includes 3 1 billion to fully fund the pentagons fy07 request for the 2005 base realignment and closure commissions recommendations which is vitally important for ft carson as it prepares to expand and for other military installations in colorado on the nonmilitary side the conference report includes critically important funding for farmers and ranchers in southeastern colorado who were recently hit hard by winter storms thousands of cattle were killed in storms worse than the october 1997 storm that killed approximately 30 000 cattle and cost farmers and ranchers an estimated 28 million the struggles that family agriculture producers and small counties face are significant and are having a negative impact on the livelihood of hundreds of farmers and ranchers and their communities so i am pleased that the colorado delegation was successful in persuading the conferees to include financial assistance for farmers and ranchers including for those affected by colorados recent blizzards many of us who voted against authorizing the president to rush to war in iraq were worried that while it would be easy to eliminate the saddam hussein regime the aftermath would be rfeither easy nor quick sadly our fears have proven to be justified and now as the pentagon has finally admitted in its most recent quarterly report the situation in iraq is properly descriptive of a civil war insisting on keeping our troops in the middle of that kind of internecine war is not a recipe for victory it is only a prescription for quagmire and as a new foreign relations council report notes we bear responsibility for developments within iraq but are increasingly without the ability to shape those developments in a positive direction we need to be scaling back our military mission in iraq we need to make the unitedstates military footprint lighternot in order to hasten defeat or failure in iraq but to salvage a critical measure of security and stability in a region of the world that we can ill afford to abandon but as we do so we must work to avoid a collapse in the regionnot only because we have a moral obligation to the people of iraq but also because our national security has been so badly compromised by the bush administrations failures there the presidents decision to take the nation to war has made our country less safe we need to change course and chart a path that enhances our national security and sets the right priorities for the war on terrorism and struggle against extremists this conference report begins to chart this path and i will support it i hope the president

"managed only a couple of months ago there is no reason for the house to be considering this rule except perhaps one and thats so that the democrat majority can deny republicans their rights as the minority party democrats are going to get their way at the end of the day majorities always do that but in putting this rule on the floor democrats are saying that they neednt even bother with respecting minority rights this rule exists solely as an abuse of power when democrats won control of the congress in 2006 they promised the american people that they would run the most open and honest house in history they would seek to work in a bipartisan manner instead of keeping that promise the democrat majority has stooped to depths and gone to extremes that no previous majority in the house has ever dared when it comes time to shutting down debate silencing ideas restricting minority rights ignoring rules they themselves wrote and running the house in a topdown shutup sitdown manner this democrat majority has no peer the democrat promise to run the most open honest house in history has been revealed as a hollow charade they have passed more closed rules that block all amendments and debate than any house in history they wrote new rules to prohibit votes from being held open to change the votes outcome and then violated that rule time after time they passed new rules to ensure house and senate conference committeesare more open and public but instead they turn around and retreat evbn further behind closed doors they almost totally abandon even holding conference committees why is this rule suddenly on the house floor today why the sudden interest of democrats in the house to go to conference with the senate on a budget the house passed their version of the budget on march 13 the senate passed their version on march 14 today is may 14 why didnt we go to conference 2 months ago never mind of course that the law sets april 15 as the deadline for congress to pass a final budget resolution the facts are that this house could and should have gone to conference 2 months ago but democrats have instead hid behind closed doors to negotiate bargain and cut deals to write a final budget by reading media reports it appears the democrat majority in the house and senate have reached a final agreement on the final budget for fiscal year 2009 that agreement will apparently increase spending by billions of dollars and include the largest tax increase in history so now they apparently are going to go to a phony conference after all the true tax and spend work has been done in secret they arent doing this to be more open and honest they are doing this to force through their plan to massively increase taxes and increase government spending the news media also reports that the democrat majority has abandoned another of their promises it made to the american people when they wrote the new law for the house that is known as paygo this is a rule that was sought by the blue dog democrats this rule places a blanket requirement that any bill that lowers taxes or increases spending must be correspondingly offset under the secret budget agreement it appears that the democrat paygo rule was jetti soned blue dog democrats have given up on their rule and their paygo principle they traded an enforceable house rule for a meaningless promise from a senator its meaningless because everyone knows that this one senator will in all likelihood be overridden by his senate colleagues one can respect my colleagues on the other side of the aisle for standing on principle but this is a principle thats being abandoned this rule isnt necessary the democrats already have all the power they need to go to conference so the only reason we are here is because the majority is trying to restrict the rights of the minority to be heard and for the republicans to have a fair opportunity to offer alternative proposals to legislation americans care about most taxing and spending we are being blocked shut down and unfairly restricted in our rights and as a result our constituents will potentially be subjected to higher taxes and more government spending i really dont think americans want that when it comes to democrat plans for billions of dollars in new government spending republicans have the right to protest to demand votes in the house to have the voices of members representing almost half of this country to be heard we especially have the right to protest the democrat majoritys writing of a 200 billion appropriations bill that just completely skips over any hearing or markup in the appropriations committee instead of passing a bill to fund our troops who are fighting to protect america democrats are shortcircuiting the legislative process shutting out republicans and larding the bill up with billions knd billions of dollars of unrelated spending right now upstairs in the capitol on the third floor the house rules committee is meeting to consider this massive 200 billion supplemental spending bill the text of this bill was just released an hour be fore the committee met it never went before the appropriations committee republicans have obviously just had minutes to read the bill this is wrong and is abuse of power by the democrat majority the american people deserve to have a more open process on how their tax dollars are spent so i repeat again that this rule is totally unnecessary democrats already have the power to go to conference theyre just 2 months late in doing so the democrats have broken their promise to the american people to operate the house in an open and honest manner they are conspiring in secret to write a budget that increases taxes by the largest amount in history and use a vital troop funding bill to try to pass billions and billions of new dollars in unrelated government spending so for these reasons i urge my colleagues to oppose this rule i reserve the balance of my

exactly what congress did the last 2 years cutting nih research grants by over 500 grants well weve stopped that in january we reversed the presidents cuts and this bill adds another 1 billion above

percent below the 1980 level and by 2012 to a level 57 percent below 1980 thats hardly runaway rse h7899 growth that is a steady bleed of americasquality of life and americas future for the president to borrow 1 2 trillion to pay for tax cuts and 600 billion to pay for iraq including another 140 billion next year and then pretend that this modest 2 percent difference with him is the cause of fiscal irresponsibility is sheer nonsense and many enlightened republicans knew it these investments are not just fiscally responsible they are necessary for the future health and strength of the

rule they exploded from zero to over 3 000 this bill has cut back the dollar level for earmarks to half the level in the 2006 bill exactly twotenths of 1 percent of the total funding in this bill go for congressionally directed earmarks and let me also point out that the amount of dollars in spending directed by the congress is a tiny fraction of the amount directed by the administration first for instance the administration in this bill requests specific earmarks 10 million for reach out and read 10 million for teach for america 9 million for the points of light foundation 4 5 million for americas promise 1 7 million for the mind and body institute 1 4 million for the ymca on top of that in 2006 alone the health and social services department directed spending of 1 9 billion through 21 000 contracts that were less than fully competed that alone is more than seven times the amount of congressionally directed spending in this bill in the labor department 90 percent of discretionary

the federal trade commission chairman majoras secretary of the treasury paulson and internal revenue service commissioner everson to express my concerns that consumers who visited these sites might provide the operators with personally identifiable information and tax return information enabling the operators to either market or sell this information to others or to sell and market all manner of products and services to these taxpayers a consumer survey and study presented to the irs and ftc in early january of this year by the computer and communications industry association suggested that a

percent of those surveyed believed the site represented the intemet address of the internal revenue service even after viewing the site 1 3 of those surveyed still believed the site was the irs

and china at the u n security council and the refusal of some of our european and asian allies to sacrifice commercial interests for the sake of nonproliferation 1415 just last wednesday iranian leader ahmadinejad said that u n resolutions could not prevent iran from obtaining nuclear technology he stated lets say that they issue resolution number 300 what will happen it should be remembered that iran is obtaining nuclear technology they will have to eventually accept that well for almost 5 years iran has been manipulating the socalled international community buying time to expand to strengthen and to hide its nuclear activities in fact recent public reports further document the construction of a major tunnel complex inside the mountain near the iranian facility at natans near the fortified buildings where the iranian uranium is reportedly being processed this clearly illustrates the frenetic and advanced nature of that regimes nuclear weapon pursuit and should increase our sense of urgency but the regimes pursuit of these destructive policies has one weakness irans energy infrastructure irans economy and its ability to influence events is heavily dependent on the revenues derived from energy exports as such recent unitedstates efforts to prevent iran from acquiring weapons of mass destruction have focused on deterring and prohibiting investments in irans petroleum sector unitedstates law prohibits american firms from investing in iran in addition the iran sanctions act seeks to influence responsible nations to stop their investment in irans energy sector that is the economic lifeline of the regime by calling for sanctions on those entities unfortunately due to lack of enforcement lack of commitment from some of our allies foreign entities which fall outside of the jurisdiction of our country continue to invest in iran helping to fill the coffers enabling the regime in tehran to pursue not just a nuclear capability but a chemical and biological program longrange ballistic missiles and as all of us know they are a state sponsor of global islamic extremism and terrorism as part of their effort to isolate iran and deprive it of its revenues it needs to fund its nuclear weapons program my distinguished colleague chairman lantos and i introduced the iran freedom support act which was enacted into law in september of last year this legislation strengthens sanctions against those who invest in irans petroleum sector the economic lifeline of the iranian regime however the final version of the law did not include language that would make export credit agencies insurers and other financial institutions subject to sanctions for their facilitation of investments in irans oil industry the bill before us h r 957 seeks to close this loophole the imminent need to close this loophole and to compel responsible nations to do the right thing was clearly articulated in february of this year by ambassador george schulte the chief unitedstates representative to the international atomic energy agency ambassador schulte called on european governments to stop giving credits to subsidize exports to iran and to take more measures to discourage investment and financial investment with iran it is my hope that despite the clarifications included in the suspension text at the request of other committees that h r 957 is applied vigorously against those governments that claim to support our efforts to stop irans nuclear pursuit but fail to take tangible actions to deny the regime the resources to continue along this destructive and dangerous path h r 957 also seeks to expand the activities covered under the law to include petrochemicals and liquefied natural gas concerns were raised that existing law required the clarification that sanctions under the isa should apply to certain foreign subsidiaries of unitedstates companies therefore h r 957 expands and extends the applications to unitedstates foreign subsidiaries as defined in the bill this is a straightforward bill with a simple purpose to enhance our ability to deprive iran of the revenue it needs to fund its nuclear weapons and to secure greater cooperation from european asian russian and other allies to cut off the flow of funds to iran responsible nations must immediately stop their multimillion and in some cases billion dollar investments in irans energy sector i strongly urge my colleagues to support this critical bipartisan measure to confront the iranian threat i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.0014759302139282227,
