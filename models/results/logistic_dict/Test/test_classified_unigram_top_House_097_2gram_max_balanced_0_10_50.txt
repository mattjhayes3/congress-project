again has presented an alternative budget plan that offers this nation the promise of strong economic recovery rather than the continued pain of unemployment high interest rates and runaway deficts this alternative is necessitated by the fact that this current administration continues to make excuses for its bankrupt economic policies which are bankrupting our nation we are told to just wait intil our economic recovery program takes effect we have been waiting now for 8 months with these results interest rates are the highest in history 16 million americans are either out of work working parttime or so discouraged that they no longer even look for work the housing industry is in the worst condition since world war ii business failures and farm foreclosures are running at the highest levels since the great depression this litany could go on and on but suffice it to say that if the congress had enacted last year the congressional black caucus economic recovery plan instead of president reagans we would not be suffering the economic contractions that are now wreaking havoc with our nation there is no joy however in pointing out that the congressional black caucus last year predicted the misery and human suffering that would occur as a result of the adoption of the reagan economic program the reagan record hs all too clearly shown that the congressional black caucus was right the congressional black caucus is right again this year we have once again met the presidents challenge to put up or shut up we put up once again a fair and sound budget proposal which will rescue our nation from devastating and debilitating deficits unemployment and economic stagnation the fauntroy alternative controls federal spending not by pushing millions more americans into poverty not by a continued assault on the nations young disadvantaged and poor but by an assault on wasteful military spending extravagant tax breaks to wealthy citizens and irresponsible tax subsidies for profitable corporations the fauntroy substitute rejects the reagan economic shell game which redistributes income from the poor and middle class to the rich more than any other alternative the cbc alternative embodies creative and comprehensive tax reformstopping the raid on the federal treasury through tax breaks for those who least need them rather the cbc alternative restructures the presidents tax cut to principally benefit those earning less than 50 000 per year moreover our alternative provides real tax relief to the poor and middle class by increasing the standard deduction and earned income tax credit the fauntroy substitute proves that fiscal responsibility can be achieved while maintaining compassion and concern for the american people by implementing tax reform and by reducing military expenditures the cbc budget would reduce the projected fiscal year 1983 deficit to 97 billion by 1985 a surplus of 4 2 billion would result let me emphasize once again that fiscal responsibility need not come at the expense of the poor and disadvantaged in our society the republican party platform for 1980 said the measure of a countrys compassion is how it treats the least fortunate yet we now know that this republican administration has systematically dismantled every program which was created to serve our least fortunate under the cbc budget the american tradition of compassion and concern for the needy and destitute would be restored to address the totally unacceptable rate of unemployment among our people the cbc alternative includes 6 billion for a desperately needed jobs program to train and put people who want to work back to work additionally the cbc budget restores funding for important education programs such as title 1 and student financial aid in order to maintain an investment in our human capital and in our future by educating our young people other vital national needs in housing social services and transportation which the reagan budget fails miserably to address are best met under the cbc alternative budget in short there is a way to move this nation toward the goal of reduced inflation without throwing millions of americans out of work there is a way to reduce the federal deficit without taking school lunches away from hungry children and snatching costofliving adjustments from the elderly there is a way to lower interest rates and to restore confidence in our economy without slamming the door on thousands of small businessmen and farmers the way is the fauntroy substitute i have a special concern in the area of health care and waut to discuss with my colleagues the cbc alternative budget proposals in this regard the fauntroy subutitute recommends that 85 5 billion be spent on health care programs in fiscal year 1p83 in order to provide the resources necessary to treat and prevent disease care for sick workers mothers children and the elderly this amount is a full 7 5 billion more than the reagan budget and 5 5 oillion more than the budget committee alternative as cochairman of the congressional black caucus health brain trust i enjoy the benefit of the special expertise of hundreds of experienced health care professionals throughout the country these health care professionals are appalled and rightly so about the ruthless impact of last years budget cuts on the ability of poor and disadvantaged americans to obtain high quality medical care it is all too obvious that the great progress that we have made in the last decade in expanding the availability and affordability of health care from inner city communities to isolated rural towns is swiftly being undermined last year 1 billion was slashed from the medicaid program forcing states to cut benefits and limit eligibility for the poor and working poor as a result over 1 million people lost med icaid coverage virtually all of the losers were women and children in lowincome families thousands of families with incomes at or below the poverty line when faced with overwhelming medical care costs have had to quit their meager paying jobs and go on welfare in order to keep or obtain vital medicaid coverage we believe that it is unconscionable to impose this type of pain and hardship on the poorest and most disadvantaged segment of the population the cbc budget therefore restores those cuts in medicaid imposed last year and maintains a basic level of medicald coverage for the millions of women children and lowincome famtlies who depend upon the government for basic health care similarly the fauntroy substitute restores cuts imposed last year in medicare and rejects any cuts for fiscal year 1983 more than 90 percent of medicare enrollees are senior citizens who have the greatest health care needs in this nation senior citizens have the highest percentage of heart attacks and the greatest number of strokes they are the individuals who for the most part have the greatest incidence of cancer and suffer the greatest incidence of crippling and debilitating disease moreover in addition to being the most sick the elderly suffer the double disadvantage of being sick and poor one out of six senior citizens is poor one out of every two black elderly is poor or marginally poor the cbc finds untenable any proposals which penalize our senior citizens and ask them to use their already limited resources to pay more for medical care the cbc also rejects as foolish and shortsighted any freeze in spendling on such vital health programs as maternal and child health alcohol drug abuse and mental health rervices health manpower and biomedical research additional spending in these areas now only serves to save money in the long run no where is the cost effectiveness of a strengthened federal investment in health care more evident than in the area of biomedical research the economic losses from illness and diseases which we still are unable to prevent and cure run into the billions of dollars last year i had the pleasure of hearing testimony from 10 nobel laureates who spoke about the fact that our nation is becoming scientifically and technologically illiterate they spoke about the need for more funding for biomedical research in order to maintain a leadership position in advancing new knowledge about medical care in order to continue progress in understanding the causes of disease and illness the cbc budget provides additional fundiqg to maintain a strong federal investment in biomedical research let us remember that the debate about health programs and out the larger federal budget is otri simply a debate about numbers and dollars and cents it is about human beingschildren parents elderly it is about their successes and failures it is about their hopes and dreams the cbc budget is an alernative which will allow all america te to enjoy human dignity and a high qusiity of life i urge my colleagues to support the fauntroy substitute"], [0.013283610343933105,

the fallacy of feeding the fat and starving the lean economics for those who care to think objectively and to heed commonsense i am inserting into the record the report of the national advisory council on economic opportunity a governmental agency which the congress created warning us that the blunderuss budget cuts in social program will lead not to price stability and a sounder economy but more crime poverty welfare dependency and general social and economic chaos the councils statement follows the national advisory council on economic opportunity today sharply criticized the reagan administrations proposed cutbacks in federal incometransfer and antipoverty programs saying that the effect of these cuts will be to cause massive suffering as well as to undermine the work ethic and family life among the poor the administrations proposed cutbacks of these crucial federal programs warned the council in releasing its final report will severely deepen the crisis of poverty in the future and could drive whole segments of our society toward hopelessness and despair instead the report calls for passage of the economic opportunity act and continuation of the legal services corporation two programs that are essential to the wellbeing of the more than 29 million americans still living in poverty in a separate statement arthur 1 blaustein chairman of the council said by separating economic theory from social policy and pursuing the former at the expense of the latter the administration has adopted a strategy of brinksmanship that could lead to social chaos there is a price to be paid for the reduction of human and social services the price is that these cuibicks will not reduce crime they will increase it they will not reduce the use of drugs they will increase it they will not reduce alcoholism they will increase it they will not reduce physical and mental illness they will increase it they will not promote better family life they will destabilize it they will not increase respect for the law they will weaken it at present there exists an air of suspended disbelief over the radical changes that have occurred in the past two months that is because the layoffs the shutdowns the cutbacks and the reduced paychecks have not yet reached ground level but the day of reckoning will come shortly october 1 1981 will be remembered as a day of infamy for it will mark the worst massacre of social and human service programs in american history the report the american promise equal justice and economic opportunity addresses itself specifically to the issues of unemployment inflation women in poverty the implementation of human and social service programs citizen participation and volunteerism and the myths of poverty the 15member council established by congress in 1967 and appointed by the president is responsible for making an annual report to the president and congress on programs and policies aimed at helping the poor it is slated for abolition by this administration attacking what it termed persistent myths about poverty in the united states the council presented evidence that disputed what it termed the mistaken view of some economists that the reduction in the proverty population had been a result of growth ini the private economy the council maintained that for some time such growth has ceased to trickle down to the poor in the farm of more jobs better income and a more rewarding and productive role in society and the council reaffirmed its belief that only those comprehensive and national economic revitalization efforts targeted specifically toward dissadvantaged communities and the jobless would effectively combat poverty in the 1980s a strategy that the administration is abandoning in addition to releasing the report the council issued the following statement seventeen years ago this nation made an historic commitment to reduce if not eliminate poverty in america the economic opportunity act was conceived with moral conviction and dedicated to the proposition that all americans even the 36 million poor were entitled to both opportunity and equal access to the law the act itself called for a national effort to attack the causes of poverty and related social problems which were national in character and scope all the testimony given to the council over the past several years has shown that these federal programs do work that they do help people get out of poverty and that the delivery systems are providing the necessary basic human and social services thus after fifteen years of progress in our nations effort to relieve poverty when in fact the number of poor had by 1980 been reduced by 11 million and millions more have been kept above the poverty line this council is deeply concerned that the process will be reversed by recent policy decisions by the administration that will serve not only to increase the number of poor but to make their burden more severe the three aspects of the administrations economic recovery program that gravely concern the council are 1 the massive acrosstheboard cuts in social and human service programs 2 the abolition of delivery systems provided for in the economnic opportunity act and the legal services corporation act 3 the transfer of federal authority and program responsibility to the states through block grant programs in evaluating the impact of these changes on the poor we believe that each of these decisions taken alone would be painful but taken together they will be absolutely devastating this council under four presidents two republicansand two demo crats has consistently taken the position that the federal government must maintain active responsibility for pursuing the goals of the economic opportunity act this has never beena partisan issue and it should not be one now the council vigorously reaffirms its earlier recommendations that the economic opportunity act and the legal services corporation act should be reauthorized the council is well aware that the economic difficulties facing our nation are complex and often seem overwhelming but these difficulties cannot be used as an excuse for reneging on our social and moral commitments as a nation we are deeply troubled by the notion that national issues ones that require national policy and programs and that are a part of our national purpose should suddenly devolve to the states the issue is not federal versus 9tate responsibility rather it is the dimunition or avoidance of any national standards of responsibility and accountability to deflect suspend or fragment responsibility and accountability suggests that we are either renouncing or failing to assert our moral purpose as a nation worse than that the administration seems to be denying that this moral purpose exists the effect of the block grant proposal as opposed to the economic opportunity act and the legal services corporation act is to destroy existing support systems that are effective that have a proven capacity to deliver services and that utilize local planning and implementation capabilities they are being replaced by a new system that has a poor track record and is restrictively financed more bureaucratic less accountable ans more subject to intense political pressures the last point is extremely important in that effective and efficient use of limited federal funds is in danger of being thwarted by conflicting political interests in each state after reviewing the recent budget process it appears that there has been a massive transfer from basic human and social services to our military budget the council seriously questions whether it is in the national interest to relegate a substantial number and social service programs to the junkpile while we increase the stockpiling of weapons of mass destruction in an arms race where overkill has long been achieved moreover these changes are occuring without any serious national debate when advocates of balanced national priorities are dismissed by the president as representatives of special interests and critics of the administrations policy are referred to as demagogues in criticizing the administrations sharp cutbacks in social programs the councils statement emphasized the negative impact of these cutbacks on work and family life from an administration that places high priority on the importance of faily life and the work ethic it said this budget will be selfdefeating the council cited the following analyses drawn from its own research and other recent studies in support of its statement that these policies will actually encourage dependency instead of work family breakdown instead of family stability the council cited an estimate by the congressional budget office that proposed cuts in public service employment under the comprehensive employment and training act ceta would result in a net loss of between 210 000 and 330 000 jobs in fiscal years 1981 and 1982 causing a sharp rise in expenditures for welfare and unemployment insurance the loss of these jobs the council pointed out would be compounded by cuts in support services which range from child care to mass transit creating a spiral effect that will deal a devastating blow to the realistic job prospects of hundreds of tihousandsof disadvantaged workers the council cited an estimate by the wharton economic forecasting associates that about threequarters of a million jobs would be lost through cuts in ceta alone and an additional million as a result of the administrations program reductions as a whole the council singled out proposed cuts in the aid to families with dependent children afd c program as an example of how the reality of the administrations budget departs from its rhetoric citing independent studies by the congressional budget office and the university of chicagos center for the study of welfare policy the council noted that the bulk of cuts in afdc are concentrated on families who are presently working but do not now earn enough to maintain an adequate living the council pointed out that welfare recipients who work will have their incomes cut by an average of more than 20 percent versus a 4 percent reduction for those who do not work and in some states the administrations proposed changes will eliminate the difference between what an afdc family can receive if no one works and the income it can receive with a fulltime worker noting that this sharply penalizes the working poor the council commented that tile administration apparently feels that only the rich need incentives to work the council said that families with young childrenespecially minority families and families headed by womenwould be among the worst victims of thle hardships imposed by the administrations cuts citing an analysis by the congressional budgct office the council pointed out that of those families that are expected to lose a substantial portion of their spendable income from reductions in public service jobs af dc food stamps and the school lunch program over twothirds are headed by women and almost two out of five are nonwhite referring to thle university of chicago study the council noted that a singleparent faily with two children could lose up to 30 percent of its disposable income from reductions in afdc food stamps and child nutrition programs alone in rejecting the administrations contention that renewed economic growth will eventually trickle down to the poor to offset these losses the council declared that it flies in the face of everything we know about poverty today tile council cited new evidence in this years report affirming that growth in the private economy has had a declining role in reducing poverty and that virtually all of the reduction in poverty since the mid1960s has come about through the expansion of social insurance and incometransfer programs of the kind now under attack by the administration though poverty increased most dramatically in the hardhit declining cities of the northeast and midwest the report says poverty rates also remained disturbingly stable even in those cities characterized by strongoccasionally phenomenalgrowth in jobs and income in short economic growth has had little impact in decreasing poverty rates in recent years even in the boom cities of the southwest the stubborn persistence of poverty in the face of economic growth the council pointed out in its statement results in part from the changing nature of thle poverty population what tile report terms the new poor are increasingly a population of those whom the private economy has passed by even in good times thle council noted these peoplethe aged the disabled disadvantaged youth women heading families with small childrenare rarely hired by the private sector in 1978 a year of economic recovery thle unemployment rate among disadvantaged minority youth was 41 percent among afdc recipients one of the groups most harshly affected by the administrations cuts nearly 70 percent are clilldren more than twothiirdls of them 11 years old or younger among the adults thle overwhelming majority nre women heading fainiliesabout 80 percent of whom are either required as fulltime homemakers disabled or already in training at work or seeking work because few of these people can be absorbed into the private economy without special assistance and support said the council the massive suffering these program cuts will bring cannot be balanced by any credible longrange benefits from the administrations programeven under the hi 6769 most optimistic economic assumptions instead the council declared any economic renewal resulting from the administrations policies would take place at the expense of stable rewarding family lives and genuine work opportunities for the poor and their children mr lllaustein chairman of the council added that we are watching a great tragedy unfurl before us the steady drumbeat of rhetoric emanating from administration officials and shrewdly orchestrated by the white house is intended to create and has heretofore succeeded in creating a counterreality and new myths with respect to social policy for example by continuously referring to economic opportunity and equal justice programs as welfare programs the administration has misled the american public these programs are in fact designed to achieve the opposite to create jobs and economic opportunities and to encourage people who are dependent upon welfare to become productive citizens and taxpayers by seeking to eliminate these programs and substituting its own policies the administration will deny upware mobility to millions on welfare and will force many of the working poor into welfare dependency by shifting program authority from the federal government to the states through block grants the administration has created a bureaucratic nightmare that will result in government by provisional catastrophe by transferring huge amounts of funds from human and social services to defense the administration is not dampening inflation it is fueling it in order to gain support for its economic package the administration has conjured up the specter of an economic dunkirk what it is perpetuating is a social pearl harbor which will have a devastating impact on the poor who are defenseless as well as wiping out the modest gains made in the past fifteen years by women the elderly minorities and the youngthe most vulnerable segments of our society"], [0.013982057571411133, 0.9860179424285889, 1, "i

countless thousands of jews during the holocaust at great personal risk and sacrifice amply justifies this nation conferringupon him its highest honor by proclaiming him an honorary citizen of the united states mr wallenberg undertook his perilous mission at the behest of the united states and the american war ref ugee board the passage of house joint resolution 220 will represent a ringing affirmation of americas commitment to the survival of the jewish people and our tremendous esteem for someone who risked his own life to try to save so many jewish lives from nazi extermination a number of bills have been introduced over the years to confer honorary citizenship on various persons but the only successful effort to date related to sir winston churchill the conferral of honorary citizenship on raoul wallenberg however will not establish a precedent for similar action on behalf of a number of other heroic figures the fact that our action today will not serve as such a precedent is clear for a number of reasons raoul wallenbergs valiant efforts to save thousands of jews from the holocaust provide an appropriate basis for distinguishing this bill from bills introduced on behalf of others conferral of honorary citizenship on wallenberg unlike any other honorary citizenship bill congress has considered heretofore will symbolize our commitment as a nation to remember the holocaust and vigilantly guard against the possibility of any recurrence congressman lan~os who introduced this joint resolution testified before the subcommittee on immigration refugees and international law thatwe need to establish a clear record for posterity that america through wallenberg did act to prevent the holocaust in its final days during the subcommittee hearings i requested congressman lirrros to develop this idea further and place mr wallenbergs actions in the context of other actions or even inaction by the united states to prevent the holocaust congressman lairros answer i believe should be brought to the attention of the house and for that reason i will quote from it at some length it is important to underscore that wallenberg was not a diplomat wallenberg was a young man living in the comfort and safety and affluence of neutral stockholm during the brutal closing days of world war 11 he left behind a most promising career as the son of swedens most prominent family the safety the security the comfort of stockholm to voluntarily assume the task of saving human lives so raoul wallenberg did not think of this mission himself this was not an activity that stemmed from his own plans it was a mission that he tundertook at the specific request of the secretary of state of the united states the united states thtrefoe bears a very heavy responsibility for the untold numbers of years that this young swede spent under the nightmarish conditions of the gulag archipelago whether he died earlier or whether he is alive today it is we the united states who are responsible for his tragedy and for his lost life a great deal of criticism has emerged over the course of years concerning the failure of the western powers to act in decisive ways to stop the slaughter questions such as why werent the railroads bombed why wasnt there an attempt to liberate the camps earlier here is a tangible demonstration that the united states officially acted and successfully acted to save approximately 100 000 people our record for world war ii is a better record because of the actions of raoul wallenberg undertaken at our own behest honorary citizenship is singularly appropriate in the wallenberg case not only because of the place the holocaust occupies in the history of human depravity and our national commitment to the survival of the jewish people the fact that wallenberg acted at the behest of the united states and suffered untold misery as a result of it establishes our interest as a nation in giving this special recognition to him the soviet union in addition never satisfactorily has accounted for what happened to mr wallenberg the conferral of honorary citizenship on him may give the united states added leverage with the soviet union in determining whether he is still alive and possibly in securing his release honorary citizenship is exactly what its designation impliesnamely an honor that does not confer on either mr wallenberg or any members of his family any rights or privileges under the immigration and nationality act the concept of honorary citizenship must be distingished clearly from citizenship itself no member of mr wallenbergs family as a result of our action today can possibly claim any derivative rights under our laws even mr wallenberg himself will not be recognized as an american citizen under united states domestic law or under international law if he is found to be still alive conferral of honorary citizenship in no way can be described as giving away anything tangible the meaning and significance of our action today is entirely symbolicbut it is a critically important symbolic gesture in an age when many nations treat human life so cavalierly a few of the statements in the legislative record underscore the critical significance of the step we are about to take today secretary of state alexander m haig jr said that mr wallenbergs contribution during the dark days or world war ii in hungary stands out as a beacon to all those who respect human rights and dignity he expressed his full support for this legislation assistant secretary of state richard fairbanks informed the judiciary committee thatthe conferral of honorary unitedstates citizenship on wallenberg would serve to underscore the seriousness with which the american government and people view sovietbehavior in the wallenberg case conferral of honorary unitedstates citizenship on wallenberg would also serve to reaffirm to the government of sweden that the united states firmly supports the quest to resolve wallenbergs fate former secretary of state edmund muskie informed two subcommittees of the house committee on foreign affairs that the chronological record of state department and war refugee cables and conmnunications 0 documents the unitedstates governments position of responsibility for the selection of wallenberg the directive and funding for his activities the appreciation for his work and the deep distress over his disappearance mr muskie concluded that its isthe uniqueness the extraordinary link between a man raoul wallenberg and our nations conscience that makes this action appropriate mr muskie went on to say raoul wallenbergs mission on behalf of the united states behind nazi lines in world war ii was without precedent what hie accomplished on our behalf risking his own life to save the lives of tens of thousands of people is unparalleled in our history the cost to him the years of his life can never be repaid the action of bestowing honorary citizenship on wallenberg undertaken by the congress of the united states will recognize his humanitarian sacrifice under our direction this is an important part of american history this adoption of raoul wallenberg as our own citizen makes clear to our posterity that the american government did act to save lives threatened by the holocaust i can add nothing further to the eloquent statements submitted by numerous witnesses before subcommittees of both the committee on foreign affairs and the committee on the judiciarywvitnesses who underscored the critical importance from both a national and

would be costly and complex and time consuming to make this change at this time and i think the gentlemans statement is right on target when the rousselot amendment was offered last october i voted for it so did 253 of my colleagues since that time i have done more homework on the issue i have concluded that i cannot support this amendment to the urgent supplemental appropriation i havealways believed that the free enterprise system cannot survive if it is entangled in excessive regulation but it also cannot survive if it fails to meet its responsibility to protect the safety and health of workers and that is the fundamental issue here how can we best protect the workers in surface stone sand and gravel mining the argument for this amendment is that with msha barred from using its funds to inspect and regulate certain surface mines osha will automatically have the authority to step in and fill the breach i know that my colleague from california mr rousselot can cite an impressive number of cases to try to show that this is so but i must point out that there are many doubts about this argument it has been suggested that under the rousselot language osha does not have the authority to take over from msha i do not pretend to have a definitive contribution to make in this debate but given the disagreements between honest men and women of good will i am certain of one thing the lawyers will have their hands full the losers will be the workers whose safety may be jeopardized so long as the matter is disputed as labor secretary donovan has written resolution of this litigation may take some time while this or any other issue is being litigated the contesting operator need not comply with an osra abatement order some of my colleagues have pointed out if the legal problems are so complex how come all that litigation hasnt surfaced yet the answer is that osha has not yet gone full speed ahead into mine inspection osha is only now attempting to take mshas place and we are feeling the calm before the storm when osha starts to inpsect in earnest industry and labor alike will be consulting their lawyers more often i recognize that a completely different scenario is possiblethere may be little or no litigation this could come about if osha is unable to take mshas place this would leave mines uninspected and workers unprotected when msha was inspecting surface mines there were over 1 800 inspections between january 1 and april 1 1981 in the same time period this year osha has performed only 17 inspections all of oshas were in response to complaints or fatalities there were no routine general inspections i know that secretary donovan has assured my colleagues that he will do his best to equip osha for the task of surface mine inspection my fear is that realistically he may not be able to achieve that goal the proposed rousselot amendment transfers many of mshas responsibilities to osha but none of its funding last december secretary donovan pointed out that this would be costly complex and time consuminginspectors would have to be trained new rules and regulations would have to be promulgated and inspections would have to be scheduled and madeall within oshas present resources last december these obstacles were so worrisome that secretary donovan said he did not think osha should take over mshas surface mining responsibilities the possible outcomes then are not very appealingwe face legal problenis over oshas authority to regulate surface mines and administrative problems involving oshas ability to enforce that authority if indeed it exists i am afraid that despite good intentions all around the safety of workers may be at risk if this amendment is adopted and where human lives are at stake i do not think we can afford

matters to create a precarious game of brinkmanship between the white house and the congress just think of the consequences to the american people those whom we are sworn to serve if thir bill does not pass then the men and women of our armed services will face payless paydays if this bill does not pass the defense department will not be able to buy fuel for its planes and ships and tanks if this bill goes down 36 million social security beneficiaries will be denied the timely receipt of their monthly checks many employment offices would be shut down and the services that they provide for the unemployed would be terminated possible layoffs in the postal ranks if this bill does not pass could hopelessly delay the delivery of mail in this busiest season of the year to the detriment of all americans six of the departments of government would close down completely i do not think any of us wants to be responsible for those results quite frankly there are those on the democratic sidei among themwho are bitterly disappointed over our inability to get any money included in this bill to initiate jobs to put americans back to work we have tried faithfully and the house three times this year has passed significant jobs initiatives the housing initiative was passed by the other body also and then vetoed by the president we did not muster the votes to override the veto in the summer we passed a modest public works jobs bill and it was not taken up in the other body earlier this month we passed a 5 billion public works jobs bill to stimulate employment to do the things that need to be done for america and employ some of americas unemployed the other body trimmed it down to 1 2 billion and finally abandoned it entirely in the face of a presidential veto threat so be it in the words of disraeli we appeal to history let us take some consolation on this side in the fact that that history is only 1 month away when a new congress can take up once more the imperative demands to get this economy moving again but for now we have the responsibility to keep the government functioning let us face that responsibility and do our duty and vote for the bill many on the other side including the president are disappointed because the bill does not contain money for funding now of the building of the mx missile although it does contain money for the research and development perhaps some good will flow from that perhaps a better basing mode will result or we may even achieve a break through in our negotiations with the soviet union to make the production of the missiles unnecessary in this lull perhaps we both may contemplate those words that were spoken 22 years ago by president dwight d eisenhower who said what can the world or any nation even hope for if no

sneak attacks closely spaced basing is a defensive arrangement based on a theory of nuclear fratricide the theory of nuclear fratricide is impossible to test it is imliortant to evaluate what we do not know when we consider the value of dense pack basing the dense pack theory postulates that in the hellfire environment of an atomic attack later incoming warheads would be destroyed by electromagnetic pulse or debris kickedup in the maelstrom of the blast through which our missiles can supposedly be launched this defense scenario is based on a hiroshima type blast in the air the picture is radically altered by a groundburst detonation proponents of dense pack claim this would enhance and lengthen the fratricide effect for incoming missiles it is unknown whether mx could launch through this environment however it is important to remember that the environment created by an atomic blast is not clearly understood an appropriate analogy would be comparing it to conducting launch operations on the surface of the sun if only momentarily furthermore should the soviets be capable of simultaneously detonating warheads the dynamics of the blast environment changes totally and incomprehensibly second let me caution my colleagues that we are plainly deluding ourselves if we believe that fratricide will be the defense of the dense pack with this particular configuration it is postulated that there would be a limited number of cross pull or trajectories which could be attack corridors for a soviet nuclear salvo on the 14 square mile target in wyoming theoretically it should be possible to defend this area with an antiballistic missile system rather like a video arcade game a single abm system is permitted under the salt treaty the extremely difficult technical problems which must be overcome to implement an abm system include differentiating mirv warheads from meteorites which they would resemble on radar and submarine launch ballistic missiles could invalidate the defense by launching south to north or west to east i hope my colleagues will attempt to evaluate the cost factors it was nearly a decade ago this body rejected the abm not on the grounds of technical feasibility but prohibitive costs that was prior to a threefold decrease in the value of the dollar you have not been told this but it cannot be denied if you buy the dense pack you will ultimately be forced to buy abm at a price that is anyones guess you will be allocating a massive amount of our nations security dollars for the deployment mode of a single leg of our nuclear

agriculture committee for a very realistic set of amendments in some regard io reduce to some extent the total of the agriculture bill but i do not think in some areas we have gone really far enough the dairy price support program has become a very serious national problem it is a classic case of a problem which brought forth a solution which has in turn eclipsed the problem and become the problem in itself we are talking about expenditures for this program going well over 1 billion we are talking about an unmanageable surplus indeed when people worry these days in the readers digest that the debt is a trillion dollars and calculate their share of the national debt i guess the one reassuring thing is that they also each own a pound of butter they did not know they had because

has not i think moved it far enough neither i must say in all candor do i think i am moving far enough originally i intended to offer an amendment that would have cut the dairy price support program far more than this in the interests of the problems of the dairy farmers who are now on the dolk and need to be weaned a little bit more carefully and trying to get a bill and in cooperation with others who have been working on this i have changed my numbers for that reason and i have offered the amendment which is substantially the amendment adopted in the senate with the support of the

with the chamber of commerce and public citizens to try to protect the taxpayer and also the dairy farmers the differences between this approach and the approach adopted in the amendments offered by the gentleman from iowa are as follows for the first year they are the same they would both set a supportprice level of 13 10 per hundredweight which is expected to be about 70 percent of parity but is in fact a little bit above 70 percent they differ in the future the amendment of the gentleman from iowa would set a pricesupport level of 72 5 percent for the next 2 years and would say after that that the parity level would either go to 75 percent or drop to 70 percent depending on the purchases that is he has a trigger the trigger is that if the government has to buy more than 3 5 billion pounds then all we have to be obligated to pay is 70 percent parity level i if however the farmers get the message and reduce production and the production ccc had to make was less than 3 5 billion pounds his bill contemplates going back to 75 percent the position of the department of agriculture which i am offering here and which the senate adopted has a trigger in the other direction we say first that we do not stay with the parity figure here but we stay with the 13 10 per hundredweight members have heard the statistical descriptions of the problem with the consumer price index if members will look at trends and look at statistical validity 4he consumer price index is a pristine model of statistical perfection compared to the concept of parity based as it is on what went on before world war i so the very concept of parity is in itself a fraud one we go to the 13 10 per hundredweight however we have a trigger we say that if the government is only going to be obligated to buy less than 750 000 000 worth of milk cheese and butterand think this is the openhandedness of this programit says that if the government is going to spend 750 000 000 to buy milk butter and cheese for which it probably has use for maybe 200 000 000 in a good year if it is going to spend that extra 550 000 000 a pure subsidy to buy products we do not need and will not distribute but will allow to go bad if it gets under 750 000 000 we will go back to 70 percent if however the program leads to still so much production a surplus which threatens to leave us awash in butterto mix a metaphorthen
