troops in the field a war has begun and we should be doing everything we can to speak with one voice and achieve national unity yet the republican leadership insists at this moment in bringing to the floor one of the most partisan divisive issues of the entire year i question their judgment and their timing i would hope that we would move fairly quickly today to a resolution supporting our troops in the field unfortunately our republiqan friends prefer to have on the floor a matter of high partisanship which will divide this congress like all of my colleagues republicans as well as democrats and like the american people themselves i fully support our troops i hope and pray that they will accomplish their mission as quickly and safely as possible for that reason i have argued that we should not be considering this bill today republicans have offered a budget that is as partisan as it is divisive as dishonest as it is dangerous to the country and at a time like this when the united states congress should be demonstrating its unity to the world i fear that bringing it to the floor guarantees a divisive debate but that is what republican leaders have done today and unfortunately there is no minimizing the differences between the democratic and republican budgets the democratic budget alternatives offered by the committee on the budget ranking member the gentleman from south carolina is a responsible plan to strengthen national security and restore economic growth and fiscal responsibility it tightens federal spending and balances the budget using honest accounting but it still meets priorities like defense education and health care and it does more for homeland security than the republican budget does there are two other budget alternatives offered by groups of democrats the blue dogs on one hand and the congressional black caucus and progressive caucus on the other they are worthwhile and i am glad that they are in order under this rule the republican budget stands in stark contrast the republican budget is intellectually dishonest morally indefensible and just plain bad for our economy and our nation it explodes the deficit and raises the death tax on all americans it shortchanges homeland security to pay for tax breaks for millionaires and it proves once again just how out of touch house republicans truly are at a time which this nation must come together republicans offer a budget that will pull us apart simply put the republican budget separates americans into two categories winners and losers the winners are the wealthiest few who get hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks the losers are everyone else the people who have to sacrifice to pay for those tax breaks for the wealthiest few to paraphrase winston churchill never have so many been asked to sacfifice for so few the republican budget skimps on homeland security it slashes priorities like education and health care it shortchanges veterans and farmers and it still explodes the deficits that is because the republican budget is a shameless work of fiction it calls for draconian cuts cuts in priorities like veterans benefits student loans and law enforcement and still gives massive tax breaks to the wealthiest but it requires the tax breaks to be enacted by npril 11 and gives republicans until july 11 to make the spending cuts when you get your dessert before you eat your spinach you never eat your spinach any american parent can tell us that and so can anyone else who has watched the republican budget charade drive up the deficit over the past few years as the gentleman from texas the foremost proponent of fiscal responsibility in this house told us yesterday in the committee on rules the tax cuts will be enacted and the spending cuts will be abandoned and the deficit will continue to explode why are republicans foisting this dangerous budget on america and on our economy for one simple reason because they stubbornly insist on giving massive tax breaks to the wealthiest few they say that to govern is to choose well take a look at the consequences of the choices republicans have made in this budget american troops are at war but republicans chose to shortchange the veterans who defended this nation in past years and to give tax breaks to millionaires that is why the veterans of foreign wars opposes the republican budget republicans chose to slash education and to give tax breaks to millionaires they chose to cut health care for children and seniors on medicaid and to give tax breaks to millionaires they chose to cut assistance to farmers and to give tax breaks to millionaires that is why the conservative farm bureau opposes the republican budget republicans are even shortchanging homeland security and once again they are making sure millionaires get all the tax breaks they want despite all these cruel cuts cuts that touch almost all americans and their families this republican budget still explodes the deficit all the budget gimmicks and phony accounting inthe world what president bush once called fuzzy math cannot hide that truth all in all the republicans are proposing an economic horror show at a time when americans are still suffering from the latest republican recession since president bush took office 2 5 million americans have lost their jobs in the private sector the surplus has gone and last years deficit was 317 billion but republicans refuse to face that fact so they propose a budget that would actually harm the economy by driving the nation deeper into debt raising the debt tax on all americans and their children and increasing families mortgage payments and credit card bills moreover this republican budget does not account for how we are going to pay for a war with iraq that

and more tax cuts for the rich are the way to end this bush recession let us look at the facts since the beginning of the bush administration america has seen the loss of over 3 3 million jobs of which 2 5 million have been in manufacturing moreover taxes on working families have gone up this is via interest rate increases that makes your monthly mortgage payments higher and increases your monthly car payments tie national deficit has soared to almost half a trillion dollars this year and is increasing and what are you getting your tax dollars are paying over 300 billion this year alone on interest on the bush tax cut for the rich finally democrats working with senate republicans put forth a bill to give working families a real tax cut an extension of the child tax credit the republicans oppose it they are opposing a tax cut on working families tie people missing out on this tax cut include 6 5 million working families and their 12 million children who are struggling to make ends meet one in five of these chldhren are front active duty military families making even a republican senator from arizona who by the way ran for president just 2 years ago to say and i quote i dont understand how you the republican leadership and the president left enlisted men and women out of this tax package i do not get it end quote additionally this bill will disproportionately penalize african american and hispanic children 2 4 million african american children and 4 1 million hispanic childrens families deserve this tax cut but the republican party refuses to give it to them preferring tax cuts for millionaires and big business this according to the chlildrens defense fund this republican tax package ignores the needs of working families and by ignoring 6 5 million working families it will have a devastating impact on these families and the children across our country it will have a particularly devastating impact on latino and african american families those suffering some of the worst brunt of this bush recession we see 3 3 million unitedstates jobs disappear in america since january of 2001 we see the unemployment rate for african americans at 11 2 percent of the population we see the hispanic unemployment rate at 7 5 percent on top of that this most recent tax bill for the rich cut out child care tax benefits for the poorest children in america whose parents are working not on welfare as the republicans would have you believe but are working people who can barely keep their head above water thanks to the economic nightmare cast on america by this republican party and president bush these are people struggling to provide for their families and this republican congress refuses to fix it republicans are holding americas working families hostage by opposing any legislative remedy to help working families and instead by offering another huge tax cut for the richest 1 percent of americans again i believe it is shameful to be offering tax cuts to the rich while cutting benefits for the working poor cutting benefits for our veterans cutting benefits for seniors on medicare and allowing millions of american jobs to disappear since president bush and republicans began to set economic policy almost 3 years ago president bushs economic plan has failed the american people who should be some of the most cherishd members of our society our veterans working families and innocent children president bushs economic plan does more than ignore these groups in my opinion and many other peoples opinion it hurts them as the disabled american veterans wrote in a letter to speaker hastert and the republican party earlier this year during consideration of the republican budget which mandated massive cuts in veterans programs disabled american veterans asked have you no shame they were speaking to the republican party today i ask that same question on behalf of the working families of my district the bronx and queens the child tax credit bill passed by this republican house leaves children and families in my district behind particularly families of color families earning between 10 500 a year and 26 625 a year are excluded from claiming the child tax credit increase what does this mean for latino families half of all latinos report having an annual household income under 30 000 half of all latinos report having an annual household income under 30 000 the house republican child tax credit plan means most of these latino families will be excluded will be excluded from the child tax credit it means that approximately 1 6 million or 30 percent of the eligible latino families who might have otherwise benefited from the increase are being left out this is on top of the fact that the bush economic plan means more latinos are out of work moreover latinos have a fasterrising unemployment rate than the general population as of this summer it was 7 5 percent compared to roughly 6 percent for the average american this is on top of the fact that the bush tax cut on dividend income affects only 7 percent of hispanics who own stock latinos in my district want to work and they want to do what they can to provide good futures for their children but many latinos in my district are working in lowwage jobs or thanks to the number of fulltime jobs lost are only working part time they are being left out of the bush tax credit president bushs priorities are clearly not working for latino families and they are clearly not working for african american families either african american families are among the hardest hit by the bush tax plan and the house republican child tax credit about 932 000 african american children under the age of 18 according to the childrens defense fund live in extreme poverty given our economy it is unfortunately not surprising that this statistic represents a 50 percent increase since 1999 african american families like latino families are disproportionately left out of the bush child tax credit african american unemploymint is rising to above 10 percent those who are eligible to find work are often barely getting by these are the families that need the child tax credit the most and yet these are the families that the republicans and this president are leaving out a family earning 20 000 with two children is being overlooked by president bush in faor of the family earning 200 000 a year who does not necessarily need the child tax credit yet a family earning 20 000 is the family that sincerely needs a 400 child tax credit that credit would be equivalent to a 4 percent raise in pay but that tax credit does not exist under president bushs plan president bushs priorities are not the families that need the tax credit the most president bush continues to ignore the voices of latino and african american families our national debt increases our debt limit increases and president bush continues to increase tax breaks for those who do not need them and i

thank the new ranking member of the committee for his kindnesses and generosity that bodes well for the future science is fun i can vouch for that as someone who has been a practicing scientist for over 2 decades science is also interesting and science is rewarding all of that is epitomized by the success of the rover that is currently on mars transmitting pictures to us and also scientific data and information to us i am very pleased to join in congratulating the jet propulsion laboratory and their scientists for the successful landing and operation of the rover spirit on mars for over 40 years the dedicated scientists at jpl have built cuttingedge robotic explorers that have investigated other planets and the far reaches of our solar system and even beyond these missions have opened windows to the universe provided us with invaluable scientific information and inspired generations of scientists and engineers just 2 months ago i was privileged to lead a group of science committee members on a tour of the jet propulsion laboratory that tour included an exciting meeting with dr daniel mccleese who is the chief scientist and dr peter theisinger the project manager for the mars exploration project their enthusiasm and devotion to this work was clearly evident during our discussion and it epitomizes the excitement that the scientists at jpl have they worked endlesshours and i am sure they are so interested and excited in their work that they would be willing to do that work without pay if they had some other means of putting food on the table science is fun as i said and it is very clear that this grand experiment on mars is exciting and interesting to our students our children at our elementary and secondary schools that is extremely important because we do not have enough americans studying science and engineering our engineering enrollments in american universities have steadily declined in the last 20 years one of the reasons is that children in our schools are not excited enough about science i want to thank jpl and nasa for their efforts to stimulate the excitement of the students in the schools and help generate a new generation of scientists and engineers i certainly want to congratulate jpl and all its partners on this latest success in landing the rover spirit on mars it is truly moving to see the years of devoted scientific work succeed in this effort as i saw the first pictures coming back tears welled in my eyes at the tremendous advancements in science that we are seeing this experiment also epitomizes what we must do if we are to meet the presidents vision we cannot just pop humans in a space capsule and send them off to mars there is an incredible amount of groundwork to be done and the spirit is one example of the type of work that we have to do if we are going to explore our planetary systems these experiments are far far less expensive than sending a human being to mars and we will have i would estimate at least 20 and perhaps even 40 years of such experiments before we are ready to tackle the very difficult and expensive task of sending a human to another planet i congratulate once again the jpl crew for their work and not only jpl but all of nasa and all the scientific community in the united states the scientists and engineers continue doing this work in generally anonymity the great excitement we see them exhibiting as they succeed in their experiments is typical of what goes on in laboratories across the united states and in fact across the world but which we as laymen never tend to see science is a great profession it is fun it is interesting but especially it is important to the human spirit and important to the success of our nation and the improvement of the prosperity and the general knowledge of this country thank you jpl"], [0.00030809640884399414, 0.499691903591156, 0, "i yield myself such time as i may consume i would just simply point out as the gentleman from pennsylvania

overdue our home state of new jersey has recently enacted johns law which allows police agencies to impound the vehicles of drunken drivers johns law is named after navy ensign john elliott john was driving from annapolis to his home in atlantic county new jersey for his mothers birthday en route his car was struck by a drunken driver both elliott and the other driver were killed three hours earlier the other driver had been arrested and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol he was released into the custody of a friend who drove him back to his car and allowed him to get behind the wheel this tragedy brought attention to a loophole in state law which has since been corrected the lobiondo amendment would not mandate any action by the states rather we hope it will encourage them to impound vehicles of dwi drivers as another important tool in the arsenal of alcoholimpaired countermeasures if someone is arrested for drunk driving it is logical that they not be allowed to get right back behind the wheel of their car endangering other drivers police and public safety groups in new jersey have praised this policy and i hope that other states will do the right thing by enacting similar laws that will save lives on a personal level i want to recognize the efforts of bill elliott johns father who has not rested in his work to ensure that such a tragedy would never be repeated passage of the lobiondo amendment will help bill in his quest for better public policy we can all hope for a day when what happened to the elliott family will never happen to other

had this to say when they submitted their final analysis of the singapore agreement it should be noted that our members were challenged by the lack of available text during the 30day period we had to conduct this analysis and write this report after earthjustice represented several environmental groups in court to seek the release of documents used in the unitedstates chile negotiations a district

who were detained and targeted by the british and the ruc was shot and killed by british loyalist paramilitaries while he sat eating a sunday meal with his wife and three children since his murder in 1939 amnesty international and the united nations have called on the british government to investigate any collusion between the ruc british government officials and the loyalist paramilitaries unfortunately after 3 years of investigation still no report has been made public according to the uda the ulster defense association which claimed responsibility for his murder mr finucane was profiled as an individual who was helping support the procatholic prorepublican cause in northern ireland i call on the london metropolitan police commissioner sir john stevens to expeditiously complete the report on the february 1989 killing of pat flnucane in belfast sir stevens has been investigating this case for almost 3 years late last year sir john stevens announced for the second time that the finucane report would be delayed as a result of a british military witness being reluctant to speak to the police stevens claimed that the report will be released before next spring however there continues to be speculation that the report may be delayed further should a public inquiry be ordered there are few who will dispute the facts in this case according to brian nelson a former british military intelligence agent who also served as chief intelligence officer in the uda he directly assisted in the targeting of pat flnucane and passed a photograph of pat finucane to a uda member just days before the killing however mr nelson claims that he has never been examined in an open court to date no one has been prosecuted for the murder of pat finucane the facts in this case seem quite straightforward once again a proloyalist police force used its authority to further sectarian rule and continue the rash of violence against the catholic community i call on prime minister tony blair and london metropolitan police commissioner stevens to finally release the current report and then immediately open a full public inquiry into this matter my hope is that by putting an end to this longdrawnout process we can bring both justice to the individuals who undertook this gruesome act and take steps to ensure that it does not happen again this whole matter once again reinforces my belief that for too long both the british government along with their police force and the loyalist paramilitary groups in northern ireland have worked in tandem to usurp the rights of the catholic community a full public inquiry into this matter will show the world that the only way peace can last in northern ireland is for a full fair and just reform of policing in
