of house joint resolution 3 to prevent nuclear explosive testing during the 1950s the soviet union britain france and the united states all tested nuclear weapons in the open atmosphere with these tests the superpowers were able to develop the hydrogen bomb 100 times more powerful than the one dropped on hiroshima these tests also slowly poisoned the land and water of the earth with increasing amounts of radioactive fallout following the cuban missile crisis president kennedy and nikita khruschev agreed to end aboveground testing with the negotiation of the limited test ban treaty in august 1963 in that treaty the united states britain and the soviet union agreed to ban all nuclear tests above ground in the atmosphere and in space they also agreed on the principle of banning all nuclear tests this principle is as valid today as it was when president kennedy signed the limited test ban treaty 23 years ago had president kennedy been successful then it would have been nearly impossible to develop the multiwarhead missiles that confound our negotiators in geneva and threaten our landbased nuclear missiles today had he been successful the arsenals of the united states and the soviet union though still deterring nuclear war might have been smaller and less complicated than they are today since that time the united states and soviet union have both conducted several hundred nuclear tests the united states maintains a substantial lead in developing small lightweight nuclear weapons that are being deployed aboard our new strategic systems other countries such as china and india have also joined the nuclear arms race with nuclear tests of their own presidents nixon and ford successfully negotiated two treaties dealing with the testing of nuclear weapons the threshold test ban and peaceful nuclear explosions treaties both treaties limited any underground nuclear explosion to 150 kilotons they also contain provisions for exchanging geologic information on test sites yield estimates for two explosions to calibrate instruments and the establishment of regular consultations since their negotiation in 1976 these two treaties have languished in the senate negotiations toward the goal of a comprehensive test ban have stalled the following president carters decision to suspend all bilateral talks in the wake of the invasion of afghanistan the reagan administration decided not to resume these talks house joint resolution 3 simply calls on the president to submit the threshold test ban and peaceful nuclear explosion treaties to the senate for their consideration of ratification and calls for the resumption of negotiations toward a comprehensive test ban treaty the resolution allows the president to submit any reservations or understandings he may have with regard to our ability to verity soviet compliance with these treaties given the long list of concerns i have received from the white house i feel certain that the president would urge him to make full use of this procedure house joint resolution 3 specifically calls on the president to propose an immediate resumption of ctbt negotiations it does not specify the time or place of such negotiations that is left up to him it also calls on this treaty to be verifiable which would include onsite inspection to monitor very small nuclear explosions below the 1kiloton range where we may have difficulty in detection in sum this is the same resolution that passed the senate 2 years ago by a vote of 7722 it is a clear statement expressing the hope of the american people that we can slow the arms race down by mutual agreement that will leave both sides less vulnerable to a devastating first strike the resolution is a direct call to work to end the nuclear arms race and to begin the

"i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time i want to discuss for a few minutes the amendment that i will be offering and also to try and deal with some of the arguments that are going to be made both pro and con i think the most appropriate place to start would be in 1984 when this issue was before the full house of representatives then there were 322 members of the house that voted for a bill that included a 5 billion revenue hit on chemical feed stocks and 2 7 billion in crude oil the amendment that i will be offering will be one that will have a 2 billion revenue impact on the chemical industry and a 3 1 billion on crude oil taxes that simply means that we will be taxing the chemical industry far less than we did in the 1984 bill which had broad support and taxing crude oil just slightly more than last years bill the reason we do that and the reason i believe it is appropriate to support my amendment is that it preserves the idea that the polluter should pay and bear the responsibility for cleanup of toxic waste sites the epa has indicated time and again most recently in one of their reports thatand let me quote their report information about the past activities of responsible parties that is sufficient to operate a tax system is generally not available at a broad industrial level responsibility for past problems can be assigned and it is more equitable for the tax burden to fall on the chemical industry and their customers than on the public at large this is the critical issue shall we deviate from the past where we have said while we cannot always tell who is responsible we know pretty much that the people who generate the chemicalsthe petrochemical industry the oil industry the chemical industryare responsible for the toxic waste problem and that their chemicals have been found in these hazardous waste sites or should we say to them well we understand that you are in part responsible but we would like to tax a lot of other people who have absolutely nothing to do with the generation of hazardous waste or have had nothing to do with the creation of toxic waste sites it seems as though that b very narrow margin by one vote th that was what the ways and means committee has done but i believe that the decerriber 5 1985 vast majority of members on this floor want to preserve the idea that pollutefs pay let us take a look at some of the more substantive reasons why the chemical and petroleum industries are concerned according to the epa in 1981 they generated 71 percent of the waste 29 percent was generated by other industries under their industrial share of the tax under the valueadded tax a national sales tax if you will all other industries will pay 82 percent of superfund and the chemical and petroleum industries will pay 18 percent so it is quite clear my colleagues that they want to reduce their burden and under a valueadded tax that burden is substantially reduced a valueadded tax would be an enormous mistake not only is the valueadded tax breaking this connection between who is responsible and who should pay it is a bad valueadded tax on top of that it exempts for instance persons and entities that create waste but do business under 10 million they could continue to pollute they can continue to generate waste they would bear no responsibility for their mess on top of that as the treasury department has pointed out in a letter that has been widely circulated it is a tax that can be avoided by shifting manufacturing and retailing within a vertically integrated corporate operation that is not the sort of thing we want to do in addition it also is expensive to administer and in many ways as i said before it can be avoided so before we take this leap into the unknown on the substance we should be aware of what its shortcomings are no 2 we should also understand something about the politics i come from a marginal district and i know many of my colleagues do do they really want to go home in an election year and explain that they were the vanguard of the valueadded tax that they saw the future and the future was a national sales tax and while it was only narrowly applied to superfund the door will have been wedged open for those who see the valueadded tax as a way of generating money i think not i believe that we want to preserve the idea that people who are responsible for the problem should bearthe cost we want to be the people who say to the american public at large that we had some difficult times raising revenue and dealing with revenue but we believe in a broadbased income tax and not a sales tax as a way of financing activities of the national government so we are going to probably tomorrow or on tuesday get into this amendment in more detail but if you keep these facts in mind and keep in mind as welland before we shed any crocodile tears for this poor industrythe fact that the chemical industry is not on its back economically the last years revenue projections have indicated that they are in very good financial shape they are not dying the oil industry which laments this crude oil tax has far more of a concern with the severance taxes that their states levy on them this is going to add 0 3 cents per gallon on the cost of gasoline or a 1 50 for people who drive their car 10 000 miles or more it is a minuscule tax it can be easily assumed by the chemical industry it will not hurt them it can be easily assumed by the oil industry so we are here at th edge of the unknown or the beginning of the edge of the unknown i would say to my

threat is a major environmental concern in every state in the country this is particularly true in new jersey which has 91 of the 703 hazardous waste sites on the superfund national priority list that is far more than any other state the program was authorized for 5 years in 1980 with a 1 6 billion budget derived primarily from an assessment on the chemical industry for the purpose of cleaning up the nations most dangerous toxic waste dumps the superfund law enacted in 1980 called for a fund of 1 6 billion to pay for the cleanup~of abandoned hazardous waste sites around the country but we know
