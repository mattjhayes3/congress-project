out in idaho it is not in my state of montana it is in southern idaho a few miles from the border of montana a few miles just west of yellowstone national park to locate it for those of you who are interested in this i am a little bit surprised not only at the fact that this is being jeopardized but at the debate this afternoon first with regard to the committee running roughshod over authorization or trying to pull off some sort of slamdunk here that is not what is happening at all the committee is simply honorong a congressional compromise that was made in 1986 all hydro projects on this little stream called henrys fork in idaho were stopped in 1986 they were all stopped except this one the reason this was not stopped is that the congress believed it was needed and it could be made environmentally benign if certain adjustments were made in the construction and so the congress imposed certain environmental requirements causing a midlicensing delay on the reconstruction of this dam called island park so this little dam was disadvantaged the only one in the nation to be disadvantaged in this manner by the congress of the united states why did we disadvantage them well because it is a trout fishery because it is one of the nations great trout fisheries that s why we stopped all hydro projects except this one we said to the contractors and supporters of this project if you do it in a certain way we go ahead and license you if notno license now the appropriations committee is saying they have done it they have met the criteria protected the fishery and the project should go forward if this dam was going to hurt this fishery and i am a fisherman from the west i would be opposed to it if this dam was bad environmentally check my environmental record in this house i would be opposed to it but that is not what this dam is going to do this is not a new dam there is no diversion of the water going to take place here there is not going to be 1 inch of new road construction here the prevailing flows will be maintained the stream flow will not be altered the prevailing temperature of the water is going to stay exactly as it is the dissolved oxygen is going to be just as it is the nitrogen is going to be changed all water quality parameters are going to be left unchanged either that or this project is not going to go ahead because that is the law the congress back in 1986 placed that requirement on this little project so environmentally it is very sound as a matter of legislative integrity this committee is simply keeping the word of this congress in allowing this dam to go ahead now what about the money are we going to lose a million dollars here the first time i ran for congress i started listening to those folks out west who said to me pat you know we ought to run government like a business well i was in business i was in the restaurant business the way we made money was to invest money we have forgotten that on capitol hill for too long we have forgotten that if you invest money up front in the right way you get money back in the treasury this 1 million will be returned almost instantly to the federal treasury in payroll and income taxes to the federal government we have already worked that out it comes back right away then we are going to get 10 million more in the long run through bureau of reclamation fees income taxes

affordable for americas lowand middleincome working families let me emphasize that this legislation is particularly important to nearly half of the working women in wisconsin who are also the mothers of children under age 6 requiring day care according to the childrens defense fund 3 500 wisconsin families were on waiting list for subsidized day care in 1989 the waiting period for an open day care slot is still months long in many counties the combined licensed capacity of day care centers and family care providers is less than 60 000 now in wisconsin yet children requiring public assistance for day care services increased 62 3 percent between fiscal years 1981 and 1988 indications are that the demand for safe affordable child care will continue to increase in wisconsin h r 4381 would bring muchneeded federal child care relief directly to hardworking families throughout wisconsin it is notable that h r 4381 and the stenholmshaw billh r 4294are now quite similar in many aspects both bills expand the earned income tax credit to help working families with a stayathome parent or a single head of the household in addition the bills maximize choice by allowing parents to send their children to a schoolbased program or a private day care center clearly h r 4381 and h r 4294 provide parents with a broad range of child care options but it is wholly inappropriate for these bills to require states to establish voucher systems and to endorse their use at facilities which permit religious worship instruction and employment discrimination the edwards amendment and price amendment which address these glaring constitutional defects in the bills have my full support first forcing states which do not now have voucher systems in plaoe to create them abrogates the states rights second a federal voucher for religious day care claarly violates the principle of saparation of church and stateand wouid be found unconstitutional if brought to a test in a court of law this is because a federal voucher for religious day care is equivalent to govemment support for the establishment of religion this opens the door to federal subsidization of religious education at all grade levels for more than two centuries the wall between church and state in this nation has remained intact this wall of separation designed by our nations founders to protect religious freedom has served us well it should remain in place these last few days my office has received many letters and phone calls regarding the child care bills most of the people who contacted me said they should be able to send their child to a religious child care facility and still receive federal assistance to subsidize what is a very private choice in this regard i would like to share with my colleagues a portion of a letter from the national council of churches and other religious groups who last summer wrote to congress in opposition to tax support of eligious programs their letter declared we respect the right of churches synagogues and other religious organfrtions to offer specifically sectarian programs and child care i but such care should be supported by those who share their specific beliefs and
