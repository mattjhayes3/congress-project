to the unrelenting assault on amercas elderly and poor that assault is most clearly and most recently reflected in the administrations threats to veto congress reasonable and compassionate budget plan for fiscal year 1988 sadly the administrations continuing attacks come as no surprise to those of us who care deeply about the millions of elderly and poor americans who have always been at the very bottom of this administrations priority list for 7 straight years americas elderly and poor have been the target of a massive assault by this administration and for 7 years democrats in the congress have fought to shield these most vulnerable americans from the unyielding onslaught of the administration budget ax the administration advances the cynical and convenient argument that americas massive budget deficits simply make it impossible to do more for our elderly and poor yes our deficits are massive yes our deficits require us to make hard choices about our priorities however it is my conviction that many of the problems we face today are the result not of hard choices which the administration has made they are the result of wrong choiceschoices which have placed unfair tax cuts and excessive military spending above the real needs of the american people the administration blames the congress and our party for the tremendous budget defcits now plaguing the american economy but it is not our priorities which have caused the huge deficits these past 7 yearsdeficits which dwarf anything our republic has ever before experienced rather it the policies and priorities of this administration which are more than anything else responsible for the deficits we face whats really driving the deficit based on cbo figures from the early years of this administration the impact of tax cuts and excessive military spending more than equaled the huge deficits burdening america lets take a look at some of the numbers in every fiscal year between fiscal year 1981 and fiscal year 1987 the administration has demanded more increases in the military budget and more cutbacks in domestic programs during this period defense spending increased more than 40 percent while domestic discretionary spending decreased 21 percent moreover this 21 percent decrease represents the average reduction in domestic discretionary programs some programs such as subsidized housing and employment and training programs have been cut over 60 percent suppose for a moment that the administrations defense and revenue priorities since fiscal year 1981 had not been put into effect according to the house budget committee defense spending in fiscal year 1986 for example would have been 54 billion lower interest costs would have been 39 billion lower and revenues would have been 66 billion higher had these administration priorities not been put into effect thats a total of 159 billion that would not have been added to our deficits in fiscal year 1986 alone sadly however those administration priorities were put into effect and it is those priorities which are driving the deficit today contrary to what this administration would like to have the american people believe it has never once sent a balanced budget to congress no this administration has instead repeatedly sent the congress budgets with large deficits resulting from grossly misplaced priorities fortunately we democrats have succeeded in softening the blows inflicted upon the most vulnerable americans by these misplaced priorities unfortunately however we have so far not succeeded in changing the basic thrust of these priorities despite our efforts this administration has largely succeeded in shielding high income people and large corporations from contributing their fair share to the nations support it has succeeded in shielding the wasteful military from the kinds of massive cuts which have been inflicted upon critically needed domestic programs for americas vulnerable children elderly and poor what about the effects of this administrations priorities on specific programs that affect the everyday lives of americas elderly and poor what about the effects of these priorities on programs like medicare and medicaid which protect americas sick and frail when they need medical care what about the effects of these priorities on the social security housing health and human services programs which are supposed to make up the safety net protecting americas elderly americas disabled and americas poor from catastrophe and ruin most of these programs have been threatened often and cut repeatedly by the administration budget ax as a result americas most vulnerable people have suffered desperately over the past 7 years that suffering will continue to grow unless we act decisively and quickly lets begin with medicare which has suffered cumulative spending reductions of 34 billion since fiscal year 1981 in 1981 beneficiaries paid medicare part b premiums of 11 today they are paying 17 90 an increase of 63 percent in just 6 years the amount beneficiaries must pay for the first day of hospital care has risen from 204 to 520 over the same period thatsa whopping 150 percent increase incredibly the medicare reductions which have been put into effect over the past 7 years represent only a portion of the reductions which the administration has wanted and it has continued to press for large medicare reductions in its fiscal year 1988 budget the administration is asking for medicare part bpremium increases that would add 11 4 billion to beneficiary costs over the next 5 years meanwhile it doubles research on antisatellite weapons of questionable feasibility the medicaid program has also suffered heavily under this administration today medicaid protects fewer than half of americas poor given this administrations record of insensitivity to our nations most vulnerable citizens it is sad but not surprising that the administrations proposed medicaid cuts would total 1 3 billion in fiscal year 1988 and 19 5 billion over the next 5 years the administrations proposals would result in a fiscal year 1988 cut of over 50 per beneficiary the magnitude of the administrations proposed reductions goes far beyond what states could absorb socalled savings under these proposals would jeopardize the neediest among us and shatter our staterun programs the administration has also repudiated its longstanding promise not to cut into the social security program the quality of services provided to the poor elderly and disabled has been repeatedly threatened by administration proposals to reduce social security staff by more than 20 percent in each of the last 5 years most recently the administrations fiscal year 1988 budget requested 5 092 staff below congressional appropriation levels despite consistent rejection by congress of these staff reduction proposals the administration has continued to reduce social security staff below congressionally authorized levels through attrition and through its failure to hire any new staff perhaps the administrations most relentless assault on americas needy has been its attempt to eliminate all funding for any lowincome housing construction rehabilitation and senior citizen housing although congress has rejected many of these proposals federal assistance has been drastically reduced by more than 70 percent over the past 6 years the administrations budget proposals for fiscal year 1988 would all but end any federal housing assistance for lowincome americans and senior citizens despite the fact that nearly half the residents of hudassisted housing are among the poorest of our lowincome elderly this administration has also proposed the total elimination of the lowincome weatherization program and legal service assistance to the poor substantial reductions in funding were proposed for the lowincome energy assistance program the community service block grant program the job training partnership acts dislocated worker program and transportation assistance in the first 4 years of this administration spending on the aged was cut by a cumulative 26 5 billion grants funding locally provided health and social services received cuts ranging from 22 to 39 percent one initiative by this administration the blockgranting of social services virtually assures that older minority persons will not receive services which have been designed to serve their special needs programs are less likely to be culturally sensitive adequately trained personnel may not be available to administer supportive services and services are much less likely to be located in the most appropriate community settings lowincome senior citizens have been particularly hurt by reductions in food stamp eligibility and benefits although not generally identified as an elderly nutrition program one out of five households receiving food stamps have at least one elderly member making the food stamp program this nations largest elderly nutrition program despite administration talk of preserving a safety net lowincome elderly have been hurt most by this administrations misplaced priorities and have suffered a great loss as a result of this administrations misdirected policies the time has come to be brutally honest with ourselves and with the american people the administrations priorities have had devastating effects on americas most needy and most vulnerable citizens children the elderly the sick and the poor have all suffered horribly because of the misplaced priorities of this administration just a few months ago the adminstration described its budget proposal as a plan a hope a vision of what america is and where it is going but if you are poor homeless hungry or sick in america the administrations budget provides no plan no hope and no vision of what america is and where it should be going just look at america in the seventh year of this administration 12 6 percent of americas elderly still live in poverty including 31 5 percent of americas black elderly and 23 9 percent of americas hispanic elderlymore than half of indian elderly live below the poverty level 15 6 percent of americas elderly women live in poverty including almost 20 percent of women over the age of 85 in 1980 19 cents was spent on subsidized housing for each dollar spent for national defense by 1985 the administration proposed less than 1 1 2 cents be spent on housing for every dollar spent on the military two out of every five elderly americans consume too few calories proteins or basic vitamins and minerals to meet even minimal requirements for good health outofpocket health costs consume 16 percent of elderly income more than wher medicare and medicaid began even without further cuts outofpocket costs are projected to consume up to 18 5 percent of elderly income by 1991 thirtyseven americans are uninsured for any health costs 200 million americans are underinsured against the costs of catastrophic long term illness sadly what i have outlined here is just the tip of a large and threatening iceberg much more can and must be said about this administrations relentless assault against americas elderly and poor the words we have heard today paint a tragic portrait of americaan america in which pebple are suffering because of the misplaced priorities of an insensitive administration americas elderly and poor have been the target of this administrations assault for 7 long and tortuous years far too long for a compassionate nation contrary to what administrations speechwriters would like for us to believe its priorities are way out of sync with those of the american people time after time the american people have reaffirmed their compassionate commitment to protecting our most vulnerable citizens in keeping with that commitment time after time democrats in congress have fought back and tried to shield americas poor its homeless its elderly and its infirm democrats in congress have fought to strengthen programs weakened by the administration we fought to protect and expand the older americans act the house version of this very important bill contains provisions to help low income and minority elderly including native americans and others with the greatest social and economic needs for 7 straight years we have repeatedly fought to save medicare and medicaid from destruction this spring our house budget resolution once again protected both of these critical programs from major cutbacks and precluded any increases in outofpocket costs to beneficiaries just last week we acted to provide an extra measure of medicare protection against catastrophic illness however much remains to be done especially in the areas of longterm care and the medically indigent but the struggle continues and the challenge remains this administration as demonstrated by its veto threats and its budget proposals for fiscal year 1988 fully intends to continue its relentless assault this congress and these democrats fully intend to block that assault and strengthen the protective shield surrounding americas most vulnerable"], [0.0011560916900634766,

programs which address the need for quality education opportunities for selfsufficiency the right to a safe and livable environment and services that will ensure healthy minds and bodies i shall focus my comments and observations on our network of child nutrition programsprograms which in my judgment play a key role in ensuring that our nations children first do have healthy minds and bodies and second are better able to obtain a quality education what is the current status of our child nutrition programs as the vice chairman of the subcommittee on elementary secondary and vocational education which has jurisdiction over our child nutrition programs i believe that we have in place a strong national network of quality programs in which we can all take pride the past present and future success of our child nutrition programs is dependent on a strong federal state and local public and private sector partnership willing to invest the necessary resources to meet the nutritional needs of our nations youngsters when they are in awayfromhome settings at the heart of this network is the oldest and largest of our child nutrition programsthe national school lunch program today the national school lunch program provides nutritionally balanced meals to approximately 24 million school age children or 92 percent of all schoolchildren federal support is provided to participating school districts in a mix of cash and commodity support what level of support the federal government provides is in an inverse relationship to the economic status of the childs family the highest levels of federal support go to meeting the costs of providing meals to our neediest youngsters this is as it should be two important companion programs deserve mention the first is our school breakfast program which is designed to ensure that all youngsters begin their school day with the nutrients necessary to benefit fully from the days educational experience thanks to congressional action during the last congress i am pleased to note that modest increases in both cash and commodity assitance will now be available to improve the overall quality of the breakfast program meal patterns while our school lunch and breakfast programs play a vital part in meeting nutritional needs during the regular school year the summer feeding program complements that initiative by providing nutritious meals to our neediest youngsters during the summer months one of our fastest growing child nutrition activities is the child care food program which essentially provides meal services appropriate to youngsters enrolled in day care centers or family day care homes as more two wageearner families and growing numbers of single heads of households join our labor force the child care food progam will assume an everincreasing role in meeting the nutritional wellbeing of our younger children no overview of the status of our child nutrition programs would be complete without the mention of the special supplemental food program for women infants and childrenmore popularly referred to as the wic program wic is an early health intervention program that seeks to provide individually tailored food packages to lowincome pregnant women new mothers infants and children up to age 5 who are determined to be at nutritional risk medical services and nutrition education round out the wic program benefits wic program benefits cost an average of 30 per month in return studies clearly demonstrate that wic does make a difference in increasing the birth weights of infants of lowincome women who are at nutritional risk and the probability that these infantswill survive and enjoy a normal and healthy childhood what is the challenge facing the 100th congress in the area of child nutrition first we must see to it that the legislative changes enacted during the 99th congress are fully and quickly implemented second we must continue to take a long and hard look at all phases of child nutrition program policies and operations we cannot rest on our laurels so to speak rather we must strive to maximally utilize what will be of necessity limited resources to the end

trade deficit of 170 billion its easy to blame it all on our trading partners and promise sanctions if they dont tailor their policy to our specifications the problem with these easy quick fixes is that they dont address the root problem of our trade deficit america operates in the red not because of foreign action but because of american inaction the only way this nation can pull itself out of a deep and worsening trade deficit is to compete its way out those who propose the easier softer way would have us believe that our trade problems are cause by the unfettered flow of products from lowwage nations that knock us over on price in reality low wages are not the major problem in 1985 the united states ran its largest trade deficits with japan canada and the european common market nations these are not lowwage countries why did we run these deficits was it because some evil foreign leader held a gun to our heads and forced us to buy foreign automobiles and television sets of course not we bought the products because we preferred them there are people who say we have to address the basic problem of trade barriers overseas i agree with them this bill addressed that need at the same time however i have to caution that foreign barriers are only a small piece in the framework mike mansfield our ambassador to japan told me last week that eliminating japanese trade barriers would reduce the united states deficit with that nation by only about 15 percent its time we faced reality that means we have to make sacrifices we have to balance our budget modernize our plants retain our workers and better educate our children we also have to realize were not the only industrial power in the world like everyone else we have to compete for business at home and abroad in my view competitiveness begins with balancing our federal budget our inability to balance the budget is one of the reasons confidence in the unitedstates dollar has dropped so precipitously its dropped to such a degree that foreigners are now shunning investments in the united states the flight from the dollar already has promoted higher interest rates and sparked new fear of inflation it would be a selfinflicted wound for the united states to cave into those who propose the easier softer way calls for severe and mandatory retaliation against nations running trade surpluses are grossly misguided in time we too will run individual trade surpluses as we have in the past and i doubt that any member of this body wants western europe to retaliate against us when it happens i support tough trade legislation but i dont support illadvised initiatives that try to solve complicated problems with simple categorized solutions countrybycountry trade deficits are all different and none can be solved through convenient standardized formulas the compromises offered by the ways and means committee provide a fair and workable way to combat undesirable trade practices nothing more is needed

technology subcommittee for his leadership in crafting h r 2330 and mr boehlert of new york the ranking republican member for his diligent efforts on behalf of this legislation the national science foundation plays a central role in the support of basic science and engineering research in unitedstates universities and also in the training of future generations of scientists and engineers this role encompasses generating new knowledge and helping sustain a highly trained work force to exploit new technologies spawned by this new knowlege the future economic vitality and competitiveness of the unitedstates in the world marketplace will ultimately depend on the strength of the nations science and technology base basic scientific research and the education of scientists and engineers create this base for technological advances history has shown that a sustained investment in basic research contributes to economic growth to an impoved quality of life and to enhanced national defense capabilities although nsf is a relatively small federal agency it has a big impact both on support of basic research and on development of enhanced basic research capabilities in american universities for example an nsf program with the longterm goal of developing firstrate research universities in all geographic regions of the united states is called the experimental program to stimulate competitive research or epscor the value of epscor is vividly illustrated by the results of a grant to the university of alabamahuntsville the grant was used by a young professor to build a strong research group studying superconductivity recently this group produced one of the first sets of research results on a class of materials that are superconducting at relatively high temperatures as tv and press accounts have highlighted this breakthrough has enormously important implications for a wide range of technologies including high speed computers medical diagnostic systems electric power generation and transportation systems the nsf budget proposed by the administration for fiscal year 1988 provides for an increase of almost 17 percent above the previous year and is the first of five proposed increases to produce a doubling of the nsf budget by fiscal year 1992 the science space and technology committee supports and endorses this proposal which is consistent with the committees firm belief in the importance of nsfs contribution to the nations wellbeing despite the serious federal budget deficit the committee believes that the increase in funding for nsf is essential to address important concerns about the health of the unitedstates basic research enterprise and in particular concerns about the state of science and engineering education the proposed budget increase would also allow nsf to pursue new research opportunities including interdisciplinary multipleinvestigator efforts involving linkages with industry the total authorization in h r 2330 of 1 893 billion includes 1 625 billion for research and related activities 150 million for science and engineering education and 118 million for the unitedstates antarctic program although h r 2330 as reported by the science space and technology committee provides a total authorization at the level of the administrations request it makes redirections and establishes certain priorities reflecting the concerns of the committee members the major change from the administrations request is an increase of 35 million for the science and engineering education directorate unitedstates economic competitiveness is ultimately tied to the availability and excellence of scientific and technical manpower unfortunately a decreasing fraction of american college students are choosing science and engineering studies at a time when the total pool of collegeaged students is declining significantly over the past 15 years the proportion of the unitedstates population engaged in science and engineering has declined appreciably relative to other technologically advanced nations during the same period the federal investment in undergraduate and precollege science education has dropped dramatically and is now at a level well below that of the 1960s in constant dollars at a time when the united states must compete against strong economic rivals in a global marketplace these trends are disquieting nsf must have the resources to play a strong role in strengthening science and mathematics instruction at the precollege and undergraduate levels to ensure that the pipeline of scientists and engineers remains filled and to maintain a large technically literate inventive and adaptable work force in order to provide the significant increase in funding primarily for precollege science education programs a small decrease was imposed on the administrations requested funding levels for four scientific directorates and a cut of 25 million was imposed on the unitedstates antarctic program which effectively maintains this program at the fiscal year 1987 funding level the reduction to the antarctic program does not reflect concern for the quality of the research program however only about a third of the total budget for this program is for research and direct research support the remainder is required to support the unitedstates presence in the antarctic in light of current priorities within the overall range of nsf programs level funding the large operations support budget of the antarctic program seems jsutified in particular since the funds will augment science and engineering education programs which have been neglected in recent years besides the strengthening of programs in science education h r 2330 provides funding level increases that will sustain nsf initiatives in scientific areas such as biotechnology global geosciences and advanced scientific computing also h r 2330 will allow nsf to expand its efforts in developing interdisciplinary research groups to explore new scientific frontiers at the interfaces between traditional disciplines these enterprises such as the engineering research centers program often involve industrial participation which both opens new communication channels to facilitate transfer of new discoveries to industry and also exposes university researchers to industrial technology problems the creation of links between university researchers and industrial laboratories and equally important the training of scientists and engineers who are familiar with the industrial culture will contribute to improving unitedstates performance in the commercialization of new discoveries which is a critical factor in maintaining economic competitiveness h r 2330 is balanced proposal which is essential to

during that period of time i am afraid that neither side of the aisle has seen the fruits of their labor on housing legislation clearly no housing authorization has been reported out of the committee and signed into law since 1982 i believe we have had plenty of effort on both sides of the aisle probably best reflected recently in the effort of the chairman and the ranking republican member on the subcommitee the gentlewoman from new jersey mrs roukema and the gentleman from ohio chalmers wylie we have had a lot of effort but we have not seen much in terms of success i do notwant to underestimate or understate the hard work that has gone into this bill on both sides of the aisle i think it is time we break the logjam it is time that we send something downtown that can be signed into law so that we can have a permanent authorization i would ask my colleagues to look carefully at the two alternatives the wylie substitute is not an overdone hastily drawn alternative i think it is a very thoughtful and careful proposal that balances the critical need for more housing for more a ffordable housing with continued community development assistance and the need to produce a bill that is realistic in terms of spending the current bill does not take on this difficult task of balancing that indeed i think h r 4 invites a veto without the wylie amendment we go into another year without housing authorization now there is no question that reducing the spending in h r 4 and there is a substantial difference in the dollar amount of both bills that we have made some tough decisions we have chosen not to start some new programs i believe the funding difference is about 9 percent with h r 4 authorizing the larger amount i think it is very important that we take note of some of the discussion if you measure compassion solely in terms of dollars then i guess the alternative is 9 percent more compassionate than we are but if you measure compassion in terms of the number of new available units that is shelters that is homes if you measure compassion in terms of how many more people will be able to find shelter during the fiscal years of this authorization you would find that the wylie substitute is far more compassionate it is estimated that somewhere between 10 000 to 20 000 more families although the wylie amendment involves less dollars 10 000 to 20 000 more families would find homes if we pass the wylie amendment we have heard a lot of rhetoric about homelessness let us be realistic about it neither bill will resolve the problem of the homeless unfortunately the battle against this problem requires a continuing ongoing effort neither bill resolves and eliminates the demand for lowcost affordable housing but there is one bill that during the

301 as it has been revised in the trade bill an american firm ntered into a joint venture with a firm in argentina this joint venture then contracted to perform services for a municipal authority their performance over the last 8 years continues and is not in dispute unfortunately however the municipality has not performed on its end of the contract it is unilaterally refusing to pay for a portion of the services performed this refusal stems from argentinas economic reform program called the austral plan of june 1985 which created a new currency and so forced the recalculation of many existing contracts with public authorities argentine authorities have renegotiated their contracts with argentine firms and indeed with other multinationals but in this case the municipal authority has refused all efforts to negotiate with the american company even refusing the arbitration called for in the contract while this american firm wants to negotiate a settlement my understanding is that the unitedstates firm could take action against this unfair and discriminatory behavior by filing a petition under section 301 and seeking to have the unitedstates government employ whatever
