the hydrogen bomb 100 times more powerful than the one dropped on hiroshima these tests also slowly poisoned the land and water of the earth with increasing amounts of radioactive fallout following the cuban missile crisis president kennedy and nikita khruschev agreed to end aboveground testing with the negotiation of the limited test ban treaty in august 1963 in that treaty the united states britain and the soviet union agreed to ban all nuclear tests above ground in the atmosphere and in space they also agreed on the principle of banning all nuclear tests this principle is as valid today as it was when president kennedy signed the limited test ban treaty 23 years ago had president kennedy been successful then it would have been nearly impossible to develop the multiwarhead missiles that confound our negotiators in geneva and threaten our landbased nuclear missiles today had he been successful the arsenals of the united states and the soviet union though still deterring nuclear war might have been smaller and less complicated than they are today since that time the united states and soviet union have both conducted several hundred nuclear tests the united states maintains a substantial lead in developing small lightweight nuclear weapons that are being deployed aboard our new strategic systems other countries such as china and india have also joined the nuclear arms race with nuclear tests of their own presidents nixon and ford successfully negotiated two treaties dealing with the testing of nuclear weapons the threshold test ban and peaceful nuclear explosions treaties both treaties limited any underground nuclear explosion to 150 kilotons they also contain provisions for exchanging geologic information on test sites yield estimates for two explosions to calibrate instruments and the establishment of regular consultations since their negotiation in 1976 these two treaties have languished in the senate negotiations toward the goal of a comprehensive test ban have stalled the following president carters decision to suspend all bilateral talks in the wake of the invasion of afghanistan the reagan administration decided not to resume these talks house joint resolution 3 simply calls on the president to submit the threshold test ban and peaceful nuclear explosion treaties to the senate for their consideration of ratification and calls for the resumption of negotiations toward a comprehensive test ban treaty the resolution allows the president to submit any reservations or understandings he may have with regard to our ability to verity soviet compliance with these treaties given the long list of concerns i have received from the white house i feel certain that the president would urge him to make full use of this procedure house joint resolution 3 specifically calls on the president to propose an immediate resumption of ctbt negotiations it does not specify the time or place of such negotiations that is left up to him it also calls on this treaty to be verifiable which would include onsite inspection to monitor very small nuclear explosions below the 1kiloton range where we may have difficulty in detection in sum this is the same resolution that passed the senate 2 years ago by a vote of 7722 it is a clear statement expressing the hope of the american people that we can slow the arms race down by mutual agreement that
