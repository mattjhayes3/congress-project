i think expresses and embodies our hopes as well as our concerns about the upcoming election in mexico when mexicans go to the polls in what is expected to be record numbers on august 21 the electoral process will reflect a confluence of political will presidential vision for reform compromise by the major political parties and insistence on integrity in the electoral process by mexican voters significantly more than 90 percent of the eligible population is included in the new electoral registry and an estimated 22 to 27 million voters are expected to go to the polls on the 21st of this month all signs indicate that this election will likely result in the largest voter turnout in mexican history the reform and modernization of mexicos political process is of particular importance to the united states because of our geographic proximity our strong ethnic and cultural ties our economic bonds and a common aspiration for democracy i believe house concurrent resolution 250 as amended reflects our respect for the breadth of electoral reforms already undertaken by the salinas government and our expectations of an honest fair and transparent process house concurrent resolution 250 recognizes the significant reforms which have been made such as broadening the impartiality of the federal electoral institutes general council screening for accuracy in the voter registry list protecting the right of fair media access and reforming the criminal code to add teeth to anticorruption initiatives president salinas should be applauded for the commitment he has made during his term to these historic changes which promise to change the face of the electoral process in mexico the mexicans have faced many challenges throughout this electoral reform era and campaign season not the least of which is the trauma caused by the assassination on march 23 of presidential candidate luis donaldo colosio undeterred however in pushing reform the mexican election will be marked by a plethora of firsts the universal use of transparent ballot boxes the most accurate and meticulously prepared registry list the most candidates who are seeking the presidency the largest number of election officials television debate among the presidential candidates and extensive press coverage of the elections the mexican electorate has understandably raised its expectations of a transparent and fair electoral process with transparency at all levels and they must determine whether or not the outcome reflects the voters will on july 12 the presidential candidates from eight of the nine political parties signed a historic agreement for civility harmony and justice only the democratic revolutionary party decided it would not sign this accord the agreement recognizes that democracy is a system that guarantees our unity as a nation without undermining regional diversities or the ethnic religious political and cultural pluralities that identify and enrich us the political parties committed themselves to proceed with strict adherence to the law to ensure greater access opening objectivity and impartiality from the media coverage of the election and to encourage open and pressurefree participation by the electorate the document recognizes that it is not through violence that democratic progress will be accomplished the establishment of democracy can only nuture itself through the improvement of institutions in the republic and as a result of broad participation by society the election is likely to be one of theif not the most important in mexican history as our neighbors south of the border elect a new president 500 members of the chamber of deputies 96 senate seats as well as political leaders in 6 states and the federal district of mexico city because of

is a debate about power projection and our security around the world largely depends on our ability to project power quickly that means to move american forces including equip ment and personnel to critical strategic spots very very quickly in the words of gen nathan bedford forrest it is the ability to get there firstest with the mostest we are now in a situation in europe inwhich our formerly massive presence of over 300 000 military personnel is being directly reduced to around 100 000 personnel that means we do not have the security the airfield security and the airfield security capability that we had a couple of yeaxs ago it means now if we wanted to go in for these long runways that the c5 requires wemight have to lose some people we would certainly have conflicts because one of the most strategic targets in any conflict is runways airways and the key to the cit debate when juxtaposed with the 0 4 and its capabilities is runway length the c17 uses roughly half the runway that a c5 uses what does that mean it means in europe that ofall the runways that are available the c17 can access roughly ten times the number of airstrips and runways that the c 5 can access that means instead of having to come in if there is armor if we are moving m1 tanks into a particular area in europe or other heavy equipment instead of having to fly this hardlware into an areal that may be 100 miles by road or a 3~ is 50 miles by road or 20 miles by road from where we want to strategically place it for conflict with the adversary we can fly into an air base that is mucli closer
