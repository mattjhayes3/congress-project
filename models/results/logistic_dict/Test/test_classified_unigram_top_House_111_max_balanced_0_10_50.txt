last day of school we think the voting is done for this year and yet the work is not done in fact america among other things is suffering from a considerably high level of unemployment and that was going to be the topic for this evening i want to talk a little bit about employment spending and the different theories that people have as to how jobs are created and there are some theories out there that dont work very well and there are some that do work well and history tells us the difference between the two i thought what i might do this evening would be to start with something which in a way may seem remedial it should seem fairly basic because most americans have plenty of common sense and i think that its important though to start at the basic level and start defining your terms as we talk about the problem of unemployment now there are certain series of things i have identified sixthere may be other ways economists might look at it differentlybut there are six things that are job killers to start with we need to understand where jobs come from jobs come from businesses what sort of businesses well if you take a look at businesses that have 500 employees or less those businesses employ about 90 percent of the americans that have jobs in the private sector five hundred or less employees those many people would say are small businesses well what are the things that these small businesses need in order to create these jobs 90 percent of the jobs in america well the first thing is that there are certain things that are killers of jobs the first is economic uncertainty lets talk about that for just a minute economic uncertainty put yourself in charge of a business say you have 100 employees and youre manufacturing some product and you just really dont know whats going to happen with the economy and so there is a level of uncertainty maybe political things are going on which increase your level of uncertainty you dont know whether or not perhaps we are going to go into some kind of economic slump and so what are you going to do if you are a president of a small business well what youre going to do is in the state of missouri they call it hunkering down you say im not going to take a lot of risks im going to prepare for some sort of an economic storm or at least be prepared that im not too extended i dont want to take a lot of risk when there is economic uncertainty and what sort of risks might those be the risk might be to add a wing on your building to buy a new machine to start a new process to patent a new invention and decide to try to produce it and sell it on a market all of those things create jobs but youre not liable to take a highrisk position if theres a high level of economic uncertainty so economic uncertainty is a job killer the next thing is consumption reduction thats a fancy word for saying you got a business slowdown people arent buying as much stuff everybody is worried people are having a hard time economically they are not spending as much money people arent making investments and so your business is going along with all the other businesses around you when you are in a time when there is a recession going on its an economic uncertainty its a form of economic uncertainty i suppose and that is youre thinking hey it used to be last year we had orders for 100 widgets but this year it looks like we are only getting orders for 50 so youre not going to be thinking about getting a machine that will make widgets more efficiently youre not going to be thinking about making investments in adding to the building so you can increase production because youre expecting that youre going to sell less this year than you did because of the fact that there is a slowdown in the economy so a slowdown in the economy tends to affect businesses and therefore affects jobs pretty much common sense i think and then excessive taxation how does that hurt jobs well here is the deal youre again the president of a business maybe you have 100 employees and you find out all of a sudden that your taxes are really going up now if you have a lot of taxes that means you dont have very much choice youre going to have to pay those taxes what is the tax going to be paid with well its going to be paid with the money from your company from the profits and the proceeds of the company that you have and hopefully you have 100 employees youre paying them youre selling product and youre selling product for more than it costs you and so youre making some profits and youre pocketing those profits but now you understand that theres going to be a whole lot of taxation coming down the pike so one of the things that taxation is going to do is take money away from the guy that owns the business and when you do that he doesnt have the money to spend on adding additions to the building or perhaps taking a risk on introducing new products or maybe even inventing some different ways of doing things and so the taxation takes the place of investment that would normally be made in the company when that investment is made that usually results in hiring more people but the hiring more people isnt going to happen if you have excessive taxation in fact we have found historically that if you drive the business owners with enough taxation you can not only stop job creation you can stop the whole business and bring it into bankruptcy and destroy the engine that creates jobs so excessive taxation is a big factor in killing jobs another thing is insufficient liquidity now that sounds like a fancy thing theres nothing too fancy about it the fact is that businesses need money to run on just like the engine in your car needs oil and what happens is the business lets say its a machine shop decides that they want to buy a new piece of equipment that new piece of equipment is going to cost them 5 million well you have got your machinists there in your company but you dont have any 5 million to buy this new piece of equipment but you figured out that if you had that piece of equipment that in a matter of 21 2 or 3 years you could pay for the whole piece of equipment just by the kinds of products that you could make on it so you can say hey this is a great investment i can pay this off relatively quickly but i dont have that million couple million dollars to buy this new piece of equipment so what do you do well youre going to have to go out and a get a loan and when you take a loan youre going to pay interest on that loan but then you get that piece of equipment in and its running just beautifully for you you get all those orders you make these parts and pretty soon you pay off the piece of equipment how did that happen it happened because you were able to borrow money which people call liquidity and you can borrow money and get that tool or whatever it was when you did it you hired a few people to run the new piece of equipment and of course you created jobs if you do not have that liquidity if you cant borrow money that you need then what happens well then you cant buy the new pieces of equipment and guess what youre killing jobs or the potential for creating jobs another thing is excessive government spending oh now wait a minute now how can the government spending affect jobs in america well it turns out that there is an effect indeed and what it is is when the government spends a lot of money it has to get that money from somewhere guess where the money comes from the private sector where does the money come from from taxes and so as the government tries to collect more and more money to appease its appetite for spending what happens is that affects liquidity and it plays out as taxation and so as the government does a whole lot of spending you find that it tends to kill jobs now it may not appear to kill jobs in the short term if the government does a whole lot of spendinglets just say the government decides to spend 150 billion we just decided to do that a few hours ago here on the floor 150 billion for son of stimulus this is stimulus jr ministimulus 150 billion stimulus still real money to most people and real money to the unitedstates government although you wouldnt know it by the way we spend it today by the way we did a pretty good job of spending money we spent about 1 1 trillion today but ministimulus was just 150 billion still a lot of money and that government spending lets say you go out and hire a whole lot of people well wouldnt you create jobs congressman akin well you would in a temporary sense you could put some people on a government payroll but what economists have found is that when you temporarily hire someone from the government what youre doing is youre taking money out of the economy through this government spending in fact what happens is for every one job you create in government youre taking 2 2 jobs out of the private sector so its one of these things where it may seem like youre doing well its a little bit like drinking salt water youre getting a drink but the salt makes you even more thirsty than you were before so its kind of very much a losing proposition when you start to get into this excessive government spending and then the other thing of course is excessive government mandates and red tape we have a picture here that my staffer found of some poor ceo buried in red tape all kinds of memos pieces of paper and all kinds of regulations i think that your common sense will show why this is a problem because lets say particularly youre a small business well you have a certain number of employees those employees you have them working right away making product that you can sell because you have a clean lean and efficient process and you dont have very many people that are management people just a few people to try to keep an eye and organize things and get some orders in the door and all of a sudden somebody from the government knocks on your door knock knock knock and says hey you didnt fill out such and such form and somebody else knocks or calls and says you didnt fill out this form you didnt fill out this form did you do this have you applied for this did you get this and pretty soon you have all kinds of employees and what do they produce they produce paperwork paperwork for whom for the government and so if you get more and more red tape and excessive mandates obviously that is one of the things where you may seem like youre creating jobs but in effect youre making the business less efficient so it cannot grow and really put those good producing jobs on to the payroll in a sense those are like excessive government spending because theyre really government jobs that in fact tend to get rid of the actual productive private so all of these things all of these conditions kill jobs so if the federal government wants to create jobsfirst of all we have to understand something the federal government cant create jobs the whole concept of stimulus is a false assumption the only thing the federal government can do is create the conditions so the people in the private sector can create the jobs we can create an environment that is helpful in producing jobs but the federal government when it tries to hire people all that does is take jobs away from the private sector so all of these things are job killers so lets go in a more positive light and say well what do you do to create jobs well just the reverse of these things and that will tend to create jobs in fact you might even have some trouble in a couple of areas but youre doing very well in some other areas and you could create some jobs this whole bit about the problem with unemployment in america is not really that complicated when you understand that the jobs come largely from these 500employee and smaller size companies and that theyre created by the fact that those companies and the owner of those companies have enough money they can invest in their company and can do the new processes innovation and the ideas that americans are so great in doing thats what makes the economy strong and thats what makes jobs now we have here a cartoon we have the president here speaking to a small businessman and the president is saying here now give me one good reason why youre not hiring and what do we have coming into the china shop well we have three big bulls one is the health care referendum there is capandtrade or capandtax and then another is a war tax well the point here in a cartoon form obviously the bulls are not going to have a good influence on the china shop and the president doesnt seem to get whats going on with the businessman hes not looking too excited about a good reason for why youre not hiring with these guys coming in the door now lets take this back to what we were just talking about health care reform health care reform was going to introduce probably at a minimum 1 trillion worth of spending or close to it so what happens if the government does a whole lot of spending well theyre going to do a whole lot of taxing guess who is going to be taxed with several different types of taxes to pay for socialized medicine well it was going to be the small businessman so now what have you done relative to our chart here when you have the senateand the house has already passed this 1 trillion socialized medicine bill that has all these mandates on small businesswhat have you done in terms of jobs when you pass this socialized medicine well first of all you are creating economic uncertainty because the bill hasnt passed we dont quite know whats going to happen so there is uncertainty there is also the slowdown in the economy which of course is not helped by a tremendous level of spending and debt excessive taxation of course the taxation in the socialized medicine bill is going to fall very heavily on these small business owners if you take their money away and force them to provide all this health care theyre going to have an incentive one to get rid of employees because they cant afford them anymore because the health care is so expensive for them so theyre going to figure out ways to get rid of employees not hire them and what theyre going to do because of the excessive taxation is theyre not going to be investing in new equipment so its going to be a job killer that was what one of these bulls is and then capandtrade or capandtax here bull number two that of course is the large tax that was going to be part of the solution to global warming and were going to talk about that a little bit too but that also had a very very large tax associated with it not only did it have a very big tax to increase the cost of energy it had a very large tax in terms of red tape in fact i suppose that the red tape and the amount of additional federal authority to regulate anything in the energy area including even how individual american citizens houses are builtthat is building codes at the federal level building codes regulating how you build your house and whether it has the proper carbon footprint or green footprint all in this bill with not only the largest tax in history but also a great deal of red tape these are all things that hurt jobs and so should we be surprised that were getting a high level of unemployment we should not be surprised we are breaking all the basic laws here is the first stimulus bill we were told last springlate spring and early summerthat we needed to pass a 787 billion stimulus bill and what was the idea of the stimulus bill the idea of the stimulus bill was that government is going to spend a whole lot of money and by spending money the economy is going to be better now that entire premise is suspect if the economy was going to be better by us spending money we would have one of the most robust healthy economies in the whole world we wouldnt have any unemployment we would be going gangbusters if federal spending was the thing that was going to make the economy good but most people with a little common sense if your family budget is in trouble the thing youre going to do is not run down to the local store with your credit card and stack up a whole lot of debt and spend like madunless youre a little bit nutty or had too much to drink but anyway we were told that the thing to do is weve got to pass this 787 billion stimulus bill and we were told if you dont pass it do you know whats going to happen america and you congressmen that are representing americans if you dont pass this stimulus bill you may see unemployment go up to 8 percent if you dont pass this stimulus bill so this is the presidents forecast of whats going to happen if we pass this stimulus bill right here you see this is 8 percent unemployment and he says were going to keep it under 8 if you just get this 787 billion into our hands to spend without the stimulus he said this is whats going to happen if you dont pass the stimulus its going to do this first the red line here is what has actually happened is this red line a surprise no it wasnt a surprise at all i stood here on this floor 6 months ago with similar charts and said this stimulus isnt going to work is it because im very smart or brilliant no its not at all its simply because i know a little bit about history i know what will and i know what will not work if the democrats had known something about history they would have at a minimum learned something from a fellow democrat this democrats name was henry morgenthau he was franklin roosevelts treasury secretary and he appeared before the house ways and means committee right here in congress in 1939 now we have some old people in congress not too many people probably remember henry morgenthau but they could know something about history and about franklin delano roosevelt and here is what henry morgenthau said after 8 years of spending money on thisits called keynesian economics henry morgenthau was a close buddy and associate of little lord keyneshe was a strange little fellow that british manand came up with this idea that we could stimulate the economy by spending money and so they went at it hammer and tongs stimulating away spending lots of money at the end of 8 years this is how well it works henry morgenthau appears before the house ways and means committee we have tried spending money we are spending more than weve ever spent before and it does not work thats pretty straightforward english weve been spending money more than we ever did before and it doesnt work i say after 8 years of the administration we have just as much unemployment as when we started and an enormous debt to boot and so its not rocket science to see that this idea of spending 787 billion that we dont have its not rocket science for us to be able to stand here 6 months ago and say hey we hope it works but its not going to work it has never worked in history before its a lousy solution its going to make the problem worse we said all of those things dozens of people stood on this floor and said those things and its not because theyre so smart its just because we understand the basics of what it takes to make jobs and the thing that kills jobs is too much government spending now i will say about the stimulus bill that we put in place it would have made henry morgenthau very uncomfortable because it wasnt even traditional oldfashioned stimulus oldfashioned stimulus is like making highways or building hydroelectric plants or hard job creation this thing was more an expansion of wealth here it was giving money so that organizations like acorn could apply for community organizing and a lot of things that really were never going to create jobs in the first place or if they were they were government jobs and those things the result has been look weve got unemployment by the time you get into the latter part of this year up in excess of 10 percent not 8 percent but 10 percent unemployment and thats not a big surprise and so today what did we do we passed ministimulus little brother to big brother stimulus this was only instead of 787 billion 150 billion today and did we learn anything from our experience no nothing at all apparently i think it was einstein who said that if you repeat the same thing over and over again expecting a different result you may just be crazy and thats what we have done today we came up with a junior stimulus bill and we passed it on this floor and the people who voted for it were the democrats they were a little reluctant in voting for it because it didnt work very well the first time when they did the stimulus and theyre not so confident that its going to work again so what are we looking at in terms of obamapelosi spending well youve got the second half of the wall street bailout here 350 billion then youve got this economic stimulus thing that has not worked that we said it wouldnt work it doesnt work it will never work and yet they spent 787 billionwell they havent spent it all theyre just slopping it into other government programs and then youve got the schip and then the appropriations another 410 billion over there imf bailoutthat chart is wrong its probably about 110 billion and then the house got really excited about doing some really serious spending and they passed this capandtax which is that global warming bill and that waslet me see what the number on that is here get the chart turned aroundthat was 846 billion the reason on this chart that thats a little hazy is because the senators werent brilliant enough to go along with this 800 billion capandtax or capandtrade bill now this is going to extend a huge government net over the energy business and it was probably worse in terms of red tape and government than it was in terms of its tax now the ironic thing is that im an engineer and the thing about this bill thats particularly frustrating is that it doesnt appear that there is a consistency between the stated purpose and what the bill does lets assume for a minute that global warming is an imminent threat its something that we need to spend billions of dollars on that sometimes people dont call it global warming anymore because it isnt clear that the planet is warming and so they call it climate change but anyway the theory runs along the lines that there are these various organic kinds of pollutants particularly c02 carbon dioxide thats the bubbles in soda pop and the theory runs that if mankind makes enough of this co2which we make by burning carbon or burning coal or burning gasoline or diesel or whatever we make co2 and if we make enough of this what happens is the co2 then reacts with other kinds of effects particularly water vapor and clouds in the atmosphere and they amplify the effect of the c02 and the sun warms it up and the climate gets hot and melts down thats the general idea now lets just assume for a moment that that were true and that it were a bad thing for us to make co2i dont believe that thats entirely true some of that is true but a lot of its not but lets just say for instance that we really did believe co2 is a big problem and we needed to spend billions of dollars do we need to give the federal government all this regulatory authority over building codes how you put a wing on your house and all this kind of stuff the answer is of course its not necessary at all lets say that instead what we wanted to do was to reduce the co2 in america reduce the co2 by the amount of all of the passenger cars that drive on the highways in america lets say thats our objective just to start with were worried about c02 we want to basically make it so that it was the equivalent from a generation of c02 of turning off all of the american passenger cars on our roads in america that would be a pretty ambitious goal if you were worried about c02 that would be a pretty good place to start maybe how would you possibly accomplish something like that well the fact is you could accomplish it relatively easily for much much less money than what is here and with much less government regulation what you would have to do would be to simply take the coalfired plants that produce 20 percent of americas electrical output and replace them with nuclear plants currently 20 percent of the electricity in america is produced in nuclear plants if we were to go from 20 to a little over 40 percent in nuclear generation we would eliminate the co2 from effectively every passenger car in america that is not that complicated and the nuclear plants are pretty efficient over time they would probably prove to be not much different in cost than the coalfired plants are but that is the question is that really the objectiveto get rid of c02 or is it that we just want more taxes and government control ive become a little cynical because the engineering solution to this problem is not where the legislation went in the house then of course weve got this other thing here its a little bit of a sidetrack the bottom line is if you make energy cost expensive and if you tax people a whole lot for energy what is that going to do to jobs its going to get rid of jobs so everything weve been doing hereeverything we are doingis killing jobs and we cant seem to understand why the small business cant make the jobs now we go on to the government health care proposal passed here on this floor not so long ago what is the price tag on that well even with a little bit of financial hocuspocus it is still up there in terms of 1 trillion we spent 1 1 trillion today but some of it was for the appropriations for the defense of our country to add to this big socialized medicine bill to add 1 trillion more on top of all of these other things is going to bury our economy well now wait a minute congressman akin arent you overstating your case i mean you are a republican and it seems like youre bashing those democrats for overspending under the bush administration didnt you spend too much money well lets just take a look at that question the worst deficit of the bush administration occurred in 2008 under the pelosi congress that worst deficit was 455 billion now that was a bad deficit 455 billion maybe even a more effective number to ask is what was that deficit as a percent of the gross domestic product of america thats a way of looking at that number that was about 3 1 percent which is actually fairly common as you look back over a number of presidents who did that kind of spending anyway that was 2008 under a pelosi congress bushs worst spending 455 billion what happened this year under a pelosi congress and president obama instead of 455 billion it was 1 4 trillion thats more than three times more than bushs biggest spending i wasnt fond of his biggest spending and people who know my voting record know i did not support some of the costly elements that were there this year were three times over what we were with bushat 1 4 trillion what does that do to our deficit as a percent of gdp we go from 3 1 to 9 9 percent of our debt to gdp which is by the way the highest level since world war ii so this track record here doesnt make a lot of sensebillions and trillions of dollars well what does this all mean if you put it in context what were saying here is this year there was three times more spending than bushs most aggressive spending were making bush look like ebenezer scrooge with the level of spending this year what does that spending do of course it affects unemployment it affects jobs because that spending has to come out of the pockets of american taxpayers some of those pocketsin fact some of the deep pocketsare the people who own the businesses who can no longer do the innovation and make the improvements to create jobs that is a very very serious problem you have to say that this is a new era of irresponsibility the national debt of the united states at 16 17 trillion so in other words have we been spending too much money yeah we sure have but this year has been a regular budget buster and that is of serious serious concern of course in the long term we have the concern with medicare and medicaid growing over time absorbing more and more of the budget there is a certain level the american economy can sustain in taxes if you raise the taxes higher what happens is that the economy suffers so badly that you dont actually collect any more money from the government and that overtaxing is pointed out by a guy by the name of laffer he had a thing called a laffer curve its an interesting idea you think well look we really want to spend all this money because its really good to take care of global warming and to pay for everybody and to give them all free health care with a socialized health care system and weve got to do this because this is all kinds of additional money that were schlepping around and giving to different people weve got the wall street bailout weve got to pick winners and losers and so were going to be having to spend this wall street then as people come back and pay back some of the wall street now what were going to do is turn that money around and give it to other businesses so now the government is playing in the private business if wed had a president whod fired the president of general motors a number of years ago that would have raised some eyebrows indeed so when we get done with all of this the problem is that it is creating unemployment its a problem of jobs it gets back to these things here which are just awfully simple but theyre inflexible immovable kinds of facts and that is when you follow the policy that weve been doing which is first of all were increasing red tape and government regulation were engaging in excessive government spending unlike anything that has ever happened before in our history we have a problemand i havent talked about thisof insufficient liquidity this is also a problem weve got about a perfect storm going on for small businesses in america here is what has happened the federal reserve doesnt actually print money but they call it printed money theyve increased the liquidity in america and they did that by a factor of 10 last year in other words if you look at a chart of the amount of ml money supply it runs along up and down like a saw tooth and all of a sudden we get to last year andboom excuse me i think it was the end of last yearthis yearand the thing jumps by a factor of 10 so the federal reserve created all of this money boom it printed a whole lot of it and thats available at a very low interest rate and the big banks have access to that the question is does all of that liquidity get down to the small business man because if you could get that liquidity into the hands of the small business man and if you could knock his taxation back all of a sudden presto zingo youve got the formula to get the economy back chugging and churning its not the government that is going to fix the economy its american individuals its the free enterprise spirit of americans its the people who love freedom who have the ingenuity who say theres a better way to do this i think i could do it i think i could build my own business and i could make a living for my family this way these people have the courage to take the risks to put the equipment together to put the systems together to put the inventions together america grows one dream at a time they are the people who pull us out of recessions and it is those people who we are hurting with excessive taxation as to this liquidity thing the problem now is that the small businesses cant get their hands on money at a reasonable interest rate here is what happened that liquidity that the big bank has trickles down to the little bank and the little bank gets some of it all of these federal regulators are running around and the bank is saying man i am not going to loan money to any small business unless i know its a slam dunk theyre going to pay me back because im already skating on a very thin edge ive got a lot of assets that my bank owns that are not too strong and im afraid theyre going to shut me down and that my bank is going to go out of business so i am not going to loan money very easily to just anybody who comes down the pike when you do come down the pike and want to borrow money ill tell you what im going to charge you a pretty good interest rate on that money so what happens is the small business man is already intimidated because of the threats of all of these taxations that are coming along and the economy has slowed down he has got economic uncertainty he has got a slowdown in the economy hes getting excessive taxation now i havent even talked about all of the taxes hes facing first of all the bush tax cuts are expiring so the death tax is coming back the dividend tax the capital gains tax all of those are coming due because those tax things are expiring and theyre coming back resetting at a higher rate so the small business man sees the death tax capital gains dividend taxes now hes seeing the other taxes we talked about which are socialized medicine energy taxes and capandtrade what other things has he has got coming he has got these taxations coming now with that hes thinking oh my goodness im not too sure i really want to borrow anything even if he does get the courage to borrow something because he has to hell go to the bank and the bank will say ah before i was giving you a couple percent interest on those loans it was a 3year a 5year loan for your business now im going to need to get a little more interest from you i think about 4 or 5 or 6 percent is what i want now all of a sudden the small business man even if he qualifies and if he has a solid strong business its going to be harder for him these days its increasingly harder for him to get liquidity so aside from the taxation excessive government spending aside from the red tape and mandates the economic uncertainty and the slowdown now hes also getting hit with the problem of liquidity this is fairly close to a perfect storm for small business so guess what were not very surprised that unemployment has been going up now do we have any good news its always nice to have a little bit of good news somewhere until we fix these things or at least a number of them you are not going to hear much about good news people can say oh the stock market is fine and everything is going well weve hit the bottom everybody looks at these things like theyre cycles that repeat it doesnt have to be a cycle you know fdr managed to take a recession and turn it into a great depression because he did the wrong things we can follow in his footsteps but we dont have to the point is we dont have to follow keynesian economics we dont have to do all of this tremendous level of spending and taxation its not necessary its not what the republicans are proposing we know it wont work and we have learned from morgenthau and we have learned from other people as well what is the solution well actually its kind of interesting one of the people who learned the solution was jfk a democrat what he did was what well he cut taxes oh my goodness a democrat cutting taxes yeah jfk actually did we had a recession he understood that businesses have to have some breathing room so he cut taxes guess what the economy improved then ronald reagan comes along ronald reagan had the same basic idea he said hey weve got a bad economy how can we ever compete with the soviet union when our economy is all in trouble so what did he do he had a huge tax cuttwo or three times what george bushs tax cut was everybody called it trickledown economics and made fun of ronald reagan for about a year or so until the economy turned around and took off like a horse and it pulled us on ahead he continued to spend money on defense he bankrupted the soviet union the berlin wall fell down and the western world was freed from the threat of an aggressive marxist communist regime that was bent on taking over the free world this is all because he understood these basic principles so who is it who has given us the model jfk ronald reagan and also president bushthe last presidentall understood this principle youve got to get off of the taxation and big government spending here is the funny thing that is interesting it was called sometimes supply side economics people made fun of it but here is how it works and you can see in your own logic how it would be lets say somebody appointed you to be king for the year and that your job was to raise money for your little government and your kingdom and that the only thing you could do was tax loaves of bread people in your kingdom liked to eat bread they bought loaves of bread so you had the power to tax them on loaves of bread well you start thinking in your own mind how would you do that well you might say first of all well i could put a penny a loaf on the bread and i could collect a certain amount of money you could figure out how many loaves of bread are sold at a penny apiece you could figure out some revenue then you get to thinking you know ill bet i could raise more money for my little kingdom if instead i put a 10 tax on every loaf of bread then youd think wow that would be a whole lot except what would happen is people wouldnt buy as much bread so i really wouldnt get as much tax as i first thought i would so as you play with this back and forth in your mind you come to the conclusion that there is an optimum point where if you raise or lower the taxes you will get less tax revenue well thats the thing that ronald reagan jfk and bush ii understood they understood that if you get off the taxes the government can actually take in more money than they would have taken in if the taxes were higher it sounds like making water run uphill but it isnt as you think about the loaf of bread you think wait a minute you can tax something so much that no one will buy it anymore and youll basically stall the economy what happened when bush was faced with a recession when i first came to congress in 2001 he was criticized roundly for this after a little whilei guess it was about 2003he got around to this he reduced dividends capital gains and death taxes now those things affect the guys that own these small businesses when he did that almost immediately what happened was government revenues went up even though the taxes rate of taxation went down well how in the world could that be its this same principle it was called the laffer curve it was first published i think by art laffer an economist the solution to this doesnt mean that americans have to sit around with no jobs and suffer tremendously with a lousy economy the solution is available the solution has been used time after time in american history the thing that we are doing now has also been used to turn a recession into a depression what we have to do is stop spending too much money its not very complicated the same thing you would do in your family budget you cant say that you are fiscally responsible criticize george bush for creating all of these problems when his highest level of spending at 455 billion is less than onethird of what we have just spent in this year at 1 4 trillion when we get the ratio of debt to gross domestic product higher than its been since the second world war you know something is wrong and it is not that complicated this whole idea of employment and what makes jobs is very straightforward what i hear the democrats frequently doing is beating on their drum we are going to tax that old rich man we are going to get the rich man we are going to take his money away from him and give it all to other people well the only trouble with that is the trouble with socialism is sooner or later you run out of other peoples money guess who it is you are going to tax if you say you are going to tax the rich man some of those rich men are the guys that own these companies the men and women the entrepreneurs who own the companies many times the amount of profit that the company makes is like their profit they plow it back into more jobs now if you tax those people out of their hides guess whats going to happen they dont have any money to reinvest in their company and you kill jobs you cannot separate the people that run the business and the jobs they are not separable if you really want jobs you have to have employers you cant have employees with no employers if you tax the employers too much then they cant have employees its not that very complicated yet what we hear constantly is all these fat cats we are going to run the tax up on these welltodo people well as it is today you might be amused to know that 50 percent of americans pay about 1 percent of the tax revenue in america fifty percent of americans pay about 1 percenti believe my numbers on that are pretty close to right you could also say that a very very large percent of taxes are paid by a very small percent of americans now if you drive that too hard what happens again is you squeeze the small business and the wheels come off the tracks thats what we have been doing and we have not been making the situation better its not complicated we can fix it but we cant fix it with what we did today today the democrats decided to increase the debt ceiling another 300 billion they decided to spend money on the defense of our country which i supported and voted for but also another 150 billion in this stimulus kind of thing which didnt work before and we know its not going to work again we are not using the right approach we are not going back to the basics of how jobs are created what we are doing is we are spending americans money not just our own money not just our kids money our grandchildrens money at this kind of rate we cannot afford these kinds of programs in the condition of our economy we can right the economy theres things that can be done to fix it theres a great deal that can be done with health care even if you believe in global warming and it is a high priority to spend billions of dollars on it even if you believe that there are a whole lot of better solutions and a whole lot of government redtape and taxes you can move to the nuclear model which is going to reduce c02 significantly this economic stimulus we saw how effective that was thats the thing that we are claiming we are going to keep our unemployment below 8 percent and here we are closer to 10 now of course the wall street bailout this was a failed idea from the start it was sold to the congress that the entire american economy was going to collapse that there was going to be sulfurous smoke billowing out of the earth there are going to be hail storms and brick bats falling from the sky if we didnt come up with 700 million in unmarked bills and we wanted it in a big hurry because we made a big public announcement the stock market is watching you congress congress obliged i think it was a bad decision they passed that stimulus bill now we have got politicians running around inside the private sector deciding on the salaries of private employees the recent bill that we passed here just last week gives the federal government the authority to regulate financial transactions and at least in theory could give them the power to determine the salary of a bank teller do we really think that thats a job that congress and the federal government can do efficiently is to determine the salary of people in private industry is that what we really want our government doing do we trust our government to be telling us whether we can put an addition on our house and we have to prove that the carbon footprint of our house is just right to be able to allow us to put an addition on our house do we need to have a energy taxed a whole lot more when the economy is in the condition it is now is this threat of global warming whichby the way a whole series of emails and electronic files were released from the scientific university in england that is the center for collecting all the data on global warming it found that these scientists had been fudging the data what they found was in fact that they were very less than professional and had been doing everything they could to quash any article appearing in a journal that would question the absolute rigid science that global warming was an imminent disaster on this planet well when the evidence of the fact that the data had been doctored that they had been intentionally trying to quash the opinions of dissenters trying to say that its settled scienceits nothing settled at all what these emails revealed in east anglia but that was kind of dubious science all the way along the question is is that as important as our dependence on foreign oil i am not so sure that it is even if it is theres a solution to that which is replacing coalfired carbonburning plants with nuclear plants france has 80 percent nuclear generation if we went to 40 we would equivalent get rid of the c02 from all of those passenger cars this is not the approach we have been taking the whole wrong economics of what we have been doing is wrong thats why people are feeling pain they are feeling unemployment thats why people cant make their mortgage payments thats why people are having to move in with their parents and all kinds of other sacrifices are being made thats a tragedy because this is something thats not that complicated its something thatthere are models that show us what we should be doing in government the republican party has proposed all of the things that i am talking about in solutions that is in terms of health care are we saying there isnt something that should be done of course there are things that should be done in health care if you have got a problem with the plumbing in the kitchen sink it doesnt mean you remodel the entire kitchen thats what the democrats have proposed in socialized medicine the government could take over all of health care you dont have to do that but there are things that we can do to improve the situation and can build on what we have we have a very very good health care system in terms of delivery the payfor piece of it is broken and its because about a third of americans dont pay anything for their health care no wonder that starts to create stress in the system there are things that we can do to improve the efficiency and the way our health care system works but it doesnt mean scrap the whole thing and give it to the government in each of these areas there are good proposals ways to solve these problems when we are talking about jobs and employment we have to remember what the basic principles are the basic principles are those small businesses have to be healthy and they are never healthy when we spend too much money when we create too much redtape and when we tax too much and also when we dont get the right rules in terms of liquidity i heard on the floor here not so long ago the democrats saying that this entire recession is the fault of george bush of course he is the one that brought the hurricaneits always convenient to find somebody to blame but whats to blame in this recession whats to blame in terms of job losses well its these things here anybody who has ever run a small business you can check these with anybody who has a friend talk to somebody who runs a small business ask them is economic uncertainty a problem in terms of creating jobs oh yes yes slowdown in the economy yes that makes me concerned excessive taxation oh yes you are going to tax me a whole lot we have got this thing called a death tax the death tax the way it works is when it goes back into effect in 2011 or 2012 lets say you have got a business maybe its a farm you have got the thousand acres and dad is running the farm dad dies and passes the farm on to his son the government says well your dad died so we are going to tax you well how come you are taxing he already paid his taxes yes we are going to tax him again its a double taxation and we want 45 percent of the value of the farm the son says well that means i would have to sell half the land from a thousand acres and go to 500 i would have to get rid of half of my tractors and combines and other equipment the farm really wouldnt work at 500 acres it needs a full thousand acres sorry bub you owe uncle sam the death tax what that does is what it kills small business when you do that death tax these are things that people know you just cant do this and expect to have a strong economy thats where we have been making some mistakes unfortunately this last year these mistakes have come home to roost you could say well this is bushs mistake because he got the whole economy messed up in the first place well lets go back to that record lets go back to that conservative newspaper the new york times on september 11 september 11 2003 the new york times reported first of all that president george bush was worried about what was going on with freddie and fannie freddie and fannie had apparently lost a few billion dollars didnt know where they had put it that said these financial institutions that were quasipublic the implication was that the government would be in the bag if something went wrong with freddie and fannie he is quoted september 11 2003 in the new york times saying that congress needs to give him authority to regulate freddie and fannie more in a matter of a year or two we here in the house it was a republican house at that time passed a bill to give the president authority to get into freddie and fannies finances and to regulate them more because they were out of control the bill went to the senate as you can expect but it was killed by the democrats in a filibuster on the floor it never saw the light of day it was never passed so it was that freddie and fannie failing along with other parts of that real estate market which was created by laws that we had made saying that banks had to make loans to people who couldnt afford to pay them and also this wild speculation that came from a very very low interest rate and a lot of liquidity created by greenspan you put that all together and you get a bubble in the real estate market the bubble pops and things come apart now you could try and blame that thing on bush but it really wouldnt be accurate to do that he saw at least in 2003 that we were in trouble and recognized we should do something about it its easy to try to blame problems that are created by overspending and overtaxation on the republicans but the fact of the matter is this congress has got 80 democrats more than it does republicans this is not exactly what you call a republican control of the congress or the house over in the senate the democrats have a working 60vote majority so they could even break filibusters and pass what they want they have had a year to work on this and we can see what they have done we have seen what happened to their spending we have seen all these different things they put money into these ones that are foggy are the ones that are just done by the house the senate has not passed them we have seen whats happened to employment as a result of that excessive spending it has not been good and its not been good for a reason we have today again continued in the same policy i think americans are getting tired of it i think they realize you cant blame it on someone else that these are basic factors that people understand its businesses that create jobs and if you tax the businesses too much and if you have the wrong environment for the businesses they are not going to be able to keep the economy going ironically something that suffers a great deal in a poor economy are governments governments depend on tax revenues for their revenues and the states really take a beating because many of them have balanced budgets that they have to meet so if you happen to be some poor governor in a state when you have a congress like this thats spending money wildly and forgetting the basic principles of economics youve got a lot of problems so this cartoon is as a lot of cartoons that have a certain amount of sense and humor to them now give me one good reason why youre not hiring well weve seen a whole lot of reasons why were not hiring and the trouble is that we have essentially exasperated every single one of these things and thats why there are not jobs here so were closing up here then on this segment on unemployment and on spending and what it is that creates it theres nothing here thats very complicated like most things in life if you understand the mechanics and how they work theyre not very difficult were doing some things that are wrong in terms of jobs if we want to have jobs we can do it its not the government thats going to create the jobs its you my friends the american people that will create the jobs but we have to give you an economic environment that is conducive to creating jobs and that does not mean a whole lot more money in spending such as our 150 billion in stimulus ii son of stimulus if you want to call it that the failed bill from last summer that didnt work it does not include increasing the debt limit as we did today by 300 billion what it includes is the same basic principle that jfk ronald reagan and bush used which is getting the government off the backs of the people of the united states this is a sad situation my father fought in world war ii and their mindset was were going to give of ourselves a whole lot so the next generation our children can have more than we did some of them didnt go to college and they said we want our kids to go to college we want to leave america a better place is that the heritage of this day that we want to leave america a worse place that we want to leave our kids and our grandkids up to their ears in debt having a less bright future than what we had cant we learn from the great generation that fought world war ii that we want to leave america a better place i believe the american public will say we want to go back to leaving this a stronger better freer country than when we inherited it and i think we will do that but we will do that by changing these false premises and policies that are leading us down the primrose path i thank the speaker for allowing me to talk on

in fact the president himself said that he needed that for revenue revenue to pay for obamacare now thats not a direct quote of the presidents but thats what he said he said he needed the revenue from the environmental tax which was really an energy tax a tax on all energygasoline electricity and everything he needed the revenue so that he could pay for his medical program for his socialized medicine that we forced through here in congress thats why i call it taxandtrade not capandtax but you can call it taxandtax i guess or any of those also the president said very clearlyand i can quote

and a helper certainly has a good idea about ways to fix our health care system its just a shame that in the health care bill that got crammed down everyones throat here that my friend from georgia as well as so many of the doctors here were not allowed any real meaningful input and it is interesting as we think about the health care bill that was supposed to do so much and you consider it in light of the speakers comments that we need to pass the bill so we can find out whats in it well were beginning to find out more and more now some of us read through the 1 000page bill we read through the 2 000page bill and when we got this one between 2 000 and 3 000 pages frankly i put off going through that i knew there wasnt going to be much sleep for a while while i was trying to get through that and i think i got through about all but about 300 pages its tough sledding though of course when you are reading through a bill that references other sections and subsections and including other laws that unless you actually go look them up then its hard to really get a grasp since i have been a judge and dealt with law most of my adult life sometimes you can pick up things others dont realize but it really is heartbreaking to realize as more and more people get into this new socalled health care bill just how much damage is being and will be done you dont cut 500 billion from medicare and not end up having seniors that dont get the care they need you dont end up increasing taxes by 500 billion like this did and not hurt job creation in this country i heard a comment just today from someone whos not a member of congress is an economist he said you cant love jobs and hate the people that create them and that seems to be what were dealing with weve got a health care bill that punishes employers if you dare try to provide health insurance for your employees then youre going to actually end up paying more than you ever dreamed you would if you dont pay for health care for your employees if you have more than 50 employees youre going to be paying 2 000 per employee and thats going to get pretty expensive its not going to help them one whit with their health insurance but we have done so much damage to jobs its just unbelievable and i am getting more calls and emails into my office from people that are shocked because they thought once the obamacare bill went through all of a sudden they would magically get health care like they never had before now what people are going to get for the next few years is a lot of extra taxes 500 billion in extra taxes and thats not going to be good for the economy but as we approach the end of the year a number of economists have pointed out things should start picking up the rest of the year if the government doesnt keep interfering and creating problems as it has been because the economy wants to improve itself if we will just let it but especially the next 6 months things should be improving because when we get to january 1 2011 there are going to be the biggest tax increases in american history january 1 of 2011 its coming and we have seen over and over you want to hurt the economy then just have a big tax increase our friends across the aisle constantly enjoy saying it is tax cuts that got us into this problem it is not it is the spending that went out of control when the republicans had congress from 1995 to 2000 it is the congress that got a balanced budget the president doesnt pass a budget he proposes one his wasnt used the congress came up with a balanced budget and despite president clinton kicking and screaming he finally came along and signed off on the bill and we had a balanced budget the problem came when we had a republican president and republican house and senate you had republicans get giddy and start thinking gee maybe the democrats are right and you can show compassion by throwing money at a problem you can spoil a child by doing that if you are a parent you can destroy peoples desire to work i wish more could have benefited from the exchange program from which i learned so much in 1973 there were eight americans that were allowed into the soviet union that summer on that program at one point the eight of us were out at a collective farm about 30 miles from kiev in ukraine and i was amazed because the fields looked terrible i am from east texas and there is a lot of farming and ranching i have worked on a lot of farms i could not believe how bad their fields were they were just pitiful it looked like nobody had been working out there the sun was eating them up and they werent doing anything about it the fields were overgrown with weeds anyway all of the farmers in midmorning were sitting in the shade i spoke some russian back then and i put together some words and tried to nicely say in russian when do you work and they laughed one of the guys said in russian i make the same number of rubles if i am here or i am out there in the field so i am here well there is your lesson on communism when you end up paying people the same thing if they are working and sweating and killing themselves to grow crops or if they are sitting in the shade laughing cutting up with their friends they are going to sit in the shade and laugh and cut up with their friends it is going to happen that is why communism has never worked and it will never work the pilgrims tried a form of it out of a christian thoughtif we bring everything in a common storehouse and share things even the new testament church at one time tried that and it resulted in the apostle paul saying okay new rule you dont work you dont eat the pilgrims had to do something similar and they got to a really novel concept how about if we just give everybody your own private property it is yours to do with as you wish but you eat what you grow you have excess you can trade it barter whatever use it to buy other things what a novel idea giving people private property and letting them be rewarded by the sweat of their brow instead of rewarding their neighbor many people think that and as a christian i dont seek to ram my beliefs into someone else but as a christian if you care you would like for people to understand what is at risk but i hear christians here on the floor who have spoken up and said you know jesus said as you have done to the least of these my children you have done to me he said we are to help the widows and orphans he said we are to help the less fortunate i was naked and you clothed me i was hungry and you fed me where is that compassion in here what they misunderstand is that jesus never said go thee therefor use and abuse your taxing authority take somebody elses money and do your charitable work he meant for you to do it with your own money your own effort not go take from somebody else and legalize your stealing from somebody else so you give to your favorite charity that is not what he intended he knew in an orderly society you would have need of government you would need courts that is why romans 13 talks about the role of government if you do evil be afraid because the government is supposed to be fair but fairness is not taking in a form of legalized stealing taking somebody elses money to give to your favorite charity that is why after zacchaeus met jesus the first thing he did was go and cut taxes fact is he even created a 4 to 1 rebate for those from whom he improperly took tax money but you dont hear that kind of talk a whole lot here you hear you guys are heartless and uncaring when you think about eagles or birds it seems so mean and uncaring for a mother to shove that bird out of the nest and force them to learn to fly it seems mean it seems uncaring but unless they do that they are never going to learn to fly there are people who could fly in this country figuratively speaking and yet the government keeps pushing just enough money into their hands to keep them subsisting and just enough money to keep them beholden to the big master here in washington it is as if there are people here in this city who want people across america to see us in congress as the big master and you are the slave you are the servant we want you beholden to us thats not what this nation was founded on this nation was founded on the ideas and you read them and hear them if you study historyi had wonderful history teachers and it breaks my heart to hear people who dont understand where we came from and the basis for this country but it was not to lure people into subsistence and dependence on the government that was never the purpose it was to inspire people it was to give them liberty and freedom and say you can be anything you want to be and some of us were blessed to have parents who loved us and would say that you can be anything you want to be and now today unfortunately surveys are showing indicating 70 percent of american adults first time in our history are saying we dont believe our children are going to have the opportunities and liberties the life as good as we have had it that is tragic and that is why some of us ran for congress because we are going to do everything in our power to prevent that from happening so our children can have an even better life better liberty better freedoms than we had it can still happen but it cannot happen when this government is determined to make people completely reliant on it one of the things that drove me to run for congress to leave the judicial bench was i knew judges were not supposed to legislate and i didnt sometimes i didnt like the laws i had to follow but if we were going to have a rule of law in this country judges have to follow the laws and i did but it was seeing how many examples over and over presented themselves that had indications that government lured these people away from their godgiven potential and into ruts from which they could not extricate themselves with no hope of getting out unless they committed a crime thats the way it would look to them how did we get so far afield from the foundation of this nation that inspired people to reach their heights and i understand i mean were all affected by how were raised and the people that had an impact on our lives and i am sure there are those in america who if they came from a broken home there are even people who have been given everything with a silver spoon who would seem to have come from nothing and yet had the best schools all the way up had the greatest things and i can understand if somebody has been given everything their whole life that theyve ever wanted that they would think well we need to do that for other people because look at me ive reached the top and you know i had everything given to me i never really had a real job never really had to work to earn things for myself everything was given to me so lets just give everything to everybody else unfortunately we come back to the quote i read earlier you cant love jobs and hate the people who create them it doesnt work and jobs are not created for very long by government without hurting the private sector meaning eventually the government takes over everything provides the jobs and theres no better example of where that goes than we had in the soviet union eventually just like the pilgrims just like the new testament church people in leadership realize weve made a mess now the question is can we get back on track it was one of the caesars that realized providing bread and circuses had made the people lazy they were unproductive and it was destroying the roman empire and he tried to do away with bread and circuses to push people as the mother eagle does push the baby out of the nest so it will be forced to fly unfortunately when you have made them dependent for so long for too long they dont fly they start rioting in the streets they dont reach their potential they start destroying what others have and what others have created for themselves and you eventually destroy the society they had to reinstate the bread and circuses and they knew there was no way to avoid the eventual end because people had become too dependent on government phil gramm used to say when you got one more in the wagon than pulling the wagon the wagons going to stop weve gone from 39 percent of unitedstates adults not paying income tax now approaching 50 percent and when we get over 50 percent if those people that do not pay any taxes all vote then were done for because youll have people picking the leaders just as has been predicted thousands of years ago you will have people selecting the leaders based on how much they will be promised from the public treasury and the public treasury will go broke and then you are put to the situation that the soviet union had you cant print it fast enough to get out of debt you cant borrow enough to sustain you any longer so you have to announce this country is out of business were done and thats where this country is going my friends across the aisle in 2005 and 2006 who complained bitterly about deficit spending were right we should not have been deficit spending its a big reason that our friends across the aisle won the majority but in the 4 years since nearly 4 years we have gone in one case a 160 billion budget to a 1 6 trillion budget they said the right things i thought they believed them youve got to stop deficit spending yet here after the majority shifted we have found ourselves with 10 times the deficit that we were beat up for properly 4 or 5 years ago the deficits have to stop we are destroying this country you look back at what president reagan did had a great economist art laffer and he had said you need a 30 percent tax cut if you will cut taxes 30 percent you will see this economy explode unfortunately that 30 percent tax cut was put in place over a 3year period in 1981 there was only like a 11 2 percent tax cut in 1982 a 10 percent tax cut in 1983 about a 20 percent tax cut so just as laffer predicted when he got so troubled when he heard that it was going to be phased in over 3 years he said 1981 and 1982 are going to be disastrous 1983 when the full tax cut comes through it will be terrific and thats what happened and thats how president reagan got a second term the big tax cuts came through the problem was deficit spending did not stop and its carried on even today with that brief interim when the serious republicans took the majority 1995 to 2000 they balanced the budget but weve got to get back to that or those 70 percent of american adults who think their kids will not have it as good as they did they will end up being right now look at some of the judgment that is being utilized these days you have people that say they believe in the law and yet you had a federal judge say you cant act arbitrarily and capriciously and just ban all offshore drilling even among people who are doing everything right you know i betcha if the federal government had said we are going to have a moratorium on our dear friends the big democratic contributors from a company called british petroleum if we just have a moratorium on british petroleum offshore rigs there would have been a basis because we knew it appears at least that they cut some corners and the more you find out the more you realize they kind of felt like somebody here in washington had their back they were working with this administration with the democratic majority particularly in the senate to pass a number of bills that most people think were not a good idea but the tarp bill british petroleum supported that the stimulus bill most people think you know oh these big oil companies they are all republican well if you look just like wall street wall street gives about four to one to democrats over republicans and with british petroleum they were working so closely with the administration and with democrats in the majority as one article talks about senator kerry communicating with working with british petroleum to try to pass the crapandtrade bill at the very time that the deepwater horizon blew out it is beginning to appear that british petroleum used a cheap way of drilling in such deep water it shouldnt have been used in such deep water that is what is beginning to emerge it appears may be the case and that it seems like there was almost an attitude that we dont have to worry were big buddies with the white house and with the majority theyve got our backs we can cut corners we find out minerals management service sent out their twoman unionized fatherandson team to be the last team of offshore inspectors that inspected the deepwater horizon theres certainly plenty of anecdotal stories about how the inspections were not occurring as they should and there were gifts changing hands all kinds of problems we find out that a lady who was in the clinton administration that actually signed the notices about the deepwater leases offshore leases back in 99 and 98 that pulled the price adjustment language which has now apparently cost our country billions of dollars from its treasury where they should have gone to big companies like british petroleum it turns out that lady went to work for british petroleum for 8 years from 2001 until 2009 and then in june of 2009 she came back to work for minerals management service even though we heard from the deputy secretary of the interior oh yeah weve recused her from areas where she may have a conflict give me a break from british petroleum no wonder they thought somebody here in washington their democratic majority friends the white house had their back so they could go cheaply they could cut corners and make extra profit because they were in with the powers that be here in washington they were in they were in favor of the crapandtrade bill they had supported tarp they had supported the stimulus and this administration loved having a big oil company that supported them on this stuff so that they could tout that so sure bp thought they had their back covered and it was only when after a number of weeks when it became very clear that the american public was furious appropriately at british petroleum that the administration realized they needed to throw them under the bus and so they finally did but what better thing to do if youre going to hurt one of your friends by throwing them under the bus then just hurt all the oil companies so that theyre all hurt equally except of course the one we heard on television that may be george soros biggest individual investment over 900 million to drill offshore brazil we loaned them 2 billion from this country even though we wont drill our own stuff and have a moratorium in this article about the deepwater drilling ban and the federal judge feldman that lifted it this article and this was from bloomberg indicates that judge feldman granted a preliminary injunction halting the moratorium and immediately prohibited the unitedstates from enforcing the ban government lawyers told feldman the ban was based on findings in a unitedstates report following the sinking of the deepwater horizon rig off the louisiana coast in april but then judge feldman after he reviewed that said the court is unable to divine or fathom a relationship between the findings and the immense scope of the moratorium the quote continues the blanket moratorium with no parameters seems to assume that because one rig failed and although no one yet fully knows why all companies and rigs drilling new wells over 500 feet also universally present an imminent danger i bet if they had just only imposed a moratorium on this administrations former dear friend and the majority particularly in the senate british petroleum then that moratorium probably would have held because there are seem to be indications they were cutting corners judge feldman said this also the court cannot substitute its judgment for that of the agency but the agency must quote cogently explain why it has exercised its discretion in a given manner judge feldman then says it has not done so and that it must be immediately prohibited in order to avoid irreparable harm and then what seemed to be offensive even more so from this administration was announcing that there would be an appeal even before the opinion was read its as if this administration really and truly does not care about the law we saw that with the auto task force their bankruptcy laws say there have to be time for alternative plans for reorganization secured creditors take the first unsecured creditors take last and least those laws were turned just thrown out by an auto task force meeting in the white house appointed by the president without any confirmation from the senate without any input from congress we couldnt even find out what was discussed in those meetings they just threw aside the bankruptcy law threw aside the constitution that says before you can take property there must be due process threw all those laws to the side completely dismembered the constitution and the bankruptcy laws and found a bankruptcy judge perhaps since they have to be reappointed its not a lifetime this bankruptcy judge was hoping to be reappointed as a bankruptcy judge perhaps he was hoping for a lifetime appointment but the judge signed off on it clearly illegal the supreme court should have stopped it but apparently the administration scared enough of the supreme court judges that if they held up this bankruptcy plan and the sale to an italian an inferior car company then all people in the car business would lose their jobs and they used scare tactics and got even the supreme court to overtly walk away from the constitution and ignore it and this is the kind of thing we see now they wont even read the opinion of the judge to see if it makes sense just simply announces were going to appeal but then again what would you expect from an administration that didnt have the decency to call the governor of arizona and say you know what governor we owe you an apology we are so sorry we should have been doing our job as a federal government we should not have allowed 75 percent of gang members who are violent in this country to be here illegally we shouldnt have allowed illegals to destroy wilderness area national parks and put people at life and liberty at risk property at risk we shouldnt have allowed that to happen to arizona we should have done our job and were sorry oh no that didnt happen instead the secretary of state was sent to ecuador to tell ecuador since i guess the administration thinks we owe ecuador more than we do one of the 50 states of the unitedstates citizens we owe more to ecuador apparently so they were told about the lawsuit that would be forthcoming against arizonas law from people who announced without ever reading the law that it was a terrible thing it was racist it was profiling and they had not even read the law you know its scary its really scary whats going on around here when the law doesnt matter i never thought i would see a time in our countrys history like this when the law just didnt matter were in power i really enjoy bill oreillys show on fox but i heard him say the other night whats wrong with the presidents bringing in a company ceo and having the attorney general there who has already announced he is investigating them he wants to charge them with a crime and have him sitting there for no other reason obviously than to intimidate the ceo of british petroleum and to get them to fork up a 20 billion fund there is a reason that one man in this country is not supposed to have that kind of authority to extort money bill oreilly said oh he thought it was fine in fact he would even go in with a machine gun and force them to give up that kind of money i hope and pray he got carried away when he made that comment and that he really doesnt believe that because what that would be saying is when someone does something as hideous as what british petroleum has done heretaking lives wounding injuring people destroying landscape destroying vast areasits okay if you become a criminal if they have been so very negligent its not okay to let someones negligence force you into becoming a criminal weve got to be above those things and weve got to follow the law there are laws that say you cannot abuse your office by threatening prosecution unless someone does something financially that you direct anyway these are just amazing times when smart people with wisdom on most occasions are letting that go to the wind as a result of some heinous negligenceand maybe at some point well find outsome criminally negligent activity as weve seen from british petroleum we owe it to arizona and the people of the united states to enforce the borders there are people coming into this country who want to destroy our way of life i talked to a retired fbi agent who said that one of the things they are looking at are terrorist cells overseas which have figured out how to game our system it appears they would have young women who would become pregnant they would get them into the united states to have a baby and they wouldnt even have to pay anything for the baby then the babies would return back where they could be raised and coddled as future terrorists then one day 20 30 years down the road they could be sent in to help destroy our way of life because they would have figured out how stupid weve been in this country to allow our enemies to game our system to hurt our economy to get set up in a position to destroy our way of life yet we wont do anything about it well even sue a state that tries to do something about it we have a national park down on the arizonamexico border that now has signs posted to warn american citizens not to go into the area because it is being used by people illegally there you know its kind of like those spaces in roads where a city just doesnt want to spend the money to fix a hole or a bump so instead of fixing the problem theyll just stick up a sign saying bump thats what were doing we have got a problem people are putting life and limb and sacred fortunes at risk and all were doing is putting up a sign saying that this is a dangerous area and that you probably dont want to come over here lets see this is an article from fox news authored by joshua rhett miller anyway in quoting from the article roughly 3 500 acres of the buenos aires national wildlife refugeabout 3 percent of the 118 000acre parkhave been closed since october 6 2006 when unitedstates fish and wildlife service officials acknowledged a marked increase in violence along a tract of land that extends north from the border for roughly threequarters of a mile federal officials say they have no plans to reopen the area weve just got to let the illegal violent people have that property and unitedstates citizens cant use it it has been closed the article reads elsewhere at organ pipe cactus national monument which shares a 32mile stretch of the border with mexico visitors are warned on a federally run web site that some areas are not accessible by anyone due to our proximity to the international boundary with mexico some areas near the border are closed for construction and visitor safety concerns the web site reads were not going to fix the bump in the road were just going to put up a sign that says bump well why dont you spend the money thats being spent on the sign to stop the problem instead states like arizona are driven to try to protect themselves now we have got an area down there a wilderness area in this park the organ pipe cactus national park with a 32mile stretch it is wilderness area so you cant even drive a vehicle border patrol cant drive a vehicle into that area a helicopter cant land in that area border patrol is not allowed to adequately do their job there how crazy is that its because weve got massive numbers of illegalssome violent as weve found outcoming in there doing damage and putting our nation at risk instead we declare it off limits to our own people you cant keep a country going when you have that little regard for the countrys future safety and current safety its interesting too under unitedstates law the border patrol can go onto private land along the unitedstates border with mexico or canada it can go in up to 25 miles away from the border to do their jobs except in this national park area theyre not allowed to go in to do their job there thats why ive prepared a bill that would direct the secretary of the interior or border patroland this is the way it works in this country in this government the law is we have to have a study done to see what would be an appropriate amount of land before we would be allowed to transfer it this bill would require that a study be completed to determine the buffer area needed to allow for border protection and for environmental protection on lands administered by the department of the interior along the border of arizona and mexico then theyd have to come back very quickly i put in 6 months they want to have 2 years normally we havent got that kind of time theyd come back and tell us how much would be appropriate to convey over away from the park so that we could adequately control our border its the only thing that makes sense in that regard and im hoping that many of my colleagues will sign onto that bill another thing weve done here is we today passed a bill making tougher sanctions regarding iran they are tougher sanctions and thats a good thing the trouble is it has taken so long to get sanctions in place and the centrifuges in iran have been spinning for so long that according to the iaea they have enough nuclear material to make two bombs now well lets think about that i have a resolution here and im hoping that we will have people who will get on board i think ive got around 50 cosponsors but there is no reason that most of the congress should not be sponsoring this bill so i would submit the following and this is from the bill that has been crafted and that i am proposing the whereases are as follows whereas with the dawn of modern zionism the national liberation movement of the jewish people some 150 years ago the jewish people determined to return to their homeland in the land of israel from the lands of their dispersion whereas in 1922 the league of nations mandated that the jewish people were the legal sovereigns over the land of israel and that legal mandate has never been superceded whereas in the aftermath of the naziled holocaust from 1933 to 1945 in which the germans and their collaborators murdered 6 million jewish people in a premeditated act of genocide the international community recognized that the jewish state built by jewish pioneers must gain its independence from great britain whereas the united states was the first nation to recognize israels independence in 1948 and the state of israel has since proven herself to be a faithful ally of the united states in the middle east whereas the united states and israel have a special friendship based on shared values and together share the common goal of peace and security in the middle east whereas on october 20 2009 president barack obama rightly noted that the united statesisrael relationship is a bond that is much more than a strategic alliance whereas the national security of the united states israel and allies in the middle east face a clear and present danger from the government of the islamic republic of iran seeking nuclear weapons and the ballistic missile capability to deliver them whereas israel would face an existential threat from a nuclear weaponsarmed iran whereas president barack obama had been firm and clear in declaring united states opposition to a nucleararmed iran stating on november 7 2008 let me staterepeat what i stated during the course of the campaign irans development of a nuclear weapon i believe is unacceptable if i might interject here this bill was drafted to be extremely bipartisan to show that people on both sides of the aisle have the same concerns weve just got to get people signed on as cosponsors so that we can get this to the floor for a vote but going back to the resolution whereas on october 26 2005 at a conference in tehran called world without zionism iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad stated god willing with the force of god behind it we shall soon experience a world without the united states and zionism whereas the new york times reported that during his october 26 2005 speech president ahmadinejad called for this occupying regimeisraelto be wiped off the map whereas on april 14 2006 iranian president ahmadinejad said like it or not the zionist regime israel is heading toward annihilation whereas on june 2 2008 iranian president ahmadinejad said i must announce that the zionist regimeisraelwith a 60year record of genocide plunder invasion and betrayal is about to die and will soon be erased from the geographical scene whereas on june 2 2008 iranian president ahmadinejad said today the time for the fall of the satanic power of the united states has come and the countdown to annihilation of the emperor of power and wealth has started whereas on may 20 2009 iran successfully tested a surfacetosurface longrange missile with an approximate range of 1 200 mileswhich by the way if it were on a ship off the texas coast could get it up to the middle of the country 300 miles up and which if exploded as wellknown among those who have looked at the issue would create an electromagnetic pulse an emp which some experts have told us will fry every computer chip in the country and indications are even walmart would not be able to sell a product electricity would not be generated it just is important to note what 1 200 miles means whereas iran continues its pursuit of nuclear weapons whereas iran has been caught building three secret nuclear facilities since whereas iran continues its support of international terrorism has ordered its proxy hezbollah to carry out catastrophic acts of international terrorism such as the bombing of the jewish amia center in buenos aires argentina in 1994 and could give a nuclear weapon to a terrorist organization in the future whereas iran has refused to provide the international atomic energy agency with full transparency and access to its nuclear program whereas united nations security council resolution 1803 states that according to the international atomic energy agency iran has not established full and sustained suspension of all enrichmentrelated and reprocessing activities and heavy waterrelated projects as set out in resolution 1696 2006 1737 2006 and 1747 2007 nor resumed its cooperation with the iaea under the additional protocol nor taken the other steps required by the iaea board of governors nor complied with the provisions of security council resolution 1696 from 2006 1737 from 2006 and 1747 from 2007 whereas at july 2009s g8 summit in italy iran was given a september 2009 deadline to start negotiations over its nuclear programs and iran offered a 5page document lamenting the ungodly ways of thinking prevailing in global relations and included various subjects but left out any mention of irans own nuclear program which was the true issue in question whereas the united states has been fully committed to finding a peaceful resolution to the iranian nuclear threat and has made boundless efforts seeking such a resolution and to determine if such a resolution is even possible and whereas the united states does not want or seek war with iran but it will continue to keep all options open to prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons now therefore be it resolved that the house of representatives condemns the governmentnumber one condemns the government of the islamic republic of iran for its threats of annihilating the united states and the state of israel for its continued support of international terrorism and for its incitement of genocide of the israeli people two supports using all means of persuading the government of iran to stop building and acquiring nuclear weapons three reaffirms the united states bond with israel and pledges to continue to work with the government of israel and the people of israel to ensure that their sovereign nation continues to receive critical economic and military assistance including missile defense capabilities needed to address the threat of iran and four expresses support for israels right to use all means necessary to confront and eliminate nuclear threats posed by iran defend israeli sovereignty and protect the lives and safety of the israeli people including the use of military force if no other peaceful solution can be found within a reasonable time now thats what we should have passed today instead of sanctions because the sanctions have not been productive the centrifuges continue to turn and ahmadinejad continues to make threats another thing thats been going on is the snubbery of israel by this administration and the incredibly hurtful vote with israels enemies to force them to open up and reveal their most powerful defenses similar to what hezekiah did back 2 000 years before there was a mohammedback unfortunately as helen thomas never had anybody kind enough to teach her the truth the historic truth thousands of years before mohammed hezekiah was in israelwell i guess not quite 2 000 years but after he showed the babylonians his treasure and all his defenses isaiah came and said because of this everything they have seen will be taken away you dont show your enemies all of your defenses your strongest defenses because theyll figure out a way to defeat them and because this administration has been rather rude to prime minister netanyahutheres a letter that im hopeful that members will join in signing bipartisan speaker pelosi and leader reid the letter simply bipartisan in nature says this letter is to simply state the obvious need for the prime minister of our dear friend israel to address a joint session of congress he has been here in washington on numerous occasions but has not addressed a joint session of congress since 1996 in our nations history we have invited over 100 leaders from 50 different countries to speak before joint sessions of congress at this time with the enemies of america and israel looking for weaknesses in our close relationship we can show them that israel is our friend and will be our friend and we want to hear from its leader prime minister netanyahu with the magnitude of international events and tensions swirling in recent years and the threat of nuclear proliferation in the middle east it is desperately important that we show the world the importance of our relationship with israel by inviting prime minister netanyahu to come address this body the sooner we extend such an invitation the more stabilizing it will be we the undersigned urge you to extend the invitation to prime minister netanyahu to speak to a joint session of congress as soon as possible when the enemies of israel were to see both sides of the aisle standing and applauding the prime minister of israel the message could not be more clear but we need to send that message it needs to be clear it needs to be unequivocal people need to know that we support our friend and there is not a great deal of distance between our two countries were close friends and if i might inquire how much time remains"], [6.52265953249298e-05, 6.52265953249298e-05, 0, "this evening we stand just before a daytomorrowof great political drama i am trained as an engineer and not much of an expert on drama or plays but i have at least one theory about acting in plays and drama and that is usually its very good or very bad as we take a look at the drama that faces people who will be watching tomorrow the question tonight is what drama are they liable to watch are they going to watch the olympics the last part of the olympics which will be very exciting or the political drama of 6 hours of discussions or debate i think there will be more drama that will take place tomorrow on the health care bill now we have been talking about this health care bill for more than a year and the subject has had a tendency to get a little bit stale but tomorrow is an attempt to revive that discussion one of the things that is required in good drama is the theme or the major topic and the different parts of that drama have to be believable i think thats one of the things that may make the drama tomorrow more difficult in terms of its success lets just talk about what really is believable the president claimed about a year or so agoi guess it was in a state of the union messagethat this new health care was going to save money and that it wouldnt cost us a dime well i guess thats true its going to cost more like 1 trillion is that believable the president repeatedly said that republicans had no ideas yet in baltimore just a month or two ago he said not that the republicans had no ideas but that hed read a good number of the bills that had been introduced by the republicans is that believable the president also pledged transparency and openness in the whole process of developing a health care bill what we have seen has been that bills are developed behind closed doors and for tomorrow the bill that has been created behind closed doors is going to be revealed only for 24 hours so is the transparency openness pledge believable in baltimore the president talked about the fact that he has a lot of economic experts scoring the bill and taking a look at whether it works financially or not whether or not the different component parts come together and whether or not it achieves the economic results that he wants yet when the congressional budget office which is supposedly and to a large degree politically neutral scored the bill they said that the republican bill actually reduces premiums by 10 percent while the democrat bill makes them more expensive then there is a question about whether or not the meeting tomorrow which is attempting to be billed as bipartisan and bipartisanshipdoes that really make sense because if you write a bill behind closed doors unveiling it at the last minute within 24 hours and then demand that the republicans agree to it is that really bipartisanship i wonder if that is believable the president promised us that the bill that he was going to present when he was in baltimore would include tort reform yet the bill that we have seen did the exact opposite the states that had already enacted tort reform were forbidden from using those tort reform laws so in effect it would reverse tort reform and would go in the exact opposite direction is that believable we were told that the special deals have been taken out yet in a few minutes we will take a look at those special deals which remain in the bill then last of alland it is the one that i find most amazingthe republicans are obstructionists i find that hard to believe how anybody could even repeat that let alone believe it i wish it were true i sorely wish it were true the republicans here in this chamber my republican colleagues are 40 votes short of a majority there is nothing that we could obstruct if our lives depended on it the democrats could lose 20 voters and still pass anything that they choose to pass so how we could be as republicans obstructionists again seems very hard to pass the old sniff test now it seems that the president in setting up this great drama of 6 hours of televised discussion on health care has made a major assumption which is if people just knew what was in his bill they would really like it probably the opposite is true what we have seen is our constituents my constituents have called in and they have read portions of these bills they know what is in the bill guess what they dont like it in fact this bill that is being proposed is ugly its so ugly it has to sneak up on a glass of water just to get a drink well lets take a look specifically at why it is that we are going to have this great health care political drama tomorrow and yet we are not really passing the believable test lets just take a look to see if anything has really changed at all first of all this bill imposes 500 billion in medicare cuts thats a whole lot of money five hundred billion dollars is going to be taken out of medicare the old democrat bill took 500 billion out of medicare the presidents new bill takes 500 billion out of medicare the republican alternative takes nothing out of medicare well nothing seems to have changed here this bill enacts jobkilling tax hikes and government regulations costing hundreds of billions of dollars in the old democrat bill yes that was true for it the presidents new plan which is online likewise enacts a lot of jobkilling tax hikes and government regulations that cost billions of dollars yet the republican alternative does not it spends 1 trillion on a government takeover of the health care system this is something that people are really conscious of this is a government takeover of an entire sector of the unitedstates economy 1 trillion i think that number is short because its not counting the unfunded mandates to states the old democrat bill does that the presidents new bill does it the republican bill does not so what has changed here it benefits trial lawyers by failing to enact tort reform well the old democrat bill did not have any real tort reform in it in fact it went the opposite way the presidents new bill is not different the republican alternative is the opposite it protects backroom deals with washington special interests weve been told these deals have been taken out but theyve not been taken out the old bill had those special deals the new bill does the republican bill does not it puts government bureaucrats in charge of personal health care decisions this is something a lot of americans are very concerned with its bad enough if some insurance company is getting between you and your doctor but its even worse if a government bureaucrat does because if you dont like the insurance company you can change companies you cant change governments so again the new proposal is no different than the democrat proposal and the republicans are not doing that it breaks president obamas pledge not to raise taxes on those who make less than 250 000 well certainly the old democrat bill did raise taxes on people making less than 250 000 the new proposal still taxes people more who make less than 250 000 the republican proposal does not it forces individuals to purchase governmentapproved health insurance thats something that people are pretty sensitive tothe governments telling you that you must buy health insurance the old democrat bill does that the presidents proposal still does it republicans reject that idea it forces employers to choose governmentapproved health insurance or they are going to have to pay a new tax so the government is going to tell you what kind of insurance you have got to purchase or you are going to have to pay a new kind of tax the old democrat bill did that what the president is proposing continues to do it the republicans dont so is this great drama that is supposed to take place tomorrow really something new im not so sure that it is in that it seems to follow the same pattern now if we take a look at the proposal the proposal is still pretty much the same thing here is a picture of what this bill looks like you have got a 2 000page bill and it is pretty complicated to try and read 2 000 pages in 24 hours is quite an undertaking the only advantage that some of us have is that its so much like the other proposals that it is not really that different you dont have to read all 2 000 pages of it to know whats in there as i mentioned the president makes an assumption which is that if people just understood the bill betternow thats obviously something that he could talk about for 6 hours i think if its that complicated if people just understood the bill better they would like it what i would propose is that the president is mistaken in that regard what i would like to talk about for just a few minutes are the people who are not going to like this bill when they see what it has got in it because there are a lot of these groups of americans various groups and i will tell you which groups they are and why theyre not going to like this bill i think the more that this bill is talked about and the more that people read it and see how it works whats going to happen is that youre going to see these numbers change right now in the public opinion of health care 58 percent of voters nationwide oppose the obama health care reform plan 58 percent oppose it 50 percent of voters strongly oppose the plan and 78 percent of voters expect the plan to cost more than projected so its not very popular now the question is if they see 6 more hours of drama are they going to like the plan any more i would suggest that there are all kinds of groups of people who are not going to like this plan let me talk to you about some of those groups of people the first is a category that i am increasingly putting myself in and thats the group of people who are older i just hit 62 years old so im feeling a little bit older and older people arent going to like this plan for a couple of reasons the first reason they wont like it is because of something we mentioned just a minute ago which is that this is going to take 500 billion out of medicare now when i was first getting started in politics years ago the democrats always accused republicans of taking money away from medicare yet ironically this bill which is being proposed by the president is taking 500 billion out of medicare so if youre an older person you probably wont like it for that reason if you are an older person there is a bigger and more serious reason that you will not like this bill if you are older you will go to see the doctor more if you go to see the doctor more what this bill is going to do is it is going to harm the quality of american health care it will harm the quality this has been the experience of every nation that has had its government take over health care it has also been the experience of two statesmassachusetts and tennesseewhich have had their state governments try to take over health care in every one of those experiences the quality of health care has gone down and the cost of health care has gone up so if you are an older person and if you see the doctor a little bit more first of all youre not going to like that great big cut to medicare second of all the quality of your health care is going to go down now lets say instead of being older youre young certainly you would like the bill if the older people dont like it no wrong if youre young you wont like the bill because this bill forces you to pay for government insurance which is written the way the government says you have to buy the insurance if you dont buy that insurance youre going to be penalized youre going to have to pay a penalty if you are a young person if you like freedom and if you dont want the government telling you what kind of insurance to buy or if you have to buy insurance you wont like this bill for those reasons the next group of people that will probably not like this bill is the group of people who are married what this bill does to married people is it says if youre married youre going to have to pay more money for your health insurance than if youre single so there is a marriage penalty in this bill in other words if you have two individuals who are both making the same amount of moneysay you have two individuals making 32 000 a year if you take a look at what those two single individuals have to pay because they get all the subsidies under this bill they are going to have to pay a lot less than the two people as husband and wife who are making the same amount of money those people will have to pay 2 000 more so this bill contains for that example 2 000 of penalties for people who are married so if youre married you probably wont like this bill now if you happen to fall in the category of being prolife or at least if you fall in the category of not wanting government money your tax money to pay for abortions you wont like this bill because the bill thats being proposed is the senate bill and it allows in these insurance policies which are government funded for people to get abortions through the policies so there is not a strict and clean line in the bill the way the house version of the bill was passed which says that there is absolutely no using these government policies to do abortions so if youre prolife you will not like the senate version of this bill and you will hear people who are involved in the prolife cause standing and arguing vigorously that the senate version is unacceptable now if you own a small business youre not going to like this bill if you own a small business this is going to cause you trouble in a number of different ways first of all youre going to be taxed a tremendous amount of money to help pay for this whole thing if you think about small business in america as being people who have 500 employees or less that is 80 percent of the jobs in america are small business people those companies are not going to like this bill the people that run those companies because of the fact that it requires those companies first of all to pay a great deal of increased taxes to help pay for the trillionplusdollar bill in this package but also it requires those companies to buy the insurance that the government tells them they have to buy and if even one employee doesnt like it then there are going to be additional penalties this is going to cost small businessmen a lot of taxes and a lot of regulations and red tape if youre a small businessman youre not going to like this bill if youre unemployed you wont like this bill because this bill is going to cost jobs it will make it harder for you to get your next job how is it that this bill will make it harder for you to get your job well get into that in a little bit more detail later but the basic elements of creating jobs in our economy is allowing the small businesses to create the jobs by creating an environment in the small business that makes jobs how does that happen well one you dont want to tax the guy that owns the business because you want him to put his money back into the business to expand it to buy new equipment to put a new wing on the building in order to create more jobs this bill does the exact opposite it buries the small business owner in taxes and red tape and a lot of unknown costs for health care when you do that its going to make the small business less likely to hire people and therefore if youre unemployed its going to make it a lot harder to get a job because this is a jobkilling proposal so if you are an unemployed person this is not something that you want to see passing right away the people in america who own health insurance are not going to like this bill if you own health insurance what this bill is going to do is its going to charge you more money for your health insurance to help pay for the people who havent bought any health insurance so this bill is going to cost you more for the health insurance if you own health insurance lets just run through the list of who wouldnt like this bill if youre older you wont like the bill if youre young you wont like the bill if youre married you wont like the bill if youre prolife you wont like the bill if youre a small business owner you wont like the bill and if youre somebody looking to get a job from that small business owner you still wont like the bill then also if you have health insurance youre not going to like the bill either so theres a whole lot of people that just naturally when they take a look at what all of this complicated maze means to them those are all people who arent going to like this proposal is that all there are who wont like the proposal oh no there are a lot of other people who wont like the proposal as well lets take a look at some of the others if you are concerned about illegal immigration you wont like the bill because this bill provides no guarantee that illegal immigrants cannot come in and get health care and get the subsidies to health care that will have to be paid for by the american public and all the people who are taxed to pay for this measure so if youre concerned about illegal immigrants coming and getting a free ride in terms of governmentpaidfor health care this bill does not contain the protections if youre worried about illegal immigrants coming into this country and getting subsidized health care this bill does that and there is no protection against it if youre one of 36 states who do not want the federal government to mandate that everybody in your state has to buy governmentcertified health care if you want the people in your state to have some sovereignty if you care about state sovereignty and you want the people of your state to make their own decisions how theyll spend their money and you dont want the federal government to force the people in your state to pay for insurance then this bill is something that you dont want and there are 36 different states out of 50 36 states that have legislation that is in the process of moving in those states essentially banning the federal government from requiring citizens of those states to have to buy health insurance product so if youre one of those 36 states where the legislators are saying we dont want the federal government butting into our business telling our citizens that they have to buy insurance then this is something that you certainly wouldnt want the other people that might not like this and this probably goes almost without saying are people who make a fair amount of money people who make a fair amount of money are going to be taxed very heavily in a number of different regards to try to help subsidize this new health insurance plan if youre welltodo and you dont like huge taxes then you certainly are not going to like this plan if you happen to be somebody thats concerned with doing things in a just way that is if youre concerned that every state gets the same deal that there are no special deals in this legislation youre not going to like it weve been told that the special deals have been taken out but unfortunately thats not true here are some of the special deals in this proposal that are still there one of them is what they call louisiana purchase no 2 and that is something for i believe mary landrieu out in louisiana the cost is 300 million and it provides a special assignment for states recovering from a major disaster its written just to include this one state and its 300 million to add to the state medicaid program so thats a 300 million special deal for louisiana how about for connecticut yes there is a special deal for a connecticut hospital 100 million which appears to apply only to some connecticut hospitals theres millions of medicaid dollars for vermont and massachusetts thats 1 1 billion total it helps with the medicaid program and gives about 600 million to vermont massachusetts 500 million for those states cash for new jersey drug companies new jerseys getting a deal the cost is 1 billion for special deals for new jersey extra cash for union health care plans this is a deal of 5 billion it says that theres going to be a reinsurance program to defray the medical costs of union members so thats 5 billion for union member health care costs are there other special deals yes in fact there are we dont have to pay any medicare advantage remember how i said this bill is going to cut 500 billion from medicare but it wont cut medicare advantage for people in florida so if youre in florida you wont get that medicare advantage cut the other states will special funding for coal miners in montana yes it does the cost were not quite sure what that is but its medicare coverage for workers exposed to environmental health hazards there is a fee exemption for politically connected insurers in michigan apparently higher medicare payments for north dakota providers hawaii hospitals are getting exempt from the cuts and longshoremen are exempt from tax or health plans there is a whole series of special deals so if you dont like special deals for various states that your state doesnt get you wont like this plan i think one of the groups and this is probably not exactly small that doesnt like this plan would be doctors why would that be well what does a doctor do why does a doctor become a doctor many of them will say that they really wanted to take care of people and help them with their health care why then would a doctor dislike this plan other than its great complexity well one of the things thats extremely frustrating to doctors as well as patients is something that we dont like but has happened and that is you allow an insurance company to come between a doctor and a patient i think most people consider that doctorpatient relationcertainly my republican colleagues would say if theres anything in health care that should be principally sacred it would be the fact that the doctor and the patient need to make the final decisions on health care thats something that we dont want to have disturbed and if an insurance company is allowed to come between the doctor and the patient we dont like that we dont want somebody thats not a doctor getting involved in medical decisions unfortunately in versions of this plan what you have is you have insurance companies who are allowed to make medical decisions and are not held legally accountable for the outcome of those decisions thats bad enough but a doctor particularly wont like this plan because instead of an insurance company which you can always change or at least you have some chance to change you have no chance to change the federal government if the federal government is the one that is coming between you and your doctor so if youre a doctor a lot of doctors do not like this plan in fact there have been a dozen different republican doctors on the floor over the period of the last year talking about the fact that they dont like this plan they think its terrible and that should tell us something there is another constituent group that does not like the plan theres another group of people who will not like this plan i happen to fall into this group and its one that you might not think of off the top of your head and that would be people who have cancer why would people who have cancer not like this plan well one of the things that has been done is to take a look at the survival rate in people who have cancer in various countries what you find in england is the survival rate is much much lower than the survival rate in america the survival rate of cancer patients in canada is lower than the survival rate of cancer patients in america so if america then changes our medical system to be more like england or canada we have to assume also that then the survival rate of cancer patients is going to be less its going to be harder to try to survive cancer when you have a staterun system doing cancer so theres cancer patients the list does seem to be getting a little bit long and is it really such a good idea on this great drama thats supposed to take place tomorrow in competition by the way with the olympics this great political drama is the assumption really true that if the american people see this bill more closely theyre going to love it more or is it possible that in this drama the real villain in the drama is this very bill itself is it possible that all of these different groups of americans really do have it right lets run through this again this is a pretty significant list as i go through it i would like you to ask yourself do i fall into that group myself is this something that is going to affect me in a bad way certainly a great majority of americans believe it will hurt them and it is not a bill that they want but lets take a look at who these people are that wouldnt like it first of all if youre old then if youre young if youre married if youre prolife if youre a small business owner if youre unemployed if you have health insurance if youre concerned about illegal immigration and they are getting health insurance if you are one of the many states who are concerned with a government mandate that every citizen has to purchase government certified health care if you are welltodo if you are those who dont like the special deals that some states get and other ones dont get if you are a doctor you are not going to like this plan and if you care about the doctorpatient relationship you particularly wont like this plan and if you happen to be a person with cancer youre not going to like this plan but then again you may be dead so you might not care as much and then you have other people leaders who are in state government governors legislators various senators or house members in state government why would they not like this plan well here this is another group that has a pretty good concern and that is the trilliondollar bill that has been attached to this plan that trilliondollar bill is not the full cost of the plan a lot of cost is going to be passed down to the various states so this plan contains unfunded mandates on the various states now a lot of states because of the recession and the high level of unemployment their state revenues are very tight in fact some of them are in the red and if we through this plan produce something that first of all is going to create more unemployment and going to cost more money to the various states people who have to manage the state budget unlike the federal budget many states have a balanced budget requirement and so if you keep adding more costs to those states they are going to have to cut other things on the state budget in order to pay for this big governmentrun program the exact numbers on what unfunded mandates this includes are not entirely known particularly when a plan is being released and you have 24 hours for different economic experts to look at it now is it possible that the reason that this bill after it has been put together behind closed doors is trotted out for only 24 hours that the reason for that is people really dont want a good economic look at what this is going to cost i hope that is not the case but it is very hard in 24 hours for the congressional budget office to come up and say well here is what it is really going to cost and even if you take their best estimates which i think they try in the past their estimates of medicare were way way off by a factor of two or three or as much as seven times off those numbers tend to be much lower than what the real costs of the programs are so there are a lot of people in various state leaderships that are not going to like this plan people who do not like red tape i dont think we need explain that one very much if you dont like red tape you are not going to like this this is a simplified version of a 2 000page bill and every one of these new boxes is some government creation to try to make this thing work because the government is taking over you have to remember almost a fifth of the unitedstates economy and when they do that they have got to create a lot of bureaucrats and boxes and flow charts and all that kind of stuff if you dont like red tape you are not going to like this bill and then people who dont trust the government to run the economy well i think there are a lot of people who think that the government is not proving to be very efficient in the way it runs a lot of things even the premise behind this bill is well weve got a problem with medicare so were going to take the money out of medicare and medicare isnt working quite right so therefore what we need to do is to replace medicare with the government taking everything over there is something about that logic if you take a look at the overall finances of the unitedstates government what you find is it is not a big problem with earmarks the real big problem is with three entitlement programs which are growing because of the demographics in our country and because of the nature of those entitlement programs the entitlement programs are social security medicare and medicaid two of those are medical entitlements medicare and medicaid both of those are growing to the point that over time and people disagree exactly what year it happens but they bust the entire federal budget they grow so big they balloon so large that you cant derive taxes any more and they basically shut out all of the money that congressmen are supposed to spend on different things like defense or all other kinds of government programs so these things like a cancer are growing so big that they threaten to break the federal budget and the federal piggy bank in fact right now those three programs medicare medicaid social security have almost gotten to the point where they are taking half of the disposable budget of the country so now we have got medicare and medicaid out of control and so what are we going to do oh well were going to have the government take over all of health care that doesnt seem to be a credible solution to that problem this is an article from the new york times as a result this is talking about this great meeting this great political drama that is supposed to take place tomorrow democrats now are considering a plan to use a parliamentary maneuver called budget reconciliation to attach changes to the senate health care legislation as a budget measure which cannot be filibustered and requires only a simple majority for passage in the senate now does this look like a bipartisan effort to cooperate on health care i dont think so what this is is a call by the captain of the ship to go to ramming speed to take the bill which a majority of americans do not support and to try to jam it through now there can be a nice political drama tomorrow but is it really working in a cooperative spirit to go behind closed doors put together a bill pop it out within 24 hours and then demand that the republicans all go along with it is that really working in a bipartisan way or is it really just more of my way or the highway i will leave that to your decision but that is what the new york times not exactly a conservative oracle is saying this is the plan is to take the bill that went through the senate which a great majority of americans do not support and push it through anyway this is where the public is now fiftyeight percent of voters nationwide oppose this health care reform plan will 6 hours of drama tomorrow change that is this going to change is it really going to be drama or does it lack credibility i would suggest that when i take a good look at this i think people may yawn and say this sure looks like the same old same old we havent seen very much changing and the olympics is a whole lot more exciting as i started by saying i have observed things about drama and plays and the things that i have observed are that they tend to be either really good or really bad and boring and so that is my concern about the high level of drama tomorrow now one of the connections that i think we need to make and it is something that has been made is the connection to something that i think is on the minds of americans maybe more than a governmentrun health care program and that is the problem of unemployment i would like to connect these two because these two do connect together i see that i am joined by my good friend from georgia jack were you interested in joining our discussion"], [6.692419265164062e-05, 6.692419265164062e-05, 0, "it is a pleasure to be able to join you my colleagues and those gathered in various places around the buildings here near the capitol i have had the opportunity having served in government as a legislator for a number of years to serve both in the majority in the minority but also in the wilderness this last year and a half has been different i have served in the wilderness because we have actually come up to the edge of the abyss with a piece of legislation that promises to be so threatening and so destructive to our country that should we decide to swallow this poison pill and pass this piece of legislation america will never be the same i have seen in the majority and in the minority pieces of legislation which are harmful and that may be poor solutions to some particular problem or solutions to a problem that doesnt exist or excuses just to have more taxes and more government control but we have never quite seen a threat like the threat that confronts america today and we you and i my friends who love the red white and blue are looking off the edge i dont know if you have ever stood on the edge of the rim of the grand canyon and looked thousands of feet downward or if you have ever been on the top of some high skyscraper or bridge and looked off into empty space but that is where we stand tonight that is where we stand this week or next week in america we are standing looking into the abyss into a piece of legislation which is quite possibly going to be passed and if it is passed it will leave our nation very very weak much weaker and unlike anything that we have seen before it threatens to do two major things to destroy the quality of health care in america and to destroy the fiscal integrity of our very country i am talking of course about an old topic a topic that has been debated now for more than half a year here in congress it has absorbed the attention of the nation and it is an interesting topic because the more that it has been around it seems the more the public is aware of it and the more they see of it the more they dont like it in fact as you start to take the covers off the legislation on health care it becomes a very ugly picture and the american public is wise in fact the statistical information suggests that at least 20 percent more americans believe that we would be better not passing this piece of legislation and a great majority think we should just scrap it and start over again by systematically defining a problem and fixing it rather than having government take over all of health care now the process the way that the legislature works historically has been so boring that none of the american public pay any attention to it but that has changed since we have been in the days of looking into the abyss the abyss of the destruction of health care and the destruction of our economy and people are becoming conscious of how it is that bills are passed and how they become law what would be required to have this health care bill passed would be a process that people call reconciliation what that means essentially is that the bill would endrun or bypass a safety process in the unitedstates senate the unitedstates senate has a very conservative way of operating and that is that you can have a bill that you have 51 senators who would vote for itso it would pass if you had a chance to vote on itbut they put this extra caveat that you have to have 60 senators agree to bring it up for a vote so in a sense everything in the senate requires a 60 percent approval before it goes to a final vote now there is an exception to that and that is because of the necessity of dealing with the budget and spending and taxing and some of those issues that on certain financial kinds of transactions because of the fact that we cant afford a gridlock we allow a 50vote majority to be able to move something along and thats called reconciliation but it is not a process that is typically used for a completely new bill on a very broad subject which is not just specifically a financial kind of thing we have this quote from our president on this subject of reconciliation he says reconciliation is therefore the wrong place for policy changes now wait a minute now this is the president saying reconciliation is therefore the wrong place for policy changes isnt the health care bill a policy change i guess it is its a whale of a big policy change in short the reconciliation process appears to have lost its proper meaning a vehicle designed for deficit reduction and fiscal responsibility has been hijacked to facilitate reckless deficits and unsustainable debt well i wish the president would pay attention to his own words this is what he said reconciliation is not a place for policy changes and yet the health care bill is a massive policy change it will take over about onesixth of the unitedstates economy the government will step in and effectively run onesixth of the unitedstates economy with all kinds of rules and regulations and bureaucracies i guess thats a policy change mr president in short the reconciliation process appears to have lost its proper meaning indeed it does a vehicle designed for deficit reduction and fiscal responsibility thats what the reconciliation process was supposed to be about and in fact its going to be hijacked its been hijacked to facilitate what to facilitate jamming down the throats of the american public a bill that america clearly does not want us to do they want to take the reconciliation process as a mechanism to jump with all of america into the abyss so i think its interesting that after the votes particularly the vote in massachusetts where the democrats do not have 60 votes in the senate they dont have one republican that would support this bill not one for people who have served in the legislature that is a huge warning sign when you see a total party line vote on something that means theres some problems usually in the legislative process if its been done properly a lot of people have a chance for input people have a chance to improve and say this part seems to be a little radical lets go back this way usually what you have is more of a mix of people when you see something being jammed in a process that is not designedthat is reconciliationfor this massive policy change and you see not one republican voting for it that should be a warning sign for people everywhere and it is a misuse of reconciliation and so while the public is saying in poll after poll survey after survey phone call after phone call from our districts stop this train do not jump into the abyss do not allow the federal government to take over onesixth of the economy and yet what do we see we see a tremendous determination to jam this bill through whether the procedure fits or not but its my way or the highway and were going to do it because we know whats best for you this is a very highhanded approach and it is something that does notnever does and never willproduce a good consensus in america it will be something that will divide america create a tremendous amount of tension and pressure end up with lousy health care and a federal budget that is even more out of control now if you take a look down here we have another quote from the speaker of the house nancy pelosi and it says this will take courage in other words for the democrats to vote for this bill it will take courage what does that mean it will take courage well if it takes courage it means somebody is going to be mad somebody is not going to like it and so you have to be courageous and stand up to somebody who doesnt want you to vote for this bill who do you think the somebody is is it the republicans the republicans dont like it but we have 80 votes less than the democrats so we cant say much of anything about it other than explaining why we dont like it but our votes dont make the difference nancy pelosi has a whole lot of extra votes she could have 20 or 30 people vote no and still pass this bill so why does this take courage well it takes courage because somebody doesnt want it somebody very much doesnt want it and theyre going to be mad if its jammed down the throats of the american people who is the somebody going to be you got it the american public people are not going to like this bill so if you vote for it the point shes making is youre risking your seat because people are going to be mad its interesting when the leader is saying its going to take courage that says somebody doesnt like it now are there some reasons why people dont like the bill well first of all this is a rough flowchart trying to describe what happens when the government takes over onesixth of the unitedstates economy obviously theres a whole lot of things being done by private institutions which will be replaced with government institutions and theyve got to figure out how to replace it all so no wonder it takes almost 3 000 pages of bill to try to put some sort of a scheme together for the government to be running the health care business now on the surface of the whole situation with this bill this is not an easy sell as you know this bill has been around for more than half a yeari guess its threequarters of a year people dont like it very well the president thinks its a beautiful bill but the more that people see it the less they like it they think its an ugly bill well lets just think about the logic of this stand way back away from all the details of health care weve got medicare and medicaid both of those have to do with medicine they are both very large federal entitlements medicare medicaid in fact the great challenge to the american budget are three entitlements people say earmarks is what its all about earmarks are 1 percent earmarks are not the thing thats really a threat to the budget the thing thats a threat to the budget are three entitlements social security medicare and medicaid two of those have to do with health caremedicare and medicaid and whats the problem with medicare and medicaid well theyre financially broken and if they continue as they are right now without changing those laws they will bankrupt our country so weve got medicare and medicaid government programs that are currently bankrupting our country and so what are we trying to sell the american public oh hey weve got the government running medicare and medicaid theyre bankrupting our country so lets take over all of health care with the government there is something intuitively counterintuitive about that isnt there why would you want the government to take over something that its already messing up that not working financially that is in the process of bankrupting our country if you cant do it in a smaller area of medicare and medicaid why do you want to expand it to everybody so this is kind of a hard sell for the president and thats why its taking a lot of courage and why this bill is not moving any too fast and why the public doesnt like it but there are many many other reasons you can see the complexity here and as you can imagine when you start to look at the details you find that it is full of a lot of little devils one of the things that you findand i think one of the little devils that is perhaps most noxious to a lot of american peopleare the special deals you see when you have a piece of legislation thats going to take a lot of courage you have to put some sugar in it to make people vote for it and the sugar of course comes in the special deal form so what you find in the legislationto the best of our knowledge because the idea about transparency and openness we have not seen and so we dont actually see exactly whats in this bill in its final form but you see what it was like in the house we saw what it was like in the senate but we find that it has some of these special little things that is that its going to take 500 billion out of medicare but is it taking 500 billion out of medicare all the way across the country no in fact in the state of florida its not going to take any money out of medicare advantage at all so it wont be coming out in florida but in the other states they do take it out well that was a special deal for somebody in florida then weve got special deals fori think it was called louisiana purchase ii for louisiana special deals for massachusetts that medicare gets these special reimbursements there going to build a hospital as i recall in new jersey but not in other places so you have special deals thats one of the things that makes this look ugly to the voters because youre not treating every state the same youre making some states pay more and other ones dont and youre making some special adjustments for various people you find there are special adjustments for people who work in a labor union but somebody who works the same kind of job in a company thats not in a union doesnt get the same break as if you are in a union so again this is one of those special deals the american people in general see that and say that isnt fair that isnt right that isnt good legislation thats special deals we dont like special deals because they dont treat people equally before the law now when you take a look at the complexity of this chart what it suggests is that this is going to be expensive not only is it going to be expensive if youve got a problem and you fall through the crack somewhere you may never get over to getting any health care at all because it has got so much redtape and bureaucracy and so the whole idea of this kind of a system working well and providing good quality service is a little bit hard to understand and when you take a look at the failings of medicare and medicaid in terms of the projected way that theyre going to take our country into bankruptcy do you really want to expand all of health care into these categories so there is a fiscal sanity kind of component one of the ways to take a look at the bill and to ask some questions and to get a sense of whats going on as to why this bill is unpopular as people study it and see more and more of it these are some comparisons of what the health care proposal does this is the old democrat bill this is the presidents new online bill and this would be the republican alternative or alternatives so we have three different bills in comparison here and a comparison based on a number of different criteria i think it may be helpful to take a look at some of those first of all it says here that it imposes half a trillion in medicare cuts we talked about that just a minute ago this bill is going to cut medicare you always heard the democrats saying the republicans are going to take your medicare away that didnt turn out to be true we have not done that but this bill does this bill is going to cut 500 billion out of medicare and the answer to this of course is yes the old democrat bill did that thats the yes the presidents new bill is going to do the same thing so its going to impose a half a trillion in medicare cuts the republican alternative does not so this is one of those situations where people are a little uncomfortable medicare is having trouble financially and doctors are not being reimbursed very much in medicare so theyre starting to not accept new patients because theyre not being reimbursed enough to make it worth their while to take patients if thats a problem in medicare why are we going to pull half a trillion dollars out of it thats one of the ways you can look at these bills so there is a difference the republicans are not proposing that but both the presidents new online bill and the democrats bill do that then it also enacts jobkilling tax hikes and government regulations costing hundreds of billions of dollars its a 1 trillion bill which is a conservative estimate this bill is going to cost a lot more than 1 trillion how do you pay for it guess what by tax increasesright and with cuts to medicare so the tax increases here are going to come from where well a lot of them come from small businesses when you tax small businesses a whole lot for their employees guess whats going to happen theyre not going to be able to hire as many employees so this bill then has the effect of causing unemployment so in our particular climate with unemployment near 10 percent in america and with not a lot of sense of hope that that employment is going to turn around in a hurry because of very badly shaped policies by the federal government particularly policies which hammer small business owners to have this bill which is going to tax heavily small business owners and which is going to put tremendous new government regulations on them which will cost billions of dollars is not something from an unemployment point of view that is a very good idea this is going to be done by the old democrat bill and the presidents new proposal the republican alternative it wont surprise you is not enthused about tax increases and we dont know that thats the best way to be dealing with some of our problems in medicine i am joined by a very good friend of mine congressman bishop i would very much appreciate his perspective as to what we are talking about ive just been sayingand i dont think i am overdramatizing thisthat to a degree its my sense that america is standing on the edge of an abyss like looking over the grand canyon or something and that if we step off the edge and misuse this reconciliation process we are going to damage our country in a way unlike anything that we have seen before please join me"], [7.274895324371755e-05, 7.274895324371755e-05, 0, "americans all over this country are asking where are the jobs where are the jobs we just heard from the previous speaker bragging about the recovery act which has been an abject failure an abject failure there have been very few private sector jobs created around this country what has been created are a lot of government jobs here in washington dc if someones looking for a job here in washington they have a lot of opportunities because government continues to grow exponentially exponentially but whats not happening are jobs are not being created out in georgia or around this country where theyre so desperately needed private sector jobs i was talking to one of my county commission chairmen just recently and he said paul 1 year ago in our country the employment rate was 14 3 per cent i said oh my goodness of course in my district we have a very poor district except for the two major cities athens and augusta the augusta area and the athens area and this is not one of those counties he said a year ago the unemployment rate was 14 3 now its 10 7 percent officially and i said that is great hallelujah praise the lord whered the jobs come from he said paul there arent any jobs people have just gotten discouraged and quit looking theyve fallen off the unemployment roles there are no new jobs here were losing jobs and our people in our county are leaving theyre just disgusted theyre disappointed and thats whats happening all over this country how do i know that republicans a couple of months ago launched a web site asking the american people to speak out its called americaspeakingout com and we are asking americans to go on americaspeakingout com to registerits very simple no costand to tell us what we should be doing here in congress right now today not only to create jobs but to get the economy back on track how to deal with health care how to deal with the issues that the american people are facing today we are asking america to speak out you see we live in a republic representative government and the only way we can continue representative government is if representatives listen to the american people and ive got a sad sad thing to saythat the leadership in this house doesnt listen to the american people i will give you an example when we were debating obamacare threefourths of america did not want that bill passed threefourths of america said no to obamacare twothirds today sayat least 60 percent or moresay repeal it repeal it our leadership here in the democratic side didnt listen to the american people president obama didnt listen to the american people they forced down the throats of the american public a bill which is now law that was designed to fail its designed to fail america why do i say that because it was designed to push people off private health insurance designed to push people into a whats now called a public exchange and thats going to force people into more and more government its designed to lead us where the president just before obamacare was passed into law said that he wanted to go where everybody in this country would be on one insurance policy one pool is what he said that means socialized medicine where bureaucrats here in washington d c direct the health care for everybody in this country to tell doctors like myselfi am a general practice medical doctorhow to practice medicine who we can give care to what medicines we can use what tests we can do and in fact right now today the federal government tells me or other physicians across this country whether we can admit a patient thats on medicare to the hospital or not its not determined by the doctor or the patient its determined by a government bureaucrat thats not a doctor not even a nurse or even a health care professional but more importantly what is obamacare going to do i spoke to just recently the head of a manufacturing entity in my district in rural north georgia that hires over 400 people and he said paul with the tax burden obamacares going to put on me as a businessman with all the big government programs the stimulus bill and tarp bailouts and taking over of the private sector he said paul im trying to find a place to move my company offshore away from america think about that if we continue down this road that this leadership and the democrats are leading us down that plant will close over 400 people in rural north georgia will be put out of work theyre going to lose their jobs and in fact we knew that while we were discussing obamacare we knew that it was estimated by experts that at least 5 million to 5 5 million americans were going to lose their jobs strictly because of obamacare and that has not changed we must repeal it and replace it with something else i introduced a bill h r 3889 comprehensive health care reform system totally constitutional according to the original intent of the constitution totally in the private sector would radically change healthcare financing would radically lower the cost of health insurance for everybody in this country would solve most of all of the problems with portability and uninsurability et cetera would leave the doctor and patient in control of their health care decisions its 106 pages a major piece of legislation not almost 3 000 like obamacare was and its very simple you can read it and understand what that bill says our speaker of the house ms pelosi said weve got to pass obamacare to find out whats in it just the other day we heard about this financial reform bill that weve got to pass it to find out whats in it the american people deserve more they deserve to know whats in a bill and deserve to know how it will affect them we are killing jobs by bill after bill by bigger government program by bigger government program its going to hurt our economy destroy our economy and were borrowing from our children and our grandchildrens future our children and grandchildren are very probably going to live at a lower standard than we live today if we dont stop this outrageous spending thats been going on ever since nancy pelosi has been speaker of this house and even more so since president obama has been in office its got to stop its got to stop now ive done many america speaking out town hall meetings all over the 10th congressional district in georgia just listening to my constituency i have done these in small groups weve done big town hall meetings weve gone into factories and asked factories and companies to speak out and to tell us what we should be doing in congress right now today in fact i went to the cocacola plant in athens georgia and spoke to the employees there and asked them to speak to me and encouraged them to go on america speakingout com i did a town hall meeting in columbia county in evans georgia and did the same thing did one in athens which is the most liberal county in my district in fact politically its a speck of blue in a sea of red its a very democratic county its where the university of georgia is its a very liberal county and i did an america speaking out town hall there invited the whole public to come anybody who wanted to come because i wanted to hear thats what america speaking outs all about we want to hear what america thinks we should be dealing with here in congress and offer us suggestions of how to create jobs were asking where are the jobs the policy thats being followed by the democratic majority is taking away jobs i already mentioned how obamacare is going to eventually put over 5 million americans out of work just because of that one bill the stimulus bills going to put people out of work its put a few people to work more government employees than privatesector employees but were asking americans to speak out to go on americaspeakingout com to tell us what we should be doing here in congress today to offer suggestions to vote on suggestions that are already made or comments already made americans can make their own comment these are just some of the things thatthese are sheets actually that my staff wrote to suggestions of legislation that people in the 10th congressional district of georgia suggested that we do no energy tax boy if that energy taxi call it taxandtrade my democratic colleagues call it capandtradebut its about taxes in fact the president himself said that his energy tax the taxandtrade bill is necessary to fund obamacare its all about revenue the experts tell us that the national energy tax is not going to reduce carbon emissions worldwide its going to hurt our economy and its going to put millions of americans out of work and americans understand that and they said no to the energy tax no to the finance bill that was just signed into law this week defund obamacare no to socialized medicine repeal obamacare pass alternatives to health care reform i would love to see my bill h r 3889 be put into place in fact i reintroduced it as a repeal obamacare to repeal all of this onerous bill onerous law thats going to lead to socialized medicine here in the country as the president has said that he wants to go to and replace it with something in the private sector to maintain the doctorpatient relationship and to lower the cost of health care for everybody alternatives to health care reform keeping bills germane the american people have told me even the liberals in athens georgia we need to have bills that are germane in other words we shouldnt tack onto bills things that arent germane to those bills the house passed and in fact were waiting on the senate amendments to the emergency appropriations for the war supplemental bill a 75 billion bill only 33 billion of that 75 billion have to do with the military and war supplemental all the rest of that 75 billion is bigger government programs bigger spending that the democratic majority pushed through americansliberals conservatives independents republicans democratshave told me keep bills germane no to capandtrade i can go on down this list but the overwhelming thing i heard where are the jobs what are we going to do to create jobs in the private sector and ive heard my democratic colleagues just speak over and over again about how great this stimulus bill has been its been an abject failure where are the jobs mr speaker where are the jobs mr president where are the jobs my colleagues on the democratic side theyre not there in fact the policies and the spending that we see going on over and over again from bill after bill since this president has taken office will actually take away jobs and its going to push jobs and manufacturers to go overseas i talked to one manufacturer and asked him what can we do to get you to start hiring employees and he said the best thing you could do is lower my corporate income tax rate my democratic colleagues say that we need to tax the rich so we need to keep those corporate tax rates high we have the second highest corporate tax rate in the world its 35 percent second only to japan in fact ive talked to manufacturer after manufacturer and they tell me paul if you just lower my corporate tax rate to 25 percent that would help me be able to create jobs in my company just lower it 10 percent i think corporate tax rates should be zero in fact not only should corporate rates be zero but dividend taxes should be zero death taxes should be zero capital gains taxes should be zero we should have an immediate writeoff of capital expenditure for business not have this prolonged depreciation schedule that the internal revenue code forces them into they have to write the check they should be able to write it off if we could change just the tax law we would create jobs in fact i introduced h r 4100 the jobs act my jobs act is an acronym for jumpstart our business sector what it would do is for 2 years it would cut in half the payroll tax for business as well as for individuals it would lower the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent it would suspend the death tax suspend the dividend taxes for 2 years and it would lower the two lowest income tax brackets down to 10 percent and 5 percent respectively and if you think about that what would that do from a monetary perspective what it would do is it would leave dollars in the hands of small businesses and it would leave dollars in the hands of the american public the consumers that would give small businesses the opportunity to expand their business to buy inventory to modernize to hire new employees and it would give dollars to the consumers so that they could buy the goods and services that they need it would give some stability to our economic situation so we dont see the stock market jumping up and down as we do today it looks like a yoyo why is that because theres so much uncertainty and why is there uncertainty out there its because of what this congress and what nancy pelosi and company are doing right here and what barack obama is proposing for more and more government more and more of the federal government taking over the private sector that uncertainty is creating a lot of fear ive had businesses small businesses large businesses in my district tell me theyre sitting on cash but theyre afraid to hire new employees why because of obamacare because of the debt because of the outrageous spending because of the socalled financial reform bill that was just signed into law this week theyre afraid and i dont blame them ive said in multiple floor speeches here that we have a steamroller of socialism being driven by nancy pelosi harry reid and fueled by barack obama we need to put that steamroller of socialism in a parking lot if we would do so if we would put the steamroller of socialism that my democratic colleagues are driving if we would put that in a parking lot we would put certainty back in the financial sector and we would see a growth in our economy but with that uncertainty that our leadership of this house and the senate and the president are giving to the private sector were going to see the business sector afraid afraid to hire new people some economists say were fixing to go into a great depression in fact some even say were going into a depression worse than we saw in the previous great depression i hope and pray not i pray that god prevents that but whether we do or dont i know this the simple truth is bigger government bigger government spending more debt being created for our children and grandchildren to have to pay is not going to solve the economic problems of our country weve got to stop the outrageous spending here that congress has been doing that this administration is doing that the previous administration was doing i wasnt here during the first 6 years of the bush administration i was elected in 2007 is when i took office but i voted against the tarp bill the toxic asset relief program because i thought it was wrong it hasnt helped the second tranche that president obama forced through the congress it hasnt helped taking over gm and chrysler hasnt helped taking over the student loan program taking over the health care system hasnt helped the stimulus bill has been an abject failure by and large the company that makes these huge signs to proclaim that barack obama and his policies are the messiah which costs lord only knows how much has helped that company but it hasnt helped the american taxpayer it hasnt helped small businesses around this country by and large america speaking out gives the american people an opportunity to give us ideas about what they think what america thinks about what we should be doing now to solve the problems you see im excited about the socalled tea party movement in this country ive spoken to many tea party rallies but theres a great misunderstanding particularly in the press particularly with my liberal friends what the tea party is all about we started a tea party caucus just this week i was one of the original signers of membership into the tea party caucus ive done a number of interviews just yesterday i did one on fox i just did one this afternoon ive done many interviews recently and its very apparent to me and its apparent to me to the questions that were asked during the news conference that we held yesterday after the tea party caucus started that theres a tremendous misunderstanding particularly by my liberal colleagues and by the press about what the tea party movement is all about and im excited about it the tea party simply is this its freedomloving americans people who just basically want to live their lives without all the government intrusion theyre teed off tea in the tea party stands for taxed enough already its an acronym and they see the socalled jobs bill that my democratic colleagues keep bringing to the floor of the house ive already mentioned my jobs act which is an acronym for jumpstart our business sector i believe every one of the socalled jobs bills that my democratic colleagues have introduced is an acronym for just one big slush fund because thats what it seems to be the american people are angry theyre angry about not being listened to theyre angry about seeing their freedom being taken away their jobs being taken away the previous speaker during the 5minutes was touting how great the stimulus act has been but its not been great they have to try to spin how disastrous the spending bill has been its not created very many jobs its created some but not very many and certainly not very many in the private sector the american people are asking where are the jobs when are we going to get this economy back on course weve seen a liberal icon my democratic colleagues one of their icons one of this countrys icons john f kennedy considered to be very liberal at the time today theyd call him a wacko a crazy man because he proposed tax cuts i hear from my democratic colleagues that they want to tax the rich they want to tax them even more well who are the rich its the small businesses of this country most small businessmen and women file their taxes as a sub s corporation which means they file their business taxes on personal income taxes my democratic colleagues say theyre making too much money we want it here in washington to create a bigger government a bigger socialistic government and whats that going to do its going to kill jobs its going to take jobs away from millions of americans and my democratic colleagues want to tax small business to the hilt theyre not happy with the high tax rates that small business are already suffering from they want more taxes on the socalled rich the rich of the little momandpop grocery stores the little hardware stores the small community businesses mens stores its not the wal marts the at ts the boeings those arent small businesses but we have developed policy and the policy of the democratic majority is antibusiness its antifreedom its antijob creation why do they want to do that its because they believe in my opinion that government is the solution to everything you see they think in my opinion that government has to tell them how to run every aspect of their lives ill give you some examples weve already seen where our democratic colleagues want to tell us how much salt we can have in our food im a physician and i have prescribed lowsalt diets to my patients i dont use salt i hardly ever pick up a salt shaker i dont even salt watermelon or eggs when i eat those or tomatoes and i know as a physician we have plenty of salt for most of our bodily needs unless somebody has a particular reason that they lose salt in an abnormal way even athletes for the most part dont need salt when i was playing football in high school our coach would give us salt tablets that was absolutely the wrong thing to do but my colleagues want to say they want to control salt in our food they say they want to control what kind of light bulbs we can putin fact thats what theyve donewhat kind of light bulbs we can have in our lamps at home they want to tell us what kind of cars we can drive how much water comes out of our shower heads they want to control every aspect of our lives every aspect theres a word for that that word is socialism central control from washington d c we have had a greater takeover of the private sector since barack obamas been the president of the united states than hugo chavezweve had a greater takeover in the private sector in this administration than the communist dictator hugo chavez has nationalized the private sector in venezuela thats a shock to most people when you tell them that but thats factual weve had a greater takeover of the private sector under president obama than hugo chavez has done in venezuela its got to stop the american people are understanding that theyre sick and tired of it they want their freedom back they want their nation back they want their jobs back theyre asking where are the jobs when are we going to put our economy back on the right track thats what were asking here as republicans weve got to stop this policy of bigger government and higher taxes more intrusion in peoples lives and thats all weve seen over and over again from the democratic majority in fact not all democrats believe in that ill give you an example during the debate on obamacare i proposedin fact i wrote an oped along with congressman dent and congressman shadeggones from pennsylvania and ones from arizonachallenging our democratic colleagues to introduce a democratic bill that i had the language for all they had to do was write the name of the sponsor in a blank and introduce it it would be a democratic bill they could claim it to be obamacare it would do four things crossstateline purchases for businesses and individuals number two anybody in this country could join an association poolall across the country multiple associationsto have the opportunity to buy and own their own health insurance through the association number three to encourage states to set up highrisk pools to cover those who are uninsurable and number four to have tax fairness so that everybody in this country could deduct 100 percent of their health care and health insurance cost off their income taxes i had democrat after democrat tell me this they said paul that makes sense it really makes sense but i cant do it i cant do it because my leadership would punish me if i did if i introduced that bill and tried to push it through the democratic caucus my leadership would punish me for doing to so i was told by democrat after democrat that they were focusing on only one thing and thats obamacare as we know it the debate was over whether we were going to have a robust public option a public option not so robust or a public exchange and thats what we wound up getting which is actually public option lite public option on a diet all three of those are geared and guaranteed to force everybody in this country into a governmentcontrolled health insurance program controlled from washington d c the only bipartisan vote on obamacare was no we had democrats and republicans voting no every republican voted no seventyfive percent of america said no but we have it now as law because ms pelosi and the democratic leadership are not listening to america theyre not listening to america when america says where are the jobs were doing that im doing that i hold america speaking out town hall meetings republicans are going to be doing that all over this country during this august district work period we want to hear from america i encourage every american who is concerned about where were going as a nation thats concerned about public policywhether youre a democrat or a republican independent whether youre a liberal or a conservative whether you consider yourself a moderateim encouraging everybody in this country to go to americaspeakingout com and speak out give us your ideas about how to solve the problems the economic problems give us your ideas about how to solve this unemployment problem i want to hear thats the reason ive done many i have even lost count somewhere between 10 and 20 america speaking out town hall meetings and meetings with small business and large groups over the last several months and i will continue to do so republicans are doing that all over the country i wish my democratic colleagues would do the same thing and listen to the american public since last august our democratic colleagues went and hid because of the ire of the american public at least most of them did a lot of them did some you can see that didnt you can see the result on youtube right now today theres a tremendous anger expressed all across this country to our democratic colleagues about that bill i held town hall meetings last august in the 10th congressional district in georgia multiple of them and i was cheered because i was against obamacare i was cheered america has an opportunity to speak out now through americaspeakingout com but we need to change the policies weve got to stop this socialization nationalization of our private sector weve got to stimulate small businesses and the only way we can do that is to give them the money they need to expand their business to buy inventory my jobs act h r 4100 will do just that i hope that the american public that are watching right now will ask their congressmen to cosponsor it i ask my democratic colleagues to cosponsor h r 4100 and lets make it a bipartisan jobs act jumpstart our business sector the way i pay for all that is to take the unspent stimulus dollars to pay for the tax reduction so its paid for wont create any more debt it wont borrow from our childrens and our grandchildrens future it is a commonsense solution but thats not what were getting from our democratic colleagues were getting more government more central control from washington bigger bureaucracy higher taxes that are going to cost americans jobs send jobs overseas where people in the philippines or in china or whatever are working and doing jobs that americans could very well be doing but americans are not having the opportunity to do those jobs because the policies of nancy pelosi barack obama and harry reid are driving jobs offshore driving jobs away from america weve got to change those policies we do that through tax cuts john fitzgerald kennedy president kennedy cut taxes and what happened when he did we saw a tremendous growth of the economy president reagan did the same thing tremendous growth of the economy george w bush cut taxes tremendous growth of the economy the leadership of the house right now today wants to see those tax cuts that were put in place during all the years of the bush administration wants to see them expire thats going to kill more jobs here in this country and its going to mean that farmers and small businesses are going to have to close down and sell their assets just to pay their higher taxes that are going to be required im told from some of my democratic colleagues that there are many democrats that dont want to see those tax cuts expire theres some of our democratic colleagues that understand that allowing those tax cuts to expire at the end of this year is going to cost jobs so again the bipartisan approach to creating jobs is for us to at least keep those tax cuts because the jobs that are going to go away if those tax cuts expire wont go away so well save jobs the president has a fondness to talk about the jobs hes created or saved well nobody can know how many were saved weve seen some kind of funny finance calculations or accounting here because i know of one instance for instance as an example that one company got some stimulus funds and they gave everybody in their company raises they didnt hire any new persons not the first new employee but the government counted every one of those increases in wages as a new job as a new job thats inane its disingenuous its deceptive thats what we see over and over again weve got to stop that the american people deserve better and im excited about the grassroots movement if you want to call it the tea party movement its not just the tea party patriots tea party express americans for prosperity freedomworks i can go on and on about different groups the 9 12 group there are many what my liberal colleagues and the press dont understand is that this is a grassroots organization an effort in all these organizations its not one monolithic thing it is american citizens all over this country in their local communities that are speaking out theyre saying that theyre taxed enough already they see their jobs going away they want to go to work they see that the policies that we have been handed by barack obama and nancy pelosi and harry reid those policies are destroying jobs theyre putting millions of americans out of work and what they see is more of the same and they dont want more of the same theyre taxed enough already they want to see some changes and im excited because i believe were going to see some big changes in november big changes on november 2 see the most powerful political force in this country today is written about in the constitution of the united states and if you look at the document if you look at the document itself our founding fathers when they wrote the document those three first words of the constitution were bold and much much larger about four times larger three or four times larger than all the rest of the text what are those three words we the people we the people are speaking theyre saying where are the jobs republicans are saying where are the jobs what im hearing from the leadership on the other side from ms pelosi and company were going to give you more government more taxes more government control bigger government more government jobs but less in the private sector is what the bottom lines going to be weve got to stop this weve got to stop growing government and shrink it weve got to stop this outrageous spending weve got to repeal or replace obamacare with commonsense solutions that will maintain the quality of health care in this country continue to allow the doctors and the patients to make decisions instead of some washington bureaucrat which is going to happen under obamacare weve got to stop bailing out wall street and start bailing out small businesses by giving them the money that they need by allowing them to do business and leave the dollars in their pockets thats whats going to create new jobs thats whats going to put our economy back on track thats whats going to solve this economic downturn i heard when the president signed the financial reform billsocalled which its not it puts in place permanent bailouts for wall street its going to hurt main street banks the community banks its going to create bigger bureaucracy more government jobs it is going to make it more difficult for small businesses to go to their local banker and get a loan the president my liberal colleagues blamed a lack of financial regulations on the economic downturn but that is not what caused the economic downturn they are blind they want to blame as the previous speaker to me just blamed the bush administration that is what i keep hearing it is all bushs fault when are they going to take time when is ms pelosi going to take responsibility when is barack obama going to take responsibility for the disastrous disastrous policies that they are forcing down the throats of the american people it is past time for them to take responsibility but they are not doing it they are blaming the bush administration what caused the financial collapse was the government it is the community reinvestment act freddy and fannie poor fed policy there is some blame an wall street absolutely there is some blame even in main street main street banks greed is part of the cause of that but it was policy that was established by congress under the carter administration with the community reinvestment act then a reform socalled reform which essentially forced banks to make loans to people who couldnt pay it back then we have freddie and fannie who would buy off those loans poor fed policy that kept the interest rates low so that freddie and fannie could set up these nodocumentation or lowdocumentation loans that is what created the bubble and the burst so it is government the best way to control quantity quality and cost of all goods and services is a free enterprise system unencumbered by taxes and regulations you have two things on the one hand you have government control socialism on the other hand you have the free market system and the free market system will create jobs if we will allow it to do so that is not what we are getting we are getting bigger government which is going to kill jobs we need to stop that we need to create what has made this country so rich so powerful so successful as a political experiment in all of history we have got to go back to those foundational principles those foundational principles that are expressed in the declaration of independence and embodied in the governing force in the constitution of the united states as it was intended psalm 11 god asked a question he says if foundation should be destroyed what are the righteous to do god goes on talking about that he is sovereign and he reigns but how does he reign in public policy how does he reign in this country well certainly our creator reigns supernaturally but he also reigns through those of us who know him as lord and savior those of us who look to our creator for direction those of us who look to the judeochristian principles that our founding fathers held so firmly and those principles are based on personal responsibility and accountability those principles are based on the free market system on free enterprise where people have the ability and opportunity to succeed but they also have an opportunity to fail without an opportunity to fail you dont have an opportunity to succeed we see class warfare by our democratic colleagues where they hate the rich they want to tax them to the hilt they want to have a redistribution of wealth as president obama keeps talking about but what is he saying he is saying that he knows how to run everything in human endeavor that is what the leadership here believes they believe in central planning they believe government knows best they believe that government should tell us what to eat what car to drive and how to live our lives and what kind of health care we can have those policies destroy the free market destroy small business we see examples all over the world socialism has never worked never will work and i dont care whose socialism it is whether it is stalins mao zedongs castros hugo chavezs or barack obamas it is not going to work it never will work we have got to stop it and it is up to the american people to stop it the american people need to speak out go on americaspeakingout com demand from your congressman your senator that we stop this inane policy of creating bigger government higher taxes more regulation more government more control from washington say no to all of that and say yes to tax cuts to the free market system to freedom they want socialism i want freedom america wants freedom we have got to demand it and it is up to the american people to do so america can speak out can speak out to my democrat colleagues can speak out to the president can speak out to their senators speak out by going on americaspeakingout com demand policy thats going to create jobs i see i have been joined by my great friend and an excellent member of this body and the republican conference my good friend steve scalise from new orleans

a little bit tonight about obamacare weve talked about obamacare a lot over the last several months and its now law we hear over and over again about how obamacare is beginning to filter out and how its going to affect the american people our president has said that when the american people know whats in the bill theyre going to like it well to the contrary as the american people get to know whats in the bill they dislike it more and more as they rightfully should because obamacare is going to be extremely expensive for everyone its going to be very onerous to almost everyone except for the federal bureaucrats who are going to be hired to put obamacare into place and who are going to be enforcing it and in fact we are even going to have to hire i think it is 16 500 new irs agents to enforce it thats right 16 500 new irs agents just to enforce obamacare on small businessmen and women around this country the more the american people discover about obamacare the less they like it we just heard i think it was last week where the congressional budget office said oops we made a mistake we made a mistake we were 115 billion too little on our estimate which puts it way over a trillion dollars our democratic colleagues their leadershipactually its not even all the democrats because there are many of them who are very reasonable over there on that side but the leadership of the democratic caucus wanted to get obamacare and the president wanted to get obamacare passed and forced the cbo through the parameters that they gave them to try to get the numbers below 1 trillion well they are north of 1 trillion frankly if you look at medicare when cbo projected the cost of medicare cbo missed it missed it terribly and in fact i think thats whats going to happen here too i think obamacare is going to be 3 trillion 5 trillion maybe 10 trillion and its money that our children and our grandchildren are going to have to pay because we dont have the money in fact we just had a lecture about hypocrisy by one of our colleagues just a moment ago talking about saying one thing and believing another frankly we are continuing to fight to stop this outrageous spending as republicans here we are fighting against obamacare every single republican voted against it even several democrats many democrats voted against it the only bipartisan vote was a vote of no against obamacare because its going to be terrible unfortunately it passed the house by five votes five votes thats certainly not a mandate from the house the american people as they study the bill they are beginning more and more to see how bad it is the feelings against obamacare have been described by one democratic pollster as hardening against it we need to repeal and replace obamacare its the only rational reasonable thing to do its the only economically feasible thing to do we see colleagues on the other side talk about budget deficits they dont care about budget deficits they dont care about the huge debt thats created in fact just last week i was down here on the floor and heard several of our democratic colleagues blame this economic woe that we have and this huge federal debt and deficit on george bush can you imagine on george bush we have created more debt in the last yearandahalf than george bush did in 8 years but my democratic colleagues continue to blame george bush i blame george bush for bringing us the first tranche of the tarp bill i voted against it many republicans voted against it i thought it was a mistake then the president came back our current president president obama came back and he wanted another 350plus billion to bail out wall street even more now they are talking about a financial services bill to regulate wall street that they the democrat leadership in this house and the president want to bail them out and then regulate them on the other hand and if the american people will look at who wall street gives money to its the democrats they give the democrats and the democratic party a whole lot more money than they give republicans the best friends of big business and the best friends of wall street are our democratic colleagues so we are here tonight to talk about spending and failed promises i am joined in this discussion tonight with two very good friends two great members of the house both freshmen both are physicians we have got dr phil roe who is an ob gyn from johnson city tennessee and we have got my fellow family doctor dr john fleming from shreveport louisiana that have joined us tonight i understand that dr phil gingrey may join us he is in a markup and so is dr burgess they are both in markups in energy and commerce but now weve got three stellar members of this unitedstates house of representatives three stellar members of the republican caucus three stellar members of the doctors caucus who have been leaders here i want to thank the people of tennessee and louisiana for sending these two gentlemen here and being part of our conference and being part of this congress fighting for the interests of their constituents i want to thank the people of louisiana and thank the people of tennessee for sending dr phil roe and dr john fleming here so to kick this off i will go to dr phil roe to put in his input about failed promises and the huge spending that obamacare as well as the democrats not only with obamacare but with their stimulus bill dr roe we are fixing to have another bill that our democratic colleagues are calling a jobs bill if they liked the first nonstimulus billactually it stimulated big government it has been an abject failure but they want to give us another bill they call it the extenders bill here in congress but the american people are going to hear it described as

that the majority is forcing on this house and the american people this budget is an irresponsible and unwise increase in federal taxes with borrowing and spending that will double the national debt

further prolong this recession by increasing government control of health care and increasing taxes on small businesses and anyone who uses electricity or gasoline this budget maxes out americas

talk about issues that i think are not only important to my congressional district are not only important to the state of michigan but are also important to the people of the country i was struck this morning when one of the first newspapers that i saw said democrats out of sync i didnt read the article because what really caught my attention was the headline at the bottom that said michigan lawmakers look to gitmo for stimulus now this is a story that has been out there now for a couple of months but it looks like my colleagues on the other side of the aisle again believe that the stimulus package for the state of michigan should be moving the people from guantanamothe radical jihadists the individuals who are identified as being members of al qaeda some of whom have been identified as members of al qaedaand saying we ought to move these individuals to the state of michigan this is our economic stimulus package now i understand why they believe that michigan needs help as i take a look through my counties i see unemployment rates of 10 9 percent 13 percent 12 5 percent 19 1 percent roughly one out of every five people are out of work in at least two of my counties you have 16 8 15 3 16 7 those are the counties that i represent and as a state we have an unemployment rate that is now 15 2 percent which i expect will again be the highest unemployment rate in the country but believing that michigans stimulus package and the way that we are going to rebuild the state of michigan is by opening gitmo north i think is a terrible idea im the ranking member of the intelligence committee ive had the opportunity also to serve as the chairman of that committee and we get some special insights into who these folks really are and what the impact of having these people in your community may be i have no doubt that we can move these folks into a prison in michigan we can move them into a maximum security perhaps anywhere around the country theres no doubt in my mind that we could probably contain them and hold them and they wouldnt escape but there is a reason that they are in guantanamo guantanamo is a difficult place to get to we have constructed a facility specifically to match the needs and the challenges of the prisoners that are held in guantanamo and those facilities dont exist in other parts of the country the other reason that we have them there is we recognize that by the very fact of putting them in the united states and putting them into a community they present an increased threat to those communities to the people that work in those facilities and to the region itself this is a really bad idea to my colleagues from the michigan delegation lets not do this lets not promote this lets make sure that we keep guantanamo open and lets make sure that we dont move these people to michigan and lets make sure that we dont move them to other parts of the united states keep them in gitmo and lets make sure that we deal with this threat in the most appropriate way i also found it interesting that as we talk about economic developmentyou know weve got a model for economic development we did it in the 1990s we did it with a republican congress and we did it with a democrat president it began in january of 1995 it was relatively straightforward we are going to cut taxes we are going to reform government and we are going to freeze spending the end result is that during the 1990s we saw unprecedented economic growth and we balanced the budget for 4 years in a row i wish that my colleagues here from michigan and my colleagues in the state of michigan would have recognized that formula because instead of cutting taxes reforming government and freezing spending what we are doing in michigan today is we are increasing business costs by piling on more mandates and theres no plan to create jobs they want to raise the minimum wage to perhaps the highest minimum wage in the country they want to put more mandates on businesses in michigan and we will end up with the most mandates on our businesses for any one state save one which is california right now i dont think michigan really wants to go down the path of california weve seen what california looks like if you want to take a look at the state of michigan this is my state the counties that are in pink have an unemployment rate of between 10 and 15 percent the darker purple that is 15 to 20 percent and we now have two counties now where the unemployment rate is over 20 percent more than one out of every five workers and the response from the other side of the aisle and from democrats in the state of michigan is to open guantanamo north put more mandates on businesses and provide no incentives for economic growth in the state of michigan michigan is a whole lot better than that we could cut taxes we could reform government programs and we could freeze spending and we could become a model and an engine for economic growth michigan has tremendous strengths that we could build off of sure theres a lot of focus as to exactly whats happening with the automobile industry today but think about the people that have lost their jobs in the automotive industrythe skills the talents that they have that can be applied to other industries and other opportunities its happening each and every day i have a situation in my congressional district right now where the people coming out of the automotive industry have developed some very innovative products for alternative energy they have been ideated in michiganthe ideas came out of michigan they have been created they have been engineered and developed in the state of michigan a relatively small number of jobs but as this particular product is now moving into production which is where the real jobs are and where michigan has a tremendous number of strengths in terms of manufacturing skills and manufacturing facility it appears that those jobs will go to some other state not some other country theyre not going offshore they will go to some other state that has created a more inviting environment for job creation and business investment than the state of michigan even though we have got all of those manufacturing skills and all of those talented manufacturing people we can build things in the united states it appears that right now we just cant build them in the state of michigan because we have put up too many barriers to job creation in the state of michigan were also doing some of that same thing here in washington that sometime in the future may force those types of jobs offshore what kind of things am i talking about well if the model is to freeze spending and to cut taxes what are we doing in washington d c well were spending were spending much more than we have ever spent before when president clinton came into office and we were in a recession he proposed i believe an economic stimulus of around 25 billion to 40 billion primarily on infrastructure when this president came into office he too proposed a stimulus package 787 billion 787 billion which is starting to slowly work its way through the system but is having very very little impact because of the types of things that it is being used for its not being used significantly for longterm infrastructure investment if you were looking at the state of michigan where could we be building or what could we be building and what could we be using those dollars for for real stimulus meaning we would be building infrastructure that our kids would benefit from we need a new train tunnel between windsor and detroit sounds like a good idea to build that tunnel with stimulus dollars it is a longterm investment right now detroit and michigan we are the main link between ontario and the united states that traffic comes through the state of michigan goes through that tunnel that we currently have the problem is if you take a look at the trains coming through the trains coming through the tunnel theyre stacked too high with the containers they get to the tunnel theyve got to take the top one off set it aside take the train through put the container on another carrier take it underneath the river when they get to the other side of the river they put the container back on its not a very efficient way to move goods from canada into the united states we need a new train tunnel build a new train tunnel that will accommodate a doubledecker to make sure that michigan and the midwest stay competitive because we have got an efficient transportation corridor we need a new bridge between detroit and windsor build a new bridge it will last a long time we have a lot of minerals that we take out of the up that we take out of minnesota that go through lake superior and go down to the lower great lakes we need a new soo lock if were worried about stimulus and were going to have federal stimulus dollars being spent lets use it on things that make a real difference and will provide us a competitive advantage and strengthen our economy and will benefit our kids and our grandkids rather than spending it on projects that dont have much of a longterm benefit what are some of the things that were going to be building in michigan with our stimulus dollars 500 000 to renovate a facility which may house yoga or childrens movement classes 6 9 million to put in 29 intelligent transportation system signs in four west michigan counties im assuming that these big electronic signs will be put up to warn the motorists about the potholes that are ahead because were building signs instead of repairing the roads were going to be spending 983 000 dollars for streetscaping were going to be spending 1 3 million for construction of a wastewater treatment plant for which there may be no plan and little community support of course every time whether youre in michigan or in some other state around the country youre going to see these wonderful signs that say this project was brought to you by the stimulus package these signs cost anywhere from 300 to 1 000 apiece they dont fill one pothole they dont pave 1 increment of road yet were spending on those to remind you that your money that came to washington d c actually the money that washington d c is borrowing for the stimulus package you ought to thank us for borrowing this money so we put up the sign to remind you where it came from but we dont say this road or this project is brought to you by your kids and your grandkids we seem to think that its brought to you by your congress and you should be thankful for the stuff that weve done weve just approached and gone over a trillion dollars of deficit spending for this fiscal yearand the fiscal year doesnt end until september 30 so weve still got july august and september to go and there are many that are saying the deficit for this fiscal year will probably exceed 1 5 trillion that is something that our kids will not be thankful for and its something that they will carry long into their future but in addition to that kind of spendingagain if the model is cut taxes freeze spending and reform government where are we headed today in washington d c in regards to cutting taxes we are not going to cut taxes we are actually going to increase taxes on the american people it is estimated by some accounts that the capandtrade the capandtax bill that we passed through this chamber a few weeks ago is going to cost the average american family about 3 100 per year now you may not see this as a tax bill that you will have to write a check to the federal government for but what you will see in it is increased cost for electricity for gasoline and any other product that when you consume it has a carbon emission its a carbon tax and so you will see the cost of goods the cost of services increase for every american family it will also make it more difficult for american businesses to compete to invest and to grow our economy again in michigan we are a heavy manufacturing state what does capandtrade do to the state of michigan what does it do to the midwest it hammers the midwest we have a lot of coalfired plants they do have carbon emissions they will be heavily taxed heavily regulated and the cost of producing energy out of those plants will increase significantly ive got a lot of foundries in my district what do foundries do they melt steel they melt aluminum they pour them in a mold they wait for them to cool they take the mold out and youve got a piece of metal that has been molded and shaped and then will be machined it will become part of a car or it will become part of another product that consumes a tremendous amount of energy what do we think will happen to that business if capandtrade becomes the law of the land and that business sees its energy costs go up by 50 to 70 percent remember this is a large input cost to this business its a cost of production they will start looking for alternatives and where will those alternatives be will they be someplace else in the united states probably not because these facilities and the similar facilities in the united states will all be experiencing these kinds of cost increases where will they begin looking they will begin looking in places like china they will begin looking in places like india and mexico the countries that do not have these types of regulatory burdens placed on them so again it is an indirect tax on jobs and businesses and the result will be that more and more counties in my state and more and more counties around the country will start changing these pink counties from being pink to being purple meaning that the unemployment rate is going to continue to increase we see it both at the state level and at the federal level the model that my counterparts on the other side are using toin their beliefgrow the economy is to increase taxes to grow spending and really to reform nothing ill give you one example of where were not seeing a lot of effective reform theres a couple of things that you ought to know about this chart number one the speaker of the house and counterparts on the other side have said this chart is unapproved for public use actually its unapproved for us to send to our constituents under the franking process so if someone calls my office and they say congressman hoekstra wed like a better understanding of how this new health care proposal is going to work or what the structure is going to be for that new planthats another new tax thats coming as well but as the president proposed and as my colleagues on the other side of the aisle proposed a new plan for health care what does that system exactly look like i dont know if this chart is right but we had some really bright people come together and read the thousand pages of rules and regulations of the new health care bill as they read it they tried to put an organizational structure to it to say heres how its going to work this is the process and these are the different kinds of organizations that are going to be necessary or are identified by name in the legislation this is it at least this is what they thought it looked like as they put the pieces together and how the different pieces of this related to each other this is the organization that will stand between my constituents and their doctors this is the organization that will say if youre sick and you want to go to a doctor or you want to go to a hospital this is the organization that will decide whether that is permissible and then what the doctor may or may not be able to do at least this is our understanding but the franking board the organization that determines whether we can make copies of this and send this out to our constituents has decided that this is inappropriate to send to our constituents because they say its inaccurate so now the democrats here in the house are starting to control what members of congress can send back to their constituents when their constituents ask for information the interesting thing is as we talk about this we may ask and say well if this chart isnt right could you lay out for us the chart that is more accurate and the chart that you would use to explain to your constituents exactly how this process would work we are still waiting for that chart the other thing that we found out that was kind of interesting is that it appears that the speakers office has determined that it is inappropriate to say governmentrun health care so even though were putting an organization in place like this to manage the health care system in america something that the congressional budget office says will add about 1 trillion to our debt over the next 10 years even though were creating all of these different agencies it is inappropriate to tell our constituents that this is governmentrun health care and that we cannot use those words to describe this system to our constituents so rather than reforming government what we are doing is we are growing government we are growing this bureaucracy in health care we are also growing this bureaucracy in the energy area so we are seeing a massive expansion of the role of government and an erosion of freedom for american citizens today the model is cut taxes reform government and freeze spending whether you are in the state of michigan and perhaps many other states around the country or you are in washington d c if youre asking where are the jobs and why is there not any economic recovery the answer becomes fairly clear weve got the wrong model in place because rather than cutting taxes we are going to be increasing taxes whether its in capandtrade whether its in health care or whether it is allowing many of the tax cuts that were implemented in the previous administration to expire we are going to grow taxes rather than reforming government we are going to grow government and rather than freezing spending we are going to increase spending were going in exactly the wrong direction for economic growth the model that you are seeing here in washingtonand i remember a couple of months after the election presidentelect obama was sitting at a conference in chicago and had a lot of his economic advisers and a lot of his future cabinet with him they were talking about what to do with the economy i saw that the governor of michigan was sitting next to the president i thought part of the reason for this would be for the president to learn from our governor about some of the things that we had tried in michigan that clearly hadnt worked that increasing taxes had not grown michigans economy that it had been detrimental to our economy that more regulations and more bureaucracy had been detrimental to our economy that increasing the size and the scope of michigans government had been bad for our economy and bad for job creation that the president would be able to understand that and say maybe we ought to take a different look at what were going to be doing in washington but he has followed the same formula of increasing taxes forgetting to reform government and increasing spending in each of these cases as we move through that direction as we move down that path when we grow taxes who gets more control of americas future and who loses freedom when we grow taxes it means that americas families americas individuals and americas businesses they lose control and they lose freedom when we grow government when we put this system between you and your doctor who gets control and who loses freedom this system guarantees that control moves to the federal government who loses freedom americas families americas individuals and americas businesses so when we grow taxes who loses freedom the american people do when we grow government who loses freedom and who gains control americas people lose freedom the government gains control when we grow spending who gets control the federal government who loses freedom the american people which means that a lot of this debate now in washington d c is about control and it is about freedom let me give you a couple of examples this week the president announced a new education program 4 billion one more education program we counted all the education programs that were out there a few years ago and we came up with a number of 659 different education programs and now weve got one more in other parts of this education bill i agree with the themes and the objectives it says weve got to open up our education system to more k12 systems and to more charter schools its kind of like yes i like charter schools i think they work but then this is how the federal governments saying if you want a piece of the action if you want some of this 4 billion these are the things that youre going to have to do to compete for those 4 billion charter schools may be appropriate for michigan but they may not be appropriate for another state so whys the federal government saying that with charter schools that is now the way its going to be nationally and were going to take your money to incent you to do things that the federal government wants to you do who loses control and who loses freedom the federal government gets control using your money to bribe you to do things they want you to do that may or may not be appropriate for your state or your community who loses control local schools local families and the states of course the most massive expansion and best example of this in education is the passage of no child left behind in 2001 the goal is a goal that i think every american agrees with no child left behind every child is a unique gift to us its our responsibility as a parent its my responsibility to try to do everything that i can to raise up that child and to make sure that that child is given the background the values and the education necessary that will enable them to have a fruitful and productive life i want that responsibility as a parent i want the freedom to raise my child what does no child left behind do no child left behind says were going to move responsibility for k12 education were not going to move it from a parent and a family to the local school board to the state it says man were going to grab k12 education and we are going to move it not only from the local community but from there were going to move it all the way to the department of education who gets control who now has control of your local schools we send to your local school about 10 to 12 maybe 15 percent of the money that they spend every year the majority of that money is raised at the state or the local level but ask your teachers and ask your superintendents as to who is controlling what is going on in your local school theyll tell you very clearly and very quickly theyll say its that bureaucracy in washington d c its called the department of education when i chaired the oversight committee on the education and workforce committee and had the opportunity to have oversight over the department of education i always had a great time me and a colleague we would walk over to the department of education we would just walk in wed walk into some offices and people would look at us and say who are you and we would say well i am congressman hoekstra and this is congressman schaffer and were here to help to help wed really like to understand what you do and how you help my kids in my local schools so you kind of say this is my congressional district here is ludington michigan and i am very concerned about what is happening with the schools in detroit there are some rural school districts up here but this is my congressional district can you tell me if theres anybody from ludington michigan that works here in the department of education who might understand the needs of ludington michigan what about pentwater what about muskegon what about holland what about zeeland what about jenison i couldnt find anybody from west michigan at the department of education then youd say well if we really dont have anybody there from west michiganit was even hard to find people from michigan as we went through we would say do you guys know where these towns are do you know the differences in the needs of schools in ludington versus the kids and the challenges and the opportunities that we have in baldwin or cadillac or sparta do you understand that these are just names to them theyre just little pushpins on a map to these folks they dont know the differences and the unique characteristics of each of these communities then you would ask them and say you know all of my school districts in the state they prepare a mountain of paperwork that they send to this place in washington to the department of education can you tell me where this paperwork comes in and to what office it goes to they said well you know not really who reads this stuff and does anybody ever read it and then send a letter back to the kids at muskegon or the superintendent at muskegon heights and say weve read your material weve analyzed it and here are some ideas as to how you may improve your schools but at the same time that these folks in washington really dont understand the kids or the communities that they are managing they have a tremendous amount of control over what goes on in these schools and how do you know every year now what does this department of education in conjunction or mandated through the states do think about it you have a department of education here in washington that is dictating the standards that identify whether your school is a good schooland they dont call it a not so good school or a school in need of improvement what do they call it they call it a failing school you have the department of education telling you whether your school is a good school or a failing school theyll tell you the same thing about your teachers we put in all kinds of mandates and i spend a lot of time going through these schools and talking to these different classrooms and after we passed no child left behind i started going back to some of the schools that i had been at and theyd bring in the kids and the government teacher would come in and i said well what happened to mr smith well mr smith wasnt a highly qualified teacher he didnt meet the requirements that some bureaucrat in washington said you needed to have to teach government under no child left behind so he retired or he or she is not teaching government anymore and i said wow i didnt know that they didnt have necessarily all the class background theyve got a teaching degree and all of those types of things but these persons really when i had been there before they appeared to have a genuine passion for the kids they understood the subject matter they must have found out about it some way and they appeared to be doing a really good job with the kids when i was there but now what you find out is that because they didnt check every box on a form that came out of washington d c they no longer could teach the subject that they loved and perhaps they had taught for 10 or 15 years control came to washington d c and parents and local school boards lost the freedom to run their schools the way that they felt was most appropriate for their kids and would give them the best learning and we now have a school system that across the united states is getting to look a lot more bureaucratic rather than innovating and being creative as were moving forward ill give you another example as to where states lose freedom think about it every time you go to your local gas pump a good portion 10 to 15 percent of the price that you pay comes to washington d c in the history of the transportation bill a state like michigan has gotten historically we have gotten 83 cents of the dollar back so for every dollar that we send to washington d c under the highway trust fund we have gotten 83 cents back thats not a very good return it may be one of the reasons we dont have the greatest roads there are other people around the country who ought to be thanking michigan because michigan dollars are paving their roads but the interesting thing is when this money comes back when the money comes back to michigan it comes back with a lot of strings and mandates attached to it saying you are going to build these signs that may be expensive in the northern part of my district a few years ago they were going to build a turtle fence along the expressway it goes through a wetlands area maybe a mile mile and a half long and we found out about it and said we are not going to build a turtle fence and so we were effective in the delaying of that turtle fence for about a year we came back a year a year and a half later and saw that there was construction going on along the road there and we said man they are going to build this turtle fence for those people who dont know what a turtle fence is you dont need to have much of an imagination a turtle fence is a fence that you put alongside the highway to make sure that turtles dont cross the road and thats really good for the turtles except when you build the turtle fence and you build it along the river so a turtle cant sneak into the river swim under the bridge and then get into the median by getting up on the bank there they put the turtle fence there so all they can do is get in the river swim under both bridges and then get up on the other side of the other fence for the turtles that are on the outside of the fence they are really thrilled about this fence because they cant get hit by a car again but i have gotten a significant number of complaints the turtles inside of the fence are really unhappy because the only place that they can hang out is in the median or on the roadway and they cant get back to the road but the bottom line here is i talked with the governor about this and she said pete lets not get into an argument about the turtle fence im just telling you that the federal government that money came in a funnel we had to use it for road beautification or enhancement projects meaning we had to build things like turtle fences well for those of us that live in the state of michigan we have a lot of potholes and a turtle fence was not a priority for us but it was 318 000 for the turtle fence before that we had spent about 80 000 to 90 000 i believe doing a study as to whether a turtle fence was absolutely essential in florida they have done us one better they have not only built the turtle fence but they have also built turtle tunnels they now have tunnels under the roadway so that the turtles can go and get from one side of the road to the other side of the road and they go through tunnels im not sure whether they have built turtle tunnels as well as alligator tunnels because they dont want both of them in the same tunnel that again is a bad place for the turtles to be in michigan we have been forced to spend about 400 000 on a turtle fence we also have a rest area it looked like a perfectly good rest area to me but we ended up tearing down the rest area and we ended up building a new rest area for about 3 6 million and remember that this is the state where we have the eighth worst road system based on overall performance in the country the 400 000 for the turtle fence and the 3 6 million for the rest area we could have spent on other things and invested that on the things that we really need those transportation dollars for and that is to repair our roads to build bypasses and to build new on and off ramps so that we can facilitate the movement of goods and services throughout our state so that we would enhance our ability to compete not only in the united states but on a global basis to enhance our transportation system again when we send that money to washington when we send that dollar to washington washington gets control and washington uses its control by saying michigan youre sending a buck here and were only going to send you over the life of the program we have only sent you 83 cents back weve got that improved now i think this year were going to get 93 cents back still its not good enough but washington says were going to exercise control by taking some of your money and siphoning it off and giving it to other states and then when you get the money were going to force you to spend that money on things that you otherwise perhaps would not have wanted to do and what does washington d c what does the department of transportation know about whether we ought to be building a turtle fence a rest area or investing it in basic infrastructure those are the decisions that should be made and could be made at the state level again washington exercising its control the residents and the citizens of michigan losing the freedom to set their own destination and to set their own priorities the same thing happens with all kinds of other spending it comes here to washington d c it goes back to the states but it comes back with all kinds of strings attached to it michigans budget is about a 44 billion budget i think its roughly twothirds somewhere between twothirds and threequarters of that budget comes back to the state with strings attached to it by the federal government and strings means control by the federal government and it means a loss of freedom for the people in the state of michigan there is one other area that is a very very different area let me just change focus for a minute here but before i do that let me just reinforce what we are talking about here if we want to get back to economic growth what we need to do is we need to move in a direction of cutting taxes reforming government and freezing spending we need to empower individuals we need to empower families and businesses the job creators and the movers in our economy and take control away from washington d c and devolve it back to states local governments and individuals that is how we will get economic growth not by raising taxes not by growing government and not by increasing spending the thing that i wanted to talk a little bit about is one other area of freedom a year and a half ago a friend of mine came to me and said pete we need to do a constitutional amendment im very cautious about amending the constitution i think thats something we ought to take very very seriously and he said ive got an idea that we need to do a parental rights constitutional amendment and i said parental rights what are we doing with parental rights the parental rights constitutional amendment is very simple it is less than 50 words and it basically says that parents have the right to raise and educate their kids or lead in the direction of raising and educating their kids the government has the responsibility to step in if there are cases of abuse or neglect with the children and the third part is that this constitutional amendment takes precedence over any treaty you ask well why would we need to do that we understand that and it is clear that is an implied right in our constitution meaning if you read the constitution most people would say yeah we understand that to be true that parents have the right and the responsibility to raise and educate their kids but what we have found so often in the last 40 to 50 years is that the things we took for granted slowly eroded and changed and got to a point where we didnt expect that it would ever go fifty or 60 years ago if people had said we need an amendment to protect an unborn child people would have said people understand that that is a life obviously we found out that that is not true we have moved to a different place twenty or 25 years ago if someone would have said we need to define marriage and put a definition of marriage into the law or into the constitution people would have said everybody knows what that is and we have now found out that no we have broad disagreements as to exactly what that is thats why we are doing this parental rights amendment where we understand that it is an implied right that parents have the right to raise and educate their kids but what we are now seeing is that that right is starting to be eroded it is being eroded by our courts it is being eroded by what we are doing here in congress and those types of things so what we want to do is take this implied right and make it an explicit right in the constitution just like the bill of rights which guaranteed explicitly what the rights and privileges were the right to free speech the right to practice religion the right to bear arms and those types of things the spirit of this amendment is to explicitly put into the constitution the right of parents to raise educate and direct the upbringing of their children because that right is being eroded and being questioned and challenged in the courts and in this building each and every day the third piece here is why put in that it takes precedence over any treaty well under the unitedstates constitution loosely interpreted by a marketing guy and not an attorney under the constitution if the united states signs a treaty the treaty takes precedence over the constitution unless it is expressly stated in either the treaty or in the constitution what takes precedence and right now moving through the u n and the president has said we ought to ratify this treaty the secretary of state has said that it is a disgrace that we have not yet signed this treaty or ratified this treaty and barbara boxer a colleague in the senate has said that she is going to make it a priority of hers to move this through her committee and bring to the senate and this is the treaty on the u n convention on the rights of a child and if this were ratified by the united states senate it would totally change the relationship and set in place a framework to alter the relationship between a parent and their child and put the government in a potentially critical role in directing the upbringing of our kids probably another bureaucracy just like this bureaucracy that is going to potentially get between you and your doctor you could very easily envision this kind of bureaucracy getting between you and your children and thats why weve done that amendment and finally let me bring up an issue that were working through right now in the intelligence committee earlier this year the speaker of the house indicated and made a statement along the lines of i believe that loosely stated that the cia lies they lie all the time more recently the chairman of the intelligence committee has made a similar statement that the cia lies and lies consistently seven members of the intelligence committee have written to the director of the cia asking him to retract some statements that he made back in may about the cia and the honorable men and women in the cia and their service and their intent to always fully brief congress and to be truthful in their testimony to congress and these seven members said that he should retract that statement and basically implied that they believe that he had now misled the congress and the intelligence committee and remember this is all democrats the speaker saying the cia this cia lies now under the direction of leon panetta a former democrat member of this house the seven democratic members of the intelligence committee saying that leon panetta a former democrat member of this house may have lied to the committee the president of the united states as we were considering or we were hoping to bring an intelligence bill to the floor for a debate the president coming back and saying that heputting a veto threat on that bill because of the language that was in that bill but the bottom line is that as weve gone through this process and coming out of this briefing where director panetta had briefed us some of my colleagues on the committee have now said well were going to bring in the vice president we need to bring in vice president cheney and we have to investigate a program that was very clearly stated yesterday in usa today they want to investigate a program that they never told congress about that never happened meaning they planned it and they did some work on it but they never executed the program and so its kind of like whats going on here the program sure there was some planning done on it there might have been some training dollars that were expended on it yeah youre right they didnt brief congress but they never did the program and then usa today said you know and guess what this was in the immediate aftermath of 9 11 and its alleged that the program and the deliberations within the cia were about how to disrupt contain and perhaps kill the leadership of al qaeda and you kind of step back and think you would think that our national security apparatus in the months after 9 11 in the years after 9 11 that they would have been considering different ways to contain disrupt or to kill the leaders of al qaeda and in reality according to press reports much of that has happened over the last 8 years guess what in many of these cases the american people are very grateful that weve disrupted al qaeda that theyve not been able to carry out another attack against the united states and according to press reports in the last few months one of the top leaders of al qaeda one of bin ladens sons may have been killed in an attack but hes part of the leadership that still wants to attack unitedstates troops in afghanistan to kill our troops in afghanistan and if possible to attack the united states again but its just amazing to me that you have the men and women of the cia who have been aggressively going after the threats and the enemies of the united states and theyve done it successfully for 8 years we havent been attacked again and the thanks that they get now from this administration and the leadership of this congress is that they are called liars and theyre called liars repeatedly and they are now being threatened by the attorney general that they are going to be investigated and they may be prosecuted thats the wrong way to go these are all points that were raised in the editorial yesterday in usa today saying its wrong to go down this path because number one theres nothing there to be investigated what it appears that some want to do what it appears they want to do is they want to move and they want to focus back on the previous administration and what we need to be doing is we need to be looking forward the threats to america are real we need to be focused on containing and defeating the threats that we face as a country today and we need a strong intelligence community and a strong military to make that happen and we need to demonstrate to the men and women of the intelligence community and in the armed services that we stand behind them and sure we recognize that they may make mistakes they will recognize that and that when they do they will be held accountable but when they do the job that we have asked them to do when they do the job that we have funded them to do it is amazing to me that many of the programs that are now being criticized that have kept us safe are the same programs that many of the members of this house knew about they supported them they funded them and they asked the intelligence community to carry them forward and to do them they are now criticizing the intelligence community forthey are calling them liars and theyre saying we may prosecute you and the bottom line as it was pointed out in the usa today editorial is they are destroying the morale within the intelligence community these are people who risk their lives to keep america safe and theyre saying this is the thanks that we are getting from americas elected political leadership for the risks that we have taken and for the results that we have gotten it is just plain wrong for us to be doing this to the men and women of the intelligence community and like the usa today i think the message has to be very simply stop stop theres not any evidence that you need to go down the path that youre going down and all youre going to do is hurt the community that has kept america safe america has great strengths weve got great people in the state of michigan yes we are struggling but michigan is going to come back because weve got great people weve got great resources we have got the opportunity to rebuild the state weve got the opportunity to rebuild this country but the solutions for rebuilding america and rebuilding michigan are not going to come from washington d c they are not going to come from lansing they are going to come from washington d c and lansing giving up control and giving more freedom back to the people of america to the people of michigan to let them get some of their sovereignty back let them get some of the freedom back and to free them from some of the burdensome mandates rules and regulations we do that by cutting their taxes by reforming government allowing for innovation and creativity at a grassroots level at a local level and by freezing spending here in washington i think with the mad dash that weve done here in washington on spending we ought to be looking at cutting spending here in washington and shrinking the size of this government and unleashing the potential of americas people and michigans citizens to rebuild our state and rebuild this country give them the freedom give them the freedom to grow their business to start a business to hire a few more people to try things the freedom to grow a business the freedom to fail and the freedom to be successful the freedom to succeed in a dream that they may have michigan was built on the creativity and the innovation and the ingenuity of a whole range of people over generations michigans future was never built or created by a government in lansing or a government in washington d c we need to reform this government here in washington we need to cut taxes we need to reform government and we need to reduce spending and when we start setting up the tone here in washington and start moving that money back and just think if we could get 5 or 10 percent efficiency of the money that goes back to the states a lot of our states wouldnt be facing the financial challenges that they face today theyd have more money coming in and if they experienced and implemented the same kinds of practices of cutting taxes lowering spending and getting rid of burdensome government programs we would see a real rebirth at the local level at the individual level and at the business level in this country weve done the model before we didnt do enough of it in the 1990s we need to do it again and we need to do more of it because only you know during the last 8 years and now going into the last 9 years what weve been doing is weve been growing this beast in washington weve been taking control here in washington and
