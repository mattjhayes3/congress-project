offers this nation the promise of strong economic recovery rather than the continued pain of unemployment high interest rates and runaway deficts this alternative is necessitated by the fact that this current administration continues to make excuses for its bankrupt economic policies which are bankrupting our nation we are told to just wait intil our economic recovery program takes effect we have been waiting now for 8 months with these results interest rates are the highest in history 16 million americans are either out of work working parttime or so discouraged that they no longer even look for work the housing industry is in the worst condition since world war ii business failures and farm foreclosures are running at the highest levels since the great depression this litany could go on and on but suffice it to say that if the congress had enacted last year the congressional black caucus economic recovery plan instead of president reagans we would not be suffering the economic contractions that are now wreaking havoc with our nation there is no joy however in pointing out that the congressional black caucus last year predicted the misery and human suffering that would occur as a result of the adoption of the reagan economic program the reagan record hs all too clearly shown that the congressional black caucus was right the congressional black caucus is right again this year we have once again met the presidents challenge to put up or shut up we put up once again a fair and sound budget proposal which will rescue our nation from devastating and debilitating deficits unemployment and economic stagnation the fauntroy alternative controls federal spending not by pushing millions more americans into poverty not by a continued assault on the nations young disadvantaged and poor but by an assault on wasteful military spending extravagant tax breaks to wealthy citizens and irresponsible tax subsidies for profitable corporations the fauntroy substitute rejects the reagan economic shell game which redistributes income from the poor and middle class to the rich more than any other alternative the cbc alternative embodies creative and comprehensive tax reformstopping the raid on the federal treasury through tax breaks for those who least need them rather the cbc alternative restructures the presidents tax cut to principally benefit those earning less than 50 000 per year moreover our alternative provides real tax relief to the poor and middle class by increasing the standard deduction and earned income tax credit the fauntroy substitute proves that fiscal responsibility can be achieved while maintaining compassion and concern for the american people by implementing tax reform and by reducing military expenditures the cbc budget would reduce the projected fiscal year 1983 deficit to 97 billion by 1985 a surplus of 4 2 billion would result let me emphasize once again that fiscal responsibility need not come at the expense of the poor and disadvantaged in our society the republican party platform for 1980 said the measure of a countrys compassion is how it treats the least fortunate yet we now know that this republican administration has systematically dismantled every program which was created to serve our least fortunate under the cbc budget the american tradition of compassion and concern for the needy and destitute would be restored to address the totally unacceptable rate of unemployment among our people the cbc alternative includes 6 billion for a desperately needed jobs program to train and put people who want to work back to work additionally the cbc budget restores funding for important education programs such as title 1 and student financial aid in order to maintain an investment in our human capital and in our future by educating our young people other vital national needs in housing social services and transportation which the reagan budget fails miserably to address are best met under the cbc alternative budget in short there is a way to move this nation toward the goal of reduced inflation without throwing millions of americans out of work there is a way to reduce the federal deficit without taking school lunches away from hungry children and snatching costofliving adjustments from the elderly there is a way to lower interest rates and to restore confidence in our economy without slamming the door on thousands of small businessmen and farmers the way is the fauntroy substitute i have a special concern in the area of health care and waut to discuss with my colleagues the cbc alternative budget proposals in this regard the fauntroy subutitute recommends that 85 5 billion be spent on health care programs in fiscal year 1p83 in order to provide the resources necessary to treat and prevent disease care for sick workers mothers children and the elderly this amount is a full 7 5 billion more than the reagan budget and 5 5 oillion more than the budget committee alternative as cochairman of the congressional black caucus health brain trust i enjoy the benefit of the special expertise of hundreds of experienced health care professionals throughout the country these health care professionals are appalled and rightly so about the ruthless impact of last years budget cuts on the ability of poor and disadvantaged americans to obtain high quality medical care it is all too obvious that the great progress that we have made in the last decade in expanding the availability and affordability of health care from inner city communities to isolated rural towns is swiftly being undermined last year 1 billion was slashed from the medicaid program forcing states to cut benefits and limit eligibility for the poor and working poor as a result over 1 million people lost med icaid coverage virtually all of the losers were women and children in lowincome families thousands of families with incomes at or below the poverty line when faced with overwhelming medical care costs have had to quit their meager paying jobs and go on welfare in order to keep or obtain vital medicaid coverage we believe that it is unconscionable to impose this type of pain and hardship on the poorest and most disadvantaged segment of the population the cbc budget therefore restores those cuts in medicaid imposed last year and maintains a basic level of medicald coverage for the millions of women children and lowincome famtlies who depend upon the government for basic health care similarly the fauntroy substitute restores cuts imposed last year in medicare and rejects any cuts for fiscal year 1983 more than 90 percent of medicare enrollees are senior citizens who have the greatest health care needs in this nation senior citizens have the highest percentage of heart attacks and the greatest number of strokes they are the individuals who for the most part have the greatest incidence of cancer and suffer the greatest incidence of crippling and debilitating disease moreover in addition to being the most sick the elderly suffer the double disadvantage of being sick and poor one out of six senior citizens is poor one out of every two black elderly is poor or marginally poor the cbc finds untenable any proposals which penalize our senior citizens and ask them to use their already limited resources to pay more for medical care the cbc also rejects as foolish and shortsighted any freeze in spendling on such vital health programs as maternal and child health alcohol drug abuse and mental health rervices health manpower and biomedical research additional spending in these areas now only serves to save money in the long run no where is the cost effectiveness of a strengthened federal investment in health care more evident than in the area of biomedical research the economic losses from illness and diseases which we still are unable to prevent and cure run into the billions of dollars last year i had the pleasure of hearing testimony from 10 nobel laureates who spoke about the fact that our nation is becoming scientifically and technologically illiterate they spoke about the need for more funding for biomedical research in order to maintain a leadership position in advancing new knowledge about medical care in order to continue progress in understanding the causes of disease and illness the cbc budget provides additional fundiqg to maintain a strong federal investment in biomedical research let us remember that the debate about health programs and out the larger federal budget is otri simply a debate about numbers and dollars and cents it is about human beingschildren parents elderly it is about their successes and failures it is about their hopes and dreams the cbc budget is an alernative

i would like to commend congressman wyche fowler for providing the time for this much needed discussion of a very critical issue the slaying of over 20 children in atlanta ga is clearly indicative of the sickness which is eroding the fibers of our society violence is becoming more and more a way of life throughout our nation the atlanta slayings and related attacks against children are very cogent symbols that we are moving further away from the highest regard for human life it frightens me deeply to acknowledge the significant psychological damage which is growing among all children due to the recent incidences while the victims of these murders have all been black it is no secret that such acts of violence do not discriminate the fundamental question we must face now is that any child may be forced to live in fear during every phase of a days activity surely the increased number of weaponcarrying schoolchildren momentary periods of panic if a parent is late picking up a schoolchild and decrease in academic achievement are not peculiar to the findings of several atlanta psychiatrists psychologists and mental health officials the feelings of distrust fear and apprehension wih spread among all of our nations children as they begin ti dread functioning in everyday environments this is a sad outlook for our future another fundamental question which is magnifici in the minds of those who fear for human safety is the continuing focus away from human needs we are forced now to question if whether or not the evils of poverty deprivation and unemployment may be so deep rooted in our society that respect for human life becomes secondary to mere survival we are also forced to question the validity of continuous violence as romanticized and glamourized on our television and movie screens the situations in georgia florida maryland and throughout most regions in this country leave us frustrated and angry they leave us to question the basic responsiveness of authorities who must become more adamant in the protection of human lives however they must not lead us to take the law into our own hands the widespread acts of violence must also remind us that the protection and preservation of human lives are crossjurisdictional when as many as 21 lives are lost it cannot be pegged as a state or local government matter both the president and the congress realized this and i laud the dispersal of federal funds to atlanta and the efforts to appropriate 1 5 and 1 8 million for use by this city we have to examine closely the cli mate that motivates and encourages psychotic violence the violence of racism the aforementioned influence of television and movies and the violence of war and militarismall of these inevitably get reflected in individual behavior to a greater or lesser degree he psychotic killers who murder our children in atlanta or any where else are victims of this climate and have apparently been affected to a greater degree we cannot excuse this behavior however we can and must deal squarely with the environment which fosters such actions several sociologists tell us that most of the slain atlanta children come from public housing neighborhoods which are more vulnerable and conducive to human mistreatment abduction and even death such conditions and incidences are not limited to this region of the country right here in washington d c children from lowincome housing projects are becoming more and more susceptible to conditions of drug abuse and molestation here the elimination of unemployment underemployment and poverty must precede the eradication of such criminal acts it is not easy to warn the blacks of atlanta to stay away from theories that the acts of violence against 21 black children are conspiratorial in nature or racially motivated the pattern of systematic murders rapes additional overt and covert actions against black citizens in the south and throughout this country is still just too prevalent however we must assist in the efforts of mayor maynard jackson the numerous task forces and concerned cftizens in addressing the problem in a rational way again until we eliminate the fundamental societal ills we cannot be shocked at deviant behavioral patterns of violence irresponsibility and total disregard for human lives there is little help in calling on citizens to care about each other when increasing inequities among neighborhoods schools living standards and opportunities have become a way of life those of us who are in a position to have impact on public policy must stand firm against further inequities and burdens on our children elderly and lowincome citizens we must promote the kind of solidarity which has been displayed as citizens across the nation have rallied behind the victimized atlanta families most importantly we must not be afraid to oppose and openly attack racism chronic unemployment poverty injustice and other societal ills which cloud any efforts to provide equal opportunities

increased by 249 percent over the past decade federal tax receipts as a percentage of gnp are at a level unmatched since world war 11 inflation is driving millions of hardworking citizens into tax

united states mr wallenberg undertook his perilous mission at the behest of the united states and the american war ref ugee board the passage of house joint resolution 220 will represent a ringing affirmation of americas commitment to the survival of the jewish people and our tremendous esteem for someone who risked his own life to try to save so many jewish lives from nazi extermination a number of bills have been introduced over the years to confer honorary citizenship on various persons but the only successful effort to date related to sir winston churchill the conferral of honorary citizenship on raoul wallenberg however will not establish a precedent for similar action on behalf of a number of other heroic figures the fact that our action today will not serve as such a precedent is clear for a number of reasons raoul wallenbergs valiant efforts to save thousands of jews from the holocaust provide an appropriate basis for distinguishing this bill from bills introduced on behalf of others conferral of honorary citizenship on wallenberg unlike any other honorary citizenship bill congress has considered heretofore will symbolize our commitment as a nation to remember the holocaust and vigilantly guard against the possibility of any recurrence congressman lan~os who introduced this joint resolution testified before the subcommittee on immigration refugees and international law thatwe need to establish a clear record for posterity that america through wallenberg did act to prevent the holocaust in its final days during the subcommittee hearings i requested congressman lirrros to develop this idea further and place mr wallenbergs actions in the context of other actions or even inaction by the united states to prevent the holocaust congressman lairros answer i believe should be brought to the attention of the house and for that reason i will quote from it at some length it is important to underscore that wallenberg was not a diplomat wallenberg was a young man living in the comfort and safety and affluence of neutral stockholm during the brutal closing days of world war 11 he left behind a most promising career as the son of swedens most prominent family the safety the security the comfort of stockholm to voluntarily assume the task of saving human lives so raoul wallenberg did not think of this mission himself this was not an activity that stemmed from his own plans it was a mission that he tundertook at the specific request of the secretary of state of the united states the united states thtrefoe bears a very heavy responsibility for the untold numbers of years that this young swede spent under the nightmarish conditions of the gulag archipelago whether he died earlier or whether he is alive today it is we the united states who are responsible for his tragedy and for his lost life a great deal of criticism has emerged over the course of years concerning the failure of the western powers to act in decisive ways to stop the slaughter questions such as why werent the railroads bombed why wasnt there an attempt to liberate the camps earlier here is a tangible demonstration that the united states officially acted and successfully acted to save approximately 100 000 people our record for world war ii is a better record because of the actions of raoul wallenberg undertaken at our own behest honorary citizenship is singularly appropriate in the wallenberg case not only because of the place the holocaust occupies in the history of human depravity and our national commitment to the survival of the jewish people the fact that wallenberg acted at the behest of the united states and suffered untold misery as a result of it establishes our interest as a nation in giving this special recognition to him the soviet union in addition never satisfactorily has accounted for what happened to mr wallenberg the conferral of honorary citizenship on him may give the united states added leverage with the soviet union in determining whether he is still alive and possibly in securing his release honorary citizenship is exactly what its designation impliesnamely an honor that does not confer on either mr wallenberg or any members of his family any rights or privileges under the immigration and nationality act the concept of honorary citizenship must be distingished clearly from citizenship itself no member of mr wallenbergs family as a result of our action today can possibly claim any derivative rights under our laws even mr wallenberg himself will not be recognized as an american citizen under united states domestic law or under international law if he is found to be still alive conferral of honorary citizenship in no way can be described as giving away anything tangible the meaning and significance of our action today is entirely symbolicbut it is a critically important symbolic gesture in an age when many nations treat human life so cavalierly a few of the statements in the legislative record underscore the critical significance of the step we are about to take today secretary of state alexander m haig jr said that mr wallenbergs contribution during the dark days or world war ii in hungary stands out as a beacon to all those who respect human rights and dignity he expressed his full support for this legislation assistant secretary of state richard fairbanks informed the judiciary committee thatthe conferral of honorary unitedstates citizenship on wallenberg would serve to underscore the seriousness with which the american government and people view sovietbehavior in the wallenberg case conferral of honorary unitedstates citizenship on wallenberg would also serve to reaffirm to the government of sweden that the united states firmly supports the quest to resolve wallenbergs fate former secretary of state edmund muskie informed two subcommittees of the house committee on foreign affairs that the chronological record of state department and war refugee cables and conmnunications 0 documents the unitedstates governments position of responsibility for the selection of wallenberg the directive and funding for his activities the appreciation for his work and the deep distress over his disappearance mr muskie concluded that its isthe uniqueness the extraordinary link between a man raoul wallenberg and our nations conscience that makes this action appropriate mr muskie went on to say raoul wallenbergs mission on behalf of the united states behind nazi lines in world war ii was without precedent what hie accomplished on our behalf risking his own life to save the lives of tens of thousands of people is unparalleled in our history the cost to him the years of his life can never be repaid the action of bestowing honorary citizenship on wallenberg undertaken by the congress of the united states will recognize his humanitarian sacrifice under our direction this is an important part of american history this adoption of raoul wallenberg

member of the house in combat from the vietnam war and we certainly appreciate what the gentleman has done in bringing attention to this situation that has happened pertaining to the cbs special that really hit general westmorcland awfully hard the gentleman from virginia mentioned that he had been to vietnam four times i believe i went to vietnam more than any other member of congress during the combat time having gone there eight times during the war years and four times since the war was over as i said earlier cbs certainly i thought was very unfair to general westmoreland there were many other areas if they wanted to do some type of special on vietnam that they certainly could have picked which would have been a better subject a subject that made more sense when i was over there watching general westmoreland and company commanders and platoon leaders and sergeants they were just trying to survive they were trying to dig out the enemy they were trying to destroy the enemy and they were trying to save american lives and also the lives of our allies they were not that much interested in enemy counts as i say in war you try to survive and you try to attack the enemy so quite frankly i just did not see any coverup they gave me the best information they had as i said i was over there more than any other member of the congress during the combat time let me point out several areas one is the tv guide which had a publication several weeks ago pertaining to the unfairness and how they slanted this special cbs report the tv guide was very supportive of being fair to general westmoreland as i understand it tv guide said that in the interview they did with general westmoreland some time ago before they actually ran this special cbs asked him one question and he gave an answer they did not use that answer to the question they asked but they used another answer it certainly can really make a person look totally out of place and make that individual look bad they took the witnesses that were more favorable to what cbs was trying to prove and did not use some of the witnesses who had some good information i speak of walter rostow a johnson aide who knew what the president knew about the troop infiltration figures about the number of enemy troops he was interviewed for 3 hours the fellow that was the closest to president johnson but not 1 second of his taped interview was aired on the program certainly that was not cricket and it was not fair i will close now because i do not want to take all of the gentlemans time but i was talking to senator george

a function and he had one expression on his face of gladness of what was being talked about but then cbs showed senator murphy in a frowning mood like he totally disagreed with what was being said i just think the networks have got to be more fair and they have to pick subjects that come up and not treat one of our great warriors general westmoreland as they did he had a tough job everything goes

responsible for the behavior of their political subdivisions on a matter as important as the rights of people to vote seems a little bit bizarre in a year in which we have decided that the states ought to be in almost total control of the subdivisions in so many other areas the house voted for instance that the states will have complete control of the small cities community development block

of this block grant power into the states and having given the states all of this control that in fact on something like voting the parentchild relationship of the state and the political subdivisions

progress toward a longterm settlement of the arabisraeli dispute sale of this equipment will violate an express commitment made in 1978 by the united states to israel when the original f15 sale was made to the saudis at that time the united states indicated that the sale of f15s was made solely to contribute to the ability of saudi arabia to defend itself against external threats from the soviet union and south yemen effective defensive capability for the saudis against these and any other credible potential adversaries remains intact without the sale of this advanced equipment what this newly proposed sale will do if permitted to go forward is to add a destabilizing offensive possibility to the saudi military capability which will provide a real and perceived threat to the security of israel this in turn will heighten tensions in the middle east and leave the israelis little recourse but to invest in countermilitary measures to check the saudi escalation the longterm interest of the united states and our western allies is best served by a situation which provides a military balance between israel and her adversaries until a framework for peace can be agreed upon and implemented a major step forward toward peace in the middle east occurred over the past 4 years with signing of the camp david peace accord by israel and egypt the saudis however have not supported the peace initiative which grew out of the camp david accords in fact they have been outspoken in their opposition to the accord this raises legitimate questions regarding the advisability of proceeding with a sale which no one can deny places in the saudi grasp an offensive capability which could result in an escalation and not a moderation of tensions in the middle east moreover the policy course the reagan administration intends to pursue over the next 4 years in the middle east is not yet clearly delineated i would maintain that this sale without the benefit of such a carefully defined policy is ill advised the painful course of events in iran over the past 3 years should further caution us against a policy in the middle east which has a potential of promoting instability within the region in iran in an effort to provide a buffer to check soviet advancement in the middleeast the united states provided a steady stream of advanced military equipment thereby accelerating technology transfer and industrial moderation we have already witnessed internal dissension within saudi arabia similar to that which eventually led to the downfall of the shah in iran sales of sophisticated military equipment and technology which further encourage the saudi ruling family toward a rapid course of modernization and westernization can seriously threaten domestic and regional political and social stability no one would deny that fostering friendly relations with saudi arabia is very important to the united states both because of the leadership role the saudis exercise within opec and the importance of political stability in the middle east nonetheless friendship must be a twoway street whereby the saudis must recognize the paramount importance of a stable and

left the soviet union with ianruell visas the emigration of jews reached its peak in 1979 when 51 000 were granted exit visas thus the sharp decline in recent months represents a tragic low in jewish emigration it i most unfortunate that the soviet authorities have once again adopted a very comprehensive and restrictive policy in regard to jewish families who wish to emigrate to israel either to gain religious freedom or merely to be rounited with their families this policy has included the harassment of applicants by the soviets there are many jews who wish to leave the soviet union some estimate the number to be in the hundreds of thousands today we discuss the plight of just one of these individuals my friend yull kosharovsy when i introduced house resolution 269 in november i did so after hearing about yuli from two of my constituents mr ernestine urken and rabbi gary charlestein then in january of this year i travelled to the soviet union where i met yull and his young family

kosharovsky my wife marie and i pray for him daily president andrew jackson once declard one man with right on his side is a majority i believe that sums up yuli kosharovsky the facts of his case are plain and stark yuli kosharovsky is one of the leading and most wellknown figures in the large jewish community in the soviet union as a teacher of hebrew and jewish culture in moscow he has been the constant target of harassment by the kgb and other soviet officials yull is one of the most remarkable men i have ever had the opportunity to meet he is devoted to his wife and children his community and his religion he is devoted to the basic fundamental principles of freedom of thought conscience religion and emigration that he believes he is entitled to as a human being although he lives in constant fear yuli kosharovsky does not live afraid the terror of kgb interrogations have become an unwelcomed norm in his lifestyle he has however learned to cope with their harassment during one of the meetings i had with yull and his family in their small moscow apartment i showed them some pictures i had brought along with me from new jersey yuli came across the picture of myself with president reagan and vice president busu he eagerly asked me if he could have it when i gave it to him he proudly placed the picture on top of his bookcase then yull said the next time the kgb comes this will be the first thing theyll take despite the fact that the soviets have treated yull harshly and have inflicted great pain and hardship upon both he and his family yull does noti repeat does not engage in tirades against the soviets in moscow i talked with yull for hours and found a man who was gentle yet firm loving forgiving and in no way given to acrimonious outbursts his personal discipline and compassion for his oppressor makes his plight all the more compelling this then is yuli kosharovsky a brave courageous man who has quietly fought the soviet government for over a decade in his attempt to gain emigration to israel for himself and his family where he can practice the faith of his choice freely and without fear of harassment but challenging the soviet government is not an easy thing to do when you are a jew in moscow since yull first applied for emigration in april of 1971 he has not had an easy time soon after applying for his exit visa yuli began to experience a series of problems which unfortunately continue through today he lost his job as a radio electronics engineer and has been forced to take on odd jobs to support his family yet yull remains proud and he will not accept charity from his friends both in the soviet union and abroad and his struggle continues on occasion he has been placed under house arrest spent time in jail on trumpedup charges and taken away from his family without being given any type of explanation over the past 11 years yull has had his home searched on many occasions and such searches have increased over the past months he has had his books and religious materials confiscated and his family suffer through harassment by any reckoning yull kosharovsky and his family have been the victims of a premediated policy of persecutiona policy aimed at demoralizing the kosharovsky family at preventing this family from practicing their religious beliefs this sort of persecution is completely unacceptable it is abhorent to

sector employs about 7 out of every 10 americans and creates some 65 percent of our gnp with such an advanced and sophisticated servicec sector it is only natural that it is a positive addition to our trade balance yet there are enormous barriers to the export of various services and it is important that the administration seek to reduce and eliminate as many of those barriers as possible so that the united states can continue to develop its comparative advantage in this sector as ustr ambassador william brock recently said at the davos switzerland european management forum on february 1 the
