defense spending and discretionary domestic spending however today the cold war is over and the cold war budget is obsolete and the walls must come down today we are engaged in a war on the homefront unemployment inadequate health care homelessness failing infrastructure and recovering from years of domestic cuts made in the reaganbush administrations therefore it is our responsibility as elected officials to enact a homefront war budget which reflects the real needs of this countrys citizens i believe the congressional black caucus alternative budget provides the appropriate response it is time to break down the walls and take this opportunity to invest in this nations future through infrastructure our children and our economy i commend the president for acknowledging that due to recent world transformation it is finally time to cut the bloated defense budget however in fiscal 1993 the presidents recommendation for defense spending level is 6 6 billion higher in budget authority and 4 2 billion higher in outlays than the levels recommended in the committees resolutions plan a and b even better the black caucus recommends reducing fiscal year 1993 defense budget authority by 49 6 billion and defense outlays by 20 7 billion below the caps set in the budget agreement the presidents modest proposal is out of sync with the new world situation especially in light of our current bleak domestic condition in addition because the presidents proposal does not change the rules of the budget enforcement act there will be insufficient funds in the domestic discretionary to merely maintain fiscal year 1992 funding the congressional dellumtowns black caucus has put together a budget which adequately addresses the needs of this nation the budget resolution is the first step in establishing the spending priorities of our nation it is imperative to remember that we are determining more than numbers we are determining the future of this nation and the fate of millions of human beings housing i firmly believe that this nation must be resolved to end the deterioration in the quality of life for millions of americans especially in the area of housing further as federal representatives it is our responsibility to provide decent and affordable housing opportunities the single greatest way to address our nations societal ills is through the implementation of a sound human investment policy which has as its centerpiece the provision of safe decent and affordable housing for all americans proper housing provides more than shelter it provides the stability and environment necessary to enable learning to take place and for people to establish a sense of community since the early 1930s when this country faced the great depression the federal government has played a role in meeting housing needs until 1981 this role grew rapidly as did the bipartisan consensus supporting it this federal role existed because the leadership of this country realized that the government should be involved along with the market to meet the affordable housing needs of all the nations people somewhere along the way however priorities changed and thus today after 40 years of federal housing programs for each lowincome household living in subsidized housing there are three others who need housing assistance but can not obtain it further since 1970 the cost of housing has risen four times faster than income the past two administrations and their budgets have largely accepted and acted upon the assumption that there is simply no way to adequately meet our lowincome housing needs the housing conditions of this country are too important and too demanding to cut community development and affordable housing programs by more than 16 percent from the 1992 levels as the president proposes further to fund housing programs for a prolonged period without properly addressing housing needs serves to make a bad situation worse the assumption that there is simply no way to meet our housing needs is a self fulfilling prophecy unless we make a commitment to provide the necessary funds by doing so we would begin to provide adequate housing especially lowincome housing i am pleased that the alternative budget proposes 5 billion for low and moderateincome housing construction and rehabilitation grant program we can no longer allow further disinvestment to occur in our neighborhoods communities or the increasing loss of affordable housing stock and the exclusion of poor and middleincome working people from housing and vital human services if we allow for unabated decay to the infrastructure of our society we will have no base upon which to build lasting economic development if we can spend over 160 billion to bail out the savings and loan industry we can surely make a sufficient sound and long term investment in this countrys community and infrastructure development we need a healthy and productive population to develop the economic prosperity that we so desperately desire to our world wide competitiveness i believe the progressive budget makes a serious attempt to provide adequate shelter for the million households on waiting lists for housing assistance and the 100 000 children who are homeless today it is disgraceful that in america two million people sleep on the streets each year with hundreds of homeless people huddled on sewer grates in the nations capital and in the white houses backyard i dont understand how the president can eliminate programs such as the emergency shelter grant program which since 1986 has provided assistance to more than 2 000 shelters around the country by more than 715 percent today we must consider the long term effects of this budget resolution vote we must enact legislation with priorities which remembers the millions of hidden invisible americans in the dark and into a temporary shelter out from under bridges in cars abandoned houses or homeless shelters to the daylight of promise and hope supported by the funding necessary to make our dreams for america a reality we must give all of our children a chance to learn we must bring all of our people out of the third world existence that they have been relegated to inside the wealthiest nation on earth i believe the budget for new world realities and for rebuilding america is the budget which reflects this goal"],

purchase of a handgun that crime will go down how many times have we been asked to enact legislation that would force honest gun buyers to wait 7 days or 2 weeks or longer before they purchase a handgun i have just about lost count but i do know that the congress has rejected all of these proposals during the past 20 years and i also know whya majority of members of congress through the years have recognized such proposals as having no impact on those who disobey the law the legislation before us is often called common sense or reasonable but upon closer examination it is neither as we find ourselves discussing a national waiting period for the purchase of a handgun i want to make my objections clear to all first how many members of this great body honestly believe that creating a 7day waiting period and background check on handgun purchases is going to prevent criminals from getting guns and misusing them the best research done to date that by professors wright and rossi for the justice department prove that felons simply do not get guns from legitimate sources criminals by definition do not obey the law and when it comes to acquiring guns friends family members swaps trades and theft are the predominant sources of illegal firearms simple common sense tells me that those who live by violating laws every day are in a position to obtain a gun more quickly and more cheaply from the street than from a retail outletwith or without a waiting period second if waiting periods and background checks do work and criminals are deterred from getting guns why hasnt there been a corresponding decrease in violent crime i have not heard gun control advocates cite fbi figures or data indicating that crime is going down in any state that has such regulatory schemes all i have heard cited are figures about permit denial at a rate incidentially of only about onehalf of 1 percent and this ladies and gentleman does not equate to crime reduction in fact the proponents of this measure fail to tell you that in states that have waiting periods roughly 80 percent of the small number who are initially denied are lawabiding citizens denied due to faulty information no there is a reason that we have not heard gun control proponents arguing for their cause while using violent crime decreases as proof of the effectiveness of such restrictive laws that reason is thisthose states with such laws have simply not experienced any crime decreases attributable to gun control so why force a waiting period scheme on the entire nation when it has failed miserably wherever its

the amount of money that the fdic can lose on the sale of property under the programs during that period to time i think that is an important amendment it is also included in the en bloc amendments and i did not hear the chairman mention it i wanted to be sure that it was mentioned i would like to clarify several aspects of the proposed fdic affordable housing disposition program as i have already discussed this program would sunset after 3 years and would have a cost limitation of 30 million for the 3 years the 30 million would be the limit on the amount of losses which could be realized by the fdic on the sale of properties in the program a loss would be assessed on the difference 6etween the realizable disposition value of a property and the final sales price on the property realizable disposition value would be as determined by the fdic the estimated sale price on a property that the fdic could reasonably be expected to obtain if the property were sold outside the program it is the intent of this amendment that the fdic use the appraised value of a property as the realizable disposition value of a property unless the fdic can develop a more accurate method of valuing properties in the program moreover part of the assessment of losses should include any special holding costs attributable to the affordable housing program such as where a property is held for a longer period to time than would occur if the property were sold outside the program it is also not expected that the fdic should have to develop any valuation system which is overly administratively burdensome and costly moreover i believe there may be some technical issues concerning how certain requirements of this program will operate in conjunction with certain requirements of the hope single family and hope multifamily housing programs i would like to facilitate the purchase of eligible properties under the fdic affordable housing program to the maximum extent possible for use in conjunction with these hope programs i hope to address these technical issues at conference for the information of my colleagues the fdic affordable housing program would be similar to the rtc affordable housing program with the following significant characteristics first single family and multifamily properties eligible single family and multifamily properties could not exceed the appraised value limit set for properties in the rtc affordable housing program this limit corresponds to the fha single family and multifamily it su ance limitswithout regard to high cost areas for example the appraised value of singie family properties in the fdic affordable housing program could not exceed 67 500 second limitation on the program the fdic affordable housing program would sunset after 3 years the program would have a cost limitation of 30 million for the 3 years this means the fdic affordable housing program will cease after 3 years or when the 30 million cap is reached whichever occurs first the 30 million would be the limit on the amount of losses which could be realized by the fdic on the sale of properties in the program a loss would be assessed on the difference between the realizable disposition value of a property and the final sales price on the property realizable disposition value would be as determined by the foic the estimated sale price of a property that the fdic could reasonably be expected to obtain if the property were sold outside the program it is intended that the fdic use the appraised value of a property as the realizable disposition value of a property until a better valuation system is developed third implementation date the fdic would be required to implement the affordable housing program within 6 months of enactment subject to a determination that there are sufficient funds to compensate the fdic for any losses resulting from the sale of properties under this program fourth right of first refusal the right of first refusal in the single family component of the program would be 6 months as compared with the 3 month right of first refusal under the single family component of the rtc affordable housing program

among other things provide a preference for purchasers who do not aggregate and require for all multistructure purchases that at least 10 percent of the dwelling units in each building be reserved for lowincome families sixth bulk transactions under home this amendment would provide for bulk transactions to participating jurisdictions under the home program seventh liability this amendment would

benefits they deserve second it ends the requirement that benefits be repaid if they were once authorized and later sometimes years later reversed the financial and emotional burden caused by this policy is overwhelming and unfair because almost all of the coal miners who receive black lung benefits are people with limited resources the bill restores fairness to the black lung program for miners widows and their families by acknowledging that the government authorized these payments based on the evidence submitted third the bill sets reasonable limits on the evidence which both the miner and coal company can offer at each of its oversight hearings the house subcommittee on labor standards heard the same story volumes of medical reports by armies of doctors are used to refute a single piece of evidence submitted by the miner rarely can a miner match a companys ability to accumulate evidentiary exhibits this legislation stops a wellfinanced coal company from submitting numerous examinations and reams of expert testimony against the miner whose personal resources are so obviously limited finally this bill allows any miner whose black lung claim was denied after

interest of saving this body some time i will include in my comments references to its companion bills h r 1253 and house concurrent resolution 89 which are coming up next all of these bills concern the issue of domestic violence and seek to help protect the rights of battered women and their children in various ways i want to salute our colleague representative connie morella for her efforts in focusing national attention on these important issues each year 3 to 4 million women suffer physical sexual and mental attacksand 3 000 to 4 000 women will be murdered by a spouse or partner while these attacks occur more than 3 million children will watch the violence most of this violence but not all is committed by men against women h1lll subsequent to these repeated attacks some of these battered women are driven to retaliate a few even kill their abusive partners it is critical that judges and juries understand the plight of these battered women judges also need to consider the implications of histories of domestic violence before making custody decisions the central phenomenon behind these bills is the battered woman syndrome and our societys response to it this syndrome describes the psychological condition of one who is repeatedly attackedphysically sexually or mentallyby an intimate partner and explains why her perceptions and reactions may be different from those of the average person it also helps to explain why victims of domestic violence remain in these abusive relationships and why under certain circumstances these women have even resorted to killing their battering partners for instance the average juror often has little understanding of the nature and effect of domestic violence on a defendants behavior beliefs or perceptions also a juror is often unaware that victims of domestic violence frequently are in greater dangbr after they have separated or attempted to separate from their abusive partner despite these misunderstandings some state criminal courts do not allow into evidence the defendants history as a victim of domestic violence or expert testimony on the battered woman syndrome this is so because many of these killings committed during a lull in the abuse such as when their partner is sleeping do not fall under the traditional models of selfdefense therefore for example a jury may never get to hear why a defendant acted with lethal force these judicial procedures combined with jury misconceptions often result in misplaced blame a failure to even consider these extremely extenuating circumstances the bills before the house today are based on the premise that there is a specialized knowledge of the nature and effect of domestic violence which is sufficiently established to be admitted as expert testimony the committee on the judiciary believes that expert testimony on battered woman syndrome is crucial to explain to the factfinder why a defendant used deadly force against someone who to all outward appearances did not appear to pose an imminent danger of death or seriousbodily harm the committee has reported three bills on this issue the first of these three bills h r 1252 would authorize the

consumers will ultimately have to pay for it the question we need to ask is whether this amendment is really necessary some have suggested that the amendment may be necessary to end what have been called settlement day ambushes where consumers find higher settlement or financing costs than expected the subcommittee on consumer affairs which the gentleman from california chairs and on which i serve as the ranking republican held 1 day of hearings on the broader issue of mortgage refinancing in late may at that time the federal reserve testified that in the past 18 months they have received 3 300 complaints of those 3 300 complaints only 3 dealt with the disclosure of information the fed stated it does not appear that widespread consumer problems exist because a significant increase in compliance burden likely would result from enactment of the proposed amendments to the truth in lendlig act we believe that a clear need for additional legislation should be established before

notwithstanding the fact that our weekly whip notices indicate that conference reports may be brought up at any time the fact is we still have a little house rule around here that prohibits the consideration of conference reports until the third calendar day after they are filed that rule is rule 28 clause 2 in case anybody is interested the budget resolution conference report was just filed yesterday noontime the minority members of the budget committee and the rules committee did not see it prior to yesterday and if we were to observe house rules around here this would not be eligible for consideration until after tomorrow so i would ask the question what is the rush well the chairman of the budget committee tells us we have deadlines to observe and that we should take this up on the floor before we consider appropriation bills let me respond to that you know will rogers once said that he never met a man he did not like well the budget committee has never met a deadline it had to meet either not sipce i have been here for 13 years in this case this budget resolution is already 37 days past its april 15 deadline for final action in the second place under last years budget summit agreement the appropriations committee was given authority to move forward with its bills after may 15 even if a final budget resolution was not in place so that argument just does not hold any water third even if we observed the normal 3day layover we could take this up next tuesday or wednesday before we begin consideration of the first appropriations bills that are going to come on the floor sometime next week so the fact is there is no compelling reason to violate the 3day lay over rule unless of course it is the clear intention of the budget committee majority to rush this conference report through before members even know what is in it i would bet that there are not 15 members in this house of 435 members who have any idea of what is in this budget conference report now before us the inability of members to study this report before they vote on it is not the only problem we have around here however this rule waives all points of order against the budget resolution conference report and its consideration let me repeat that it waives all points of order we do not even know which ones it just wavies them all now why would the budget committee need a blanket wavier unless it is to hide under the blanket i do not know how many house rules or budget act provisions are actually being violated by this conference report i do not think there is anybody here who knows i certainly do not know it is my understanding that they have violated both the scope and the germaneness provisions of house rule 28 which applies to conference reports not to mention the 3day layover rule that i mentioned before a scope violation is the most serious violation that can be committed by a conference report because it involves including something that is beyond the limits of what was committed to conference by either house we have always abided by that we know that if we pass a bill and the senate passes a bill the conference report has to be somewhere between the two this rule also limits debate time on the conference report to just 1 hour even through the budget act provides for up to 5 hours as we all know of debate on a budget conference report this rule underscores our suspicions that the majority doesnt want the house to have sufficient time to study and debate this matter just think of that 1 hour to discuss a 1 v2 trillion budget which has a 300 billion deficit1 hour for 435 members to consider thishere on the floor this afternoon i am sure the argument will be made by the supporters of this rule and this conference report that the minority is only blowing off steam about mere procedural or process objections to what is being done on this floor today well youre darn right we are and such objections should not be trivialized or minimized after all what we are talking about here is a process in itselfthe congressional budget process if that process is to retain any respect and credibility we should either adhere to the requirements of that process and the house rules that surround it or we should scuttle the whole thing lets not come in here at the last minute before floor consideration and say its necessary to waive all the procedural rules of the house and budget act in order to consider the budget resolution that is absurd on its face and an insult to every member of this house i resent the fact that our republican members were completely shut out of the negotiations on this conference report i told them every single republican in this house on the budget committee was shut out completely every single senator on the republican side was shut out we have a sunshine rule for conference committees that says all meetings should be public unless otherwise closed by an action of this house we did not do that as far as i can determine the only public session held by the conferees at all was a photo opportunity at which no substantive discussions were allowed so much for congress and so much for the sunshine law the budget chairman indicated before the rules committee yesterday that he thought there were other matters complicating his taskand he normally does a good job at his taskhe had other matters relating to other legislation for which he had no responsibility quite frankly that certainly has contributed to our anger on this side of the aisle over the quickie scheduling of this conference report by waiving all the rules of the house and especially the 3day layover but again this is an important process issue that should be aired as long as we are on this subject the scheduling of legislation by the majority has turned this house topsyturvy and members are very frustrated by the onagain offagain announcements we are getting on matters like fast track and civil rights and what is going to be the final versions of those bills when they are finally brought to the floor someone once said that the process of democracy depends on an informed electorate i would just suggest that first of all it depends on an informed legislature and an informed congress and most members on both sides of the aisle are either being misinformed or not informed at all as to what is going on both procedurally and substantially this house is in a state of disarray as far as i am concerned for that we are going to pay we are going to pay we are going to pay with bigger and bigger and bigger deficit the price we pay for being misinformed and uninformed will be bad bills and bad laws and it will be the american people who will suffer in the long run so let us get back on track let us get our act together let us put our house back in order so that we know what is going on and when it is going on getting back to the rule at hand i urge a no vote on this rule lets us observe the normal 3day layover and take this up early next week after we have had a chance to comprehend 1 5 trillion dollars worth of spending and a 300 billion deficit what are we doing to the
