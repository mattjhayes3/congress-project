the house chamber today with regard to the presidents crime package because it tends to focus on the very issue that we have been raising since the beginning of this year about the way in which this house works early this year we begin to explain that the problem was not so much that the american people were wrong on the issues it was not even so much that the majority of this house was wrong on the issues it was the fact that the issues that the american people want debated and the majority of this house is willing to vote never get debated on the floor that there is a liberal leadership in the house of representatives that locks up this legislation locks it up in committee locks it away from votes so that in fact the american peoples agenda never gets voted on we have made that case with regard to balanced budgets we have made that case with regard to line item veto and on a number of major issues we made the case over and over again with regard to the crime issue today we saw in a matter of a few hours that issue defined precisely the way we have talked about since the beginning of the year early in the day we came to the floor asking that the rule be changed so that the crime package could be one of the authorization bills included in this overall countinuing resolution this omnibus bill that we were voting on today after all already included in that bill were things like the public works committees authorization and a number of other things we asked that this one major item be included as a part of that package that at least we come out here and debate that issue here on the floor so that we would decide as a body whether or not to include that package what we got when we asked for that procedure was a turndown people evidently believing that they could hide behind a procedural vote decided specifically that they would vote not to allow the crime package to come to the house for a vote now in my mind the responsible course of action would have been to take up the crime bill in that way after all you would have had actual debate on the house floor with regard to the crime package it would have been a more extended debate then we finally got when we raised it as a recommittal motion and it would have allowed the opposition a substitute amendment which means that they could have effected some changes in the bill at the point of consideration in other words it was a more open a better process however the house decided on that procedural vote that they would go along with their liberal leadership and that they would hide behind that procedure and not allow the crime bill to be debated not allow the crime bill to be considered in the house we proceeded on with that continuing resolution and a matter of only a few hours later in a matter of just a few hours the issue was before us again this time in a motion to recommit with instructions a motion that is available to the minority party and in this case through the offices and through the best wishes of the gentleman from massachusetts he allowed that motion to recommit to be carried by the gentleman from california who has been one of the people who has worked the hardest on the crime bill in yielding to the gentleman from california he allowed then the recommital motion to be one with instructions that included the crime bill we were allowed 5 minutes of debate on either side mr lungren pointing out very rightly that this was the one chance we were going to have to vote on the package as such that here was the package before us you had to vote either yes or no on the package no more procedural hiding no more hiding behind the leaderships bottling up of the bill in committee here it was on the floor through the recommittal motion the gentleman from new jersey argued against the procedure saying that we had already had some votes that there were things hanging around here attempted in my opinion to obfuscate the issue a little bit by suggesting that for instance we had passed the justice assistance bill which of course is one part of the crime package that was out here so in arguing the justice assistance bill we really had an argument for voting for the bill that was before us because the justice assistance packag6 was included in the presidents crime package but nevertheless we came to a vote there and when the vote was flat out on the crime bill we found that many members of congress decided that they were going to vote for that bill and sure enough it won it not only won by a few votes it won overwhelmingly it was about a 70vote margin that we decided to include the package in the continuing resolution the very decision that we decided earlier in the day we would not make when we could hide behind procedure we decided to do when we got the flatout vote what changed was there any real change in the substance of the package no exactly the same thing it was precisely the same item that we had had before us earlier was there a change in the people no it was exactly the same representatives of the people voting on this issue that had voted on the issue earlier in the day what we had was a change in the manner of the vote no longer could you hide behind procedure you had to say yes i am for the crime package no i am against the crime package and when faced with that particular vote dozens of members who had voted the opposite way earlier in the day decided that they were not going to face their constituents saying that they were against bringing up the crime packpge now that tells you something about the way we operate around here when people actually have to face up to something that looks like it might catch the ire of their constituents then all of a sudden what they do is they run for cover they cover themselves by voting for that which they know is popular but if they think they can hide behind procedure if they believe that there is some way that they can give speaker onll their vote and not get caught at it they do that and if ever there was a reason for changing the makeup of the congress we see it in part of what took place here today because we see people who made a conscious decision to vote one way earlier in the day when they were going to hide and they were going to help tip onrr i and later on in the day decided then there was no longer any hiding that they were going to vote their constituents wishes people ought to evaluate that record they ought to take a look at who was who in that vote because it is important to understand that that vote is precisely the problem when it comes to dealing with things like line item veto when it comes to dealing with things like constitutional amendments tc balance the budget when it comes to dealing with a whole host of issues around here we find the very same attitude that as long as i can hide as long as i can allow some committee chairman to bottle up the legislation as long as the vote that i have is a procedural vote i will not vote the american peoples wishes as soon as i can get away from direct responsibility i am going to get away from direct responsibility but give me a vote where the american people will understand precisely what it is that i am doing then i had better vote the right way well i do not think that shows very good representation that does not show the american people the kind of representation most believe that they need to have i will be glad to yield to the gentleman from florida"], [0.01756160706281662, 0.01756160706281662, 0, "i think that is probably about right i think you have to go a step further and say to yourself that means we have to create 15 million additional jobs over and above the jobs we need to employ the people who are already here who want to work so it is potentially an enormous problem a problem of tremendous proportions and as i said house of representatives h r 4447 is a bill which would permit them to stay in the united states but it goes beyond that as the gentleman started to talk about welfare i think frankly we should not expect people to live badly but this bill would direct the president to report to the congress how many retogees there are and let me read the rest of this because i think everybody in america has been down this road before also the president should report the living conditions of such persons with particular attention to their personal safety and availability of food and medical assistance what does that mean that means that the us government should provide all the medical care they need all the food they need all the housing they need let us go on the resources available for humanitarian assistance including the methods and policies respecting distribution of such assistance and obstacles which may prevent the efficient and equitable distribution of such assistance in other words more bureaucracy more welfare workers more delivery systems more money furthermore steps that can be taken to improve the status of such persons what does that mean more special education more special training more costs furthermore it goes on to suggest that we should not only be concerned about the salvadorans who are living here but we should also look at the number of salvadorans living in honduras guatemala and mexico and report how much foreign aid we need to give to those three countries to take care of the additional refuges so in addition during the transition when those countries will be collapsing which they will if we keep losing the war in central america then we will see even more effort involved let me go on and say that we have to confront the fact that there is already in the radical wing of the democratic party a willingness to accept refugees in enormous numbers and they are already putting bills in that would make that happen but let us look for a moment at the fascellmoakley amendment and why i would say it is unilateral disarmament what does it do it is interesting the words they use it prohibits presidents use of section 506 defensive equipment drawdown authority it prohibits use of section 21 d delayed billing authority restricts use of section 614 authority to waive other prohibitions notice the first three operative words prohibits prohibits restricts but let me go on it restricts the number of unitedstates military advisers broadly defined in el salvador it has restrictive conditions on all aid it allows the second payment only if congress adopts another joint resolution it prohibits joint military operations in honduras and guatemala it restricts the number of us military in honduras prohibits the use of unitedstates military in guatemala limits military aid to honduras prohibits credits and guaranteed loans to honduras prohibits military aid and sales to quatemala let me just read the words notice what the wall street journal was talk ing about we face a world crisis almost every american has seen the film from london of this policewoman who was killed standing there on a peaceful street in a great city we have seen how bad it is everyone who walks into the capitol to vote walks right by pillars that have been built concrete just to stop trucks from running into the capitol and setting off a bomb in the middle of a dangerous world are we authorizing the president to make america safe are we authorizing the president to do what it takes in central america to preserve freedorn and allow people to live in their own country in freedom no these are the code words prohibits prohibits restricts restrictive restricts prohibits restricts prohibits limits prohibits prohibits in other words what we are saying what the radical democrats are saying is that the united states should be totally handicapped in its ability to act should be totally tied up should have its hands locked should have no capacity to act and this is in a region let me remind you where there are 55 american advisers in el salvador and there are close to 3 500 cuban and soviet advisers in nicaragua this is a region where the soviets alone are sending 114 million in military aid to nicaragua in the form of equipment this is in a region where the soviets are engaged in 300 million in military construction in over 40 bases in nicaragua paced with that crisis faced with the fact that the only tanks in central america are soviet tanks in nicaragua there are three battalions of them and tanks are an offensive weapon what is the response of the radical democrats their response is to restrict and disarm and cripple the united states and they have already prepared a bill to accept the refugees once we guarantee by the collapse of our will in central america thslt the refugees are coming a recent analysis tells us a lot about this it is an analysis by prank gigorski the editor of the republican study committee bulletin in the april 30 edition in an article entitled amerlcan foreign policy and the crisis of democratic party incompetence he said the following thing i want to quote mr origorski because i think it is an exactly accurate statement of what is happening with the radical wing of the democratic party le goes on to say what is really fascinating about this letter about house debates on ventral america since reagan became president and indeed about so many foreign policy coinments by so many democrats since 1974 is the implied world view of the democratic party since august the republican study committee has collected democratic commay 1984 mentary on southeast asia angola nicararua granada and el salvador we have compared predictions with results and sifted through dozens of statements to derive the unifying themes we found a way of viewing the world that is simplistic defeatist and simply not competent when applied to the dangers the unitedstates faces here are its five elements stated as postulates these are the views of the radical democratic world view which i think is characterized in the fascellmoakley amendment which is characterized by the bill to admit more refugees which is characterized by the actions that we have seen day after day here on the house floor this is the radical democratic world view as described by mr frank grigorski 1 there are no evil ideologies or governing systems in the world except apartheid communists are at heart are reformers who are too rough in their tactics they are not inherently bad but the unitedstates is so clumsy in its dealing with communist forces that we facilitate or give them excuses for their exceases 2 left wing extremism is caused by a right wing tyranny and the unitedstates makes both worse we finance rightist forces and make the leftist ones worse by not competing with the soviets to finance them there is always hope that cuba nicaragua vietnam et cetera will behave if only we treat them as sincere nations run by people not too different from us 3 foreign policy conflicts get worse when america intervenes the lesson of vietnam is the united states cannot impose its will anywhere and what presidents call vital interests usually are not worth fighting for to ease world tension the united states should keep a low profile wherever it wants to maintain influence 4 military force is proper only to defend the united states and perhaps a few demo cratic allies against an attack already underway but threatening force to prevent a feared attack is always too risky force never really settles anything and if it does it should not 5 political negotiations and military force have nothering to do with each other klauswitz was wrong conservative presidents who subsidize or threaten force prove they are not serious about negotiations liberal democrats and peace activists who forswear force make better negotiators because the other side knows they are sympathetic these postulates are blandly stated but they still seem astounding they are the unifying themes in democratic analysis ineluding the carter administration thinking right up to afghanistan of world hot spots where communist forces are a major factor the study the nrsc is doing will argue that it is time to stop challenging or seeming to challenge the patriotism of demo crats and liberals enough historical evidence exists their cutandrun formula having been tried enough places that the question for 1984 can be one of the competence simply put can you trust the democrats to safeguard unitedstates interests in a dangerous world if they keep saying romantic things about people who despise america can they tell who our friends are and who are enemies are the evidence is they cant now that is from mr frank grigorski who is the editor of the republican study committee bulletin and clearly a partisan therefore it was with some surprise that i found today the following editorial in the wall street journal entitied the newcst gary hart this wall street jountal editorial i think you will agree shys the same thing about one of the two leading candidates for the democratic nomination it says in effect radical democratsand they are now the dominate democrats the george mcgovern democrats have decisively defeated the john f kennedy wing of the democratic partyradical democrats literally cannot figure out what is going on from the wall street journal entitled the newest gary hart voters in the democratic caususes in primaries yet to be held will now have a choice of four instead of three candidates there will be walter mondale jesse jackson gary hart the dove and gary hart the hawk gary hart the hawk emerged at texas a m monday bidding for the 169 delegates to be selected at the texas democratic precinct caucuses saturday he dredged up the days of shame of the cartermondale administration when americans felt helpless outrage over the holding of unitedstates hostages in iran having thus dispatched mr mondale mr hart did a number on ronald reagan for the fiasco in lebanon then he launched into his coda this is quoting gary hart as president i will not hesitate to use force when vital american interests are threatened but i will not hazard american lives where our purpose is unclear our goals unattainable or negotiations have been left untried let me go on to quote from the wall street journal what kind of real world situation would meet gary harts criteria for bold action is not answered would he have nuked the ayatollah but at least it has a hawkish sound contrast the melody with gary hart the dove on a television panel just before his illfated outing in the new york primary april 3rd quoting gary hart i would end military assistance to the el salvador gov erinent immediately and only resume it if and when the death squads were ended that is not withdrawal the wall street journal went on to argue voters in texas like the voters in new york probably wont overtax themselves seeking the real gary hart to the extent they do they will probably go by the one specific thing he said in the above foreign policy pronouncement that he would jerk the rug out from under el salvador in other words he propbses to back away from el salvadors elected government the way jimmy carter backed away from the shah of iran the hostage crisis that mr hart so glibly pins on walter mondale followed from just such a show of weakness and moral doubt the shah too proamerican to suit his soviet neighbors was being portrayed as a tyrant by the american left generating political pressure on mr carter similarly mr hart has fallen for the death squad propaganda being used by american leftists against not only el salvadors right wing terrorists but against its government and people the interesting thing is that there is even less justification for the hart position in central america than there was for mr carters position in iran given the low state of unitedstates intelligence gathering at the time let me make a comment here because the wall street journal frankly could have made a stronger point it was the radical democrats in this house who gutted the central intelligence agency who crippled our intelligence capacity who stopped us from helping freedom in africa and who then turned and complained because the central intelligence agency they had crippled did not do its job when it was the radical democrats who crippled it let me continue with the wall street journal given the low state of unitedstates intelligence gathering at the time mr carter had some excuse for not knowing that the ayatollah and his followers were bloodthirsty maniacs there was also some question whether the shah could have controlled them even with unitedstates support central america however is known to be under attack from the soviet union a well known force that seeks well known results primarily the weakening of unitedstates power and influence in the world the attack could be defeated with a little more backbone amdng mr harts senate and house colleagues let me repeat that one key word so that members of the house will understand it was not me but the wall street journal that suggested the attack could be defeated with a little more backbone among mr harts senate and house colleagues the wall street journal goes on to say mr hart would use force some day somewhere but not where it would make a difference today gary hart the dove wants to pull out of the central american fight gary hart the hawk would be a tough guy providing our purposes are clear gary hart the hawk we think has entered the campaign too late gary hart the dove got there first now let me make a very clear statement here by closing the quote in the wall street journal radical democrats never want to be tough anywhere that is real there is always good reason either the regime is too proamericah the regime has too narrow a basis of support the regime is too violent the regime is too distant it is as though they borrowed neville chamberlains code book on czechoslovakia there is always some reason why that is a distant country about which we know little now the distant country in the case of el salvador as i said is 2 days drive from texas there are already 500 000 el salvadorans in america the number of el salvadorans in los angeles alone is enough that it would be the second largest city in el salvador after the capital and yet we are not sure in fact as i said the fascell and moakley amendment would clearly be a unilateral disarmament amendment that would cripple our capacity to survive but are our purposes clear after all mr hart has said he would do something if our purposes were clear let me read briefly from the unitedstates department of state january 19 1984 what the united states seeks from nicaragua four points to remove any possible ambiguity let me say again what these measures are this is an address by langhorne motley assistant secretary for interamerican affairs the establishment of a genuinely democratic regime a definitive end to nicragauas support for guerrilla insurgencies and terrorism severance with nicaraguan military security ties to cuba and the soviet bloc and reductions in nicaraguan military strength to levels that would restore military balance between nicaragua and its neighbors now mr motley speaking for the state department raises four issues are we for a genuinely democratic regime the reagan administration is the radical democrats think it is not worth worrying about are we for a definitive end to nicaraguas support for guerrillas in honduras in costa rica in guatemala in el salvador the reagan administration is the radical democrats do not think it is worth worrying about do we want nicaragua to stop having a military alliance a military relationship with communist cuba and communist russia the reagan administration does the radical democrats do not think it is worth the effort finally and this is something most americans do not realize the nicaraguan communist army is now larger than all of the other armies in central america combined they are in effect the nazi germany of central america an incredibly 15owerful country compared to all of the other countries if you add up guatemala el salvador honduras and costa rica together they are weaker in military force than nicaragua should there be some balance of power the reagan administration thinks there should the radical democrats do not think it is worth worrying about why are we worried about the communist government of nicaragua and you will notice i do not talk about the sandinistas and i want to explain why there was once a sandinista government it was established on july 19 1979 as the government of national reconstruction formed in exile as a coalition of both communist and civic leaders it had 1ive members running it as a junta or a committee slowly systematically it changed originally on july 19 1979 in the declaration of san jose the govern ment of national reconstruction prom ised a democratically elected govern ment and a fair pluralistic society il was widely supported freedom o speech freedom of press freedom o religion freedom of assembly wert guaranteed by the declaration of san jose gradually over time that free sandinista government was destroyed the government of nicaragua today is not the sandinista government and in fact in april 1980 less than a year after the declaration of san jose the sandinista government was killed for on that date in april 1980 the two noncommunist members of the fivemember committee resigned what has happened since april 1980 is that the communists have systematically increased their power examples in march 1982 the communists imposed a state of emergency severely limiting dissent and establishing prior censorship of the news media the newly rejuvenated judiciary is now a communist judiciary several thousands political prisoners remain in prison awaiting trial after 2 years for 2 years they have been imprisoned by the communist government do any radical democrats complain is there any demonstration in the streets for the political prisoners of a communist government not at all the fact is that the communist government of nicaragua is antirellgion antifreedom and antiamerican the national anthem of the communist government of nicaragua talks about the united states as the worst enemy of mankind but let me go on let me quote about that government from a statement from secretary of slate shultz on march 15 this is a letter in a report to congress let me qiuote about how bad this government has become the nicaraguan governments tentative moves in the domestic front have lacked substance the amnesty program for the miskito indians was iilreceived by the mislkito people 1 200 of whom fled to honduras in december 1983 claiming mistreatment and torture by nicaraguan authorities let me ask again do any radical democrats get up and complain is there any sense of outrage about how horrible it is that the communist government is torturing miskito indians not a word let me go on although the sandinistasand i think it should read marxistfinally announced a date for elections a first step to potentially fulfilling its 1979 pledge to the organization of american states the nicaraguan opposition temnsa convinced that the nicaraguan electoral system now being devised will not permit a true contest for power to occur it goes on to say sandinista leaders have said that armed opposition leaders will not be allowed to run for office and it now appears possible that the state of emergency in effect since march of1082 will not be lifted for a long enough peri~od to allow the opposition a fair chance to compete a possible clue as to the type of election planned by the sandinistae came from a comment of minister of planning henry rutz an february 3 1084 when he said the nicaraguan people had a right to pluralism but with a sandinista hegemo ny now if you replace the word bandl nista which i think is just a stale department stupidity with the correct word communist what ruis is saying is that oh they can have a vote as long as we win now ia this a new thing to us is it a surprise to us to see the communists take over well let me think in 1917 the communists used this same technique in russia in the late 1940s they used this exact technique in eastern europe in 1959 they used this exact same technique in cuba and in fact fidel castro has been quoted explaining the technique and yet it surprises the radical democrats when once again a communist government knocks out the free citizens and imposes a dictatorship but let me quote again from shultz meanwhile the nicaraguan government periodically offers vivid reminders that despite occasional relaxation press censorship remains very much in effect new cruackdowns led the independent newspaper la prenza not to publish on three occasions in january and february of 1984 nor has the government relaxed its control over news programing by the remaining independent radiostations in other words this is a communist government it is a dictatorship it censors the press it censors the radio it is against the church it oppresses political leaders it has 2 000 political prisoners and yet the radical democrats do nut think it is worth worrying about well if we do not necessarily want to believe the secretary of state of the united states what about the kissinger commission a bipartisan commission that included a former chairman of the democratic national party i quote again from secretary shultz it is worth noting that 10 of the 12 members of the national bipartisan commission on central america chaired by former secretary of state kissinger concluded we do not believe it would be wise to dismantle existing incentives and pressures on the managua regime except in conjunction with demonstrable progress on the negotiating front what does that mean it means that the fascellmoakley unllateral disarmament amendment is exactly the opposite of the kissinger commission that when we brought together 12 national experts democrats and republicans and they looked at what was going on in a communist colony the country increasingly taken over by the cubans and the soviets with their local front people the nicaraguan communists the kissinger commission said youve got to put pressure on them but yet what did the speaker of the house say as i quoted earlier the speaker of the house does not want to put pressure on them he said i am opposed to funding for guerrillas in nicaragua all the way nicaragua is not going to get through this house now we have gary hart saying he would sure like to be for something if the principles are clear we have the unitedstates government making the principies clear gary hart does not get the message we have the kissinger commission saying you have got to put pressure on the nicaraguan communists the speaker does not get the message well let us not just trust the reagan administration why do we not go back to the bishops the bishops of the catholic church in nicaragua in their easter statement and what do they say prom the bishops last week our country too is plagued by a beligerent situation pitting nicaraguan against nicaraguan and the consequences of this situation could not be sadder many nicaraguan youths and men are dying on the battlefields many others look toward the future with the fear of seeing their own lives prematurely ended a materialistic and atheistic educational system is undermining the consciences of our children many families are divided by political differences the suffering of mothers who have lost their children which should merit our great respect is instead exploited to incite hatred and feed the desire for vengeance farm workers and indians for whom the church reserves a special love are suffering living in constant anxiety and many of them are forced to abandon their homes in search of a peace and tranquility that they do not find some of the mass media using the language of hate encourage a spirit of violence the bishops went on to say well let me stop for a second before i go on and say that one of the radical democrat arguments is oh it is all the united states fault if only we were not pressuring the nicaraguans let me say first of all that when the nicaraguan sandinistas took over the united states provided more aid to nicaragua than we have provided so somoza the dictator in 20 years in a brief period we have provided millions of dollars and the communists knocked out the free sandinistas and imposed a communist government the next time you hear a radical democrat or for that matter a radical minister tell you well they would not be so bad if it were not for the united states putting pressure on them quote to them from the bishops the catholic bishops in nicaragua at easter who said it is dishonest to constantly blame internal aggression and violence on foreign aggression let me repeat this because notice how powerful a word they use the catholic bishops of nicaragua say that when somebody tells you it is all the united states fault that if we were not putting pressure on them there would not be a dictatorship that there would not be communists in managua if we were not responsible this is what the catholic bishops in nicaragua said it is dishonest to constantly blame internal aggression and violence and foreign aggression is useless to blame the evil past for evl ng without recognizing the problf he present all nicaraguans inside itside the country must participate dialogue regardless of ideology clar trtisan belief furthermore we think that nicaraguans who have taken up arms against the government must also participate in this dialogue if not there will be no possibility of a settlement and our people especially the poorest among them will continue to suffer and die now let me remind you those quotes are from the nicaraguan catholic bishops in a communist country and they were attacked by the government for what i read you the government savaged them called it a criminal statement the government has had mobs that it has organized to beat up catholic priests to threaten the catholic bishops this is the standard precise communist pattern which we have seen in poland in hungary in romania in the soviet union in east germany in czechoslovakia in cuba in north vietnam in north korea and one has to ask the question will we never learn let me close with this summary yesterday in deciding to oppose the federal bureau of investigr~tion rather than to root out corrupt congressmen in deciding to vote to allow soviet slave labor imports in the united states rather than to stop it in deciding to kill any effort to provide aid to the freedom fighters in central america the radical democrats in this house proved that they still have pwer in this house the people of the united states face a real choice there is already a bill in this house which would allow a halfmillion refugees to come to america and be legalized if we fail in el salvador if we fail in nicaragua if communism takes over central america we can expect to have 13 million or more refugees in the united states before 1990 that is approximately 6 percent of the population of the united states sit down for a moment this evening i hope every member will do this and figure out what that means for your neighborhood now of course we know that california and texas and arizona and new mexico will get more than their fair share of refugees but let us say for a minute that we were going to be fair that we have learned the lesson from the cuban boat people back in 1979 under jimmy carter when we had a total disaster and we had a crisis of what to do with all the refugees and certainly everyone in south florida can report what it is like to have a sudden crisis without planning let us say that we can expect 6 percent of the population of the united states in refugees by 1990 that means for the average congressman we can expect something on the order of 33 000 refugees in our district but every american citizen should just take the population of their town or their country and multiply it by 6 percent that means for the city of atlanta which has about a halfmillion people that atlantas share will be about 29 500 ref6gees in

american people have 6 percent more folks in their neighborhood 6 percent more folks in their town 6 percent more folks in their county it will be the american people who permitted it because in the

respecting the lawbecause it is the law that protects the human rights of all of us in his most thoughtful and eloquent statement the letter prom birmingham jail dr king wrote as follows in no sense do i advocate evading or defying the law as would the rabid segregationist that would lead to anarchy one who breaks an unjust law must do so openly lovingly and with a willingness to accept the penalty and when he spoke he spoke in defense of the principles of democracy as lie understood them of the nonviolent protesters he once said they were in reality standing up for what is best in the american dream and for the most sacred values in our judaeochristian heritage thereby bringing our nation back to those great wells of democracy which were dug deep by the founding fathers in their

support in that body as the debate over the mx missile system heightened the build down became part of a broader approach to weapons modernization and arms control in the house of representatives members such as congressmen albert gore las aspin and norm dickss continued to offer fresh and innovative ideas on force planning and arms control in the wake of pressure from both congressional bodies and from members on both sides of the aisle the administration undertook to modify its start position develop a build down proposal move forward on a small single warhead icbm and create a durable bipartisan arms control panel during the summer numerous meetings were held with administration officials to develop a meaningful build down proposal this was a difficult process which frankly became mired at times in bureaucratic quicksand last month senator nunn senator percy and i decided to make a final attempt at invigorating the process we chose the medium of the scowcroft commission which has been so helpful last spring in moving the administration toward a useful melding of arms control and weapons modernization in a letter to general scowcroft we suggested a broad approach which incorporated th e thinking and ideas of a number of congressmen and senators military specialists and the stated concerns of administration officials we noted that if the reagan administration and the congress can agree on a sensible strategic prog~ram and on a coordinated reasonable approach towards arms control we will demonstrate that we have the political cohesion and the longterm bipartisan commitment needed to maintain our strength and reduce the risk of nuclear war we outlined our approach in seven principles which offered the nearterm benefits of the build down conceptimmediate reductions as the price for modernizationand a longer term approach to resolving the major differences between the united states and the soviet union on strategic arms control we recognized that to be negotiable any proposal to the soviets would have to offer meaningful restraints on strategic bombers an area in which the two countries are likely to modernize significantly in the next decade to deal with bomber forces equitably and effectively will require important negotiating breakthroughs trhe missile throw weight qtestion has been a major stumbling block in start by proposing meaningful limits in the area where the united states enjoys a substantial and increasing advantagethe bomber forcewe believed that the united states could extract reductions in the area where the soviets hold a substantial leadmissile throw weight senator nunn senator percy and i felt that the approach we suggested reflected in addition to our own thinking the ideas and views of congressional colleagues who we believed were on parallel tracks in their dealings with the administration to merge these tracks we held a series of meetings with congressmen gore aspin and dicits what emerged was a unified approach which we felt could lead to a broad congressional consensus behind an arms control package the president could send to geneva for negotiation in start this type of support we believed would significantly strengthen the credibility and effectiveness of unitedstates negotiators by making clear to the soviet union that the unitedstates proposal had strong broad support in the unitedstates congress our group of six developed a set of principles which were specific enough to clearly reflect the thrust of the groups thinking but general enough to allow flexibility in implementing the approach in negotiations with the soviet union we met with general scowcroft and subsequently with judge clark to present these idas in a series of intensive meetings over the past week the details were worked out and presented to president reagan who endorsed the principles advanced by the group of six during this process general scowcroft proved again why he is in my view a national asset he listened carefully to all views and stepped in at critical moments to bridge differences and keep the process moving forward ultimately it was president reagans personal involvement which insured the siccess of the endeavor he made clear over the objections of many within the administration that he supported the approach and he met personally with our congressional group to insure that agreement was reached his actions demonstrated his sincere commitment to promoting stability through reasonable and meaningful arms control measures he recognizes that this requires flexibility by both sides and in his rose garden statement to the departing start delegation explicitly offered to meet soviet concerns we seek limits on the destructive capability of missiles and recognize that the soviet union would seek limits on bombers in exchange there will have to be tradeof fs and the united states is prepared to make them so long as they result in a more

president in these troubled times i am reluctant to take an optimistic stance on the prospects for achieving an arms control breakthrough with the sovirt union i must say however that the proposal ambassador rowny is carrying with him to geneva contains the basis for real progress i look now to the soviet union to study the proposal carefully recognize the flexibility it displays and negotiate toward an agreement which will significantly reduce the threat of a nuclear holocaust the unitedstates government has shown in these proposals its willingness to look beyond the immediate tensions in sovietamerican relations and to focus on the longterm interests of both sides in a durable arms control regime i hope that the soviet government likewvise will rise above the frictions of the day and
