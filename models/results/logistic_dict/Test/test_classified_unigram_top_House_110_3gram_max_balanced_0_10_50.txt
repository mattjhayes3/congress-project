tremendous lbadership on so many issues and for her consistent and i mean consistent opposition to this war from day one also i would like to thank the chair of our congressional black caucus congresswoman carolyn kilpatrick for your outstanding leadership and also for your commitment in changing the presidents failed policy on iraq and for making sure that the congressional black caucus speaks in one voice thank you congresswoman kilpatrick let me also salute all of our colleagues from the congressional black caucus who have opposed this war from the start including congresswoman maxine waters who actually boldly started the out of iraq caucus if our voices had been listened to we would not have embarked upon this unnecessary immoral war i once again stand here as the daughter of a 25year veteran who fought in two wars it is past time to end this war last week the president once again took to the air waves to make his case for the same old stay the course strategy he said that he will return the number of troops in iraq to presurge levels by july of 2008 he wants us to believe that by getting back to where we were last january sometime next summer he wants us to think that that is progress the american people arent buying that they know how to count it is the same song and dance from the people who told us that there were weapons of mass destruction who assured us that we would be greeted as liberators who declared mission accomplished and said really it is mission impossible but he declared mission accomplished and who said we were turning the corner and that the insurgency was in its last throes the fact is that the bush stay the course strategy put us on the path for 10 years of occupation in iraq at the minimum it is time to call this what it is it is really the presidents plan to run out the clock on his failed policy to move the goal post once again so that he could sneak out the back door and leave the american people holding the bag after he leaves the white house well let me ask you how many of our troops should die so the president can save face how many iraqis must die to convince the president that the occupation is bringing disaster to hundreds of thousands of iraqis how much of our tax dollars should we spend so the president can avoid admitting that his policy failed we are now spending 12 billion a month in iraq for the price of 1 month in iraq we could be paying for 1 5 million children to go to head start for a year for the price of 1 month in iraq we could have hired 200 000 new school teachers for a year for the price of 1 month in iraq we could have insured 7 million of the 8 7 million children living in this country without medical insurance for a year that is just the cost of 30 days in iraq and the president thinks we should be staying yet another 10 years that is far too high a price to pay for him to save face all the talk about military progress in iraq is a distraction it is a smoke screen that only serves to obscure the basic fundamental fact that there is no military solution to the situation in iraq our brave troops are trapped in a civil war and an occupation our continued presence there is not only challenging our military it is undermining our national security and our efforts tc fight international terrorism that is why every member of the congressional black caucus really cosponsored a resolution which we sponsored banning military bases and control at least unitedstates control of the iraqi oil this resolution passed this body on a very large bipartisan vote and in fact it sent a strong message that we do not intend to occupy iraq at least this house doesnt intend to have that as our policy despite this administrations though efforts to frame this as an issue of victory and defeat the fact remains that redeployment of united states troops from iraq is really a precondition its aprecondition to restoring ournational security and our efforts to fight terrorism and putting us on a path toward a foreign policy that provides real solutions for global peace and security redeployment is a precondition a precondition for engaging iraqs neighbors and the international community in a regional stability plan we have a moral obligation to help build iraq we bombed the country and we for the most part destroyed it but neither iraqs neighbors nor the international community will truly engage in a regional stability plan as long as they believe that the united states intends to maintain an indefinite occupation redeployment is a precondition for any successful effort to combat global terrorism the united states occupation of iraq has become a rallying point for terrorist recruitment training and fundraising a factor that actively undermines our antiterrorism efforts congress has the power to end the bush administrations failed policy in iraq but it means it really means that members of congress are going to have to make a choice are we going to stand with the president for an openended occupation that sacrifices our troops lives so he can save face or are we going to act to bring this disastrous policy to a conclusion the choice is simple congress should not provide another dime not another dime for the presidents failed policy we should provide the money necessary to fully fund the safe timely and responsible redeployment of troops and contractors from iraq and let me tell you the american people support this in closing let me remind you that members of the congressional black caucus saw this disaster coming and tried to stop it if you recall we had an amendment when the authorization to use force came before this body it was my amendment that would have allowed the united nations inspectors to complete their inspection process for weapons of mass destruction congress then however voted to go to war members of the congressional black caucus voted for that resolution members of the congressional black caucus continue to oppose the occupation and ork day and night to bring our young men and women home and we will continue to be that voice that reminds our country that we truly we really we honestly we do support and love our troops and the best way that we can demonstrate that the only way that we can demonstrate that is by bringing them home and making sure that they have their economic security their health care and their mental health care and the resources they need to take their lives back thank you congresswoman kilpatrick for your leadership and for calling us together tonight thank you congresswoman stephanie tubbs jones for pulling us together and making sure we all stay on time and for your leadership on so many issues"], [0.00012171268463134766, 0.9998782873153687, 1, "i thank the chairwoman for yielding to me the rule allows for the supplemental to be considered in two parts part 1 is funding for the war and iraq and part 2 includes expanded benefits for gi education expanded unemployment compensation disaster relief food aid and other measures i want to begin also by thanking chairman obey for his incredible leadership in trying to forge a decent and fair compromise he has more patience than i let me start with talking about amendment no 2 i strongly support the measures contained in this amendment it expands the gi benefits for the education of our veterans including those serving in iraq and afghanistan and extends them more equitably for all of our service branches including the guard and reserves the amendment also extends unemployment benefits by up to 13 weeks in every state for workers who have exhausted their benefits it places a moratorium on six medicaid regulations the costs of which are fully offset it provides emergency funding to meet critical needs especially in addressing the global food crisis and disaster and refugee assistance it includes many other measures that are worth supporting that are important that are vital and so i urge all my colleagues to support amendment no 2 let me now just say a few words about funding for the war in iraq under amendment no 1 funding for the iraq war is provided without conditions a blank check with no requirements about how or when we might begin removing our military forces from iraq or prohibiting the bush administration from moving forward with a status of forces agreement that could tie the hands of the next administration to design a new policy and a new future with iraq how can anyone in this chamber give this president another blank check for the war in iraq this is the same president who rushed us into war under false pretenses there were no weapons of mass destruction and no ties to al qaeda everything he and his administration have told us has been wrong where is the accountability for me this is one compromise too many it represents one cavein too many it asks congress to roll over and be blind to the consequences of the war for the next 9 months or so five years after the invasion of iraq the bush administration continues the occupation of iraq with no end in sight more than 4 500 american soldiers and tens of thousands of iraqi civilians have been killed and over 30 000 americans wounded it is long past time for a change in course and this bill does absolutely nothing to bring that about this is george bushs war and he should end it while he is still president i urge my colleagues in the strongest possible terms to oppose this amendment amendment no 1 and demand that this president and his administration begin the

of good ideas this body who represents greater integthat are out there but every time rity and greater honor than the genthere is a good idea you have a price tleman from south carolina his disthat has to be attached to that and it trict was very wise to send him to the is not only a price as to what we are united states house of representaspending here but it is also the price tives i want to thank the gentlelady that is paid because neither the private from tennessee who preceded me who nor notforprofit sector is going to fill is one of the most dynamic members we have in this entire body for the clarity and persuasion of her speech a lady who knows how challenging it is for families to be able to put food on the table put gasoline in the car pay for their health care expenses and knows that ultimately it is the family budget that ends up paying for the bloated federal budget now i didnt join the budget committee because i enjoyed numbers in fact i think probably the worst grade i ever made in my life was in an accounting course at texas a m university many many years ago but i joined the budget committee because ultimately the budget is about priorities and i came to this body because j believe america needs greater freedom and greater opportunity and you cant have more freedom and more government you have to choose between one or the other and sometimes especially at a time of challenging economic times you have got to decide which is more important a government check or a paycheck and right now government increasingly is taking a bite out of that family paycheck to pay for bloated washington spending well i dont know if the american people know it but right now the federal government is spending over 23 000 per american family it is the first time since world war ii that the government has spent that much money over 23 000 i wonder how many families that are listening to this debate tonight think they are getting their 23 000 worth out of the united states federal government now some will say government has great needs but you know what its not always how much money you spend in washington that counts its how you spend the money and i want a federal government that does a few things well like guards my family and the families of all americans against radical islamic terrorists i want a federal government that can control our borders i want a federal government that will provide a social safety net for those who are too old too young and too disabled to help themselves but outside of that i want people to go out and have greater freedom and greater opportunity and have the greatest welfare system known to mankind and when i say welfare i mean greater education greater housing greater nutrition that program is called the american free enterprise system and it is under assault and one of the things that is assaulting it is the federal budget now lets talk about the fight that is taking place in congress right now and that is a fight about whether or not americans ought to receive a huge automatic tax increase that our friends on the other side of the aisle the democrats have passed into legislation right now over the next 3 years there will be a huge automatic tax increase on the american people now is that what this economy needs now when people are concerned about their job losses when they are having trouble filling up their ford f150 pickup trucks when they are having trouble buying milk at the grocery store i have a 5yearold and a 4yearold and theyre very thirsty and they drink that milk and it is expensive and so the question right now is should there be a huge automatic tax increase on the american people well the republicans think that there shouldnt be that we shouldnt have a huge automatic tax increase let me tell you what the democrats have passed right now if we dont change this the top tax income bracket will go to 39 6 percent an increase of 13 1 percent now why is that important we always hear well you know this is the wealthy and they need to pay more taxes well you know who files at this rate is small businesses and guess what you cant have capitalism without capital i used to be a small businessman i signed the front of a paycheck i used to sign the back of the paycheck but i signed the front of the paycheok and i have risked capital so now all of a sudden the democrats have put into law a 13 1percent tax increase on hundreds of thousands of small businesses across our nation at the very time when they are trying to meet their payroll what sense does that make madam speaker capital gains the capital of capitalism democrats want to increase taxes on that 33 3 percent if you want to talk about something thats going to send more jobs overseas its increasing the tax rate on capital gains dividends go up 164 percent thats right 164 percent under the automatic tax increases that the democrats are going to impose on us the death tax you have already paid taxes on it once you shouldnt have to visit the undertaker and the irs on the same day and yet that is going to go from zero up to 55 percent the child tax credit is going to get cut in half and the lowest tax bracket for the lowest wage earners in america their taxes are going to increase 50 percent under the democrat plan it is going to go from a 10 percent bracket to a 15percent bracket now is this the recipe that our economy needs i dont think so i dont think so but yet democrats tell us well we need more money because we ve got to do all this washington spending well if you look in the rearview mirror you wilt see that over the last 10 years government has grown by about 75 percent and yet the family budget which has to pay for that federal budget has only grown 30 percent now ultimately something has to give and so again our democrat colleagues tell us well we have to raise taxes and all those tax increases that they want to impose right when the economy is having troubles they say well weve got to raise taxes to somehow balance the budget well if people would look at this chart we dont have a taxation problem we have a spending problem right now the difference between this blue line and red line is this huge massive tax increase that the democrats want to impose upon hardworking american families on farmers on teachers on small businesses and look at how much revenue it gains you and this not to get into too much inside baseball is what we call a static analysis this assumes that raising peoples taxes has no impact on economic growth we know thats not true so given the democrats every single assumption if they do this massive tax increase which is going to amount to roughly 3 000 per american family over the next 3 years it doesnt get anywhere close to the green line thats the spending line that is the line that represents the federal government on automatic pilot that is if no new programs are added that is how much is going to be spent and what does that represent dont take my word for it take the comptroller generals word for it the chief fiduciary officer in the united states government he says that line right there represents either number one a doubling of taxes on our children or it represents a federal government that consists of almost nothing but medicare medicaid and social security and anybody in charge of counting money for the federal government will tell you the same thing where is the ethic in that where is the morality in that imposing that kind of burden on the next generation but no we have so many colleagues that care about the next election and not the next generation almost 6 years ago i got in the next generation business because i have a 5yearold daughter and a 4yearold son and i care desperately about their future so we have to do something about outofcontrol spending and yet our colleagues on the other side of the aisle the democrats every single day they add a new program completely oblivious to the cost on our children and grandchildren the least of these those who cannot vote and those yet to be born if we are to work our way out of the economic challenges we have today much less spare our children and grandchildren a doubling of their taxation to where we would be the first generation in american history to leave the next generation with a lower standard of living if we are going to keep our faith with our forefathers if we are going to show fidelity to the future generations and be good stewards of the american dream we have to defeat these massive democrat tax increases we have to defeat their massive increases in spending it all starts with something we call earmarks congressional earmarks as a dear friend of mine in the senate tom coburn of oklahoma said earmarks are the gateway drug to spending addiction there are too many bridges to nowhere there are too many indoor rainforests there are too many teapot museums and the american people are waking up that all too often somebody in this body has taken a bite out of their paycheck so that some member of congress can keep his the system is broken republicans in this body have called for an earmark moratorium they have called for a select committee to clean up this system where the american people too often see money going into campaign contributions money coming in one end of washington dc and they see earmarks coming out the other end the system is broken it has to be changed and all the democrats have said is nq we are not going to join you they have gone the complete opposite direction i am proud to be a member of this republican conference that is trying to clean up this earmark mess trying to control spending and control taxation so we can get this economy going and americans can keep their jobs and have a brighter future for themselves and their children and their grandchildren i thank the gentleman from south carolina for his leadership and thank the gentleman for yielding me this time"], [0.0002078367251669988, 0.0002078367251669988, 0, "the small business programs covered by this bill are almost totally without their critics they enjoy widespread bipartisan support but there is controversy and opposition to this legislation because of the manner in which democrats have chosen to conduct the business of this house first there are concerns expressed about the increased setaside for these two programs which will come at the cost of other important research concern and opposition of this bill has come from the head of the small business administration from the white house and from the association of american universities among others which represents 60 leading researech universities across the country typically there would be an opportunity to address these types of concerns through committee action before any bill comes to the house floor but the democrats have chosen to skip past a hearing of the full house science committee on this scientific research legislation theyre just bypassing that step and sending it here to the house floor where the democratcontrolled rules committee decided to further restrict action on the legislation by limiting the number of house members who can offer amendments and they just limited it to just 17 out of 432 members in the house now it is true that my democrat friends on the rules committee have allowed some amendments to be offered on this bill but they have certainly treated themselves very well under this rule democrat members of the rules committee get to offer onethird of the amendments allowed to the entire house out of the 17 amendments that would be made in order under this rule the rules committee democrats get six of them but under the rules that the rules committee wrote 415 members will not be allowed to offer even one amendment restricting debate on the house flopr is really becoming an old habit for the new democrat majority the new democrat majority that pledged to run a more open bipartisan house when they won the election in 2006 the democrat majority has not kept their promise to the american people and have instead passed more closed rules denying all amendments on the house floor than any congress in history and they did it in record time despite this record of shutting down debate in the house the new majority has failed to complete its work and address matters critical to american families small businesses and the economy they failed to meet last weeks april 5 deadline to write a budget for the next fiscal year for example the current farm bill ended last september and our farmers are still waiting for that bill to be finished house democrats have refused to pass the senates bipartisan bill to modernize fisa and to protect our country vital tax relief is set to expire while democrats propose the largest tax increase in american history families workers and small businesses dont need a record tax increase and they cant afford the plans to cut the child tax credit in half reinstate the marriage penalty and raise rates on every single taxpayer while democrats plot these recordbreaking tax increases they sit by while the price of gasoline rises to record levels sinc6 democrats took control of congress in january of last year the cost of a gallon of unleaded gas has gone up by 50 percent according to the aaa the national average for regular unleaded gasoline has gone up 1 18 the cost of gas has gone up more in 15 months than it had gone up in the prior 6 years two years ago tomorrow on april 24 2006 house speaker nancy pelosi then the democrat minority leader issued a press release claiming that house democrats have a commonsense plan to bring down skyrocketing gas prices this was 2 years ago tomorrow two weeks after that press release then minority leader pelosi said that democrats have real solutions that would lower the price at the pump that was 2 years ago just less than 2 years ago but now theyve controlled the house for over a year yet the real solutions and the commonsense plan promised by democrats are nowhere to be seen they pledged to lower gas prices and theyve done nothing gas prices keep climbing i think its time for speaker pelosi to reveal the democrat plan and for this house to be allowed to consider ways to address the rising price of gasoline therefore i will be asking my colleagues to defeat the previous question so that i can amend the rule to make in order any amendment to the underlying bill that would have the effect 9f lowering national average gas price per gallon of regular unleaded gas this house can then debate the rising cost of gas and we can have that debate by defeating the previous question at this time i will insert into the record both speaker pelosis 2006 press release and a letter sent yesterday from republican leaders to speaker pelosi asking for the democrats to put forward the commonsense plan that they had promised"],

caucus it is a very timely issue that we are discussing today since indeed today is the first day of the fiscal year for the federal government i think for many of us it is easy to sum up the actions of the new democrat majority that is they spend too much and they tax too much it bodes ill for the future of our nation i think that it is important that we step back for a moment and figure out just how much of the peoples money is being spent and it is the peoples money it is not the governments money it is the peoples money today right now the last figure i saw is that the federal government is now spending 23 289 per family of four this is just about the highest level that has been spent since world war ii since i have been on the face of the planet since i was born the federal budget has grown four to five times faster than the family budget ultimstely it is the family budget that has to pay for that since we have been in this 110th congress with the new democrat majority rarely does a day go by that there is not a new opportunity to begin a new government program on top of the roughly 10 000 federal programs spread across 600 agencies that already exist it kind of begs the question how much government is enough because we know that as government grows our freedoms and our opportunities contract this is supposed to be the land of opportunity this is supposed to be the land of freedom yet all we do under this new democrat majority rule is add program after program after program unfortunately all of this new spending imposes a new tax burden on the american people in the budget that the democrat majority passed they includedin it the single highest tax increase in american history when fully implemented over a 5year period this budget will impose approximately 3 000 of additional taxes on the average american family now every single day we come to this floor and we debate and our friends on the other side of the aisle the democrats want to talk about great investments in education great investments in housing and great investments in nutrition that they are going to use all this money for well the challenge is though that every time that they increase some federal budget they are having to decrease some family budget to take it and right now to the tune of 3 000 per american family i often hear from people in the fifth district of texas that i represent i take great pride in representing these people who have entrusted me with their representation in congress i hear from people like the flores family in garland texas i heard this lady say i am a divorced mother with a child in college and a child in day care an increase in taxes of this magnitude would wipe out hope of the first college graduate in the family dont let this happen lets hold the budget down so again what we have here is the democrats are taking money away from a family budget in order to give it to some federal budget we are not always debating how much money we are going to spend on these items but we are debating who is going to do the spending democrats in washington want the bureaucrats in washington to do the spending republicans want families to do the spending the people who actually roll up their sleeves and work hard they work hard trying to make ends meet they have got decisions that they have to make around the kitchen table and this is just one example i hear from lots of my constituents i heard from the lopez family in mesquite i would like to let you know that if our taxes are increased this may mean that we could not continue to finance our childs education i heard from the winters family in tennessee colony stop the wasteful spending i am retired and disabled i am raising three grandchildren sometimes i cant afford my own medicine and here we are this new democrat majority wants to take 3 000 a year away from these hardworking families to fuel their budget not these families budgets but the federal budget now ultimately though it is not just the tax increase that we see right over the horizon that is so challenging it is what is going to happen to future generations and rarely does a day occur that somebody doesnt come to the floor and talk about the need to help the least of these well i often think that the least of these are those who cannot vote and those yet to be born they dont seem to have a sayso in this great debate that we are having today for example dont take my word for it but all this spending that we have seen in washington here is the result dont take my word for it but we right now are literally on the verge of doing something to the next generation that has never been done before imposing such a draconian economic burden on them something that has never been done before that according to the comptroller general the chief fiduciary officer in america we are on the verge of being the very first generation in americas history to leave the next generation with a lower standard of living as the father of a 5yearold and a 4yearold i will not sit idly by and let that happen again dont take my word for it listen to the words of our chairman of the federal reserve who said without early and meaningful action to address federal spending the unitedstates economy could be seriously weakened with future generations bearing much of the cost listen to the gao the general accountability office they talk about government spending particularly entitlement spending as a fiscal cancer that threatens catastrophic consequences for our country and could bankrupt america listen to the famous economist robert samuelson who writes frequently in newspapers all across the nation he says the rising cost of government retirement programs could either increase taxes or budget deficits so much that they could reduce economic growth and this could trigger an economic and political death spiral the congressional budget office the office of management and budget the general accountability office the liberal brookings institution the conservative heritage foundation they all agree that spending is out of control and what is going to happen is in the next generation either the federal government will consist of nothing to speak of but medicare medicaid and social security or youre going to have to double taxes on our children and grandchildren just to balance the budget now we see that hurricane coming over the horizon we see it coming towards us and yet this democrat majority every single day adds to the problem just last week the democrat majority took an insurance program the national flood insurance program that is already going broke was supposed to be selfsustaining through premiums its 20 billion in the red and they add additional coverage to it that could expose the taxpayer to 17 trillion 17 trillion of new liability in just one program alone so that is why its so important that we start tackling the pennies and the nickels and the dimes because we are talking about the priorities of american families we are talking about their opportunities we are talking about their ability to send their children to college we are talking about their ability to save that nest egg to launch their version of the american dream and start their new business we are talking about their ability to pay for their health insurance premiums again every time you increase the federal budget youre having to decrease some family budget i just often wonder when will the madness stop when will we finally figure out that this isnt investment in the future that is divesting our childrens future by spending all of this money the federal budget should not be allowed to grow beyond the family budgets ability to pay for it that is why conservatives in the republican study committee the house conservative caucus support a limitation on the growth of the federal government to force congress to decide amongst some of these priorities among these competing 10 000 federal programs i defy any man woman or child in america to tell me what they all do 10 000 of them it reminds me of what president reagan once said there is nothing as close to eternal life on earth as a federal program they all cost money and they take away from our childrens future so that is why i am so happy that members of the republican study committee have gathered here this evening to talk about the challenges of spending for the future generations and to get together to ensure that we let the american ppople know that we are working to hold the line on spending to bring more accountability to bring more transparency to try to stave off this tax increase of 3 000 per american family and thats for the families today and we are fighting just as hard if not harder to ensure that the children and grandchildren of todays taxpayers are not saddled with a doubling of their taxation so that they would see a lower standard of living that is not the america that we grew up in that is not the moral obligation we have we cannot be that first generation in americas history to leave the next generation with a lower standard of

thats so that the democrat majority can deny republicans their rights as the minority party democrats are going to get their way at the end of the day majorities always do that but in putting this rule on the floor democrats are saying that they neednt even bother with respecting minority rights this rule exists solely as an abuse of power when democrats won control of the congress in 2006 they promised the american people that they would run the most open and honest house in history they would seek to work in a bipartisan manner instead of keeping that promise the democrat majority has stooped to depths and gone to extremes that no previous majority in the house has ever dared when it comes time to shutting down debate silencing ideas restricting minority rights ignoring rules they themselves wrote and running the house in a topdown shutup sitdown manner this democrat majority has no peer the democrat promise to run the most open honest house in history has been revealed as a hollow charade they have passed more closed rules that block all amendments and debate than any house in history they wrote new rules to prohibit votes from being held open to change the votes outcome and then violated that rule time after time they passed new rules to ensure house and senate conference committeesare more open and public but instead they turn around and retreat evbn further behind closed doors they almost totally abandon even holding conference committees why is this rule suddenly on the house floor today why the sudden interest of democrats in the house to go to conference with the senate on a budget the house passed their version of the budget on march 13 the senate passed their version on march 14 today is may 14 why didnt we go to conference 2 months ago never mind of course that the law sets april 15 as the deadline for congress to pass a final budget resolution the facts are that this house could and should have gone to conference 2 months ago but democrats have instead hid behind closed doors to negotiate bargain and cut deals to write a final budget by reading media reports it appears the democrat majority in the house and senate have reached a final agreement on the final budget for fiscal year 2009 that agreement will apparently increase spending by billions of dollars and include the largest tax increase in history so now they apparently are going to go to a phony conference after all the true tax and spend work has been done in secret they arent doing this to be more open and honest they are doing this to force through their plan to massively increase taxes and increase government spending the news media also reports that the democrat majority has abandoned another of their promises it made to the american people when they wrote the new law for the house that is known as paygo this is a rule that was sought by the blue dog democrats this rule places a blanket requirement that any bill that lowers taxes or increases spending must be correspondingly offset under the secret budget agreement it appears that the democrat paygo rule was jetti soned blue dog democrats have given up on their rule and their paygo principle they traded an enforceable house rule for a meaningless promise from a senator its meaningless because everyone knows that this one senator will in all likelihood be overridden by his senate colleagues one can respect my colleagues on the other side of the aisle for standing on principle but this is a principle thats being abandoned this rule isnt necessary the democrats already have all the power they need to go to conference so the only reason we are here is because the majority is trying to restrict the rights of the minority to be heard and for the republicans to have a fair opportunity to offer alternative proposals to legislation americans care about most taxing and spending we are being blocked shut down and unfairly restricted in our rights and as a result our constituents will potentially be subjected to higher taxes and more government spending i really dont think americans want that when it comes to democrat plans for billions of dollars in new government spending republicans have the right to protest to demand votes in the house to have the voices of members representing almost half of this country to be heard we especially have the right to protest the democrat majoritys writing of a 200 billion appropriations bill that just completely skips over any hearing or markup in the appropriations committee instead of passing a bill to fund our troops who are fighting to protect america democrats are shortcircuiting the legislative process shutting out republicans and larding the bill up with billions knd billions of dollars of unrelated spending right now upstairs in the capitol on the third floor the house rules committee is meeting to consider this massive 200 billion supplemental spending bill the text of this bill was just released an hour be fore the committee met it never went before the appropriations committee republicans have obviously just had minutes to read the bill this is wrong and is abuse of power by the democrat majority the american people deserve to have a more open process on how their tax dollars are spent so i repeat again that this rule is totally unnecessary democrats already have the power to go to conference theyre just 2 months late in doing so the democrats have broken their promise to the american people to operate the house in an open and honest manner they are conspiring in secret to write a budget that increases taxes by the largest amount in history and use a vital troop funding bill to try to pass billions and billions of new dollars in unrelated government spending so for these reasons i

stopped that in january we reversed the presidents cuts and this bill adds another 1 billion above the presidents request which would again cut research grants we have also included a package of five initiatives to put health care within the reach of more than 2 million additional americans 200 million to expand access to health and dental care at community health centers 75 million to help states expand health coverage for targeted populations 50 million to help states provide affordable health insurance for 200 000 people who are medical high risks and cannot get insurance from the private

percentage of total national income have declined hugely the presidents budget would cut them to a level 48 percent below the 1980 level and by 2012 to a level 57 percent below 1980 thats hardly runaway rse h7899 growth that is a steady bleed of americasquality of life and americas future for the president to borrow 1 2 trillion to pay for tax cuts and 600 billion to pay for iraq including another 140 billion next year and then pretend that this modest 2 percent difference with him is the cause of fiscal irresponsibility is sheer nonsense and many enlightened republicans knew it these investments are not just fiscally responsible they are necessary for the future health and strength of the nation one other point we will today hear complaints about earmarks in this bill let us be clear the last time congress was in democratic hands there were no earmarks in this bill under republican rule they exploded from zero to over 3 000 this bill has cut back the dollar level for earmarks to half the level in the 2006 bill exactly twotenths of 1 percent of the total funding in this bill go for congressionally directed earmarks and let me also point out that the amount of dollars in spending directed by the congress is a tiny fraction of the amount directed by the administration first for instance the administration in this bill requests specific earmarks 10 million for reach out and read 10 million for teach for america 9 million for the points of light foundation 4 5 million for americas promise 1 7 million for the mind and body institute 1 4 million for the ymca on top of that in 2006 alone the health and social services department directed spending of 1 9 billion through 21 000 contracts that were less than fully competed that alone is more than seven times the amount of congressionally directed spending in this bill in the labor department 90 percent of discretionary funding for the high growth job training program was spent on a noncompetitive
