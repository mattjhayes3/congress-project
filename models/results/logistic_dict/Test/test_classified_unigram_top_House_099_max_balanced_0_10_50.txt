participate in military and economic aid i see how minute indeed this issue is relative to the issue of life and death dealing with millions of human beings i just wanted to thank both the gentleman for placing forth their ideas their thoughts and their hearts as did the two ladies and gentlemen in the former special order expressed their point of view a quite different point of view their thoughts on this matter tonight i am here to discuss the issue of the unitedstates plans to assist the marxist totalitarian government of mozambique in africa in military and economic ways i serve on the committee on foreign affairs subcommittee on africa i am the ranking republican so i take the well because i consider this part of my duty and responsibility and having visited the country very very briefly recently i have come home with the profound impact on me that that country in the middle of devastation and crisis is in that condition not because of democracy and freedom but because of their totalitarian marxistleninistsocialist form of government economically socially and politically i would like to read from an article from the washington times dated april 8 1985 and this sets the tone well i think for my presentation it says and i quote frbm the article would the united states militarily or otherwise support a totalitarian communist dictatorship against prounitedstates antisoviet liberation forces such a question would elicit immediate and resounding hoots of laughter and ridicule after all communist regimes are the antithesis of americas political system with its free elections freedom of speech religion and assembly a free press and multiparty system as ridiculous as it may sound my colleagues it is a reality that the ronald reagan administration whom i support in the vast majority of their efforts is considering in one small element indeed of their foreign policy but i think a crucial important element in foreign policy development globally do we as a nation decide to support a marxist regime not only with food aid which i do not object to i supported the ethiopian assistance relief act spoke up on behalf of it because we were helping human beingsbut do we transcend beyond that to other types of economic assistance and incredibly enough a form of military assistance as well i think that is what is at issue with mozambique even south africa has recently signed the nkomati accords with mozambique who are now urging the united states to assist mozambique in various ways even the south african government itself refuses to assist them militarily the soviets are involved in mozambique so much so that they have issued what they call the m 124 assault helicopters they have a crew of four they fly 320 kilometers per hour low flying they are used in africa right now and the soviets have used them in afghanistan quite extremely they are piloted by either bulgarian cuban or soviet pilots the third point and i have nine points briefly the president of that country samora machel was quoted in the new york times articlehe was not quoted but i am quoting a new york times article as a fanatical maoist in 1984 the article went on to say that later on he changed from maoist to an avowed marxistleninist he was trained in china algeria and has stated publicly that his hero is mao tsetung now the issue is that we are sold the bill of goods that well machel really is not a communist he is really deep down inside in his heart prowest and he is more than thrilled to be weaned away from the soviet union and the east bloc countries toward us if we give him a chance i find that hard to believe considering his past considering the fact the fourth point that the snasp which is the acronym for their secret police have been trained by east germans and in their actions thoughts and needs and function and role are very similar to the kgb in the soviet union the fifth point there is no freedom of religion speech press or assembly in mozambique is this the kind of country that we should contribute millions of dollars to that 40 million of economic assistance and 3 million in economic assistance to the sixth point i bring from former ambassador to the united nations jeane kirkpatrick she says and i quote she said this incidentally march 19 1985 at a speech to the committee for a free world meeting in london she says the united states approved food aid and 10 million in supplementary military assistance to mozambique in the same week that 17 mig fighters arrived in maputo which is the capital of mozambique jeane kirkpatrick ought to know she was our ambassador to the united nations that this approach is inconsistent illogical and i think irrational the bulgarian ambassador to mozambique said february 27 1985 that there is a new upsurge in mozambique in bulgarian cooperation since the fifth session of their cooperation of their cooperative engagement they have sessions periodically of the two countries is this demonstrating a weaning away from the east bloc it does not seem so the soviets are heavily involved the bulgarians are involved in not too hard to believethat between group that is easiest to support camfact 250 000 tons of crude oil is deliv 200 000 and 300 000 mozambicans are bodia the freedomfighting forces of ered by the soviets each and every imprisoned in socalled reeducation son sann even someone who has genyear to mozambique camps and some reports claim that erally been opposed to any type of mozambique is militarily tied eco 79 000 have already died over the last covert activity to freedom fightersnomically tied to the east bloc coun 9 years in those camps and my good friend and very distintries a local washington newspaper re guished colleague on foreign affairs now in 1975 the united states gave cently reported that mozambique has steve solarz has suggested we give 5 10 million to help refugees they were sent 12 000 children to work in slave million of aid to those freedom fightflooding into mozambique from the labor mines in factories in east ger ers in cambodiaso now we have thendestabilized country of rhodesia many and some say this is because nicaragua afghanistan and three nalater on however we cut off devel they want to help pay off the debt to tions together indochina cambodia opment aid because the human rights east germany and this is one way laos and vietnam then president violations were so incredible in 1980 they can help doing that without hard reagan in his letter mentioned there was a signed document by the currency angola i know the gentleman has secretary of state that these human now when i presented this case become an expert on this the forces rights violations that we are so con when i was in mozambique do you of jonas savimbi control more than cerned about had improved and we know what my response was oh twothirds of the country we even should therefore be more than willing they are there on education scholar have problems with corporate amerto contribute more aid to mozambique ships 200 000 mozambicans are starv ica like gulf oil helping out the 0 2050 ing while mozambique allows the cuban mercenaries in the capital city soviet union to take all the fish out of of luanda and then the president according to amnesty international its waters and sells inferior fish back mentioned ethiopia and here it bepublic executions and floggings are to the mozambican government they comes really difficult to house memcontinuing and the 1984 human take all their fish higher quality let bers because while we are encouraging rights report of this house exposes me repeat and resell them lower qual private support of food to stave off clearly the extent of human rights ity fish from their own shores massive starvation it appears we are abuses in the country of mozambique renamo is a prodemocratic force it is getting back mixed reports about what so have human rights problems im a freedom fighting force that is oppos is happening in the provinces of enproved according to the congress it ing the marxist machel govenment trea and tigre that there may be a has not according to very moderate they are 18 000 strong they are oper government policy of allowing some at best and impartial amnesty inter ating in all 10 provinces of mozam people to starve to death because of national it has not at all bique the marxistleninist sphere my col so what are we doing considering the freedom fighters there leagues is too big now in africa it is supporting the government of mo but then here is my point of the in ethiopia angola madagascar zim zambique we ought to be considering eight countries the president menbabwe algeria liberia mozambique supporting prowest prodemocratic tioned then the eighth mozambique and other countries are coming under freedom fighters he talked about freedom fighters in the influence of the marxists at mr dornan of california mr mozambique being worthy of our suppresent mozambique has kept in speaker will the gentleman yield port because of the presidents intropower through the help of about mr siljander i yield to the gen ductory telegram welcoming the world some say 18 000 cuban east german tleman from california anticommunist league to the united tanzanian north korean zimbab mr dornan of california last statesthey have usually met outside wean and soviet troops and advisers year i was not in the congress i had in countries around the worldthis now is that a country that is leaning been gerrymandered out and i went group for the first time passed an away from the east and to the west to san diego i think it was june 2 action program jack singlaub who is their leaders use brutality and fear as almost a year ago to the world anti the american head of the american their tactics mozambique has been communist league it is a yearly branch of the world anticommunist one of the most vocal critics in the meeting there is a united states league said all we do is meet eat and united nations are they are friend chapter that is headed by retired retreat this has been the pattern there they are not they have the army gen jack singlaub and at that since harry truman came up with the worst voting record in the united na meeting in san diego the president of excellent policy of containment of tions from our standpoint mozam the united states sent a welcoming communism but where is rollback of bique voted with the united states telegram and i had the honor of being communism anywhere until grenada zero percent of the time on 10 key there at the opening ceremony and i jack singlaub said wacl world antiissues compiled by the unitedstates mission in heard jack singlaub read the tele communist league must have an 1983 but do you know what the argu gram and the telegram from our action program to actively help the ment is now wait a minute they are president saidand i think accurate freedom fighters in the eight countries coming our way their voting record lythat there are eight nations where where young men and lots of young has changed that is the argument forces inside those nations are offering women are willing to die and then since 1983 their voting record has their lives on the altar of freedom as maybe we can look at cuba and other changed they still vote with us zero freedom fighters and he mentioned countries where people are willing to percent of the time but they have ab nicaragua we have discussed that fight but it appears this country cut stained three or four times when we much in this congress and will contin them off at the legs groups like thought it was important to do so ue to discuss it he mentioned afghan alpha66 even romania one of the strongest istan and of course the support in now i ask the gentleman how did staunch marxist totalitarian dictator this house seems to be on both sides we get into this position where less ships in east europe has done more of the aisle for that one because it in than a year ago the preslent is sugthan that in the united nations for us volves a direct soviet invasion once it gesting that all freedomloving people yet they claim a couple meaningless is covert they seem to get confused in support freedom fighters inside moabstentions that really did not count the majority party in the house then zambique and suddenly under his adin the overall vote anyway means a he mentioned six other countries ministration and in this house we are break from this deep imbedded three of them are joined by contigu being presented with language in bills rooted support from the east it is also ous borderscambodia laos and to send money to a country where believed by some reportsand i want vietnam in spite of our pullout and there are thousands of cuban merceto emphasize this is hard to verify but the communist conquest it appears names could the gentleman tell me i think it is important that when you that freedom fighters are fighting in as i do not know the figure how many look at this in the total context it is each of those countries and that cubans are assigned against their parents will i am sure to live out part of their young lives on the east coast of africa in an old portuguese colony that the freedomloving people of mozambique thought they were getting rid of the presence of foreign troops how many cubans are there"],

one of the barneshamilton amendment resolution i want to lay out a frame work for people to think about an interesting development in american history a point in which the leftwing of the democratic party in alliance with very few republicans was able to defeat in the committee of the whole but then unable to pass any kind of legislation referring to central america and in which the vast majority of republicans in alliance with some democrats came very very close to passing a major step toward freedom in central america to set the stage if i might i want to quote from a different era because i think you can only understand where we have arrived in 1985 by going back almost 40 years by going back indeed and i am quoting from newsweek of may 5 1947 back to when america first came to grips with the cold war the soviet union and the nature of leninism back then in many ways the whole situation was reversed back there there were isolationists republicans largely from the midwest largely a historical pattern back then it was the democrats harry truman dean acheson and others who were taking the lead talking about internationalism and a very courageous republican senator arthur vandenberg of michigan decided to change his beliefs because he came to believe that communism was real that the soviet union was a danger that something had to be done in a sense where we are tonight is we are looking for the arthur vandenberg of the democratic party for a man or woman willing to stand up and say communism is real the soviet unioi is a danger it is necessary to do something back then vandenberg said if congress fails to act aggression will get the green light and the rest of the world including america will get the red light i think he honestly believed that if we did not try to stop the soviet union and communism in greece and in turkey countries much more distant than nicaragua el salvador honduras that communism would become a greater threat to america it is fascinating because back then the great bulk of opposition was from isolationist republicans but there were three pioneers and i quote three wallaceminded leftwing derocrats and wallace back then was the former vice president of the united statesvery very leftwing oriented a man who managed to more consistently be an ostrich in ignoring the truth about communism than any other man of his time and a man by the way whose 1948 campaign for president was strongly supported by george mcgovern a man who developing the whole theme of the modern ostrich wing of the democratic party is really the grandfather today one of those three wallaceite democrat senators today serves in the house but he is really a distinguished senior member a man who many years ago voted against aid for greece and turkey what is fascinating is the vast number of younger members who growing up i think largely in the 1960s and early 1970s honestly came to believe in their fervor in opposing the war in vietnam that there was no real communism that is the soviet union really was not a danger that there was nothing to be afraid of i have referred before on this floor to the ostrich wing of the democratic party as i said today in all fairness ostrichism is a bipartisan problem there are some ostrich republicans although in all candor i think there is an entire herd of ostriches in the democratic party whereas there are relatively few ostriches in the republican party there are ostriches in the news media there are ostriches in the academic world there are people in government who just cannot quite believe in marxismleninism let me give you an example the department of state december 26 1979 from the american embassy in managua a document called the 72hour document a very clear systematic statement of the determination of the leninists in nicaragua to establish a dictatorship in nicaragua books that have been published on the fsln which is the leninist party the communist party in nicaragua which has taken power indicate clearly and you can go back as early as 1957 and you will find one of the nicaragua communists writing a brochure entitled a nicaraguan visits moscow there he explains that stalin was a wonderful person the russians have religious freedom in the soviet union there is freedom of the press in the soviet union and he describes the crushing the crushing of the hungarian revolution as an exampie of soviet selfcriticism now that man a man who could go to moscow and find religious freedom could go to moscow and find freedom of the press could believe that killing hungarians was selfcriticism that man was the intellectual father of the modern nicaraguan communist party and is obviously a pretty committed leninist my objection to the entire ostrich wing of the democratic party and the incredible and i repeat incredible barneshamilton resolution that came up today is the mentality behind it they talk about the idea in this document and i am quoting from the actual resolution offered today the barneshamilton resolution a ninepage document available to everyone in which they say and i think this maybe illustrates my frustration and the frustration of those of us who fear communism as much as any single quote in here on page 2 they say combatants on both sides of the conflict in nicaragua have expressed in words their goals for peace and democracy in nicaragua now let me say and i challenge not just tonight but any night any time we have special orders any democrat who is willing to come over and debate my following assertion if all you look at is expressing in words goals for peace and democracy i can find quotes from adolf hitler from josef stalin from lenin from mao tsetung i can find quotes from fidel castro peace and democracy in communist language are words to be used to deceive the west they are words to be used to mock the americans i have cited before and have shown on this floor the volume of grenadian papers which is available for any american to get from the state department that shows you what the communists themselves said because in grenada we captured communist documents from their internal memoranda and we know what the communists said to themselves this barneshamilton proposal suggests for example and i quote the congress will continue to monitor developments in nicaragua let me suggest and again i offer this to anyone who would like to debate it at a future time that you could find in 1979 from 1980 from 1981 from 1982 from 1983 from 1984 and now from 1985 pious declarations that we will monitor can you imagine had auschwitz existed had people been dying we would have been told well we will monitor developments and you say that is strong language there is a gulag archipelago today gulag is the russians prisons that have been described by so brilliantly by solzhenitsyn there is today people being killed in afghanistan even in todays paper the soviet uixion said arrogantly it would not even talk about killing the american soldier in east germany today the nicaraguan government is a communist dictatorship today fidel castro is doing things designed to hurt america and create a more powerful communist movement their offer in the barneshamilton proposal the congress will continue to monitor developments can you imagine gorbachev in the kremlin quaking in his boots as congress monitors can you imagine the communists in nicaragua eagerly excited for the next congressional report worried about the monitoring somehow it is sad it verges on pathos i yield to the gentleman from pennsylvania"],

question why wasnt he seated now these werent republicans or democrats these are young future leaders and they were concerned and couldnt understand how this process could be allowed by this house and

is being referred to as the rape of the system that it was a political steal not only affecting rick mcintyre who should have been seated but it was a steal in the way of taking votes away and the ability of the indiana eighth district to put their votes and have them count as they voted to see some of the statements that were made the blatant disregard for any kind of fair play i think when

to commend the gentleman from pennsylvania the chairman of the budget committee mr gray for bringing the presidents budget to the floor today my constituents in ninth congressional district of new york and all americans have a right to know exactly how president reagan proposes to reduce the federal deficit president reagan told americans in his state of the union address that his budget provides a modest increase for defense protects programs for the poor and elderly promotes family values and meets the grammrudman deficit target for fiscal year 1987 a closer look at the presidents budget tells a much different story first the president claims his budget would increase defense spending by a modest 3 percent after inflation however the congressional budget office estimates that defense spending would actually rise by 8 percent in fiscal year 1987 under the presidents budget an 8percent real increase in defense spending is excessive unrealistic and unwarranted given our current deficit crisis pentagon spending has doubled since 1981 but the more than 1 trillion spent by the pentagon under the reagan administration has not bought america a stronger defense instead billions of dollars have been thrown at costly and needless weapons systems like the mx missile while funds for training and readiness have been cut by 30 percent sacrificing readiness to buy highly complex and unnecessary weapons systems has undermined our defense capabilities furthermore the pentagon has allowed many of the nations largest defense contractors to reap a massive windfall from fraudulent abusive and illegal contracting practices the defense department inspector general has found that more than half of the spare parts purchased by the pentagon since 1984 were not reasonably priced this waste and fraud has eroded the quality of our weaponry enough is enough we can no longer afford to write the pentagon a blank check as the president has once again proposed we can have a strong defense and also cut billions from the presidents defense budget but to do so we must require the pentagon to procure weapons on a competitive basis and we must eliminate weapons systems that are unnecessary or duplicative second i reject the administrations claim that this budget is profamily and protects the poor and elderly the presidents budget imposes harsh cuts on vital programs that have already been cut to the bone by his administration the presidents budget would slash domestic spending in fiscal year 1987 by 22 billion more than 40 programs that are important to the families and the elderly people in my district would be totally eliminated under the presidents budget including lowincome weatherization mass transit assistance supplemental education opportunity grants community services block grants general revenue sharing and housing for the elderly and poor funds for infrastructure repair community development and health assistance would be severely curtailed new york city has been forced to absorb dramatic cuts in federal assistance over the past 5 years since 1981 federal aid to new york city and its residents has been reduced by 2 4 billion under the presidents budget for fiscal year 1987 federal assistance to new york city would be cut by another 1 5 billion the city will be forced to cut such basic services as police and fire protection education and social services for the poor and elderly the presidents proposals for housing programs clearly illustrate that once again this administration is attempting to balance the budget on the backs cf working families the poor and the elderly first the presidents budget terminates virtually all existing federclly assisted housing programs in new york city we are faced with a housing crisis of dramatic proportions homelessness is on the rise many of those who have been fortunate enough to secure housing are paying as much as half of their income for rent thousands of families are forced to double up in crowded unsafe units with the streets being the only alternative new york and many other cities across the country lack an adequate supply of safe decent affordable housing the presidents proposal to wipe out most existing federal housing programs would make our serious housing problems much much worse second the presidents proposals to strictly limit eligibility for fha mortgage insurance while at the same time more than doubling the amount borrowers would have to pay at closing will kill the dream of homeownership for millions of young families seeking to purchase their first home finally the administrations budget does not meet the deficit target of 144 billion established under grammrudman which the president signed into law just 3 months ago the president overshoots the deficit target by more than 14 billion because the administration understates defense spending grammrudman requires the president to submit and the congress to adopt a budget that meets annual deficit targets established by that measure the president has failed to live up to his end of the bargain and abdicated his responsibility to submit to congress a realistic and workable budget that adequately reduces the federal deficit in fact for 6 straight years the president has failed to submit a balanced budget even though that was a central tenant of his 1980 campaign platform president reagans budget for fiscal year 1987 is a cruel and heartless proposal that ignores the vital and growing needs of our elderly and our less fortunate for our nations cities the presidents budget is a blueprint for disaster i urge my colleagues to join me in voting no on president reagans fiscal year 1987 budget proposal i look forward to working with the chairman of the house budget committee to develop a reasonable and compassionate deficit reduction plan that brings the bloated pentagon budget under control and protects vital domestic programs from the outrageous cuts proposed

period of some months in fact over a period of 12 to 18 months providing the sandinistas with more aid than we had given to somoza in the previous 20 years their reaction at that point was to use the money in building an army they expanded the army substantially they invited in the russians and the cubans during that same period they began to coalesce marxist power within the government at the
