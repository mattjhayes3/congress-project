antarctic ice shelf the size of rhode island just shattered and collapsed into the sea scientists say that they have never seen as large a loss of ice mass and that the disintegration was all the more remarkable because of the extraordinary rapidityof the collapse an ice mass 1 200 square miles in area and 650 feet thick that had existed for 12 000 years disintegrated in 35 days i bring this to my colleagues attention because the disintegration of the federal governments budget position over the last year has been neariy as staggering eight years of hardwon budgetary gains and fiscal discipline were thrown out the window in a single year last years projected tenyear budget surplus of 5 4 trillion dollars collapsed literally before our eyes sacrificed to the irresponsible tax and budget policies of the administration and the republican majority in congress just nine months ago the chairman of the budget committee said this congress will protect 100 percent of the social security and medicare trust funds period no speculation no supposition no projections this promise echoed similar pledges by the speaker the majority leader and the majority whip to place the social security and medicare surpluses in a lockbox and build a firewall between the social security and medicare trust funds and the rest of the budget well here we are twelve months later and 4 trillion poorer the lockbox has been smashed open the firewall has been breached the promises of the republican majority have been broken the budget before the house today raids social security and medicare this year it raids social secdrity and medicare next year it raids social security and medicare the year after that it raids social security and medicare for as far as the eye can see last years budget resolution placed our nations finances in a deep hole the budget before the house today digs the hole deeper it robs us of a chance to address critical needs like a real prescription drug benefit for seniors and adequate funding to modernize our kids schools and reduce class size the return of large multiyear budget deficits will also make it much more difficult to strengthen the social security and medicare programs in advance of the baby boom generations retirement which begins in 2008 when the leading edge of the baby boom enters their retirement years i urge the house to vote down this budget so we can begin work on a bipartisan budget resolution that meets our responsibilities restores our fiscal health and keeps faith with the promises all of us have made to the american people mrs meekof florida i rise in strong opposition to the republicans fatally flawed budget resolution here we go again the republican resolution is simply smoke and mirrors its a pretend budget so deceptive that if it were an ad the public would suq for violations of the truth in advertising laws and they would win not even the transparent ploy of using fiveyear budget estimates from the presidents office of management and budget rather than the usual tenyear budget estimates from the nonpartisan congressional budget office can hid the fact that the republican budget resolution would raid virtually all of the social security and medicare surpluses over the next five years in order to pay for the fiscal chaos caused by last years irresponsible tax bill five times last year here in the house we voted almost unanimously for a social security lockbox the president and the republican leadership repeatedly pledged their commitment to that social security lockbox in this budget the republicans dont just pick the lockbox they shatter it with a sledge hammer dont be fooled when you get rid of the accounting smoke and mirrors in the presidents budget the nondefense domestic spending is not even a current services budget this budget is replete with severe program cuts cuts that low income americans simply cannot take we are left with much less than we had to begin with where is the money for a real prescription drug benefit for affordable housing for head start for education for job training for worker health and safety thedeceptive pretend republican budget ignores the cost of the supplemental that will be offered as soon as this budget resolution leaves the house it ignores the cost of providing relief to millions of middle class taxpayers to keep them from being subjected to the alternative minimum tax it ignores the cost of the republican proposal to make permanent the tax cuts from last years bill it provides woefully inadequate resources for a prescription drug benefit and makes any prescription drug benefit compete with both the cost of provider givebacks and the costs of unspecified medicare modernization we need a budget that provides a real prescription drug benefit improves education ensures the solvency of social security and medicare and pays down the national debt we need an honest budget not this sham republican press release securing our national

predicament months before the impact of september 1th was realized in the budget unitedstates treasury secretary paul oneill asked congress to raise the debt limit by 750 million in response to deepening deficits that resulted primarily from the presidents tax cut by the administrations own estimates last years tax cutthe one that i cautioned left no room for error is responsible for 43 percent of the total deterioration in our fiscal picture so here we are today being told by the majority that if we vote against s 2578 we are being irresponsible well isnt that the pot calling the kettle black under their watch our budget experienced the most dramatic reversal in history losing 4 trillion in projected surpluses in one year to my mind permanently raising the debt ceiling in the absence of a plan to get us back to surpluses is the epitome of fiscal irresponsibility last year the majoritys budget asserted that there would be no need to increase the debt limit until 2009 but here we are poised to consider legislation raising the debt ceiling to 6 4 trillion without being given a chance to offer a plan it is disgraceful that the majority has decided to block debate on a credible plan to address the shortterm crisis and undo our present fiscal mess my democratic colleagues representatives spratt and moore sought to offer a measure that would immediately increase debt limit by 150 billion with the requirement that the president submit a revised budget that is in balance by 2007 without borrowing from social security regrettably this reasonable alternative never saw the light of day i am simply unwilling to write the federal government a virtual blank check that may or may not keep us in the black until the midterm elections in november every day americans pay 1 billion in interest on our national debt thats about 16 cents of every dollar they pay in taxesjust to make the interest payment not even to pay down the debt itself moreover the indirect costs of raising the debt limit and the return to deficits prevent longterm interest rates high for americans struggling to make mortgage car or credit card payments even as the federal reserve has dramatically reduced short term rates i urge my colleagues to join me in rejecting this measure and forcing the republican leadership to work with the minority to develop a real plan to deal with the

for our daughters and granddaughters as it was for our mothers and us the last 100 years have seen women make important advancements in the area of public service notonly did our predecessors gain the right to vote but in recent years we have been considered a decidedly important voting block we now have more women serving in the house and the senate than ever before 61 women in the house and 13 in the senate i think we will keep seeing these numbers increase we have women serving as supreme court justices governors attorneys general and in many other elected offices but we still have a long way to go for all the accomplishments that women have achieved in the 20th century we should not be complacent we still have a lot to do one of the areas where females have made important strides is in the area of education women currently make up over 50 percent of college freshmen in the country to think that in 1872 over 100 years ago only 97 educational institutions even accepted women the national center for education statistics report that females are now doing as well or better than males on factors measuring educational attainment nevertheless women continue to trail their male counterparts in the areas of mathematics anfd science this is something that i hope through my position on the house committee on science to help rectify what is more women are still underrepresented in doctoral and first professional degree programs although as the ncec points out women have made substantial gains in these areas during the last 25 years there are other areas of education where improvements need to be made most notably in the area of school access for socalled disadvantaged students a group of disadvantaged students whose needs are often overlooked are homeless children homeless children face unique problems when attempting to access a quality education some schools do not allow homeless children to register for classes without school or medical records others will not enroll children without a home address and there is nobody in the schools whose job it is to help them as a result homeless children wait days and even weeks just to get into the classroom obviously this has serious and negative consequences for their educational advantages some may be wondering why i am talking about homeless children during this recognition of the achievements of women well it is because as data shows educating homeless children is a womens issue according to a federal study released in 1999 84 percent of parents or guardians of homeless children are femaje the average homeless family is composed of a single mother in her twenties and two children under the age of 6 single mothers are vulnerable to homelessness because of the high cost of housing for families the high cost of child care and lack of housing assistance we must work together as women as leaders in our community and as public servants to find answers to the destructive cycles caused by homelessness and poverty that is why i have introduced h r 623 the mckinneyvento homeless education act of 2001 this bill will ensure that all homeless children are guaranteed access to public education so that they can acquire the skills needed to escape poverty and lead healthy and productive lives it will also strengthen the parental rights at a time when mothers of homeless children find themselves most vulnerable it will help homeless mothers pay for school supplies and other emergency items that children need to participate in school such as clothes eyeglasses and hygiene products many mothers have expressed gratitude through letters and cards for these items which they could not otherwise afford at such a difficult point in their lives working hard now to ensure a brighter future for all americans is something that we as women learn the importance of during our struggle to gain equality in the 20th century during the month of march it is fitting that women take time to reflect back upon and celebrate our collective accomplishments over the last 100 years we must use every opportunity to show how we are going to use the lessons learned in yesteryears battles to eliminate illiteracy increase educational opportunity for all and promote high academic achievements if we do so that would give women 100 years from now something to crow about"],

was a helicopter crew chief and gunner with the 1st cavalry division of the army during the vietnam war he volunteered for the army when he was just 19 years of age and specifically requested that he join his countrys soldiers in vietnam gary quickly earned the deepest respect of his fellow crewmen for the patriotism that he showed as he went into battle and the courage with which he fought gary won his first medal on his first mission and he continued to serve in this courageous and honorable way until his death gary mckiddy had a reputation among his fellow men for rising to any challenge and putting loyalty and honor at the heart of his service one man who served alongside gary once called him a credit to his ccuntry and one of the finest men he had ever met and served with in the army prior to his death he was awarded the air medal the army commendation medal with oak leaf cluster for heroism the national defense service medal the vietnam service medal the aircraft crewman badge and the marksman badge for his many heroic actions yet his most courageous act came in cambodia on may 6 1970 when his helicopter came under intense enemy fire receiving several damaging hits

the most compelling humanitarian and moral challenges facing us today i speak of the hiv aids pandemic a crisis unparalleled in modern times and one that threatens the entire world embracing developed and developing countries alike the statistics are chilling over 22 million people have already died of aids throughout the world more than 3 million died last year alone that is over 8 000 deaths each day or nearly one death every 6 minutes what is most alarming is that the number of infections and deaths is growing and the pandemic is quickly spreading from subsaharan africa to india china and russia an incredible 36 million people are already infected with hiv and 15 000 new infections occur every day to illustrate the magnitude of the crisis it is estimated that by the year 2010 over 80 million people may have died from aids by comparison that is more than all the military and civilian deaths resulting from world war ii if the disease is left unchecked we have no idea what the statistics will be in 2015 or 2020 less than 20 years from today the most dramatic increase in infection rates is in the developing world where education awareness and access to health care is most seriously lacking as is too often the case it is the children who suffer most millions are born hivinfected even though mothertochild transmission is easily avoided if adequate training and health care is provided to this is added a widespread mortality among parents by the end of the decade 40 million children are likely to be orphaned as a consequence of aids the impact on developing societies socially politically and economically is incalculable and threatens the stability of many countries and societies around the globe contrary to popular conceptions the pandemic is not limited to africa where aids continues to sweep forward virtually unchecked the disease has jumped to every continent in europe last year russia had the highest rate of increase of new cases of any country on the planet that impoverished countrys medical system is clearly unable to adequately cope with the challenge ensuring that it will continue to spread according to the national intelligence council india is on the verge of a catastrophic aids epidemic closer to home the caribbean region has the second highest rate of hiv infections in the world the most appropriate comparison of this everwidening thireat is with the 14th century when the plague repeatedly swept through europe killing a quarter of that continents population leaving no country untouched and decimating entire regions this time however it is the entire world that is at risk if the world is to have a chance of prevailing against this disease the united states must take a leading role in the efforts to combat it to do so we must advance along many fronts both bilateral and multilateral the bill we consider today h r 2069 addresses both the bilateral and multilateral pillars of our response to the aids crisis h r 2069 builds upon existing efforts by authorizing the agency for international development to carry out a comprehensive program of hiv aids prevention education and treatment at a level of 485 million during fiscal year 2002 moreover h r 2069 authorizes an additional 50 million pilot program to provide treatment for those infected with hiv aids by helping the public and private sectors of developing countries procure hiv aids pharmaceuticals and antiviral therapies the novel bilateral treatment program that my bill authorizes is vitally important for it gives hope to those already suffering from aids by authorizing a pilot treatment program we can work to extend the productive lives of those infected by the virus this is not only the right thing to do it has beneficial impact on treatment as well without some expectation of care the poor have little reason to be tested for aids or to seek help i am fully cognizant of the challenge posed by treatment programs in developing countries however it is my hope that successful treatment programs such as those carried out by the aids healthcare foundation will be replicated in developing countries there simply is no option other than treatment if we are ever to stem the tide of this pandemic through our bilateral efforts the united states will demonstrate its commitment to address all facets of the hiv aids challenge and thereby challenge the entire developed world to emulate the example of the united states it is also my hope that faithbased organizations such as catholic relief services will play a very significant and meaningful role in advising usaid on the most effective approaches to combat the hiv aids pandemic in addition to our bilateral efforts the president has already signaled our nations intention to lead the multilateral campaign by committing at least 200 million to combat hiv aids through a global aids war chest that will be designed and implemented in the months to come the global access to hiv aids pre vention awareness education and treatment act of 2001 also authorizes the president to contribute to multilateral efforts to combat hiv aids at a lvel that the administration deems appropriate and at such time as a fund is established and criteria developed to ensure its sound management america will contribute its fair share as we work to leverage additional funds for this effort from other developed countries by providing the president with this flexibility we can ensure that the contributions made by the united states will be adequate and also yield the commitments from other countries to make this effort a truly global war on aids as with any problem however financial resources cannot serve as the sole answer and the generosity of the american people must be well managed we must provide resources at a pace at which these can be absorbed and used wisely we must continue to encourage and support those faithbased organizations and churches that are on the front lines in the effort to educate the poor about hiv and aids and treatment and prevention we must also insist that any program designed to combat the aids pandemic include abstinence as a core component in closing i wish to thank the many members and staff who have contributed to the passage of this landmark legislation i am especially grateful to the gentleman from

will be sorely missed i wish to reiterate what i think is a consensus in congress simply stated the aids virus is one of the great moral challenges of our era it is a scourge of unparalleled proportions in modern times every citizen has a stake in preventing what otherwise might well become the bubonic plague of the 21st century we must do all that lies in our power to do if we are to meet this threat first of all by reaching out now to those most in need it is not only the most sensible thing to do it is the right thing to do for our children our country and for the world i urge

increased minority recruitment by the intelligence community in an effort to fill some of that communitys gaps in language and analytical skills the second amendment facilitates congressional oversight of that process the amendment i am offering at the current moment instructs the director of central intelligence to issue an annual report to congress on the hiring and retention of minorities by the intelligence community such a report will allow this body to monitor the progress of the intelligence communitys efforts to recruit and retain minorities like my previous amendment and the underlying bills this amendment is noncontroversial after all intelligence agencies have been providing reports on minority hiring and retention to the house permanent select committee on intelligence since the early 1990s my amendment simply makes the unclassified versions of those reports available to the larger congress likewise this amendment does not in any way jeopardize our national security by revealing the number of individuals working at our various intelligence agencies figures published in the report would be percentages not absolute numbers this provision is in keeping with current guidelines for maintaining the integrity of classified information let me reiterate minority recruitment is critical to the maintenance of our national security congress has a role in the maintenance of our intelligence infrastructure that role is to provide effective oversight this amendment will allow myself and my colleagues in this body to do just that i urge my colleagues to support my amendment it was just 3 years ago that the director of central intelligence george tenet stated and i quote to combat the threats our country will be facing in the decades ahead we will need collectors from diverse ethnic backgrounds and with a wide range of expertise who can think and communicate like our targets and pierce their human and technical networks we will also need analysts whose deep knowledge of other societies cultures and languages can bring important perspectives to intelligence assessments at the time that mr tenet made this statement only 11 percent of the case officers at the cia were racial or ethnic minorities tragically that number has barely changed in the intervening years realize this country is attempting to gather information on a world which is 50 percent nonwhite with an intelligence apparatus that is barely 11 percent nonwhite how can we expect to understand them if we do not talk like them how can we expect to infiltrate them if we do not look like them and what has the intelligence communitys failure to recruit and retain minorities brought us today there are large areas of this globe where the united states is unable to collect intelligence for want of agents who possess the requisite cultural literacy and language skills at the fbi cia and nsa untranslated tapes of wiretapped conversations pile up awaiting analysts with the proper language skills to translate them right now as we sit here in this chamber the intelligence operation in guantanamo bay is bogged down by a lack of translators this sorry state of affairs must not be allowed to persist my amendment expresses the sense of congress that the directors of the cia dia nima and the nsa use every means at their disposal to make minority recruitment and retention a priority in their hiring decisions the cia dia nsa and nima all have undergraduate training programs a minority scholarship program introduced by former chairman of the house permanent select committee on intelligence louis stokes in 1987 my amendment urges the directors of these agencies to use this existing program to increase minority recruitment make no mistake

will cause severe disruptions in the plant configuration for production line models over the next five years this will force automakers to shut down certain lines close plants lay off workers and harm
