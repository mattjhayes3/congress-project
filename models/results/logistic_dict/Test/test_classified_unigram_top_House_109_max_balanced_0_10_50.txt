of the budget resolution both the bush and republican budgets suffer from the same infirmities fiscal irresponsibility and selfserving and outoftouch priorities both are wholly inadequate to meet the needs of our nation and will pass along mounting deficits and debts to generations yet unborn first the 5year republican budget will result in a deficit of 376 billion in 2006 44 million over the presidents projection the republicans budget proposal also has many cost omissions because they know that their deficit numbers explode after 5 years as such this budget does not take into account the cost of fixing the amt which will cost at least 642 billion it does not take into account the 774 billion needed to pay for the presidents muchtalked about but yet unveiled social security privatization plan i suppose the republican budget proposal deserves a little credit for hiking its deficit projection as it at least includes 50 million in 2006 for the wars in afghanistan and in iraq the presidents budget proposal contained zero dollars as a matter of fact it reported that the costs could not be known however both figures are fantasy the realistic figure over the next 10 years in addition to the 80 billion that we just passed in the supplemental is likely to be 384 billion to pay for its misguided policies the house budget resolution cuts nondefense discretionary spending by 12 billion below the amount needed in fiscal 2006 just to maintain current spending levels and it cuts spending on mandatory domestic programs by 8 billion to add insult to injury the republican budget provides 18 billion in additional tax cuts these misguided tax cuts will actually cost much more when the tax cuts actually expire in 2010 in fact 97 percent of these tax cuts will benefit taxpayers with incomes above 200 000 i think most reasonable people can agree that these priorities are not americas priorities while little good can be said about the bush administrations budget it at least provides detailed information on the programs it seeks to cut the house resolution shrouds its cuts in darkness leaving the american people to wonder what vital programs will find their way to the ch6ppinig block next both the republican and bush budget proposals are travesties when the bush administration took office the nation was experiencing record surpluses it has managed to turn a 521 billion surplus into a 367 billion deficit in contrast the spratt alternative budget as well as the congressional black caucus alternative budget that we will consider tomorrow focus national spending on priorities that benefit all americans and get us on the road to economic recovery they do this by funding key domestic priorities which address the needs of working families while fully supporting the national defense and protection of our homeland and preserving medicaid social security pension programs and student loans let me speak particularly about the budget developed by the congressional black caucus which corrects the irresponsible fiscal and economic policies contained in the house budget resolution by supporting existing programs that are essential to closing disparities creating opportunities and helping our citizens build their future it will get our country on the road to recovery while funding meaningful national priorities for our children for our seniors for our veterans and for our communities importantly the congressional black caucus budget supports these priorities while also meeting our obligation to our troops in iraq and in afghanistan the cbc budget funds community development programs including restoring funding to the community development block grant program and supporting increased funding for elderly and disabled housing programs the congressional black caucus budget will also restore funding for veterans health care rather than imposing new copayments on them for essential services and prescription drugs importantly the congressional black caucus budget will reduce the budget deficit by 167 billion during the next 5 years below the deficit that will be produced by the house budget resolution theirepublican budget cuts educational housing and health programs for our children while bequeathing to them a public debt that has increased by 1 268 trillion over the last 4 years and that will exceed 4 6 trillion even before we begin fiscal year these actions are not only irresponsible they are unconscionable in the end one can only conclude that the republican budget balances itself on the backs of americans who can least afford it i urge the administration to reconsider its illconceived economic policies the congressional black caucus budget is the ultimate expression of our national priorities and our priorities must be our children our families our elderly and our veterans and of course our soldiers"], [0.0004826784133911133, 0.9995173215866089, 1, "mr ryan i think and also mrs tubbs jones i think it is important that we look at this issue of the irresponsibility of the republican majority they are being very irresponsible and to say that that is fine we will give you what you want of course i think we are going to see more of that kind of action by the republican majority to say that oh we are with you even if we are running the country into the ground we know better we know that we have foreign countries that we are borrowing from because we cant even borrow from ourselves anymore because we have done such a bad job we know we have raised the debt ceiling time after time after time again meanwhile we come to the floor and say our policies are working we know that there are things we should not be doing because you are working every day or you are running your business eyery day you may not be paying attention to everything that is going on not only are we elected but we are paid to watch out for your best interest and also for future generations best interests and they are doing it and i think that the paradigm shift as it relates to the american people paying attention to what they are doing in a way from a fiscal way i think will take place between now and november and so what is so unfortunate abqut this whole situation is that we are supposed to be responsible policymakers on a bipartisan basis and that is not happening right now that is just not happening the american taxpayers are getting mugged knocked down and kicked by this republican majority and the rubber stamp or the rubberstamp congress republican majority that is here now one other thing i want to mention here which i think is very very important just today mr ryan mrs tubbs jones we dont have to go back to weeks or months or 2 years ago or 3 years ago we had a payasyougo provision here individuals decided not to take it up we had an opportunity to raise the minimum wage on behalf of the american taxpayers the republican majority rejected an opportunity to raise the minimum wage for everyday working americans as a matter of fact mr ryan one of the republican leaders said i havent voted in 25 years to raise the minimum wage and if he would have had his way the minimum wage would still be 3 35 versus 5 15 i am so glad that my state joined 21 other states in raising the minimum wage meanwhile we are still here with chisel and hammer in hand as neanderthals on the republican side of the ball and saying oh we dont have to raise the minimum wage we are so indebted to the special interests that we dont even want to bother them of having an american public that is able to pay the rent or pay for their house mortgage or to be able to put gas in their tank we are so invested in the k street project we are so invested in so many other things that we are willing to allow these individuals to suffer but guess what those are the same individuals that are making america america and there are millions of americans that are there and so what is very very unfortunate here is the fact that the republican majority is still boasting about you know we are in charge we are going to continue to keep our foot on the necks of everyday americans that are going in punching in and punching out every day 5 days a week sometimes 6 because they have to work overtime those americans that know what it means to take a 15minute break in the morning and a 15minute break in the afternoon and a solid 30 minutes of lunch if they get that and they better not be a minute late those kind of individuals i think are going to go to the polls this november and say no more they are going to go to the polls and say we are willing to fight for the kind of accountability that we need from this government i am so proud of the 30something working group and the members that come down here and the democratic members that file legislation on behalf of the american people not on behalf of the democratic party not even on behalf of the democratic caucus not on behalf of our leadership but on behalf of the individuals that they represent who woke up early one tuesday morning and voted for representation in this unitedstates house of representatives and i must add the only chamber that you have to be elected to that you cant be appointed to al due respect to the senate but senators can be appointed by governors if a senator was to say hey you know i have had enough i want to go home i want to take care of my grandkids a governor can appoint a senator but in democracy in this chamber in the unitedstates house if one member were to say hey i want to take care of my grandkids i want to spend more time with my kids they have to run for office they have to run for office and they have to be replaced by the people so we have a greater responsibility we have a greater responsibility than the white house than the senate or the supreme court when you look at the three branches government to the american people the oversight house resolution 841 and mr cardozas legislation that calls for the calling in those administrators that are not accountable to taxpayers dollars these are the kind of bills that we must pass one thing i can say mr ryan which is so very important on our side of the ball of saying we want to take this country in a new direction is the fact that we said we will increase the minimum wage we will make our country more energyindependent within 10 years we will implement the 9 11 recommendations to be able to make sure that we can fight terrorism here and make sure that local communities have what they need these are not if or if we

entire democratic leadership mr hoyer mr menendez and mr clyburn our vice chair of the democratic caucus as you know the 30something working group comes to the floor to share not only with members but also with the american people about what is happening good here in the capitol and also what is happening bad here in the capitol and hopefully through a bipartisan effort we can move towards positive change here in the capitol it saddens me to report the fact that this congress need it be whatever poll you look at the american people by 33 percent think that we are doing a good job thirtythree percent of the american people feel that this congress is doing a good job i would tell you that if it was a grade system i would assume that and members i would assume that that would be a failing grade i have two children that attend school and if their grades were based on a 33 percent performance i do not think that they would be moving to the next grade and i think it is important members of congress as we start to look at our responsibilities to the american people not just to our constituents in our districts but to the american people because by them sending us to congress they federalized us to come up here and run this country in the way that it should be i also want to remind the members that this is the peoples house it is not my house it is not mr ryans house it is not ms wasserman schultzs house all due respect it is not your house it is the peoples house in the senate i must add and we must let all of the members we must remind them in the senate someone can be appointed to the senate of course they have elections but in a time let us just say like in new jersey the governor of new jersey the new governor of new jersey has the opportunity who was a unitedstates senator to appoint someone to be the new unitedstates senator from the state of new jersey but in the house with a seat being vacated let us just say someone from new jersey is appointed to be the senator he cannot appoint someone here to the house of representatives he would have to set a special election for that seat to be filled constitutionally so this is the peoples house and so when we start talking about the people of the united states of america we are closer to them than any other i think than any other branch of government i would like to say that on the heels of president bushs speech today on iraqs economy i could not help and mr ryan and i just returned from iraq we visited three cities in iraq and we went to the infamous green zone and baghdad visiting our troops many of them were members of the army soldiers some on their third deployment to iraq i could not help but pay attention and i got a copy of the presidents h11199 speech and he released a 35page 32 pages if you look at glossy cover and all 35 pages of his strategy for victory there in iraq but he talked about the economy today in iraq but i cannot help but say and to the members that it would have been good if the president could have talked about our unitedstates economy i think the reason why he did not talk about the unitedstates economy is the fact that we have record deficits some 3 5 trillion over the next 10 years deficits that is not the kendrick meek report that is not the tim ryan report that is not the congresswoman debbie wasserman schultz report that is reality we are recordbreaking as it relates to borrowing money members from foreign countries this president along with this republican majority here in the house and in the senate has achieved 4 5 trillion in borrowing money from foreign nations more than 42 presidents before him they were only able to among all of those presidents i mean all of them i am talking about since we became a country 4 1 trillion that have been achieved and i want to correct myself i am sorry i have so many numbers here i want to correct myself i am glad mr ryan brought this over 1 05 trillion by this president i said four and i will correct myself right now because in the 30something working group we believe in thirdparty validators and sharing with the american people and the members the truth about what is happening here in the capitol so maybe 4 05 might have sounded a little better but we believe in making sure that we give good information 1 05 trillion this president the last 4 years 2001 to 2005 and he is not done yet 1 01 trillion 42 presidents in the history of this country republican democrat and in their lifetime for some of them very early on were members of the whig party from 1776 to 2000 224 years and this is from the unitedstates department of treasury this is not from the national democratic party or anything like that we just want to make sure mr ryan that we have our thirdparty validators here maybe the president mr ryan could have talked abouit the fact that health care costs increased over 60 percent for small businesses over the last 5 years major companies are cutting jobs and not only their pension plan that they promised but they are following our lead here under this republican majority mr ryan by the fact that we are not only increasing copayments and the wait for our veterans once they leave the military they are following our lead companies like gm delphi merck verizon and now ford are now reprioritizing that means cutting jobs that means cutting back on promises that they promised their employees from the beginning the average family right now in the united states as relates to natural gas are paying three times more than they paid in 2001 the president could have talked about that but he did not he wanted to talk about iraq because he needs to explain himself republican majority they need to explain themselves sixty percent of americans if we like it or not do not believe that our leadership as relates to leading our effort in iraq has a sound plan in getting us out of there so we are going to talk about some of these things tonight we are going to also talk about this ongoing culture of corruption andc cronyism and incompetence this is not the kendrick meek report this is just todays papers this is just today that is outlining a culture of corruption and cronyism and incompetence so when historians look back on the 109th congress and the contributions that we made they are also going to look at the void in leadership and leading this country in the way that they should lead we used to give speeches here on the floor mr ryan and you know full well about putting burden on future generations fl 2015 well i can tell the members right now and this is not me speaking they can check with any of the federal agencies that do the reports or the auditor generals that put out reports on an annual basis we are putting this generation in the present in jeopardy so i am so glad that we have the opportunity tonight to come to the floor and i am so glad that the gentleman from ohio is here and i am glad that we

honest leadership but the plot involves lies and coverups the problem is misplaced priorities but the solution is not this supplemental which provides another 67 6 billion for a failed war but only 19 billion to help the victims of katrina the first disaster the iraq war was predicated on lies iraq had no weapons of mass destruction had never attempted to buy uranium from niger and was not about to welcome american soldiers with open arms an incompetent president failed to prepare america for the postwar period as a result looting of stores and museums began shortly after the united states military gained control of baghdad months later sectarian violence has pushed iraq to civil war with shiite militia and security forces clashing with sunni citizens and insurgents yet our troops remain in iraq and in harms way two american soldiers and 40 iraqi soldiers and civilians are killed every day as long as we stay in iraq the insurgency will continue even as the socalled iraqi democracy experiment goes nowhere three months after parliamentary elections the iraqi parliament has yet to form a government finally large republican donors including halliburton have looted the american treasury using their connections to secure nobid contracts for services in iraq these firms overcharge american taxpayers and underserve our troops all the while republicans blind allegiance to the president causes them to write blank checks throwing good money after bad at a war that is making america less secure the second disaster was the republican response to hurricane katrina several days before katrina ravaged the gulf coast the president was briefed on the severity of the storm and the likelihood levees would be breached but after failing to cut short his extended vacation to help with the response the president told abc news and the american public he was not advised the levees were likely to collapse after years of underfunding levee construction and mairtenance republicans attempted to shift the blame for the disaster and the inadequate response onto state and local officials but it was president bush who nominated unqualified campaign hacks to head fema and congressional republicans who rubberstamped the appointment of michael brown as a result of insufficient preparation and incompetent administration tens of thousands of hurricane victims went without adequate food water and shelter in the storms aftermath six months after katrina relief workers are still finding bodies of victims in an attempt to atone for their sins the republicans have finally brought forth additional legislation to help katrina victims but in a pathetic and transparent attempt to prevent full debate on the disastrous iraq war president bushs republican cronies in congress combined two supplementals into one although i support additional funding for hurricane victims i cannot vote for a supplemental that appropriates 74 percent of its funds or 67 6 billion to a misguided iraq war on which we have already wasted 350 billionand the lives of 2 310 american soldiers and at least 37 000 iraqi citizens it is time to tell a new tale about bringing home our

states that to me does not appear to take us into the rest of the century in terms of dealing with our energy needs what we should be doing is uniting as members of congress representing this country and dealing with our longterm energy crisis by exploring alternative energy sources not going to the same old energy sources and trying to drill our way out of this problem drilling is not the solution there is far too much environmental risk to drilling whether we are drilling for natural gas or drilling for oil and the proposal that we will be considering that is attached to the budget reconciliation bill the budgetcut document that we will be considering at the earliest next week includes a terrible proposal that would expand drilling off the coastline of florida and bring drilling within 125 miles of floridas coast on the gulf that is a totally inappropriate proposal it makes absolutely no sense it would jeopardize our environment and i am hopeful that my colleagues from florida and other colleagues who represent coastal communities which will also be in jeopardy if this provision passes will join us in opposing this budget reconciliation bill not the least of which because there are many other reasons why it should be opposed because of the dire cuts that are in the budget that are going to rain terror down on americans across this country but to add insult to injury it also has a terrible provision in it that would allow drilling off the coastline around our entire country so with that having been said i want to talk a little bit about what we talked about in the previous hour and turn the conversation back to the budget reconciliation bill there are a number of significant problems with the budget cuts that the republican leadership is proposing but one of the things that i wanted to turn to is what democrats think we should be doing in terms of the budget democrats want to bring the budget back into balance what we proposed in the budget committee today included a proposal that would bring the budget back into balance by 2012 the democratic budget also has a smaller deficit than the republican budget every year and would accumulate less debt and waste fewer resources on interest payments that are needed to service the national debt we would include budget enforcement measures to protect social security we would do more for education the democratic proposal provides 4 5 billion more for appropriated education and training programs than the republican budget for 2006 and 41 billion more over the next 5 years we also reject the 21 billion in cuts that the republican budget requires the education and workforce committee to make over the next 5 years those are cuts that could fall on students loans and school lunches these are not the same old tired complaints it is insulting to suggest that cutting school lunches and financial aid are tired complaints if one is struggling to be able to give their children breakfast and lunch on a daily basis and make sure that they are provided with nutrition and they do not financially have the ability to ensure that they can do it themselves staring down budget cuts that take that opportunity away from them is nothing short of cowardly this is a cowardly budget reconciliation bill it does not show any guts at all and it abandons the american people let us talk about housing in the previous hour we talked a little bit about the housing cuts that this budgetcut bill would hand down and i am joined by my good and close friend whom i had an opportunity to serve with in now three different chambers the gentlemanfrom florida his district and my district were hit badly by a category 3 storm last week hurricane wilma and we were talking in the last hour about housing and the issues related to affordable housing that our constituents were already facing i want to just point out this picture here over the weekend i had an opportunity to go door to door in my district because there are so many senior citizens trapped in their homes without power we still have half a million people who do not have power in south florida and unfortunately whether it is because of hurricane fatigue or just the fact that there was so much damage in the gulf coast region that it may be difficult to feel the pain that we are going through in south florida and understand it but there is not nearly as much attention as we need focused on what happened in south florida when i was going to door to door in my district to try to help some of the folks who have trouble getting out of their houses and i am talking about people who are in their 80s and 90s one of the apartments that the building captain in the condominium brought me into included this kind of damage this is the result of hurricane wilma and this is just one example there are hundreds and hundreds of condominium units and apartment buildings and homes and mobile homes that look just like this there is a perception whether it was created by the media or created by the lack of attention by the national media on what happened with hurricane wilma that everything is fine in south florida everything is not fine in south florida this is the third floor apartment and that is the ceiling of the apartment and as we can see we can look right through the ceiling at the sky this is this womans master bedroom and literally during the storm 1 minute after she walked out of that master bedroom the roof caved in on her bed a minute earlier and it would have caved in on her when we talk about the affordable housing problem that we already had now we have thousands of people in south florida whose homes have been condemned who are faced with nowhere to go because the average price of a house just in broward is 348 000 a year the rental units the monthly rent is sky high and fema has literally only 300 inspectors in our state going through these homes to determine whether these people are goingto qualify for assistance i yield to the gentleman from florida"], [0.9756329394876957, 0.024367060512304306, 1, "i rise today to mark the fourth anniversary of the september 11 2001

being on the scene every day all day so much has gone into getting this agreement we must do everything to make sure that it lasts it is also important as we look forward that we do not forget the tragedy still unfolding in sudan as i speak women continue to be raped children die from hunger and disease men continue to be murdered by the governmentsponsored janjaweed and new attacks continue to be launched against defenseless villages many of these people have been huddled in camps for over a year put yourself in their shoes for a minute you are uprooted from your home you live in a refugee camp where conditions are terrible you do not know if your family members are dead or alive you are sick weak watching people die all around you from hunger and disease now picture you have been there for over a year the tsunami in south asia demonstrates how quickly and effectively the world can respond to such terrible disasters once again we are reminded that the world has failed the people of darfur i commend the quick and generous response to the tsunami but we must not only focus on disasters as they occur but also to respond to disasters like in darfur that have gone on for decades the peace agreement between the north and south opens new doors for a comprehensive peace throughout the country and dr john garang who will now be vice president of sudan has an opportunity to play a positive role and should go to darfur to help bring about peace i have strongly supported the united states commitment to the united nations since i became chairman of the subcommittee on commerce justice state judiciary and related agencies of the committee on appropriations all unitedstates assessments to the u n have been paid in full but over the past year we have seen the united nations fight an uphill battle on darfur resolution after resolution has failed to have any impact at least two security council members china and russia have threatened to veto strong resolutions from being passed secretary general kofi annan continues to report that the situation in darfur continues to deteriorate and the government of sudan has violated the previous security council resolutions by failing to disarm and prosecute the janjaweed ngos are leaving the region secretary general annan has sent a commission on inquiry to darfur to investigate if genocide has occurred and he has the report in his hands as i speak most people believe there is genocide but whether or not they use that term it still is horrible what is taking place and no matter what you call it the facts remain innocent civilians are systematically being murdered raped and displaced and the world has failed to stop it it is time for the united nations and the international community to respond in a meaningful way i ask secretary general annan to go to darfur to confirm with his own eyes that the situation has not improved then secretary general annan should make bold recommendations and call on the security council to immediately implement them because a strong meaningful resolution should be put forward and could make a difference it is now time for secretary general annan to use his strong moral leadership he is a nobel peace prize recipient and surely the security council would take his recommendations he should use his power and prestige to plead for the people of darfur and if the security council fails to take meaningful action secretary general annan should resign in protest i am not blaming kofi annan for darfur he does not control the security council but i ask him to use his leadership to demand a new course of action from them i believe these actions could turn the attention of the world back to what is taking place in darfur resigning under protest is an act of great moral leadership and this world would respect his actions great men in history have given up their posts to force change in 1973 at the height of the watergate scandal president nixon ordered attorney general elliott richardson to fire the special prosecutor he refused and resigned in protest and later got the presidential medal of freedom william wilberforce a member of the british parliament he could have been prime minister but spoke out to abolish the slave trade and gave up being prime minister of england anything kofi annan can do to get the world to focus on darfur would be greatly admired if in the year 2005 the security council cannot deal with genocide the raping of women and the systematic burning of villages now occurring then i believe it is fair to ask what purpose is the united nations serving in the 21st century i close by adding that just yesterday the new york times reported that villages continue to burn and that civilians are bearing the brunt of the violence in darfur just last week fresh attacks killed over 100 people and drove thousands more from their homes where is the international community something needs to be done now this past

freewheeling debate on the house floor so if you feel you want to move in on something go ahead and i will let you interrupt and you can let me interrupt and we will go like that lets talk about tax policy in the united states congress since i have been here we have passed two very meaningful tax bills we have passed the jobs and growth tax relief act in 2005 and we also passed the economic growth and tax relief act we have to look at where we were in my opinion where we were was we were post 9 11 we had a corporate scandal we were in the beginnings or in the middle of a recession in our economy and we were having difficulty pulling ourselves out for alot of different reasons with the leadership of the president we followed through in congress to pass those two tax relief acts i think i would like to go to the numbers and talk about some of the things that i think are significant in terms of the numbers and how it has influenced americans i always like to personalize everything to my state so i have gome state numbers as well for instance this year who will gain tax relief 111 million taxpayers will see their taxes decline by an average of 1 877 significant numbers five million total individuals and families will see income tax liabilities completely eliminated because we moved the tax the lowest tax bracket down to 10 percent fortyfour million families with children will receive an average tax cut of 2 493 that is because we have moved down significantly the child tax credit fourteen million elderly individuals will receive an average of 2 000 and 25 million small business owners will save an average of 3 641 so those are the numbers in terms of what could possibly be saving average savings through the tax relief but i think we need to look at where we are right now we have an economy that is moving in excess of 3 5 percent in gross national product we have created over the last several years 1 85 million jobs over the last 12 months alone and 5 4 million since augustof 1993 what i think this translates to is more small business owners having more money to create jobs to buy more equipment which creates more jobs i think we also have individuals who have more discretion over their own dollars they can say what they want to buy when they want to buy it because they have fewer federal taxes to pay i think that empowers them to consume more goods which then translates to more business to more jobs so i see it as an engine that is moving in the right direction i believe that the tax relief package and the tax cuts that we passed are a large part ofthat"], [0.9502106495201588, 0.04978935047984123, 1, "for his leadership on this and so many other issues i rise tonight in strong support of h res 575 a resolution that

this resolution and move it expeditiously to the floor mr cantor mr menendez ms roslehtinen mr mccaul and mr wexler the goal of this resolution is to send a strong and unambiguous message to abu mazen that hamas and the other terrorist groups should not be allowed to participate in the upcoming palestinian elections they should be prohibited from participating in the government and the p4lestinian authority should take affirmative steps to disarm and dismantle them when abu mazen was elected he pledged to root out terrorism and end corruption in the palestinian authority to say he hhs not lived

and do what he has promised to do that he will also be doing a tremendous disservice to the palestinian people the very first step of the road map to peace is not only the denunciation of terrorism that is the easy part it is the dismantling and the disarming of the terrorist infrastructure and terrorist organizations abu mazen has yet to take this essential first step no one disputes that hamas is a terrorist organization it has conducted numerous suicide bombings inside israel and is responsible for the death of countless innocent people hamas does not accept israels right to exist and has never accepted the peace process they this week announced i am sorry to say they vowed to end the truce they negotiated with israel and vowed it will end by the end of this year instead of striking out against hamas and instead of stepping up to the plate and disarming the terrorists and dismantling their terrorist organizations abu mazens latest strategy is to try to coopt them and bring the terrorist organization hamas into his government allowing terrorist organizations to participate in the election process will not see them wake up the day after the election embrace each other sing kumbaya and strive for peace and recognition of israel instead it will give them a dangerous foothold in the palestinian authority within which they can operate and further embolden those who support terrorism and the destruction of the state of israel hamas participatiofi in the election can only continue a longrunning cycle of violence and terror it undercuts the ability of the palestinian

rust if you had been there i would have presented you with this letter detailing what i think you have done to the taxpayers and to the people of south mississippi but since you were not there i am going to put it in you a copy but there are two things i want you to know you see when you didnt pay peoples wind claims in south mist sissippi you hurt them individually you hurt average joes like joe dee benvenutti who interestingly enough is also an insurance salesman or guys like mike chapoton who is a banker or dr leroy mcfarland who was my familys physician when i was a kid and now in his 70s has been denied over 1 million claim but you also denied guys like senator trent lott and unitedstates judge lou guirola it is one thing to tell a banker or a former corrugated box salesman that you cant read a policy but i think it is something else to tell a federal judge that he couldnt read his policy to tell a unitedstates senator with a law degree from the university of mississippi apparently he cant read his policy if they are doing that to the average joes i am sorry if they are doing that to the bigshots like unitedstates senators and federal judges then the question is what are they doing to grandmothers what are they doing to corrugated box salesman what are they doing to high school teachers who dont have a prayer and who have been told that their cases could take years to be heard mr rust you not only denied those people but in my opinion you also stole from the taxpayers let me walk the taxpayers through this flood insurance is paid through you the taxpayers it is heavily subsidized this year to the tune of over 20 billion according to the rigsby sisters your agents were instructed to walk on a piece of property and without looking at any of the evidence blame it all on the water it was all water offer to pay that water claim immediately and say we will get back to you on the wind knowing full well that an investigation would not take place on the wind policy and that the only check those people are going to get would be from the taxpayers you see that broke the law because under the false claims act when you ask your nation to pay a bill that it should not pay you are liable for triple damages and a 10 000perincident fine i think that is exactly what went on this house has passed language asking the inspector general of the homeland security department to look into that unfortunately the other body has not acted on that senator lott for his part has passed the funding for that investigation for 3 million but this house has not voted on that so in return for your behavior towards the people of south mississippi where over 1 000 south mississippi families feel like the only chance they have of any justice is to go to court i am going to try to do three things in my time remaining as a member of this house number one i am going to push for that investigation because i am confident in my heart that you stole from the taxpayers when you did that the second thing is i am going to work to remove your antitrust exemption i bet you it would surprise the average american to know that if the two hardware stores in town called each other up and said lets charge this much money for a gallon of paint if they were caught doing that they would go to jail but allstate can call state farm who can call nationwide who can call farm bureau and they can say this is how much we are going to charge for an insurance premium and this is what the benefit is going to be yes let us all play hardball and not pay any claims it is perfectly legal check my facts on that it is perfectly legal look at your own pay stub i would guarantee probably that at least the fourth biggest expenditure in every americanfamily is insurance do you want to know one reason why it is so expensive there is no real competition they are exempt from the antitrust laws no one should be above the laws i am going to work to take away that exemption third thing is i am going to work to pass an allperil policy so that the people of mississippi florida alabama or texas dont have to stay in their house with a video camera to record how their house was destroyed to get some justice out of you lastly i am going to work for federal legislation because you have picked the states apart you are picking on 50 little states 50 sets of rules you are taking advantage of the citizens of this country when you ought to be dealing with our nations government i submit for printing in letter from me to mr edward b rust ceo state farm insurance companies dated september 20 2006 house of representatives washington dc september 20 2006"], [0.0010516047477722168, 0.5010516047477722, 1, "i yield myself such time as i may consume h r 853 simply removes outdated restrictions on lands owned by mammoth county water district in california we have no objections to this noncontroversial bill"], [0.0010679960250854492, 0.5010679960250854, 1, "i too want to sing the praises of our capitol police and the sergeant at arms mr livingood for the expeditious manner in which the capitol was evacuated earlier today thank heavens it was not necessary better safe than sorry but i think that the evacuation took place with dignity in record time and with respect for all in the capitol not only the members of congress but very importantly the tourists who are here our visitors the press who covers us our employees who work here in the capitol and the office buildings and of course the capitol police thank you to the capitol police because of you americans or people visiting from overseas can come to this capitol because of your courage with the confidence that they will be safe because of you this evacuation was conducted in a manner of full cooperation from all who participated because of their confidence in you when you gave the signal everyone moved exactly the way you wanted them to i would also like to add my appreciation to our national security apparatus and all that that involves for having those airplanes in the air immediately to escort that cessna to another place we do not know the full story about it or i do not anyway yet but i do think that they are to be commended for the speed with which they made us safe this capitol is a symbol of freedom throughout the world and today i think that the balance between freedom and security was velldemonstrated and certainly that was because again of the professionalism as our colleague said and the courage of the capitol police mr livingood and our national security apparatus with that i know that the gentleman from illinois shares our views i do not know if he can even speak from the chair but i have heard the gentleman express his appreciation individually and personally to them too and i want to add my voice to that"]]}
