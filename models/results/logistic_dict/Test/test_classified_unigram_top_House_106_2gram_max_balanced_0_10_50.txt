district showed a definitive difference in the amount of monies paid by senior citizens for prescription drugs it was higher in the 18th congressional district in houston than in canada and in mexico we find that those who are 85 years old 40 percent of them do not even have the ability to pay for any drugs they have no benefit whatsoever and we must realize that seniors are living longer we also find that seniors are paying twice as much for their prescription drugs if they are medicare beneficiaries and they do not have that provision and so they are buying onethird less drugs what does that mean it means sicker seniors that is what it means these are individuals who have worked hard in our communities then we find the cost of our prescription drugs the amount of money our seniors pay is far more than any other health need that they have and this i would say to my colleagues begs for us to have a prescription drug benefit under the medicare provisions i do not know why it is so difficult this is something we should support i cannot go home and tell my seniors in the 18th congressional district that in the united states of america they cannot have a drug benefit but yet in mexico and canada prescription drugs are cheaper i would say it is time now to support this motion to instruct today i rise in support of the spratt motion to instruct the conferees on the budget resolution the spraft motion sets the stage for enacting a medicare prescription drug benefit or other legislation to improve medicare before the reporting date for a tax cut reconciliation bill by setting september 22 as the date for reporting a tax cut bill protected by reconciliation furthermore the spratt motion recedes to the senates slightly smaller tax cut and also recede to the senate by dropping the reserve fund language in the housepassed resolution that provides for an additional 50 billion in tax cuts while the republicans propose large tax cuts over the next 5 years and reconcile the finance and ways and means committees to report legislation republicans do not show the 10year cost of this tax cut which could be as large as the 792 billion that the republicans proposed and the american people rejected in 1999 moreover the republicans do not intend to strengthen or support medicare due to the fact that there are no reconciliation instructions to require legislation that would actually use the 40 billion reserve earmarked in the budget resolution in addition the republicans have cut nondefense appropriations while defense significantly increased for the third consecutive year republicans have chosen to provide large tax breaks for the wealthy this budget resolution provides at least 200 billion in tax breaks over the next 5 years for the financial elite of america furthermore this resolution is a major down payment for george w bushs proposed trilliondollar tax scheme i will not stand by while our childrens future is bankrupted to fund this irresponsible budget resolution this budget contains deep cuts in domestic spending by 114 billion over the next 5 years fails to provide anything to strengthen social security or medicare cuts nondefense discretionary spending by 19 7 billion in 2001 and 138 billion over the next 5 years below the level needed to maintain purchasing power after adjusting for inflation and pretends to reserve 40 billion for a medicare prescription drug benefit contingent upon essentially turning medicare into a voucher program republicans have used slight of hand to hide the facts of their irresponsible budget by showing the effects of proposed tax cuts for only the first 5 years and not the full 10year projections commonly used during the last 4 years i am disappointed in the budget resolution because i do not believe that it provides adequate investment in our nations future americas future depends on that of her young people in providing them adequate resources and opportunities to become our future leaders including providing them education and ac cess to adequate health care the budget resolution provides inadequate resources for the education of our young people i firmly believe that we must focus our attention and our energy on one of the most important challenges facing our country todayrevitalizing our education system strengthening education must be a top priority to raise the standard of living among american families and to prolong this era of american economic expansion education will prepare our nation for the challenges of the 21st century and i will fight to ensure that the necessary programs are adequately funded to ensure our childrens success we must provide our children access to superior education at all ages from kindergarten to graduate school recent studies emphasize the importance of quality education early in a childs future development and yet despite these studies the budget resolution still inadequately funds programs that would provide for programs targeting children in their younger years in addition we need to open the door of educational opportunity to all american children it is well known that increases in income are related to educational attainment the democratic budget alternative rejects the republican freeze on education funding and allocates 4 8 billion more for education for fiscal year 2001 than the republican budget over 5 years the democratic party demonstrates its commitment to education by proposing 21 billion more than the republican budget resolution the congressional black caucus offered an amendnient in the nature of a substitute that promised to invest for the future of our nation the cbc substitute is a budget that maximizes investment and opportunity for the poor africanamericans and other minorities this budget for maximum investment and opportunity supports a moderate plan to pay down the national debt protects social security and makes significant investments in education and training the cbc budget requests 88 8 billion in fiscal year 2001 for education training and development this is 32 billion more than the republican budget provides the cbc substitute proposed a 10 billion increase over the presidents budget for school construction other projected increases include additional funding for head start summer youth employment trio programs historically black colleges and universities and community technology centers in an age of unprecedented wealth the cbc has the vision to invest in the american family and not squander opportunities afforded by a budget surplus i will not support the failed policies of the past senator mccain has best characterized this budget resolution as one that is fiscally irresponsible i

very proud of the fact that the city of houston as my colleague says the fourth largest city in the country just does not do things like everybody else does we are a major city and a great city in this country because we do not just do it the same way we are the city that built the astrodome we are the city that has a port that is off the shores of texas and the second largest port in the nation we are a city that does not say that they are not a great city unless they have rail and the reason is and i might point out to my colleagues if they had been involved in all the rail systems as i have and the chairman has for over 15 years they would understand why l a is getting out of the rail business because it is a boondoggle and a black hole for a city that is spread out like l a i might say that houston has stepped outside of the box and developed a regional bus plan that is the model for major cities in america this bill has over 20 million in it finishing the last part of 500 million in building one of the best bus systems in the world because we did not grab ahold of the notion that in order to be a great city they have to have a rail system every line that the gentleman from texas talked about every one of those lines loses huge amounts of money and takes money away from mobility systems for those cities but they do get to take a picture of a nice train and put it in their brochures and it makes everybody feel good the problem here in this particular dispute is that the houston metro following the design of many other cities and the gentleman says no elections were held in those other cities it is because the other cities did not pay attention to the voters in those cities and developed the same strategy that is going on here in houston they developed the strategy of starting a little starter line and when it does not make money and becomes a huge hole for transit funds they go to the people and say we made this great investment but it does not work only because we do not have this other line and when that does not work they say well we are just going to build another line and then they wake up and develop what dallas now has dallas now has a rail line but now has surpassed houston in congestion because dallas is more concentrated on rail than they are for the mobility in dallas i do not want to see that happen in houston it is my responsibility as a member of this committee to make sure that the full funding grant by the fta the 500 million is finished what houston metro wanted to do is take money from the regional bus plan from our regional mobility plan and move it to a rail line that makes no sense whatsoever transportationwise my good colleague and friend the gentlewoman from texas says no criticism there is all kinds of criticism including houston metros own study that says this does not help mobility this does not help transportation and this does not help the environment this is an economic development project to build a signature main street in houston texas a very worthwhile project but this is not a transit system this will not carry anybody this will not get anybody off our freeways this will not get bubba i say to the gentleman from texas out of his pickup and put him on a rail system this is an economic development project my position is if they are going to build a huge rail system in the houston region then the people of the houston region ought to vote on it and decide whether they want a rail system or not instead of doing the back doorway that was done in dallas that was done in portland that was done in miami that was done in many other cities that i described there is no transit benefit here major transportation decisions like the proposal to build this system in houston

immediately saw the value in bringing this resolution to the floor last week three synagogues were burned in sacramento just a short distance away from my district unfortunately crimes and especially ones of hate and bigotry are nothing new in this day and age but for me this act of violence has hit way too close to home we now know especially after the events of world war ii that when a synagogue is burned not only is it an attack on the worshipers of that synagogue it is an attack on the decency and tolerance and the most basic of human rights when a criminal burns a synagogue or any place of worship he or she is directly assaulting our constitutions first amendment freedom of speech which directly protects our freedom of religion i appreciate the work that my colleagues the civic and religious leaders in our community including rabbi jason gwasdoff of temple israel in stockton and all that my constituents have done as a result of these particularly disturbing crimes they have truly come together as partners and peacemakers hatred is nurtured by indifference it is often said that the easiest way for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing and i firmly believe this to be true in light of all these senseless acts of hatred i call on all americans to rededicate themselves to the daily process of promoting peaceful coexistence and tolerance from the house of representatives to houses across this country to prevent crimes like these from happening again i submit for the record the comments given on the steps of the stockton city hall on june 22 1999 by rabbi jason gwasdoff of temple israel last friday i was awakened by the telephone at about 7 15 when the phone rings at that hour in my house it usually means that something is wrong that someone in my congregation has died or has been rushed to the hospital or that some bad thing has befallen a member of my own family the voice at the other end of the line was karma our temple administrator she told me briefly of the events that transpired in sacramento earlier that morning about the unbelievable news of three synagogues firebombed in the space of 45 minutes i turned on my television to catch the news and i saw a horrifying sight it was a synagogue building totally engulfed in flames a building i had visited just a few months ago while visiting a friend and colleague who leads that congregation as you can imagine i was shocked and dismayed by what i saw i felt a rush of emotion anger sadness disbelief no it was not the first time i have seen footage of synagogues in flames that scene unfortunately is far too familiar you see ive seen like many here im sure the documentaries on the holocaust and ive visited the museums and exhibits the history we know fifty years ago in europe almost all of the synagogues were burned a precursor to the extermination of twothirds of european jewry six million men women and childrenmurdered but this was different i was not watching documentary footage and these events were not 50 years a full continent and an ocean away this was happening right here and now just an hour away on our back doorstep in sacramento in this great state of california where i was born and raised in our country of freedom and democracy and pluralism the united states of america yes this sight of a synagogue in flames was very different indeed and it had an entirely different meaning when i went to my office later that morning the inevitable calls started coming in the local newspaper and television media asking for a statement members of my congregation who heard the news and wanted to talk or wondered aloud what we could do to help what i didnt expect or anticipate however was the calls and visits from fellow clergy from the interfaith community expressing their concern and support and outrage they wanted to make sure that i was o k and they wanted me to know that they cared it was a wonderful outpouring of love and fellowship a recognition that we are united in our mutual concern for one another and united on our zealousness to safeguard the values upon which our country is built three synagogues were burned in sacramento an hour away but the message i was hearing loud and clear is that we are all in this together antisemitism and bigotry of all kinds is nothing new but we know now especially after the events of wwi and after the events of these past few months in kosovo that when you burn a synagogue in sacramento you are not only attacking the jewish people you are attacking decency and tolerance and the most basic of human rights when you burn a synagogue you are attacking freedom of worship and freedom from fear freedom to raise our children to love god and to see gods face reflected in the faces of fellow human beings i am moved by the presence of my clergy colleagues here today and i thank you my christian and catholic and muslim friends and i am thankful for the presence of these community leaders and fellow citizens who have come out to these steps to stand together in solidarity to make a statement against hatred and intolerance it has no place in our community not in sacramento and not in stockton not anywhere in our state or nation we send a united message today to the outlaws and hate mongers wherever they are that such acts will not be tolerated the difference between a synagogue burning in europe 50 years ago and a synagogue burning in sacramento last week is that we now have a government and community and religious leaders who will respond and who will stand with us who will not tolerate these kinds of acts bigotry is nurtured by indifference there is no indifference in this gathering today and neither are we afraid the message that i gave to my congregation last friday night and the one i want to repeat here today is that they will not be intimidated the best way to respond to these senseless acts of hatred is to be strengthened in our resolve to continue to worship and celebrate and to cherish our rich heritage people of all faiths and all walks of life and to sew the seeds of righteousness that is what we will do that is what we must do we will teach our children to be proud americans and in my community to be proud jews we will teach them that they are lucky to live in a country and in a time when they do not have to be afraid there is a famous saying in jewish tradition that the whole world is a very narrow bridge and the most important thing is not to be afraid we walk together you and i and all people on the same narrow bridge for this is

important to the men and women who have served our nation in the armed services it clarifies the veterans employment opportunities act of 1988 to ensure that veterans will receive the benefits that congress intended when it passed that act last year h r 3187 also included in this new presentation represents a bill introduced by the gentleman from california which would amend the 1949 federal

include education public health correctional facilities and public airports a bill that became law in the 105th congress introduced by the gentleman from california added law enforcement and emergency management response purposes to this list prior to its enactment however the bill was amended to include a december 31 1999 sunset date for these new public purpose categories there are currently more than 22 pending state and local government applications for these purposes nationwide these newconveyance categories have been invaluable for local governments for enhancing their law enforcement and fire and rescue training efforts these new authorities have allowed for an excellent reuse of surplus federal property that would be lost at least in the main if we do not take some step at this point to extend the current opportunity for the federal authorities to go forward accordingly h r 3187 provides that during the extension the general services administration while not being able to actually convey surplus federal property at no cost for law enforcement and emergency response purposes would however retain under the gsa at least the ability to consider and approve the applications for transfer during this extension additionally prior to december 31 the gsa can convey surplus property at no cost for law enforcement and emergency response purposes to qualifying state and local governments and as such this extension represents an important sense of relief to those local governments that have acted in good faith and stand to lose the receipt of federal surplus properties at no cost absent our action in regard to the underlying bill s 335 itself the house has already discussed and debated this measure extensively on november 2 when we passed it under suspension of the rules by a voice vote i do not want to reiterate all of the comments made then as important as they were but let me say just briefly with the authorization that we are about to extend once more on this house floor this body stands to take a great step towards protecting those vulnerable particularly our senior citizens who have been preyed upon far too often by unscrupulous sweepstakes mailers those individuals as few as they may be who have come where the laws are apparently insufficient and have used deceptive practices to prey upon generally the elderly but in other measures certainly the infirm those who are most vulnerable as i said and in many cases bilking them out of thousands sometimes tens and even hundreds of thousands of dollars of hardearned money and their life savings today this house can make again the statement that this congress will not abide by that kind of activity and we will enact those laws necessary to ensure that future sweepstakes proposals are done under the guise of full disclosure that deceptive practices that misleading claims that facsimile presentations so that checks are made to look like actual government documents can no longer be continued beyond the efforts that i mentioned of the ranking member and others on the committee i certainly want to extend a particular thanks to the gentleman from new jersey who really brought this houses attention to this issue last year when he began formulating a response we also owe great thanks to others including the gentleman from california the gentleman from florida and of course the language in this bill is based in large measure upon senator susan collinss comprehensive bipartisan sweepstakes mailing legislation which passed the other body by a 93to0 vote so as my colleagues can see we have drawn from many sources here to craft what i believe is not just a reasonably balanced but a tremendously effective and most needed piece of legislation i urge its immediate and overwhelming approval i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.0005798935890197754, 0.4994201064109802, 1, "just 2 weeks ago in the city of cleveland at a high school called east high school the roof

undergoing in discussing this bill number one it shows that everybody agrees that there are accounts in the veterans budget that are underfunded and the chairman of the committee seems to agree that we should plusup the research account in this case by 30 million plusup the construction of the state veteran homes by 30 million and i support that and would go even further it also makes the point that many members are caught up in a conundrum here the absurdity of our rules where we have to do something good in order to do something good in the veterans budget we have to do something bad in the space budget this at a time when we have surpluses i do not think the public understands why we should go through such an exercise that we have to cut 60 million out of the space program in order to fund 60 million in the veterans account when we have the money to do both and this is what we should be doing we should be plussing~up the account in research as an amendment i had on the floor to do we should be plussingup the account for the state veterans homes which i have an amendment to do without having to take from nasa my colleagues we all know we all know we have the money to do this this is an absurdity this is a game we are playing here that puts us in very low esteem with our constituents who say when the gentleman from florida said he represents the place where they have the fourth highest veterans and he also is strongly in support of the space station his constituents have to say well why not do both and they are right we should be doing both and though i support the plusup of 30 million in the state veterans home account i would have to underline what my colleagues from texas said this does not allow us to make up for previously approved projects and projects that have already been approved by their states which with appropriated funds we cannot make up that backlog with this plusup we need an additional 50 million more the amendments are absolutely right in that we need these plusups and i am glad the chairman of the subcommittee understands that we were falling behind in those accounts and this house has catched up but i need to point out the absurdity of the rules we are under which force us to take money from another account which is absolutely vital also to our future as a civilization i would urge somehow that the committee on the budget and the committee on appropriations would put us into realistic situations without forcing us to make these kinds of choices which are not mandated by the reality of our funds today"],

balkans which is where we could end up if we continue down the path of halfway measures after the successful conclusion of operation desert storm many of us were relieved that our nation finally appeared to have learned from the bitter experiences in vietnam how not to fight a war but everything we have seen to date in operation allied force suggests that the lessons of desert storm may have been forgotten and that we are at risk of repeating in the balkans the very same mistakes we made in vietnam we do have an interest in preventing ethnic cleansing the forcible relocation of hundreds of thousands of refuges and the destabilization of albania macedonia and the other countries in that region i believe the president was right to try to stop president milosevic from doing these things and now that we are involved i believe that we must do everything within our power to restore peace to the region that is a coherent position but what is not coherent however is the inbetween position that we have enough of a national interest to become involved in an armed conflict with president milosevic but notenough of a national interest to do what is required to prevail in that conflict that certainly is a prescription for defeat and this is what brought us the agony of vietnam this is where we may end up in the balkans if we forget the very first lesson of vietnam that we have no
