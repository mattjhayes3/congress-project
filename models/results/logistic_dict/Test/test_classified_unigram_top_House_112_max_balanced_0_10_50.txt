and puts people back to work in contrast to the house republican budget it balances our budget in 10 yearswhile preserving medicare improving health reform maintaining our commitment to education and making the investments in our infrastructure that will create jobs it does so by ending the wars in iraq and afghanistan and bringing sanity to our bloated defense budget rather than destroying our safety net like the republican budget does the peoples budget ensures that the wealthiest americans and wall street pay their fair share of taxes the peoples budget would end tax breaks for oil companies and corporations that ship jobs offshore and it would require wall street to pay for the damage it did to our economy i recently sent a survey to my constituents asking how we should cut the deficit the results show that 85 percent want to close loopholes benefiting wall street and corporations 78 percent want the bush tax cuts for the wealthy to end and 64 percent want defense spending cut in contrast only 13 percent think we should cut domestic spending for education and children and only 12 percent want cuts to medicare or social security the peoples budget represents the

districts for the last month and weve been talking to friends and neighbors back home about what america is truly concerned with what is most important in the eyes of all americans and that is getting america back to work our economy is stagnant this administration is throwing up barriers which is freezing assets because the folks that normally would invest in growth and hiring people are frightened about whats around the next corner and theyre sitting with all their money and theyre not growing i met this morning with around somewhere between 12 and 14 of my neighbors in just a sitdown cup of coffee where we sat around and we talked about the way that folks in central texas view whats going on with the job market you know in texas weve been blessed we havent faced the kinds of unemployment numbers that other states have had but we now are certainly seeing unemployment creeping up in our state also we had small businessmen and women there and they talked about the things that concern them but yet weve had meetings with bankers whove explained to us that you can look at their deposits and see that american local investors are sitting on the sidelines and keeping their deposits in the bank and not investing in growth and not investing in capital structure not building buildings and certainly not hiring people and so part of the discussion this morning from some very intelligent small business folks was we think we know why why do you say this is happening the answers i got were answers that we hear on the floor of this house every day but the one that ive been talking about now for almost a year probably maybe even over a year is the fact that we are seeing the administration doing through government regulations which are basically laws passed by the regulators which change the playing field for people and our economy across the board at every level its not done by acts of this congress its done by acts of bureaucrats in the obama administration as they make rules and regulations that fit their view of the world and how they think the world should work and these regulations regulate the drivers the force builders that employ the american people many of these regulations have become such a shock to the conscience of people who are in business that they say my lord im not about to get invested in growth until i know whether im going to even have my business once the regulators are through with me and then sitting on the sideline is the giant regulator program which is the health care bill that this house passed last year and the senate passed we call it obamacare its 2 000 pages are multiplying very rapidly as the regulators the people who are able to pass rules to set up the regulations that govern that bill are imposing more and more burden on the individual employer and on those people seeking health care so what i heard today from some people who are presidents of small businesses run small businessesa thomas barrett a very intelligent lawyer who is both a financial adviser and a lawyer for small and other sized businesses all over central texas and is highly sought after for his opinionthey said its the unknown thats driving the investment off the page in the united states its the unknown we dont know whats going to happen next our taxes what are taxes going to do weve got taxes that will last for a while and then go back to a different tax automatically unless this house acts then most importantly and what we talked mostly about today was all the new regulations that are coming up in the next 3 or 4 months the republican leadership in this house is going to do everything it can to turn back some of the craziness thats gone on in the regulatory world i brought the members here tonight just a few examples of some of the regulations many of which weve been talking about all year weve spent a lot of time talking about the cement industry weve talked about boiler mact weve talked about a lot of other things were going to talk about tonight but its just a general outline of some corrective measures that this republicanled house is going to try and going to pass through this body to just start slowing down and changing the direction of what we think are some illconceived regulations by the executive branch the obama administration i want to start off with this poster right here which just gives you a small example of what were talking about in july of this summerthis is what weve called the regulatory summer these are regulations that have been proposed by various agencies many of them are household words like the environmental protection agency but there are plenty of others the labor departmentyou could go on and on in july 229 proposed regulations went into effect 379 final regulations and the cost estimated of these proposed and final regulations over 9 5 billion to the economy in the month of july that meant business the job creators took a hickey of 9 5 billion in 1 month the month of july 2011 we have just finished august270 proposed regulations 347 final regulations over 8 2 billion in august so for this summer just july and august the 2month total 17 7 billion in costs to the people who create jobs now is it any wonder that the people who create jobs are sitting on the sidelines and saying holy cow how do i hire somebody and i think the american people know why people in business hire somebody they hire somebody because they think that person will make their business more prosperous will make it work more efficiently will make it do the job the business was set up to do if you are in the roofing business and you put roofs on houses you hire more roofers because you think you will be able to produce a better quality product faster and more efficiently therefore enhancing the profit that those who have invested their capital and labor into that businessthey can make a profit so that that business can thrive you dont hire roofers when you dont need to put roofs on houses i mean that doesnt make any sense and everybody with any kind of common sense knows that now if youve got a person whos got some business whether it be big or small and they literally dont know what the government is going to do to them tomorrow or lets just say in the next 2 months following this track record they could be looking at another almost 20 billion worth of additional costs to their business that could be coming up in september and october based upon the last 2 months its arguable that its pretty close to 20 billion of additional costs that they were not anticipating and never thought was going to happen to them and all of a sudden out of the clear blue it drops in their lap now you will hear arguments like wait a minute there are these things that are environmental and other ways and people have known all along something about this was going to be done and that may or may not be true but the ramifications of what the regulators actually did are turning out to be horrendous costs to industries that right now are trying to get the ground under them stable so they can start hiring people again if youre on balancing ground sort of like this earthquake we had up here in washington which i am very fortunate that i wasnt in when that ground is unstable you dont know which way to turn well the same thing goes for business when the foundation underneath your business is unstable you dont know which way to turn are you going to go out and hire somebody give them a job when this is what your life is right now and someone is creating that problem that are actually by their actions making it unstable i would argue that questionable regulations the imposition of additional costs the unknown of what taxes are going to be tomorrowall these things create an unstable environment for the people who hire people so this last regulatory summer is a perfect example of the earthquake that has shaken the foundation of the small businessman and the job creators in america the president of the united states promised us the white house promised us to save 10 billion in redtape which is kind of the slang term for bureaucratic regulations in 5 years but the white house has put forward 17 7 billion worth of redtape in 2 months the message has been lost somewhere where is it when did what we were promised change into a threeforone worse situation we were promised a 5 billion savings for the job creators and in fact weve created a 17 7 billion expense and uncertainty to the job creators and we wonder why we are not creating jobs mr kucinich was talking about his view of the world he and i dont see the world the same way but the facts are when he was talking about we need to create jobs we darn sure need to create jobs the role of the congress today is finding ways to get this country back to work if we put this country back to work 90 percent of our problems will be much much better so the real goal of the republican house this year to finish this year out is going to be trying to correct at least some of this instability created by these regulators these unelected regulators these are appointed people not elected people the heads of these agencies are appointed by the president they are under the wings of the white house if you will they are part of the executive branch of government and the legislature this branch the congress is going to in the next several months try to put some reins on these outofcontrol regulators and hold them back and weve got just some of them i am going to talk to you about that some of my colleagues are putting forward in the future the week of september 12 which is next week i suppose were going to take up the protecting jobs from government interference act by tim scott of south carolina now the facts of this situation are very unusual in my way of thinking and i think most of the people in the united states when they heard this on television they said they cant do that can they it seems the boeing corporation has a big operation up in the washington state area and they were wanting to build an additional plant to build whatever boeing builds whether its aircraft or whatever it isthey wanted to do it in south carolina they have been negotiating and working in good faith with the citizens of south carolina and the government of south carolina they have looked at alternative locations around the country to make a determination of what is best for their business in their situation today and they determined that they were going to build a very important plant in south carolina but the national labor relations board the nlrb issued a complaint against the boeing company for the alleged transfer of an assembly line from the washington plant to south carolina yet not one union employee at the boeings puget sound facility thats the washington plant has lost his or her job as a result of the proposed south carolina plant still the nlrb is pursuing a restoration order against boeing that would cost south carolina thousands of jobsthese are new jobs in south carolinaand deter future investment in the united states this is the government telling boeing how they can run their business at the base level of you cant move unless we tell you you can move and if you choose to go to a righttowork state instead of a union shop state were going to tell you no you cant do it what happened to the freedom of movement that our founding fathers created in this country i mean part of what makes us great is if you cant prosper in texas you can maybe prosper in south dakota in fact people are right now as we talk right now people are taking businesses from one part of the country and going to another part of the country because of maybe newly discovered resources maybe a better work environment maybe a more intelligent workforce maybe a better investment community maybe better opportunities maybe better tax structure thats the free right of every american is seeking prosperity for their company and for their family to go seek these places if were going to tell boeing they cant build a plant to create jobs in south carolina next they may be telling sam smith in oklahoma im sorry but we need you to stay in oklahoma we dont want you to move to texas or we dont want you to move to south carolina to go to work in the boeing plant which we just canceled is that the kind of world we have and we want this government to have i would say no do we want the people of south carolina to have 1 500 new jobs yes is anybody talking about hurting the people employed at puget sound no its the issue of union membership that drove this whole thing and we have given our states the right to choose whether they have a righttowork state or they have a union state and every state in this country has some difference in how they view that its part of the environment that state creates to bring business into the community what in the world is wrong with that and when did that become big brothers job to tell somebody where they can and cant offer you a job so are we now saying that the people of washington stateand i have many friends there and i love very much and i dont mean to be in any way defaming washington statebut we have got a group of bureaucrats that are saying those are more important people than the people in south carolina who want to work for boeing for a good salary because the governments telling them they cant do it the gentleman from south carolina tim scott has got this bill h r 2587 were going to take it up next week i understand which is going to protect these jobs from this government interference it would take the commonsense step and it would prevent that national labor relations board from restricting where an employer can create jobs in the united states who would have ever thought we would have had to even address this on the floor of this house this world that we have lived in and in fact president john f kennedy in writing one of his dissertation papers at harvard came up with a term the great frontier which the whole concept of america was if you failed in one place the great blessing of america is you can pack up and move to another place at one time that was the frontier now that frontier is in technology that frontier is in science that frontier is not just moved from one place to the other its moved from one idea to the other thats the greatness of america to have the government tell you where you can and cant locate is an abomination to the very spirit of the american dream this one we need to do it right away we are going to do it we hope our friends in the senate are going to help we have the administrations new maximum achievable technology act mact standards and cross state air pollution csapr for utility plants will affect electricity prices for nearly all american consumers in total 10 000 power plants are expected to be affected i cant tell you the number in other states but texas surprisingly fell under this act which no one anticipated and we actually had no input whatsoeverbut thats a different argument which i have made before but i know that we are talking about 17 to 19 plants just in texas are being closed down these are coalpowered plants were talking about coalpowered plants in most instances here the result to middle class america is an annual electricity bill increase in parts of the country anywhere from 12 to 24 percent just by this one regulation that has been proposed dealing with coalpowered plants and greenhouse gas emissions well representative john sullivan of oklahoma has come up with a solution for this h r 2401 the transparency in regulatory analysis of impacts on the nation one of the things that we think any regulator should be looking at as he is doing this type of work is how does this impact the jobs of the american people how does this impact the economy of the area if you have a state that has 20 power plants and the results of your mandatory and arbitrary ruling is going to shut down 12 or 15 of those plants it doesnt take a genius to figure the price of electricity is going up even if they go in and they make a conversion to some other form of power at great cost and expense billions of dollars of additional money happen to be spent even if they do that you are still going to have down time when electricity is going to be scarce and the risk of blackouts and brownouts is going to be increased quite honestly it hurts every industry and every person that depends on that electricity has anybody looked into this and said here is how we figure this out and told us with transparency what effect this has no so what mr sullivan is trying to say is that we need to call a timeout and it would require a cumulative economic analysis for specific environmental protection rules and specifically delay the final date for both utility mact and csapr rules until full impact of the obamas administration regulatory agenda has been studied some of this stuff is done with computer projections but the facts are its kind of a shock and surprise to everybody thats in the business and its time that we call time out and rather than cost this country jobs give these people a chance to continue to have good jobs for the american people to work in this is a good bill and were going to take this bill up the week of september the next bill that this republican congress is going to go take up is h r 2250 to deal with whats called boiler mact from hospitals to factories colleges thousands of major american employers use boilers that will be impacted by the epas new boiler mact rules these new stringent rules will impose billions of dollars in capital and compliance costs increasing the costs of many goods and services college kids will tell you how expensive going to university is today they dont need any more cost increase there but it will increase the cost of higher education and it will put over 200 000 jobs at risk just what they have done under the boiler mact rules so what are we doing with h r 2250 representative morgan griffith of virginia has proposed this its called the epa regulatory relief act and would provide a legislative stay for four interrelated rules issued by the epa in march of this year the legislation would also provide the epa with at least 15 months to repropose and finalize new achievable rules that do not destroy jobs and provide employers with an extended compliance period in other words if its a problem lets fix the problem without costing people jobs lets fix the problem with a reasonable amount of time for compliance so that its not a kneejerk reaction that is required by everybody to try to keep from going out of business because of epaimposed rules so basically just like the last bill we talked about this is saying stop this craziness take a new look let the people youre regulating have some input into the cost and the compliance and the job loss and then lets restructure if weve got to fix this problem restructure it in a manner that makes common sense to keep the american men and women of this country working keep the factories open and producing and the colleges and universities open and producing and not impose a shortterm heavy burden of an additional capital infusion in order to meet regulatory changes give them a reasonable amount of time that common sense says it would take to fix the problem instead of imposing this rammeddownyourthroat series of rules october 3 is the week the republican congress will be bringing that before the american people and before this house this is one ive been working on for quite awhile i hope through part of our efforts during these evenings when weve talked about the cement mact issue the imposition of new regulations on greenhouse gas emissions for the cement factories and the fact that weve had the opportunity to very effectively drive cement production out of this country and offshore to china india and maybe mexico where they dont regulate at all the emissions and then we think that somehow its going to fix greenhouse gases its kind of insane that cleaning it up over here and driving people offshore to where they dont clean it up at all is going to help anything its going to hurt something but thats a different argument in the week of october 3 the cement mact and two related rules are expected to affect approximately 100 cement plants in america the cost is estimated to be somewhere between 3a billion for a 68 billion industry just do the math thats a tremendous burden if these rules come into effect these stringent requirements will be cost prohibitive and the american cement industry quite frankly could be at risk across the board we could wake up finding ourselves importing from other countries by necessity a product that we now lead the world on you know concrete is the second most used building material on earth the only thing thats used more than concrete is water so portland cement which is the base ingredient in creating concrete is as important to the building of infrastructure buildings and basically everything that we live with as anything on earth and we are in that business and we produce cement in various states in this country we produce the portland cement process and these regulations would shut down factories and basically cause these international companiesbecause all companies whether they are based here or not trade internationallyto move someplace else and you wonder why jobs are going overseas well in this case in the cement industry jobs will be going out of the country for one specific reasongovernment regulations beyond reasonableness the cement sector regulatory relief act sponsored by representative sullivan my good friend from oklahoma will provide a legislative stay of these ruleshold off brother we need to look at these thingsand provide the epa with at least 15 months to repropose and finalize new and heres the magic word achievable rules that do not destroy jobs and provide employers with an extended compliance period once again quit cramming it down our throat quit saying youve got to do it tomorrow give us time to implement reasonable rules and as we look at these rules lets analyze what they are going to cost us in the way of jobs and in the way of our economy and take that into consideration as you plan out the reasonable way forward youll find that many of the things that well be taking up in the next couple of months right there is the secret key ingredient were going to come up with rules that you can achieve without destroying jobs that will still over a long term if you give time to comply will meet the requirements that are necessary that people think to clean things up if they need to be cleaned up october 3 is when we are going to take that up sometime in the month of october or november we will take up another bill oh by the way when youre talking about jobs in these portland cement factories these jobs are good jobs these are labor jobs but they are trained labor jobs they are good jobs that pay somewhere between 65 000 and 85 000 each now thats a good american job that ought to be done by an american not by someone from china or from india because we have driven these industries out of our country coal ash h r 2273 these are antiinfrastructure regulations commonly referred to as coal ash rules that will cost hundreds of billions of dollars to fix according to the existing regulations affect everything from concrete production to building products like wallboard the result is an estimated loss of well over 100 000 jobs so you know at the end of this last month we had no job gains not one job was created thats what the report said well just in the things that ive read to you so far as a result of these regulations if all of this took place next month just the numbers weve given were talking about 500 000 jobs so far that these bills that this republican congress is going to take up and try to get some reasonableness in this regulatory process its time for this congress to not surrender the lawmakingrulemaking is lawmakingauthority to regulators without overseeing what they are doing and making sure that they are not harming our economy and harming what is going on in america and the jobs that everybody needs we cant afford to lose more jobs we have to keep the people working who have jobs and then weve got to enhance these businesses in such a way that they feel that they are not going to be threatened by surprise regulations and therefore they are willing to say i have got stable ground under my feet and i can start to expand and hire again and start to invest my capital which right now is sitting in the bank into new and better products services factories et cetera so this coal ash bill that will cost this country 100 000 jobs h r 2273 the coal residual reuse and management act sponsored by representative david mckinley of west virginia will create an enforceable minimum standard for regulation of coal ash by the states allowing their use in a safe manner to produce products and protect jobs its just basically saying let the people who have this coal ashand its in certain states more than other placesuse this coal ash and regulate this coal ash in such a manner that it does enhance the environment without destroying american jobs once again the congress has got to act and the republican congress is prepared to act now here comes my favorite of the crazy regulatory acts the epa is now proposing rules to regulate dust now i live in texas weve got more highway miles than any other state in the union plenty of paved roads but weve also got what we call farm roads and ranch roads and in the western part of the state those farm roads are covered with what we call caliche which is a pulverized limestone and over in the eastern part theyre covered with certain types of gravel some of its river gravel and other things when a farmer drives up to his house on his driveway its usually got some kind of gravel or caliche on it and it kicks up dust the epa is now saying you can be fined for driving home every night on your gravel road now what is your solution well its easy go out and spend 20 000 and pave your driveway5 miles of driveway so put pavement on it oh but make sure you put a certain kind of pavement because its got to have pavement that doesnt kick up dust arguably if you use asphalt it wont kick up dust or concrete wont kick up dustor not as muchbut you might kick up a little more dust if you do what they call squirt top which is what most farm roads are which is tar with gravel spread on it until that gravel sets it kicks up dust so even if you went to the expense to build a farm road that was a paved farm road your paving method might kick up enough dust to get them to fine you and take money out of your pocket anyway and the epa now wants to regulate dust california does this already i asked one of my california colleagues how do you keep from getting fined in california while having the dust regulations heres what they said water down your roads every day so it doesnt have dust mud is okay dust is bad okay now that may be great for california i dont know what the water situation is in california but it hasnt rained in texas some kids are about to go off to school and havent seen rain in texas it hasnt rained so long but seriously i landed at the airport and looked out at this waterfall up here on the east coast and said holy cow we dont know what that looks like back home why dont they move all this water on the east coast down to texas where it hasnt rained to my knowledge in 6 months and half of my neighboring county of bastrop is burning to the ground because its so dry and so hot and we havent had a rain in so long we may be the only state in america thats praying that a hurricane will hit our coast so we can get some rain are you going to tell that farmer that the only way hes getting that water that hes feeding his animals is through shallow wells that may have gone dry on him or deep wells he has to drill to get to additional water under the ground or windmills that are pumping that water if you are out west which are not that deep and a lot of them have gone dryhis precious water that his livestock and his family needs to survive hes got to take it out and squirt it on his road so he can get home at night now does that make economic sense to the american people i dont think so but then if you sit in the big epa building in washington d c and have never even seen one of these roads and probably never been outside this beltway it may make perfect sense to that person in this paved world that we live in inside the beltway but it doesnt make sense to the average person thats trying to make a living all across the rural parts of the united states and not just rural but all across the united states where unfortunately we kick up dust by the way plowing kicks up dust so then you can only plow when the fields are wet did you ever plow when the fields are wet the only person who would sit in the epa office and think that the farm products magically appear at their grocery store would know that you cant get off in a muddy field and plow effectively yes you can turn up some moisture at the right time and you can keep dust down and farmers do they dont want their top soil blowing away like it did in the dust bowl theyve learned their lesson about that and theyre doing the best they can and i would commend them for doing it i went to school in lubbock texas back in the 1960s at the end of what we call the dust storm era and because of modern farming methods and so forth they still have dust storms up there but theyre nothing like what they had in the fifties nothing like what we had in the sixties and i would argue that because of good modern farming methods we keep the dust to a minimum but we still sometimes have half the state of new mexico blow through the panhandle of texas now who are you going to fine the state of new mexico the new mexico farmers the texas farmers where it lands whos going to be responsible for all that dust thats out there in the air well the epa says somebody is because they set regulations and that would be a violation of these regulations the biggest shortage of anything in this town is common sense this is the most nonsensical rule of anything thats come down one of our new freshman congressmen kristi noem is a smart lady she knows rural america she knows the ridiculousness of this set of epa rules shes come up with a farm dust bill which we will take up this winter to make epa start using some common sense the president was asked a question about this in one of his meetings here recently at a town hall he sent this farmer on a bureaucratic wild goose chase and he never got anything in return so as a result of that that farmer his efforts whichthat wild goose chase produced nothing that was satisfactoryrepresentative kristi noem of south dakota has h r 1633 which would protect american farmers and jobs by establishing a 1year prohibition against revising any national ambient air quality standards applicable to coarse particulate matterthats dustand limiting federal regulations of dust which are already regulated under state and local laws in other words let the states take care of it let me tell you something this is not one of those texas brags we had dust storms when i went to school where girls didnt wear dresses in the spring because it would pick up pea gravel the size of a dime with those 60mileanhour winds coming across the plains and it would blow that gravel so hard against their bare legs if they had on dresses it would literally cut them off if they tried to walk to class now thats an act of god nobody created that wind and certainly pea gravel is about as big a particulate matter that would be flying around anywhere but the federal government doesnt control the wind and it never will weve got to get some reasonableness back into whats going on finally because ive been talking about this now for over a year and in my office we are tracking every regulatory agency and every day were seeing new and bizarre concepts of what we need to do from regulatory agencieswere seeing bugs shut down major highway projects when the president laughed and he said he learned that shovelready jobs are not really shovelready jobs he should have gone on to tell you why many of those shovelready jobs werent shovel ready and it was because of regulations created by the regulatory agencies that stopped legitimate road and bridge projects that were funded i have one in my district right now that is funded and the dozers are on the ground ready to move and that project is shut down by one of these many many regulations its the same across the country we cant do today what fdr did its great to talk about what fdr did i dont think it accomplished a whole lot in getting us out of the depression but thats my opinion but the facts are you couldnt build a hoover dam today just up and go out there and start building a hoover dam my lord just to build an electric power plant the number of regulatory agencies and permits that you would have to have would cover the walls of this chamber before you even get to break ground ive seen those rules put on walls its an amazing number of rules we are a world of government control of everything thats what these regulatory acts are about finally this congressman john carter because of looking at this stuff now just for the last year or so i really and truly think the best thing we can do to give the stability to the employers who employ people is to basically ban the implementation of any new federal regulations from now through january 31 2013 guarantee a 2year window for businesses to hire without any fear of new costs from regulations and certain exceptions would be allowed for the military or foreign affairs or internal agency management and personnel rules so theyd still be able to have regulations that fit in those categories and make sure that we keep our foreign operations and our military operating they have to make rules to operate

driving force of america the new idea we just have so many examples of new ideas just in the hightech industry and the communications industry the revolution that has taken place just in the last 10 years of new ideas those new ideas come from the freedom to think and the belief that you can take that idea and put it into reality without somebody stepping on your toes and preventing you from doing it these regulations and this control from washington d c this cradletograve mentality that seems to be running inside this beltway and the creation of these regulatory rules is putting the brakes on our economy and putting fear in the hearts of american entrepreneurs and businesspeople and employers who want to make their business better by hiring those good people that were graduating from our colleges and universities those good people that are trained in trained skills that we need to put to work in america and well put them to work in real jobs not governmentcreated jobs with borrowed money but real jobs that produce something and create wealth and make us and continue to keep us the most prosperous nation on earth it doesnt come from government it comes from the people the people are the wealth of this nationtheir ideas their entrepreneurship the investment of their own personal capital and their willingness to take a risk on america because they know america is great and to people who dont think were great or think that theyre smarter and can be inside this beltway and make rules that can do a better job of telling you how to run your life or how to drive home on your farm road than you know i say get out of the way thats what this fall is going to be about were going to be bringing these things up and these are things that are going to be discussed and talked about and voted on this fall because we republicans believe that the right path to create jobs and create wealth in america is to get the regulators to start thinking in terms of creating jobs not destroying jobs enhancing businesses not negating businesses and to put america back to work and if we put america back to work all the rest gets better the debt goes down the tax revenues go up the country has more to pay back the people we owe which ought to be our first priority we can get our financial house back in order we can get our credit rating back that was taken away from us and we can start operating like america has always operated the business of this country is business and as much as that was criticized back in the twenties that statement is true today just like it was then its the american people that give the american people jobs not the government lets put the brakes on these regulatory things were going to do that this fall i look forward to it pay attention to it members of this house and anyone around the country who has an interest pay attention to it give us your input because we are bound and determined to level out and stabilize that playing field

congressman clarke your passion is clear and detroit doesnt have a stronger advocate than you and we are pleased to be a cosponsor of your bill thank you for joining us as youve heard the congressional black caucus is here this evening were still waiting for the first jobs bill to pass this congress and as youve heard from my colleagues we need to begin with the american jobs act which was proposed by our president barack obama and just to be clear while were advocates for the african american community we are advocates for everyone and this bill is good for everyone everyone who lives in this country and it is a good bill for our country we happen to feel that putting people back to work in this country now is more important than fighting over an election that is more than a year away the american jobs act provides tax cuts that will help businesses grow and create jobs it will help provide incentives to hire the longterm unemployed and it will keep teachers and other essential workers like police and firefighters in their jobs where we need them to be and it will strengthen repair and build needed and faulty infrastructure and in doing so will create even more jobs and it will give people a decent job which will allow them to take care of their families to buy what we make here in america and it will stimulate economic growth it would give every american worker and their family a tax cut through extending the tax payroll tax holiday and do more to fix the mortgage crisis that got us here in the first place by allowing more refinancing of mortgages it would help our fellow americans take better care of their families putting their children in better schools supporting small businesses building consumer confidence and spurring the spending that our economy needs to get back on track this is what this congress ought to be doing not focusing on the solitary goal of making president obama a oneterm president that is a losing proposition anyway no one should be willing to let our fellow americans suffer fall into and become mired in poverty remain unemployed lose homes and to cause our economy to crumble further just because they have political and whatever other differences with our president the republican leadership led by the tea party extremists are taking this country in the absolute wrong direction by insisting on cutting and cutting and cutting important programs and services like the women infants and children program maternal and child health and supplemental nutrition assistance programs at a time when there are more people and more children in poverty by working to deny the opportunity for health care to the over 30 million people who we worked so hard to get insured including sick children and people who would otherwise go bankrupt because of catastrophic illnesses over which they had no control people who are already getting care because of the affordable care act that is being so wrongly maligned i agree with some of the posters i saw in the newspaper this weekend calling for jobs not cuts jobs not cuts that is what we have been saying all year including here on the floor of the house every monday that weve been in session if our leadership listened instead of talk talk talk i believe that is what they will hear the american people at large are saying jobs not cuts and we have a golden opportunity to listen to them for over the last 2 weeks there has been an occupation of wall street because while homeowners and pensioners and many people have suffered because of their meltdown we have not seen the kind of remedies for the folks on main street the side streets or the rural roads that would make them whole they are speaking loudly and effectively on their and on our behalf and then right here in washington d c today and for the next 3 days the take back the american dream conference is here they will be on the hill on wednesday calling on us to end the nightmare that the dream is turning into for far too many people and to restore the american dream access which has been the hallmark and the pride of this country what is happening at this conference and the one in new york is that americans are saying enough is enough and they are fighting back against the cuts that are making it hard for far too many people in this country to survive theyre fighting back against attempts to repeal health care reform fighting back against proposals that would weaken social security medicare and medicaid and fighting back against voter suppression laws theyre fighting for jobs for a future for our children and theyre fighting for our democracy it is so very interesting this talk about president obama and democrats waging class warfare all because we want everyone in this country to do their part to help this country recover from a deep recession all because we want to let tax cuts that were only supposed to be around for 10 years that have now been extended to 12 years finally expire like they were supposed to come on colleagues lets be honest they were never meant to be permanent and how many jobs have these tax cuts created as was loudly touted they would do in 2001 at the end of the clinton administration he handed over this government with an over 2 trillion surplus now after those tax cuts enacted in 2001 after almost 12 years of them we are in record deficits and the worst recession since the great depression and president obama did not create that he inherited it the poverty rate is at the second highest in 45 years and it is hitting as youve heard african americans and latino americans hardest the share of americans in deep poverty with incomes below half of the poverty line is at the highest level ever recorded and african americans are more likely to be in extreme poverty while we hear a lot about how much of a share of taxes the richest 1 percent or the richest 10 percent pay let me remind everyone that white americans wealth is 20 timesand you heard it earlier but it bears repeating20 times that of african americans and 18 times that of latinos and that between 2000 and 2007 not 10 percent not 20 percent not 40 percent but 100 percent all of the increase in wealth went to the top 10 percent in this countryall the top 10 percent the gap between rich and poor got wider the rich got richer the poor got poorer thats a very dangerous trend for the future of this country and then unemployment has reached record highs as well you dont hear about it much you hear it from us but in far too many places our rural and our urban areas communities of color unemployment remains in double digits african american unemployment nationally is over 16 percent but as youve heard we know that it is higher than that in many parts of our country so if we want to talk honestly about class warfare class warfare is what too many people in this country have been experiencing since 2001 and now that we have a president who wants to end it he is being accused of class warfare if we really want to end class warfare my colleagues my colleagues on the other side of the aisle should be supporting rather than opposing him lets get real in all of our 40 years the congressional black caucus has always been a caucus of action our agenda has been consistent and weve pushed every congress and every president and so we resent anyone trying to put a wedge between us and our president to further their own agenda one which is clearly not ours but we continue to be the conscience of the congress as maxine waters coined when she was chair the fairness cops of our nation that is why when we could see none of our 40 jobcreating bills come to the floor under the leadership of our chairman emanuel cleaver and the jobs task force chair and former cbc chair maxine waters we called on the private sector as well as government agencies to come with us across the country to get people working again and that is why we worked so hard with our hispanic and asian colleagues to get the affordable care act passed and we will work just as hard to see that it gets implemented we are not going to sit quietly and let a vital door that is just opening for many to be slammed shut in our communities and communities like ours who need it most many scholarly reports have shown that just eliminating health disparities could save 1 24 trillion in just over 4 years in indirect and direct costs in addition to saving lives so if we really wanted a deficit reduction eliminating health disparities and achieving health equity is deficit reduction at its best and thats why we will continue to work relentlessly as a caucus to save homes to build and equip better schools to support regulations that protect our families and all families from the health and other effects of pollution we have also worked together on budgets and because we know that our country can invest where needed in health care education green energy and job creation and reduce the deficit at the same time we are preparing to send our recommendation to the joint select committee on deficit reduction it will likely be based on our proposed 2012 budget and it will end class warfare by allowing the highend bush tax cuts to expire while strengthening the middle class continuing to create pathways out of poverty for our fellow americans and protecting social security

furthermore in the event of a security threat we have an obligation to act this bill including the proposed balanced budget constitutional amendment would make it nearly impossible to respond to any economic or security crisis at the root of all of this is a system of misguided priorities my republican colleagues have determined that in order to balance the budget we should prioritize cutting

time i very much thank my good friend from memphis for yielding me the time this legislation is modest in scope but it is very important because it puts this country in the right direction of economic growth now i want to say i wish we would set our ambitions higher in the whole area of immigration our immigration system is broken it needs a fundamental overhaul we ought to have comprehensive immigration reform that makes strategic investments in border security improves workplace verification of employees and establishes a path to legalization for undocumented immigrants currently in the country but maybe we can use this kind of a debate to reflect upon the much broader benefits to our country that would accrue by improving our immigration system and continuing to pursue a comprehensive solution but regardless of whether we can get the more ambitious legislation the bill before us today fixes a real problem that today harms our nations competitiveness thats why it has bipartisan support thats why its the right thing to do and i think its terribly important for the area of our economy which is going to produce the most jobs in the future the most competitive jobs with the highest profit margins that we can then sell to the rest of the world so i congratulate the sponsors of this legislation and would hope that we would get unanimous support for it"],

texas for his leadership on this issue on the judiciary committee and i also want to thank my colleagues from the other side of the aisle as we rise in a truly bipartisan bicameral fashion in working for the passage of this very important legislation so i appreciate the kind remarks of the gentlelady from california in support of this bill as well like so many other health care costs prescription drugs are expensive and the cost is rising so what we are beginning to see increasingly is people going online to make the purchases of those drugs its an issue that i saw firsthand as a federal prosecutor who began to work on the proliferation of illegal drug sales over the internet oftentimes the people who are purchasing these are senior citizens online there are not the kinds of protections that would exist traditionally as there are in a pharmacy setting where not only do you have the ability to have the advice of a pharmacist but the certainty of the chain of custody so to speak for the drugs that have been traveling in commerce what we are finding is that close to 90 percent of counterfeit drugs are sold online and were not just talking about mislabeled pills here the fakes could actually contain no active ingredients the wrong active ingredient or even a contaminant the counterfeit medicines pose a threat because of the conditions under which they are manufactured often in unregulated locations and frequently under unsanitary conditions in many instances they contain none of the active pharmaceutical ingredients found in the authentic medicine or are in incorrect doses in others they may contain toxic ingredients such as heavy metals arsenic pesticides rat poison brick dust floor wax and even leaded highway paint in a worstcase scenario the medicine itself is a fake and the result of the counterfeit sale is harm to the patients health and safety and while all types of drugs are counterfeited whats of particular concern to me is the illicit market in significant drugs cancer drugs like avastin and altuzan adhd drugs like adderall and pain treatments like vicodin this is an economic harm estimates are that there are 75 billion worth of counterfeit drug sales annually but its not just the economic harm that is of the greatest concern to me it is the consumer safety associated with this the world health organization in their estimates predicted or believed that counterfeit drugs caused 100 000 deaths worldwide last year this is an issue of such importance it even captured the attention of the world governments with the g8 leaders at camp david issuing a declaration on the need to address this international crisis today its illegal to introduce counterfeit drugs into interstate commerce but the penalties are no different than those assessed for trafficking other counterfeit products such as movies or fashion products like purses thats why our bill seeks to have sentencing laws reflect the seriousness of the crime the bill increases fines to a maximum of 4 million for the first offense and 8 million for subsequent offenses and prison terms for a maximum of 10 to 20 years this is an overdue and needed changeand i can say that as a prosecutor i would like to thank congresswoman sanchez for her leadership on this issue i want to thank my colleague from pennsylvania congressman tom marino for his hard work on the judiciary committee working with chairman smith on this issue and i want to thank the members in both parties that should be recognized for bringing this critical measure to the floor so expeditiously

you mr chairman and ranking member brady i want to thank you all for bringing this bill back to the floor of the house this came to my attentioni would not have had any idea that if a candidate or an incumbent running as a candidate would die in office that their family would not decide how to disburse the money it would go back to the treasurer of the campaign and in cases many times that is probably what the family would want anyway but what i found out with my own father who served here 26 years and he died in office was that it does create a problem if the family has the authority to make the recommendation as to how to disburse the proceeds it just makes for a very satisfactory time in a very difficult time when a family member dies so to mr lungren and mr brady thank you very much for bringing this bill to the floor of the house again all this is is a simple change so that the candidate for federal office can determine that he would like to have or she would like to have a person other than the treasurer to disburse the funds if we pass this bill today i want to ask my friend mr brady to help me with the senate and ill reach out to the republicans and maybe he can reach

was intended to be a nonpartisan approach to an american issue cuts across the board democratic and republican priorities treated the same in this cr rolling back to 2008 levels rather than eliminating programs outright in the cr there will be time for those kinds of investigations later on in the budget process and in committees where programs can be singled out for deeper potential cuts and longterm structural changes as has been pointed out in the process of writing this there were some technical issues with it that we regret but the point of this substitute amendment remains the same that this is an american issue we both have to come together to solve this were going to have to get our fiscal house in order and to do that many steps are going to be necessary and among them is rolling back spending americans today are wondering whether or not were going to do the right thing and whether or not were going to cut that spending and whether or not our best days are in
