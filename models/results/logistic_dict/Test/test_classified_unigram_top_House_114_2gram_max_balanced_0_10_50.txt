kelly for those very generous remarks but also for your tremendous leadership and for staying the course and making sure that we are here really speaking truth to power each and every week on behalf of the black caucus also to you congressman don payne thank you very much for your leadership and for really rising to the occasion on so many issues in the very short time that you have been here you have hit the ground running and really have made a tremendous difference i want to just speak for a few minutes as it relates to the review of the congressional black caucus for the last year or 2 years i have to just say that our leader mr butterfield has been a very bold and tremendous leader we have accomplished quite a bit and we have a lot more to do while 2015 has been very challenging i believe that the congressional black caucus has really stepped up and made a huge difference not only for the african american community and communities of color but for the entire country it has also been an inspiring year we have seen the birth and growth of the vital black lives matter movement we have also witnessed powerful and moving protests across the country in places like missouri new york and even in my district in oakland and in berkeley california with people of all backgrounds and ages coming together to demand justice to petition their government to exercise their democratic rights i am so proud of the young activists who are standing up and demanding an end to racism and injustice in many of our communities they are truly bringing the civil rights movement into the 21st century i want them to know that they have allies here in the peoples house for too long congress has ignored or brushed aside issues affecting the african american community and other communities of color it is past time that everyone steps up and does the good work that we were sent to washington to do that the congressional black caucus has done for many many decades we need to start by talking about and looking at what has happened with the voting rights act as you know this year marks the 50th anniversary of this landmark legislation the voting rights act was gutted by the supreme court in its shelby v holder decision and of course republican state legislators have fallen all over to restrict voting rights across the country everywhere these dangerous restrictions come in the form of voter id requirements elimination of sameday voter registration and really severe reduction in early voting efforts we must call these efforts for what they are republican attempts to take away one of our most fundamental rights but we will not let this happen i am so proud of the congressional black caucuscongresswoman terri sewell and john lewis and mr clyburn the entire congressional black caucus our bill h r 2867 the voting rights advancement act sponsored by congresswoman sewell who represents selma alabama would restore the preclearance provisions of the voting rights act for any state that has had 15 or more voting rights violations in the last 25 years in the preclearance process as dr king once said give us the ballot and we will fill our legislative halls with menand of course womenwith goodwill we can fill this body with those who really want to see democracy fulfilled so we need our young people to keep up the street heat and demand that congress act it is past time that we get serious about restoring the voting rights act and ensuring that all americansand that means all americanshave free and unobstructed access to the ballot box also the serious economic disparities that persist in the african american community are very very evident according to a report released earlier this year by the joint economic committee led by ranking member congresswoman carolyn maloney and the congressional black caucus we learned and it is very glaring that more than one in three black children are born into poverty and the african american poverty rate is three times that of white americans the cycle of poverty and inequality starts in our school systems where black students account for 42 percent of preschool student expulsions despite accounting for only 18 percent of enrollment now that is preschool expulsion every time i remember this and say this it really makes me very terrified about what is taking place with young black kids especially with young black boys because there is no way anybody no kids should be expelled from preschool that is ages 1 to 4 that is outrageous i am the mother yes of two fabulous great black men and i am the grandmother of two black boys and i find statistics like that very very troubling for african americans we have allowed our school system to be turned into a pipeline to prison we must act now to address systemic issues facing our education and our criminal justice systems i want to applaud congressman bobby scott and congressman conyers because they have worked for decades on criminal justice reform and we are beginning to see some progress as a result of their very diligent work our criminal justice system is broken it needs to be rebuilt from the ground up so alongside of our cbc colleagues once again we are calling for comprehensive criminal justice reform also i want to mention our effort which i cochair with chairman butterfield our tech 2020 initiative silicon valley is right next to my district in california there are great opportunities there for everyone however the tech industry has not been inclusive of hiring and contracting with and working with communities of color especially the african american community so i am very pleased that the tech 2020 of the congressional black caucus has been initiated we are working with our great leader reverend jesse jackson with an insideoutside strategy many of the tech companies understand what is taking place and that they need to be an industry that is inclusive of everyone so the black caucus along with rainbow push along with the tech industry are working on a variety of strategies to make sure that this industry which provides goodpaying jobs and opportunities is an industry that is inclusive that does not discriminate and that includes the diversity of this great country so i have to just say to congresswoman kelly and congressman payne thank you for giving us a chance to talk about so many of the issues that we have been working on when you look at the issue of poverty cutting poverty in half in 10 years we know how to do it we have legislation the half in ten act h r 258 to do that and the pathways out of poverty act h r 2721 we know how to provide opportunities the congressional black caucus once again is leading on all of these fronts it is a big agenda but it is an agenda that makes

terrorist on unitedstates soil is real and cannot be ignored or downplayed congress must reassert leadership in the fight against isis by passing legislation to hold the president accountable for developing a comprehensive plan to destroy isis through congressional oversight hearings we must also ensure that federal agencies and local law enforcement are effectively communicating with each

sullivan to express my concern and press for strong corrective action in fact i have engaged in persistent oversight with respect to issues involving the secret service ranging from the intrusion into the white house last year to the 2009 incident in which a couple evaded security to attend a state dinner at the white house honoring the prime minister of india i have met with directors of the secret service on multiple occasions over the past several years to discuss and address performance and misconduct issues agent misconduct of the sorts that have taken place in recent years is unacceptable it is more than offensiveit jeopardizes the ability of the agency to carry out its core mission to address misconduct issues and ethical lapses by secret service personnel the managers amendment includes a provision i developed in cooperation with the secret service that will help elevate the issue of ethical conduct at the agency through the creation of an ethics program office with respect to other issues related to the protection provided by the secret service it is clear that the agency has been operating at an unacceptable level of resources the agency is understaffed at the agent and uniform division levels resulting in shifts that are too long and which leave inadequate time for training the agency also needs to better use stateoftheart technology and communications equipment all of these deficiencies contributed to the security breakdowns that allowed a man to climb over the white house fence evade secret service officers while running across the white house lawn and then run into the white house itself the goal of h r 1656 is to prevent future such incidentsand to protect against even more sophisticated threats that could result in far more harm this bill also would require that future directors of the secret service after nomination by the president be subject to senate confirmation the current director joseph clancy appears to be doing a good job in reinvigorating that agency and we do not propose this as a criticism of him or the presidents selection of him in any way however this positionas is the case with the directors of the other law enforcement components of the department of homeland securityshould be senateconfirmed reinforcing the need to appoint the most highlyqualified candidates and elevating the position in stature with the consideration of this legislation today we recognize that it is unfortunately the case that the secret service has recently failed to live up to its high standards with respect to the protection it provides our president and others by adopting the secret service improvements act we can help restore the agency so that it will be better prepared to achieve its mission"], [0.0008345246315002441,

very very closely though what she is doing and how she is handling it imagine as a former realtor the joy that i took in being able to get her into her own home the first thing that she had felt like was truly hers and something that her kids could be proud of well that is the type of scenario that we are trying to promote i would think as a country unfortunately with the rules that have been promulgated under this qualified mortgage rule lenders determine a borrowers ability to repay using really an arbitrary standard set by a formula they dont look at the character they dont look at the background they dont look at the history of that person because it is outside the formula if a lender does not adhere to this bureaucratically established formula a borrower can actually sue the lender this has caused 73 percent of community bankers those who know their customers best to cut back their mortgage business or simply stop providing mortgages altogether that is the worstcase scenario the portfolio lending and mortgage access act removes bureaucrats from the equation and allows lenders to work directly with borrowers to provide them with loans that they can afford that is a key element here loans that they can afford how do we know that they are going to do this well by keeping the loan on their own portfolio on their own books the lender assumes the full risk of the loan let me repeat that the lender retains the full risk of those loans if they didnt think that that borrower could pay back the loan they would not lend it to them now in my mind that is the definition of what a qualified mortgage test really ought to be so this bill is going to allow those mortgage lenders to extend and cover those loans and really offer those services to those people who are looking for that i have heard on the other side of the aisle a claim as the white house did in its veto threat that this bill would open the door to risky lending by undermining consumer protections under the rule and expanding the amount of loans that would be exempt from it as was pointed out by my friend from kentucky portfolio loans had nothing to do with the financial crisis that we went through in addition loans sold to fannie mae and freddie mac and insured by the federal housing administration which make up the vast majority of the market are already exempt under the qm rule so who exactly are we protecting who exactly are we maybe not servicing the way that this congress ought to be servicing and ought to be advocating for the originatetodistribute model incentivized predatory and subprime lending and because those loans would be readily securitized moved off of their books they no longer had any responsibility all they had to do was meet kind of a blush of a requirement and they could move it right on off of their books i can tell you this as a former realtor i understand that nobody has a greater incentive to ensure that a borrower can repay their loan i just pray that my colleagues on both sides will support this bill"], [0.0009066462516784668, 0.5009066462516785, 0, "i rise in strong support of h r 810 the national aeronautics and space administration authorization act of 2015 i would like to compliment chairman palazzo and ranking member edwards for a job well done it has been tough there have been disagreements matters have been handled fairly and now we are getting behind the product of all of that labor there was a great deal of work and negotiation on these provisions over the past year and the outcome of that work is this legislation which embodies the bipartisan leadership both here at the subcommittee level and at the committee level and the bipartisan support in this house for our nations civil space programs i would like to note that significant differences of opinion remain on many of the provisions in this bill but i wont go into any of them now i think i might have worried some of my colleagues on that but despite those differences we all share a set of common goals for nasa the foremost of our mutual objectives is that america must return to international preeminence in human spaceflight this is true for both access to lowearth orbit for which we are trusting our commercial partners and for farreaching exploration missions to the moon and beyond our discussions and yes our disagreements will continue but we will continue to work together to achieve americas shared goals h r 810 brings us closer to launching americans into space on american rockets from american soil it brings us closer to the next steps in exploration of our outer planets it brings us closer to technological developments that can turn a seemingly impossible goal into an achievable one it brings us closer to finding asteroids that may pose a threat to earth or may provide vast resources that could help humanity in space it brings us one step closer to moving beyond exploration and into pioneering leading to settlements in space it brings us closer to the stars for these reasons i ask my colleagues to join me in support of this important legislation"], [0.0009219348430633545, 0.49907806515693665, 0, "june
