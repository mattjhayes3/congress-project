their willingness to work long and hard on crafting this compromise this amendment reforms public law 480 food for peace programs by streamlining the act and by establishing clear lines of authority between the two agencies responsible for our overseas food program usda and aid the amendment designates usda as the agency responsible for title i concessional loans and the market development programs funded by title i local currencies the compromise establishes aid as the agency responsible for title ii food donations and a new grant program established by title iii the amendment also revises the authorities of the secretary of agriculture to establish commodity availabilities for public law 480 in several ways first by mandating the docket determinations to be made before the beginning of the fiscal year second by requiring that docket determinations be made on an aggregate basis rather than on a countrybycountry basis and third by requiring the secretary of agriculture to notify the congress in writing of any modifications in the docket and the reasons for such changes additional authorities delegated to the secretary of agriculture in the amendment namely the usual marketing requirements and the ccc authorities are intended to allow the secretary to take into consideration domestic concerns but are not meant to allow the secretary means by which he or she may

overriding principal here has been to make food aid a more effective development tool that is not hindered by bureaucratic delay and infighting i think that we accomplish that in this compromise in addition to reauthorizing food for peace the compromise title xii reauthorizes unitedstates agricultural export promotion programs for 5 years these programs include the export enhancement program the osm102 and gsm103 credit guarantee programs and the targeted export assistance program which is renamed and improved the amendment also provides 275 million in new credit guarantee authority to guarantee unitedstates exports to emerging democracies this provision will not only promote the export of unitedstates agricultural commodities but will also guarantee financing for agricultural infrastructure improvement projects in these nations the compromise title xii also authorizes a market promotion program which is based on the current targeted export assistance program the market promotion program will significantly increase exports of highvalue commodities such as fruits and means as well as valueadded agricultural products another key provision of the compromise provides for

vote on the matter this is the japaneseamerican reparations plan that is in the amendments from the senate this amendment involves a major change which all of us should scrutinize before we vote this is the issue of the japaneseamerican entitlements entitlements i will not argue here the merits of whether or not we should make the payments we voted on that last year in the congress and that is not the driving issue here the merits of that law are not the issue the issue today is do we create entitlement legislation in this appropriation bill something that the house has enacted a rule against second do we change an authorization without justification third can we afford to do what we say in this amendment we would like to do all of us would like to make those payments as quickly as we can the question is do we elevate them above everything else except entitlements do we elevate those payments above child care the defense of the country other issues that many in this body have fought long and hard for in this amendment these japaneseamerican reparation payments will be placed above all of those except other entitlements the motion and the amendment would provide an advanced fixed appropriation of 500 million for payments to japaneseamerican internees beginning in fiscal 1991 along with a separate amendment which follows on later in this afternoons debate this is an effort to turn the reparation payment program from a discretionary program which we enacted last year stretched over a 10year period into an entitlement over 2v2 years a clear violation of the budget act of this congress shielding it from our annual battles giving it higher priority than any other item that we search and scrape and dig to find funds for every single year this senate proposal says that these japaneseamerican reparation payments are more important than child care it is not an entitlement more important than fighting drugs the drug war is not an entitlement more important than education education is not an entitlement and on and on and on the truth is it will reduce the amount available for all discretionary spending a pot that shrinks and shrinks year after year after year the deficit is not the fault of the appropriations comn ittee th6defjcit is being caused by the entitlement programs which command so much of the overall revenue of the country we should reject this change today for three reasons one the procedure is wrong it violates the budget act it massively rewrites the law barely a year after it was created and without one hearing and on an appropriation bill it is a huge advance appropriation coupled with entitlement language in one general appropriations bill we cannot afford it as quickly as this entitlement says we should pay it when members passed this law last year we said we will pay this over a 10year period and the bill passed and became law all of a sudden today we say we are going to make it mandatory that the government pay it not in 10 years but in just over 2 years and elevate it to the top of all the other spending priorities that each of us have this comes first it is not right every dollar congress makes mandatory comes out of our hides as we sit down to find monies for the other priority programs congress faces not just in this bill in every bill because this being an entitlement comes off the top of all spending in the appropriations process when it comes time to funding agriculture programs if you are interested japanese reparations payments would get top billing environmental needs sorry about that education maybe next year child care nice try even national defense would come second to these payments because national defense is not an entitlement the law terminates the fund in 10 years over which time the payments legally can be made under the law passed last year maybe it would not be 10 let us hope it is 5 or less but do not make it mandatory upon us we have the full 10 years under the law to fulfill this obligation that congress voted on last year how do we get to a 64 billion deficit next year as the law mandates and fund drug wars and all the other programs that must be funded with another 500 million taken off the top as this entitlement would surely do at this time with this deficit it is not fiscally responsible to pass this amendment the senate has attached to our bill this amendment is the first of two items which carry this change it will be this amendment and then one later on in the procedure in the afternoon it would appropriate the maximum amount 500 million starting next year

interested in this money will come first as other entitlements do if we defeat the gentlemansmotion we remove the money and mark a blow for restraint if we do not do not complain next year when

state of the union address last night once again asked for this power from the congress it seems to me that our actions last year more clearly than at any year in recent history or perhaps in the history of the congress itself proved that the president really does need this tool to help control spending we for years have operated under a system that calls for 13 separate appropriations bills giving both to the congress and ultimately the president an opportunity to examine each of these bills and in turn if the president finds it necessary to veto one or several of those and send them back to congress that can be done without undue harm to the immediate operations of our government last year however congress contrived to bring all of these appropriations acts together into a single continuing resolution some would call it really the approach of a consolidated appropriations act which may in fact be desirable at some time if done appropriately but when that is accomplished congress presents the president with in fact no opportunity for a veto i believe we have discovered a way to keep the president from his constitutional right of veto no president would veto an appropriations act containing all of the appropriations of the government for it would then call for an immediate cessation of all governmental operations until such time as the differences between the senate the house and the president were ameliorated our forefathers could not have contemplated such a ridiculous state of affairs thus mr president if we are going to work toward a more consolidated appropriations act we ought to even the scales as our forefathers would have appropriately suggested by giving the president an opportunity for a lineitem veto this proposal is very similar to the one introduced by senator mattingly of georgia during the 99th congress which i was proud to cosponsor it is a bill for a 2year trial period it cannot be carried beyond that period without reratificatlon by the congress so it is a lowrisk proposition it is a trial period it gives us a chance to see if this really in fact will help but we have added a new element this time it would apply only to those appropriations bills which have been combined if congress as it is supposed to do passes separate appropriations bills they would not be subject to this lineitem veto and the president could examine each of the 13 independently and separately if congress in the other hand decides it is more convenient or for whatever purposes wants to weld them together then to the degree we weld them together the president would have an opportunity for a lineitem veto i think it has two potential benefits mr president one it would redress the imbalance which occurs when congress wraps things together and prevents the president from exercising his veto second it might have the even more desirable result of causing us to abandon the practice of continuing resolutions and combining of appropriations and instead presentthem to the president one by one separately and allow him to act on them as a single unit finally mr president let me say that as governor of washington i had a strong lineitem veto as other states had some say it is really not comparable that this government at this level is different from the individual state governments it is different all right we are nowhere near as s4558 cor competent when it comes to budgetmaking and appropriations we come nowhere near as close as states to do balancing their budgets and operating in a fiscally responsible manner and i certainly believe mr president that no stateno statewould suggest that a governor should be forced to deal with a comprehensive unified state appropriations act without being given the chance to comment upon it through veto of single items nor would congress act in that manner should we go ahead with the lineitem veto at this time i believe we have a somewhat modified proposal which has substantial benefits over the one of last year it gives us a chance to try things and may well prove to be a better rein on our own acts than on any acts of the president 1987"],

and revolution chinas actions should be watched carefully in tibet i want to thank you and your colleagues on the house foreign affairs committee for your work and unanimous support of this legislation and for permitting members of congress the opportunity to speak about the current situation in tibet on march 5 of this year chinese authorities stationed in tibet again violently repressed peaceful prodemocracy demonstrations in the tibetan capital of lhasa during the ensuing violence hundreds and perhaps as many as 1 000 tibetans were killed by chinese soldiers using automatic weapons foreign tourists and the press were forcibly removed from tibet the tibetan section of the city was cordoned off by chinese militia and thrown under martial law today lhasa a city which only 30 years ago was a tibetan city remains under a chinese government imposed martial law lhasa remains closed to the outside world although the western world cannot be certain about the present situation in tibet i would like to share with my colleagues a few passages from an urgent action appeal issue on march 8 1989 by amnesty international the decree of martial law which came into effect at midnight on 7 march empowers police soldiers to take all necessary measures to put down disturbances has been restricted amnesty international is concerned that following the imposition of martial law in the tibetan capital of lhasa largescale arbitrary arrests may be carried out and that those detained particularly those suspected of active participation in the recent demonstrations face the risk of torture and long periods of incommunicado detention without charge amnesty international is also concerned that in the present climate of extreme tension and violence the broad powers given to chinese troops under martial law may facilitate reprisal actions against people suspected of involvement in the recent protests or proindependence activities and possibly result in summary executions the chinese governments resolute violent and riotinciting actions used against a small group of tibetan lay people monks and nuns conducting a peaceful protest against chinas illegal occupation of tibet are in stark contrast with the chinese governments restraint in dealing with the hundreds of thousands of chinese students and workers demonstrating for democratic reforms this contrast serves as testimony to the racist and colonial instincts of the chinese occupation forces in tibet chinese government attitudes and actions remain a real and constant threat to the survival of the ancient and peaceful tibetan culture in closing i commend his holiness the dalai lama the simple buddhist monk that all tibetans recognize as their leader for his active pursuit of a peaceful resolution of the 40yearold conflict in tibet on several occasions including an event here on capitol hill the dalai lama has extended the offer of substantive negotiations with the chinese on tho future status of tibet the dalai lamas elforts have been supported by the congrer and other parliaments around the world however his offers to initiate talk continue to be rejected by a chinese government that wishes to portray the issue of tibet as an internal affair of china and as a personal problem between the dalai lama and the leaders of the peoples republic of china such arguments have not been acceptable to this administration and previous administrations when challenging the leadership of the soviet union on human rights abuses in that country such arguments and warnings should not be acceptable to our government in dealing with china this year the peoples republic of china is 40 years old although i commend the strong relationship that the united states has nurtured with the peoples republic of china over the past 10 years it is time that we quit treating this diplomatic darling as a special child that is immune to the fundamental standards of decency that we apply to other countries this administration and this congress should and must commit ourselves to the formulation of a human rights policy toward china if we are serious abo fundamental human rights and democrat freedoms and if we are to gain the respect of the government of the peoples republic of china"], [0.0008863210678100586, 0.5008863210678101, 0, "i want to thank my colleague the gentleman from texas for taking this special order and sharing these thoughts with the members of the house so that we have the issue in perspective you know there is a debate going on around the country from time to time about who sets spending priorities for the unitedstates government you know our friends on the democrat side tried to say well why doesnt your president president reagan or president bush propose a balanced budget we have heard that many times we say on the political right well presidents propose and congress disposes so i think at a time like this it is appropriate to ask a very simply question under the constitution of the united states who has the responsibility for fixing the spending level in the unitedstates government is it the congress or the white house"]]}
