11 they didnt cut the prices ive sent out charts to you to explain that so what people need to understand is what were trying to do here is give farmers a way to protect themselves against the feed costs and this volatility now this program is voluntary nobody has to get into this program if they dont like the stabilization fund they dont have to take the insurance and they dont have to be involved in it but what were saying is if youre going to have the government subsidize your insurance which is what were doing then youre going to have to be responsible if this thing gets out of whack and what the goodlattescott amendment does is it puts that responsibility on the taxpayers not on the farmers which is irresponsible in my opinion the other thing you need to understand is in regular crop insurance the prices you can only ensure the price for that year but in this amendment in the goodlattescott amendment you ensure the price not based on what the market is its based on the feed costs plus the margin so youre going to insure milk for 18 per 100 weight but if the price goes to 11 the farmer still can have 18 insurance he doesnt care if its 11 the government is going to pay for that not him this is a crazy thing that were talking about doing here were putting the responsibility on the taxpayer were actually probably going to raise costs to consumers its the wrong

for all americans its an american issue just as you said this is not just a republican issue freedom is what our country was founded on we just recently commemorated memorial day for all of those who have died for our country and for freedom friday is flag day again well be remembering what america is all about in our freedom and on the fourth of july we celebrate the freedom that our country was born to serve and to live out and be a beacon for the rest of the world we need to uphold that freedom and the hhs mandate amongst other efforts other things that have been done by the federal government unfortunately in recent years has really run counter to freedom i want americans to understand what this is about its not about birth control or abortion although we were told in the health care law obamacare was not going to cover abortion though we know the hhs mandate requires the abortioninducing drugs but thats not what the core of this is about its about freedom its about taking away americans freedom requiring them to participate in activities that violate their conscience unfortunately i think theres been a lot of misdirection on this and i think its important for all of us

that they feel is free from sexual harassment and if they feel threatened in any way they need to be able to be sure that they understand their rights and what recourse they have to protect themselves

these economic problems have aggravated social problems like crime have generated anxiety for individuals and institutions that have invested in puerto ricos bonds and have caused island residents to relocate to the 50 states in unprecedented numbers the statistics are staggering in recent years puerto ricos population has fallen by more than 4 percent while the number of puerto ricans living in the states has increased by over 45 percent as puerto ricos representative in congress it pains me to read media accounts of the islands troubles especially because i know that my constituents are just as capable and industrious as their fellow citizens in any other jurisdiction puerto rico has enormous potential but the reality is that this potential is not being fulfilled although the islands problems have certainly grown worse in recent months it is critical for policymakers and the american public to understand that these problems are not of recent vintage to the contrary for at least four decades puerto ricos economic performanceand by extension quality of life on the islandhas been far worse than any state according to every indicator including unemployment average household income and the ratio of government debt to economic production in other words puerto ricos difficulties have endured in more or less the same form regardless of who holds power in washington and san juan and irrespective of the public policies they formulate to be sure fiscal mismanagement at the local level and insufficient attention at the federal level have both been factors contributing to puerto ricos problems but the record clearly establishes that they are not the main factor what then is the principle source of puerto ricos longstanding woes in a recent editorial the washington post correctly identified the culprit noting that the territorys economic problems are structuraltraceable ultimately to its muddled political status curiously the post then asserted that there will be time enough to debate the status issue later and that puerto rico for the time being should concentrate on fixing its finances as i observed in a letter to the posts editor this is like a doctor recommending medicine to alleviate a patients symptoms but doing nothing to treat the underlying disease as long as puerto rico remains a territory deprived of equal treatment under critical federal spending and tax credit programs forced to borrow heavily to make up the difference and lacking the ability to vote for the president and members of congress who make our national laws the island will be in a position merely to manage rather than surmount its economic problems this is the only reasonable conclusion to draw from decades of empirical evidence a majority of my constituents understand this which is why they voted to reject territory status in a referendum held 1 year ago the obama administration recognizes this as well which is why it proposed the first federally sponsored status vote in puerto ricos history to resolve the issue once and for all and finally members of congress from both parties comprehend this which is why 125 of them have cosponsored legislation i introduced that provides for an upordown vote in puerto rico on the territorys admission as a state and outlines the steps the federal government will take if a majority of voters favor admission there are many reasons to oppose puerto ricos territory status which is unequal undemocratic and unamerican one of the most important reasons why puerto rico must discard this status in favor of either statehood or nationhood is because the current status has failedand will continue to failto provide the islands 3 6 million american citizens with the economic opportunities and the quality of life they deserve
