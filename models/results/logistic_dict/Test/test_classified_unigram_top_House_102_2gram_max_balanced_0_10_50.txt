prolonged recession slow and sluggish to recover since january of this year the 1 6 million unemployed americans have exhausted their benefits they have nothing the rhetoric we hear from this

mortgage payments to make you have educational opportunities that bypass your children mr darman says extended unemployment benefits only encourage people to stay unemployed what cynicism what

budget walls between defense spending and discretionary domestic spending however today the cold war is over and the cold war budget is obsolete and the walls must come down today we are engaged in a war on the homefront unemployment inadequate health care homelessness failing infrastructure and recovering from years of domestic cuts made in the reaganbush administrations therefore it is our responsibility as elected officials to enact a homefront war budget which reflects the real needs of this countrys citizens i believe the congressional black caucus alternative budget provides the appropriate response it is time to break down the walls and take this opportunity to invest in this nations future through infrastructure our children and our economy i commend the president for acknowledging that due to recent world transformation it is finally time to cut the bloated defense budget however in fiscal 1993 the presidents recommendation for defense spending level is 6 6 billion higher in budget authority and 4 2 billion higher in outlays than the levels recommended in the committees resolutions plan a and b even better the black caucus recommends reducing fiscal year 1993 defense budget authority by 49 6 billion and defense outlays by 20 7 billion below the caps set in the budget agreement the presidents modest proposal is out of sync with the new world situation especially in light of our current bleak domestic condition in addition because the presidents proposal does not change the rules of the budget enforcement act there will be insufficient funds in the domestic discretionary to merely maintain fiscal year 1992 funding the congressional dellumtowns black caucus has put together a budget which adequately addresses the needs of this nation the budget resolution is the first step in establishing the spending priorities of our nation it is imperative to remember that we are determining more than numbers we are determining the future of this nation and the fate of millions of human beings housing i firmly believe that this nation must be resolved to end the deterioration in the quality of life for millions of americans especially in the area of housing further as federal representatives it is our responsibility to provide decent and affordable housing opportunities the single greatest way to address our nations societal ills is through the implementation of a sound human investment policy which has as its centerpiece the provision of safe decent and affordable housing for all americans proper housing provides more than shelter it provides the stability and environment necessary to enable learning to take place and for people to establish a sense of community since the early 1930s when this country faced the great depression the federal government has played a role in meeting housing needs until 1981 this role grew rapidly as did the bipartisan consensus supporting it this federal role existed because the leadership of this country realized that the government should be involved along with the market to meet the affordable housing needs of all the nations people somewhere along the way however priorities changed and thus today after 40 years of federal housing programs for each lowincome household living in subsidized housing there are three others who need housing assistance but can not obtain it further since 1970 the cost of housing has risen four times faster than income the past two administrations and their budgets have largely accepted and acted upon the assumption that there is simply no way to adequately meet our lowincome housing needs the housing conditions of this country are too important and too demanding to cut community development and affordable housing programs by more than 16 percent from the 1992 levels as the president proposes further to fund housing programs for a prolonged period without properly addressing housing needs serves to make a bad situation worse the assumption that there is simply no way to meet our housing needs is a self fulfilling prophecy unless we make a commitment to provide the necessary funds by doing so we would begin to provide adequate housing especially lowincome housing i am pleased that the alternative budget proposes 5 billion for low and moderateincome housing construction and rehabilitation grant program we can no longer allow further disinvestment to occur in our neighborhoods communities or the increasing loss of affordable housing stock and the exclusion of poor and middleincome working people from housing and vital human services if we allow for unabated decay to the infrastructure of our society we will have no base upon which to build lasting economic development if we can spend over 160 billion to bail out the savings and loan industry we can surely make a sufficient sound and long term investment in this countrys community and infrastructure development we need a healthy and productive population to develop the economic prosperity that we so desperately desire to our world wide competitiveness i believe the progressive budget makes a serious attempt to provide adequate shelter for the million households on waiting lists for housing assistance and the 100 000 children who are homeless today it is disgraceful that in america two million people sleep on the streets each year with hundreds of homeless people huddled on sewer grates in the nations capital and in the white houses backyard i dont understand how the president can eliminate programs such as the emergency shelter grant program which since 1986 has provided assistance to more than 2 000 shelters around the country by more than 715 percent today we must consider the long term effects of this budget resolution vote we must enact legislation with priorities which remembers the millions of hidden invisible americans in the dark and into a temporary shelter out from under bridges in cars abandoned houses or homeless shelters to the daylight of promise and hope supported by the funding necessary to make our dreams for america a reality we must give all of our children a chance to learn we must bring all of our people out of the third world existence that they have been relegated to inside the wealthiest nation on earth i believe the budget for new world realities and for rebuilding america is the budget

the same things and all we get is candidates who sound and look the same i think it is clear in some of these things that have happened here in the last couple of days that there are major differences between the two parties i would submit to you that the democrats have more and more defined themselves as the party of government welfare and taxes and more and more it is becoming apparent that the republican party is the party of family work and opportunity and that we divide very clearly along those lines when we get policy issues before us such as we have seen in the last couple of days as we have debated the budget it is very clear in the debates that took place in this chamber today that the democrats do believe that good things come when you spend more money that good things come from bigger and bigger government the more you expand the size of the government the better off you are the more you give to people on welfare programs the better off they are and that we need lots more taxes in order to pay for those kinds of benefits the republican party i think has made it clear that what we believe is that strong families supported by strong work and the opportunities to work and opportunities to invest in that work are what produce the healthy economy a healthy country and a healthy society it has been very clearly demonstrated as the democrats have reacted in the last couple days to president bushs statement that he made a mistake in 1990 when he signed into the budget a deal that raised taxes immediately the majority leader the speaker and the prominent democrats in this body came forward and blasted the president for reneging on the budget deal in fact the majority leader in his speech on the budget here today talked about the fact that the president had reneged on the budget deal by saying that he made that mistakes the president made it quite clear that he thought it was a mistake to have raised taxes because the president now sees the consequences of that decision but the democrats are saying well that was a good decision in fact the speaker in his statement on this said that that decision to raise taxes in 1990 was a wise decision at the time and a wise decision today i wonder how many of the american people believe it was a wise decision to raise taxes the president now understands it was not so wise the democrats do not but then they are the party of taxes now the point here that should be made is that the democrats are also not faithful to the budget deal if it was in fact the president reneging on the budget deal in a vacuum that would be one thing but the democrats are going to bring to us a bill next week to tear down the firewalls within the budget in fact the budget today anticipated they might well do that so when they suggest that what they are doing is being faithful to the budget deal that is not true what they are being faithful to is the taxes that were in the budget deal but as for the spending restraints that were in the budget deal they were to back out of the spending restraints in the budget deal and keep only the taxes and they criticize the president who wants to get rid of the taxes and keep the spending restraints i think that makes it very clear where the two parties are the democrats are the party of government more and more government more and more government spending they are the party of welfare more and more welfare spending so therefore more and more government spending more and more taxes in order to pay for that spending the republican party is for family work and opportunity the only way you can get there is with lower taxes the president now recognizes that what happened in 1990 despite his best intention was wrong that we should not have raised taxes and had an adverse impact on the american people we should not have raised taxes and impeded the ability of society to produce more and we should not have raised taxes and impeded the ability of the society to produce more opportunities for more people that is the difference between the two parties the president now recognizes it was a mistake to raise taxes the democrats still do not see that it was they are always for

there are certain areas of his flexibility provision that i have some serious concerns about i think they are a little too broad i think first of all if we are going to have flexibility it will require a bipartisan agreement so that we can both stand here on the floor and say this is good and we can sell it to the various communities out there who have some concern about it as the disability community does at this time i think the flexibility is too broad in the area of head start they could waive for example health and safety requirements if members have any doubt about them waiving those requirements just look at the child care bill in the child care bill we felt sure we had health and safety protections and they said for certain child care facilities health and safety protection were not even a consideration health and safety requirements could be waived in head start and i am very concerned about that parental involvement in chapter 1 could be waived i am concerned about that another area is the area of assessment the goodling substitute moves the federal government i believe just too rapidly down a road that has not been traveled before i think we should travel that road very carefully and very cautiously i think again that if we can come out here on assessment in a bipartisan fashion we can sell that to the various other people who are

empowerment program another initiative created the safe havens program which would provide assistance for homeless persons unwilling or unable to participate in more structured homeless assistance programs another important change made by this bill is the consolidation of the eligible activities of the mckinney act into one single program for the purpose of streamlining the application process and allowing the applicants to develop much more precisely structured programs finally the bill includes a version of the secretarys choiceinmanagement proposal which will allow tenants in distressed public housing developments to hire new managers to try and provide improved living conditions h r 5334 also addresses two issues which i have had a special interest first is the critically important issue of mixed populationsthat is the housing of the nonelderly handicapped and mentallyill disabled with the elderly i especially want to commend our colleagues mr kleczka and mr donnelly for bringing this issue forward and for working so hard with this member and others to bring about a reasonable solution the overall problem we face even before getting to this specific issue is the fact that there are some 1 5 million lowincome individuals on waiting lists of public housing around the nation there is neither enough public housing units available nor funds for section 8 certificates unfortunately the problem of the deinstitutionalization of the mentally ill continues to persist and affect our housing programs when an individual is released from a state or community mental health facility or a rehabilitation program they can become eligible for public housing or section 8 assistance unfortunately hud has no control over state or local institutions which deal with the mentally ill the handicapped or those recovering from alcohol or drug addiction and because the congress has passed several laws aimed at helping the disabled and handicapped by giving them a preference for federally assisted housing and has created an explosive situation disadvantaging the elderly on long waiting lists in an effort to address the issue h r 5334 permits phas and private federally assisted apartment owners to designate entire buildings or portions of buildings as elderly only this is right to do and is consistent with congressional intent in the section 8 202 housing program at the same time alternative programs are set up by phas for the disabled it permits for the first time the phas and private apartment owners to skip through their waiting lists to find elderly applicants for units which become vacant if no elderly person can be found on the list the phas can next offer the unit to the near elderly that is those 50 years of age or older in return for this the pha and assisted owner is required to submit a plan to hud which would profile the makeup of their current waiting list provide an estimate of anticipated vacancies over a 5year period which would continue to justify the designation of buildings as necessary for the elderly and an estimate of the amount of public housing new development section 8 and modernization funds may be necessary to address the profile the bill also directs the phas and owners to submit requests for section 8 assistance to take care of the needs of the handicapped or mentally ill who would be disadvantaged by the designation of elderly buildings it commits funds reserved for major reconstruction of existing facilities for the reconfiguration of units for use by the mentally ill and handicapped it permits the pha and owner to apply for funds for service coordinators to help find the types of assistance required by the elderly handicapped and mentally ill in addition to these provisions the bill requires each community receiving home funds to include in their comprehensive housing strategy chas a description of the nature and extent of the housing needs of the elderly handicapped and mentally ill and it requires hud to provide a clearinghouse for information on housing alternatives which may be available to the elderly handicapped and the disabled the legislative remedy in this housing bill represents a fair and balanced approach to this issue as far as housing is concerned of course it is not perfect by its nature it would not solve all of the problems but it does provide a positive solution to this problem more needs to be done however before these individuals even get to the point of needing housing other committees of this body must become more insistent that states and local agencies do a better job in the proper planning for the shelter medical and social welfare of these persons before they are released into an unprepared and illequipped community in sum this problem should never have occurred and should not be further exacerbated by state and local policies it is simply not fair to our elderly and is not fair to our handicapped and disabled who need social services and treatment facilities the second issue involves the new comprehensive plan to help test for and abate leadbased paint in our federally assisted and private housing stock the problem of lead paint is pervasive and the effects of lead poisoning are devastating and well documented substantial evidence has emerged over the last few years indicating that many of the current abatement efforts around the country are being performed poorly and that abatement done improperly can do more harm than good the improper removal of leadbased paint has been associated with increased lead dust which is then inhaled or ingested by children knowing this the committees felt that the government needed to develop standards and guidelines and to educate people about the proper techniques to use to abate the lead threat safely we began this process in public housing 3 years ago and through the efforts of secretary kemp that effort is moving forward very well this conference report creates a new initiative to help states and local communities get on with the job of getting the lead out through grants awarded by hud communities will begin the important process of identifying target housing and to help test for the presence of a lead paint hazard this legislation places the burden of addressing this issue on the states and local communities but it does very precisely spell out the role of hud the epa and the department of labor in this combined effort i want to commend our colleagues from the energy and commerce committee mr waxman and mr swifr for their continued commitment to this effort their willingness to help define the role of epa in this effort and for their cooperation with the housing subcommittee during this conference similarly i want to thank chairman ford of the education and labor committee for his work in promoting appropriate worker protection provisions for this lead abatement effort in conclusion the need to reauthorize the very important housing programs in naha which benefit the poor the elderly and the handicapped and the adoption of several new initiatives such as the mixed population issue the consolidation of the mckinney program and others should far outweigh the omission of the few remaining initiatives supported by the secretary the renewed commitment to housing embodied in h r 5334 addresses the plight of both the lowincome

typically a coal miner must put together a medical file gather expert testimony submit to numerous repetitive medical tests and obtain medical witnesses in order to rebut the mountains of evidence that coal companies typically present this bill makes changes in the program which streamline the process making it simpler for coal miners to get the black lung benefits they deserve second it ends the requirement that benefits be repaid if they were once authorized and later sometimes years later reversed the financial and emotional burden caused by this policy is overwhelming and unfair because almost all of the coal miners who receive black lung benefits are people with limited resources the bill restores fairness to the black lung program for miners widows and their families by acknowledging that the government authorized these payments based on the evidence submitted third the bill sets reasonable limits on the evidence which both the miner and coal company can offer at each of its oversight hearings the house subcommittee on labor standards heard the same story volumes of medical reports by armies of doctors are used to refute a single piece of evidence submitted by the miner rarely can a miner match a companys ability to accumulate evidentiary exhibits this legislation stops a wellfinanced coal company from submitting numerous examinations and reams of expert

local farmers can sell their crops making it harder harder for poor countries to feed themselves in the long run as my colleagues know if we dump dried milk on el salvador and it is all right to send some if there is an emergency but if we keep dumping it we are going to destroy a growing dairy industry which is what happened if we give wheat to people in africa various african nations that are

have feared that it prohibits it authorizes the state regulation of production which has the effect of furthering legitimate state interests in resource conservation including the protection of correlative rights that is specifically authorized what is prohibited is regulation of production which has the effect of statewide prorationing on market demand prorationing it does not do it all in fact to the contrary it specifically authorizes those things which our producing colleagues have expressed concern about it is a responsible amendment and i urge its support when it comes to energy resources in this country geography is destinyor more accurately geology is destiny and for the new england stateswith no energy resources of our own our economic destiny depends in large part on how much we have to pay for that energy the northeast depends on oil and a lot of that is imported oil that puts us at the mercy of opec if they want to raise prices all they have to do is limit productionand theres not a whole lot that we can do about it its bad enough that our regions economy is literally at the mercy of foreign powers but with prorationing we have a situation where a handful of statesin our own countryare in a position to determine when or even if our economyand that of the midwest and the west coastrecover enough to finally pull out of the recession that is because these prorationing regulations are going to cost us a lot of money85 million for massachusetts consumers and 136 million for all of new england califomia alone stands to lose half a billion dollars and that is not inconsequential it means higher heating bills for consumers it means higher costs for industrial usersnot only those who use natural gas but for customers of the electric utilities as well right now new england states have among the highest electric rates in the country and our utilities with lower rates are those that are using a lot of natural gas to produce electricity if they have to start paying a lot more for gas ratepayers in new england are going to see their electric bill skyrocket and that means that new england businesses are going to have a lot harder time competing with companies elsewhere we recognize that times are tough for producers right now but the best way for their situation to improve is to increase demand and h r 776 contains several provisions that will helpsimplifying and streamlining the construction and regulation of new pipelines simplifying some environmental procedures price fixing is not fair when opec nations do it and it is no more fair when it is done by producing states prorationing to raise is a bad idea it should be prohibited and i urge agoption of this amendment"], [0.00016194581985473633,

which restore unitedstates funding to the u n population fund unfpa is the largest multilateral family planning assistance provider to developing countries and was established in 1969 with strong backing from the united states in 1990 unfpa provided assistance to 138 countries with donations from 106 countries major donors include japan germany the netherlands norway sweden finland denmark canada the united kingdom switzerland and italy once the leading donor to unfpa the united states curtailed its contributions in 1986 because of allegations of unfpa support for coerced abortion and involuntary sterilization in chinas family planning program this action came despite the fact that unfpa has consistently opposed coercive policies and has explicitly stated this view in all program documents indicating that all unfpa projects must be consistent with internationally and nationally recognized human rights and that all couples and individuals have the basic right to decide freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children and to have the information education and means to do so in addition the agency for international development staff review of unfpa concluded that it neither funds abortions nor supports coercive family planning through its operations in fact almost all of unfpa assistance to china is administered by other united nations organizations and by international nongovernmental organizations such as the world health organization and unicef unfpa does not manage the chinese governments population program assistance from unfpa totals less than 1 1 percent of the total cost of the china program and unfpa has control only over its own funds which are earmarked for specific purposes such as providing better quality contraceptives and extending maternal and child health and family planning assistance to the poorest counties where infant mortality rates are the highest these activities have resulted in fewer unwanted pregnancies thereby resulting in fewer abortions further h r 2508 prohibits the use of united states population funds in china because the unfpa program in china has fixed funding for 4 years the argument that united states funding will free up more unfpa funds for china is also without merit just several weeks ago a coalition of major environmental conservation family planning scientific and womens organizations launched one 3f the largest cooperative efforts ever undertaken to raise public awareness of the devastating effects of overpopulation this effort grew out of the recognition that the environmental and social consequences of overpopulation are not being adequately addressed the worlds population now exceeds 5 4 billion people more than half of this number will be of reproductive age within the next 25 years as a result what we do in this decade will determine the population growth for the next century whether it is held at 10 billion or whether it explodes to more than 14 billion population control is contingent on the availability of voluntary family planning assistance such a commitment is needed in order to curtail global poverty illiteracy environmental degradation unemployment and civil unrest the world fertility survey indicates that 500 million women want and need family planning but lack either education information or the means to obtain it many of the 42 000 infants who die daily are victims because their mothers are not allowing appropriate intervals between pregnancies every day 1 500 die women from complications of pregnancy and abortion many of which could have been prevented by family planning it is imperative that the united states once again become a full and active partner with the united nations in the vital efforts to assure couples of the basic human right to determine how many children they will have and when they will have them as a cosigner of the amsterdam declaration the plan for stabilizing world population by the year 2000 the united states made the commitment to dedicate approximately 4 percent of its foreign aid to population assistance we currently provide only 2 2 percent the 70 million increase provided in this bill will help to move us toward this goal i urge all of my colleagues who are concerned about the quality of life of future generations to vote to retain the family planning provisions of h r 2508 it is a vote that
