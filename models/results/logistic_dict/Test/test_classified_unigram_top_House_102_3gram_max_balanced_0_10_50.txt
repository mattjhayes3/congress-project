committee markups these initiatives include a proposal to allow individuals who are eligible for section 8 assistance to use their certificates for home ownership part of secretary kemps empowerment program another initiative created the safe havens program which would provide assistance for homeless persons unwilling or unable to participate in more structured homeless assistance programs another important change made by this bill is the consolidation of the eligible activities of the mckinney act into one single program for the purpose of streamlining the application process and allowing the applicants to develop much more precisely structured programs finally the bill includes a version of the secretarys choiceinmanagement proposal which will allow tenants in distressed public housing developments to hire new managers to try and provide improved living conditions h r 5334 also addresses two issues which i have had a special interest first is the critically important issue of mixed populationsthat is the housing of the nonelderly handicapped and mentallyill disabled with the elderly i especially want to commend our colleagues mr kleczka and mr donnelly for bringing this issue forward and for working so hard with this member and others to bring about a reasonable solution the overall problem we face even before getting to this specific issue is the fact that there are some 1 5 million lowincome individuals on waiting lists of public housing around the nation there is neither enough public housing units available nor funds for section 8 certificates unfortunately the problem of the deinstitutionalization of the mentally ill continues to persist and affect our housing programs when an individual is released from a state or community mental health facility or a rehabilitation program they can become eligible for public housing or section 8 assistance unfortunately hud has no control over state or local institutions which deal with the mentally ill the handicapped or those recovering from alcohol or drug addiction and because the congress has passed several laws aimed at helping the disabled and handicapped by giving them a preference for federally assisted housing and has created an explosive situation disadvantaging the elderly on long waiting lists in an effort to address the issue h r 5334 permits phas and private federally assisted apartment owners to designate entire buildings or portions of buildings as elderly only this is right to do and is consistent with congressional intent in the section 8 202 housing program at the same time alternative programs are set up by phas for the disabled it permits for the first time the phas and private apartment owners to skip through their waiting lists to find elderly applicants for units which become vacant if no elderly person can be found on the list the phas can next offer the unit to the near elderly that is those 50 years of age or older in return for this the pha and assisted owner is required to submit a plan to hud which would profile the makeup of their current waiting list provide an estimate of anticipated vacancies over a 5year period which would continue to justify the designation of buildings as necessary for the elderly and an estimate of the amount of public housing new development section 8 and modernization funds may be necessary to address the profile the bill also directs the phas and owners to submit requests for section 8 assistance to take care of the needs of the handicapped or mentally ill who would be disadvantaged by the designation of elderly buildings it commits funds reserved for major reconstruction of existing facilities for the reconfiguration of units for use by the mentally ill and handicapped it permits the pha and owner to apply for funds for service coordinators to help find the types of assistance required by the elderly handicapped and mentally ill in addition to these provisions the bill requires each community receiving home funds to include in their comprehensive housing strategy chas a description of the nature and extent of the housing needs of the elderly handicapped and mentally ill and it requires hud to provide a clearinghouse for information on housing alternatives which may be available to the elderly handicapped and the disabled the legislative remedy in this housing bill represents a fair and balanced approach to this issue as far as housing is concerned of course it is not perfect by its nature it would not solve all of the problems but it does provide a positive solution to this problem more needs to be done however before these individuals even get to the point of needing housing other committees of this body must become more insistent that states and local agencies do a better job in the proper planning for the shelter medical and social welfare of these persons before they are released into an unprepared and illequipped community in sum this problem should never have occurred and should not be further exacerbated by state and local policies it is simply not fair to our elderly and is not fair to our handicapped and disabled who need social services and treatment facilities the second issue involves the new comprehensive plan to help test for and abate leadbased paint in our federally assisted and private housing stock the problem of lead paint is pervasive and the effects of lead poisoning are devastating and well documented substantial evidence has emerged over the last few years indicating that many of the current abatement efforts around the country are being performed poorly and that abatement done improperly can do more harm than good the improper removal of leadbased paint has been associated with increased lead dust which is then inhaled or ingested by children knowing this the committees felt that the government needed to develop standards and guidelines and to educate people about the proper techniques to use to abate the lead threat safely we began this process in public housing 3 years ago and through the efforts of secretary kemp that effort is moving forward very well this conference report creates a new initiative to help states and local communities get on with the job of getting the lead out through grants awarded by hud communities will begin the important process of identifying target housing and to help test for the presence of a lead paint hazard this legislation places the burden of addressing this issue on the states and local communities but it does very precisely spell out the role of hud the epa and the department of labor in this combined effort i want to commend our colleagues from the energy and commerce committee mr waxman and mr swifr for their continued commitment to this effort their willingness to help define the role of epa in this effort and for their cooperation with the housing subcommittee during this conference similarly i want to thank chairman ford of the education and labor committee for his work in promoting appropriate worker protection provisions for this lead abatement effort in conclusion the need to reauthorize the very important housing programs in naha which benefit the poor the elderly and the handicapped and the adoption of several new initiatives such as the mixed population issue the consolidation of the mckinney program and others should far outweigh the omission of the few remaining initiatives supported by the secretary the renewed commitment to housing embodied in h r 5334 addresses the plight of both the lowincome renter and the firsttime home buyer this housing bill while not perfect is a step in the right direction i would also like to support those portions of the bill that deal with freddie mac and fannie

opposition to this bill and any mandated leave legislation i do so because a federally mandated benefit can never be flexible enough to adapt to the diverse needs of employers and employees across the country this bill was wellintentioned i think we all agree that every employer who can provide the kinds of benefits outlined in this bill ought to do so but not every good idea makes a good law for the whole nation regardless of the circumstances needs or preferences of individual workers and employers i believe that this bill will harm many more employees than it helps passage of this bill will not expand the benefit pie but simply locking in one benefit which will limit the ability of employers to offer other familyfriendly benefits and reduce the flexibility of employees and employers to negotiate a benefit package that is best for both the assertion that congress can legislate a free luncha benefit without a cost defies common sense i am disappointed that the president waited so long to provide an alternative and believe his alternative to be inadequate however we are not left simply with the two choices of burdensome mandates on businesses as embodied by s 5 or inadequate tax credits which the president proposes members who are philosophically uncomfortable with either of the two extreme positions just mentioned may feel far more at home with the idea i have promoted in h r 1270 the american family protection act i offered this bill as a substitute amendment when h r 2 was itidy cosilered by the house my alternative which would require that an employee returning from qualifying leave be rehired n and when hisiher previous job o a comparable job again comes open goes much farther than a simple business tax credit by providing that an eligible employee be given preferential status for renng for a period of 6 years this legislation asks of business a serious commitment to family ife that is workable and beneficial for both employee and employer however unlike s 5 it does not lead us down the slippery slope of mandating specific employment benefits but promotes the principle that the workplace should be flexible unlike the mandated approach of s 5 this bill does not require that an employer fire a replacement worker in order to fill the job with a returning employee finally in contrast to both proposals it recognizes that parents want and need to spend
