which address and affect the american people across the board i also thank you for being here every week during these special orders it is really raising the level of awareness on the critical issues of our day it takes a lot to do this but thank you for giving us a voice and an opportunity to be with you i join you and our colleagues tonight in the congressional progressive caucus really in strong opposition to the transpacific partnership we are talking about trying to ensure that people do not fall into the ranks of the poor but also that people have pathways out of poverty and into prosperity now here we are looking at another bill h r 3080 which is called the bipartisan trade priorities act of 2014 which would provide the administration with fast track authority for the tpp once again this is not a progressive trade policy it will not allow for people to be employed and get goodpaying jobs but rather just the opposite so unfortunately looking at this really worries many of us that we will fall backwards in terms of more people becoming unemployed let me just be clear up front though in that i do not oppose all trade agreements i support fair and free trade however the notion that congress should provide a rubber stamp for a complex free trade agreement is simply irresponsible and dangerous to our economy and to our constituents they elected us to provide a voice in all of these policies so to shut the congress out of having that seat at the table to me is downright undemocratic the tpp will have a devastating effect on the working class families and communities of color that i represent and that many of us represent it would sacrifice the wellbeing of working americans for the wealth of multinational corporations not to mention that in its current form the tpp would lock in higher prices for popular drugs threatening access to lifesaving medicines including hiv aids drugs for millions of poor and lowincome individuals and families around the world by exporting american jobs to countries where the minimum wage is just 28 cents an hour ceos will continue to get richer while working americans will lose their only sources of income we have seen this happen before past trade agreements have already cost us 3 4 million service sector jobs many of those jobs were in california we simply cannot afford to lose more nafta alone resulted in the net loss of 1 million unitedstates jobs it led to a trade deficit of 181 billion and it devastated the manufacturing sector these agreements have allowed corporations to ship good american jobs overseas while wages benefits and workplace protections and environmental protections are really declining and are denied rather than focusing on trade agreements that will hurt the middle class we really should be focusing on job creation eradicating poverty income inequality and improving economic mobility in 1980 ceos were paid an average of 42 times the salary of a blue collar worker in 2012 that number exploded to 354 times more than the average worker this is unacceptable it is really unconscionable that rather than building pathways to prosperity we are debating measures to make yes the 1 percent richer while holding working families down so i stand in firm opposition to fast track authority and to any final deal that sacrifices american jobs and environmental protections in the name of international corporate profits this must be defeated finally as many of us are talking about tonight we have 1 4 million people who did not receive their unemployment compensation checks this week the republican tea party house has totally abandoned these people who are living on the edge they want to work so it is incumbent upon us to do the right thing on behalf of these people and immediately extend unemployment compensation first of all it is the correct thing to do it is the american thing to do it is the moral thing to do but it is also economically wise to do this so we hope during the district work period next week that republicans hear from their constituents because it is not only democrats who have people who have lost their unemployment compensation but republican constituents all americans who are seeking to work and who want to work and who need that bridge over troubled waters have lost their unemployment checks also i hope for those who are people of faith they really draw from their faith and understand that this is the moment that now is the time to think about the least of these and to remember that we are our brothers and that we are our sisters keepers and that we need to pass unemployment compensation right away and then move forward and increase the minimum wage and hopefully one day increase the minimum wage to really a living wage because that is what the american people deserve thank you again for your leadership and thank you for giving me the chance to be with you tonight"],

colleagues is not by any stretch of the imagination the solution to our problems it is the problem because this is not a budget it is a retreat it is a retreat from the high ideals noble goals and bold dreams that have made this country so great as the author and columnist nicholas kristof recently pointed out a new ranking of livability in 132 countries shows that the united states has fallen to 16th fallen but apparently our republican friends think that is just a little too high we now rank 24th in inequality in the attainment of education but the republican budget would cut pell grants that help lowincome students afford college we rank 29th in life expectancy and 24th in nutrition and basic medical care and the ryan budget would cut funding for food stamps and medicaid and raise the eligibility of medicare we rank just 70th in health and republicans want to repeal the affordable care act and snatch health care coverage away from millions who just received it this is not a budget mr chair this is a call to americans to dream small and aim low this is an attempt to shift costs onto the shoulders of the middle class the young and the elderly in a way that would cripple our ability to compete i believe we are a better people than this and a greater nation look at just about any poll on the subject these days and you can see that americans are most concerned about jobs and growing our american economy what the american people want to see from the congress is a plan that will help accelerate the growth of our economy and create good jobs but the crushing austerity of the ryan plan would do just the opposite this makes no sense because we know what actually works and what actually grows jobs and what doesnt we have seen it and we have lived it the record speaks for itself it shows whose ideas actually work in the real world and whose dont since 1961 the private sector has added a total of 66 million jobs twentyfour million of them were added under republican presidents and a whopping 42 million were added under democratic presidents lets take a look at this chart under president clinton this country grew a whopping 22 6 million jobs and he left office running an annual surplus of over 128 billion projected to grow into the trillions then under the 8 years of president bush we added only 1 2 million jobswhat a stark differenceand the budget surplus was turned into an annual 1 4 trillion deficit when president obama took office our economy was shedding over 800 000 jobs a month and the bush administration left office with the worst job creation record in 75 years nevertheless in the 5 years since president obama took office we have created 4 7 million jobs nearly four times what was created under president bush and we have more than halved the annual deficit the actions swiftly implemented by the president and democratic congress quickly turned the economy around and job losses diminished and as this next chart shows those actions have worked we have been gaining jobs for the last 49 months in that time the economy has added 8 9 million private sector jobs regaining more than all of the jobs lost during the great recession this chart shows what i call the deep red republican valley where we were shedding over 800 000 jobs a month since president obama took office with his economic plan we have been growing jobs democrats understand that in order to maintain our leadership in the world economy america needs to continually sharpen its competitive edge and we understand that while investing in the future may carry some risk refusing to do so carries an ironbound certainty the certainty of a slow decline and crippling decay instead of investing in the future and in the next generation the ryan budget guts funding for education workforce training critical infrastructure scientific research public health clean energy advanced manufacturing and public safety all the investments needed to make the american economy of tomorrow competitive and put us on the cutting edge instead of fully preparing the next generation for tomorrows economy the ryan budget cuts funding for early childhood education k12 education special education and higher education it slashes grants and charges students more interest on their college loans it lets the higher education tax cut expire saddling our young people with even more student loan debt and we know now that student loan debt is now larger than credit card debt in our country it is a crippling concern sadly the cuts extend far beyond education the ryan budget proposes draconian cuts to nutrition assistance home heating assistance and rental assistance snap which provides food security for millions of american children is cut more than 135 billion and 200 000 fewer women and children would get basic nutrition through the wic program we can all agree that the economic recovery has been too slow and yet this republican budget cuts critical investments to create jobs and enhance our competitiveness in 2015 alone the budget cuts 52 billion from efforts to update our crumbling transportation infrastructure that amounts to over 1 5 million jobs the budget cuts the national institutes of health and national science foundation threatening our edge in medical and scientific innovation the republican budget even eliminates funding for the arts humanities and public broadcasting which support the institutions that enrich our lives and chronicle our cultural and artistic heritage further the ryan budget would cut health care funding and increase costs for seniors it would raise the age to qualify for medicare to 67 and bring back the dreaded doughnut hole that leaves too many seniors to choose between their medication and putting food on the table after nearly a century of talking about doing it we have finally expanded health care to cover more americans yes there have been bumps along the way as there have been with the implementation of transformational social programs like with medicare and part d prescription drugs but the important thing is that it is working already 7 million people have signed up through the health insurance marketplaces and another 3 million young adults have been able to remain on their parents health plans until they turn 26 under the ryan plan these 10 million americans who thought at long last they had reliable and affordable health care insurance would have it snatched away from them but it is even worse than that by 2024 a staggering total of 40 million people would become uninsured under the ryan plan the cbo projects that 25 million people who would have gained coverage under the affordable care act will instead have to go without it and there are another 14 to 20 million people who would lose insurance as a result of the block granting and medicaid cutting laid out in the ryan budget after 53 failed attempts to repeal the affordable care act the ryan budget hopes to succeed in taking us backwards to those dark days when people with preexisting conditions couldnt get coverage when protections against lifetime limits didnt exist nocost preventive services like mammograms and cervical cancer screenings would be no more it would take us back to a time when women were charged more just because they were women and when the insurance companies called the shots from the smallest children to the oldest seniors who rely on medicaid for health care and to cover longterm health bills the ryan medicaid cuts will negatively affect literally millions women who make up almost 70 percent of adult medicaid beneficiaries will especially feel the sting the most vulnerable will be hurt the most mr chair budgets are about choices and we face a truly watershed choice now we can choose to continue to do things that have lifted the hopes of millions provided unparalleled opportunities and made our country the envy of the world we can choose to continue to help those who need it the most and provide a measure of care to those who have the least or we can choose to go down a radically different road concede the future to the bold defer to others expect less and turn our faces away from the downtrodden and the dispossessed yes we can make that choice but please mr chair lets stop referring to this as a budget and call it what it really is a retreat

in this body whether it be the draconian cuts that appeared in the house republican budget the slashing of food stamps and assistance to the most needy in this country to see a republican finally stand up and talk about poverty we were excited and we want to have that conversation this evening so just what is in congressman paul ryans plan to help alleviate poverty i am sure it must be something about raising the minimum wage to 10 10 in the next 3 years so that we can help lift people who are making 15 000 a year out of poverty i am sure it addresses equal pay for equal work so that men and women are paid for doing the same work but it doesnt appear that is part of paul ryans plan i am sure it addresses some educational issues i am sure it helps people pay back their loans at lower rates and makes sure we have expanded pell grants available so that no one should be denied a higher education simply because they cant afford it no that is not part of the ryan plan either i am sure there is an investment in early childhood education because every person in this room must surely know that if we help invest at those earliest years you can have a lifetime of experiences and

amendment as has been explained provides additional funds to the congressional office of compliance this is the agency that really is tasked with making sure that members of congress andvery importantly most importantlytheir staff are aware of what their individual rights are and how to protect themselves against sexual harassment in the workplace unfortunately sometimes it seems like the members might be protected but perhaps their staffs are not as well aware and protected as they need to be this is certainly not a partisan issue we have seen incidents over the years of republicans and of democrats both sides of the aisle here actually this week i met with senior staff at the ooc i met with all the board members there we talked about what kind of additional training might be helpful when we put together our new members orientation program in the fall various kinds of things that we can do and of course they needed a little bit more cash to be able to really step up particularly on the internet and various things and do awareness training so this amendment i think is very important certainly congress needs to be held to the highest standards and at a minimum we ought to be held to the same standards that we hold private businesses to out in the marketplace and the workplace every employee that works on this hill needs to work in an environment that they feel is free from sexual harassment and if they feel threatened in any way they need to be able to be sure that they understand their rights and what recourse they have to protect themselves without any fear of retribution i think congress needs to be a leader on this issuea leaderand i certainly feel that by conducting awareness training that will help stop any unfortunate situation and if we dont stop it certainly then allowing an individual to protect themselves that i think is an important thing for all of us so again i thank the gentlelady from california for offering the amendment and i

change over those three decades since the signing of the taiwan relations act in 1979 the unitedstates and taiwan have forged a closer partnership to improve cultural and economic relations between our nations our partnership has been instrumental in maintaining peace and security across the taiwan strait and throughout east asia while it is important to mark this historic anniversary we also should take this opportunity to affirm ourthat is to say the americancommitment as a reflection of that todays bill authorizes the president to transfer up to four surplus unitedstates naval vessels to taiwan taiwan has been a valued partner in combating global terrorism and delivering humanitarian relief when needed chinas recent declaration of an air defense identification zone and subsequent provocation toward other ships in the region has raised concerns about the possibility of escalation and provocation that makes the security posture of friends like taiwan even more precarious and more important and underscores the need for us to continue this defense partnership the bill also as the chairman indicated authorizes the transfer of surplus naval vessels two each to mexico and thailand both critical defense partners of this nation these transfers will enhance the ability of those countries to collaborate with the unitedstates navy on joint or support operations the bill also provides an overdue modernization of the congressional review process for the licensing of unitedstates defense exports under the new criteria congressional review will focus on major defense exports the bill also will help advance the presidents export control reform initiative which has long been a priority for the hightech community which i am proud to represent in northern virginia i

miller for their support and collaboration on creating momentum for this policy that will be a critical step towards preventing child sex trafficking i appreciate both their insight and assistance in bringing this bill to the floor today i also want to thank the gentleman from pennsylvania representative marino he has been a tireless advocate for children in the foster care system mr marino along with the congressional caucus on foster youth cochairs representatives mcdermott and bachmann all served as original cosponsors of the strengthening child welfare response to trafficking act and their continuing commitment to transforming the child welfare system has brought national attention to the intersection between child sex trafficking and the child welfare system the unitedstates department of justice reports that more than 300 000 children in the country are at risk of sexual commercial exploitation and trafficking each year these are 300 000 too many and tragically this number shows that a comprehensive and aggressive response is needed in order to combat child trafficking throughout the country in my city the los angeles county probation department reports that 61 percent of identified trafficking victims are foster youth the los angeles star court is a specialized collaborative courthouse designed to serve commercially exploited youth and reports that 80 percent of these girls have been previously involved in the child welfare system as cochair of the congressional caucus on foster youth i have had the opportunity to travel throughout the country as part of our nationwide listening tour unfortunately the stories i have heard from advocates and youth is that children in the child welfare system continue to be preyed upon by traffickers who use their vulnerability as an opportunity to exploit them the stories that emerge are those like carolines a young girl who grew up in a household where she was physically sexually and emotionally abused when caroline was just 13 years old a 35yearold man attended a sporting event at her school and deceived her into believing that he loved her and would give her the attention she craved instead this man began to sell caroline to numerous men for sex throughout this time she had many encounters with the child welfare system but no one picked up that she was a victim of trafficking the social workers did not have the training or the proper tools to assess that she needed specialized services our bill would ensure that children like caroline do not slip through the cracks as state and county child welfare departments have protection plans that will outline provisions and procedures to identify and assess all reports of children known or suspected to be victims of sex trafficking state systems do not currently have the proper protections services or protocols to adequately serve those in the system who have been victims of trafficking states also lack such support for victims who enter the child welfare system in fact during a site visit recently on the foster youth caucus listening tour to missouri a law enforcement officer told us that he had no other option but to arrest the girls to ensure that they receive the proper services in los angeles the child sex trafficking unit of the county probation department specifically addresses the needs of child victims and it is the only such division in the country i commend their critical work and commitment to ensure the trafficking victims receive the resources they need we must not continue to arrest these children in order to provide them with these services our bill will be a first step toward ensuring that there are policies and procedures in place to connect child sex trafficking victims to public or private specialized services last year in a meeting with children in the child sex trafficking unit of the los angeles county probation department the girls all echoed the same sentiment while they were grateful to have the resources they needed to begin to deal with their trauma they felt stigmatized by having to be arrested in order to receive these services our bill would ensure that each state has a training plan for child protective service workers to appropriately respond to reports of trafficking so that trafficked children would be provided the same resources as youth in the child welfare system and be classified as victims of crime not as criminals we have story after story across the country of children being raped and sold as if they were little more than objects but we do not have the concrete data to help them find the appropriate services h r 5081 requires that within 1 year the department of health and human services report to congress on the prevalence and types of trafficking they have encountered many advocates believe that labor trafficking is also a critical issue with children in the child welfare system the reality is we need hard data to evaluate what is happening to the children so that proper resources can be allocated in the future our bill also allows states to establish the same policy and procedures for children if they are victims of labor trafficking the report will also assess state practices used to identify and serve trafficking victims and federal laws and policies that may prevent states from supporting these victims including the absence of trafficking in the federal definition of child abuse and neglect under capta the child abuse prevention and treatment act these critical steps to reforming our child welfare system will help ensure that victims are provided with the same resources and access as other children i strongly urge my colleagues to support our bill and continue to build momentum to combat domestic child sex trafficking
