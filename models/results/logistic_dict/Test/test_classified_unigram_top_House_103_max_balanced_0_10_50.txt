vision for reform compromise by the major political parties and insistence on integrity in the electoral process by mexican voters significantly more than 90 percent of the eligible population is included in the new electoral registry and an estimated 22 to 27 million voters are expected to go to the polls on the 21st of this month all signs indicate that this election will likely result in the largest voter turnout in mexican history the reform and modernization of mexicos political process is of particular importance to the united states because of our geographic proximity our strong ethnic and cultural ties our economic bonds and a common aspiration for democracy i believe house concurrent resolution 250 as amended reflects our respect for the breadth of electoral reforms already undertaken by the salinas government and our expectations of an honest fair and transparent process house concurrent resolution 250 recognizes the significant reforms which have been made such as broadening the impartiality of the federal electoral institutes general council screening for accuracy in the voter registry list protecting the right of fair media access and reforming the criminal code to add teeth to anticorruption initiatives president salinas should be applauded for the commitment he has made during his term to these historic changes which promise to change the face of the

23 of presidential candidate luis donaldo colosio undeterred however in pushing reform the mexican election will be marked by a plethora of firsts the universal use of transparent ballot boxes the most accurate and meticulously prepared registry list the most candidates who are seeking the presidency the largest number of election officials television debate among the presidential candidates and extensive press coverage of the elections the mexican electorate has understandably raised its expectations of a transparent and fair electoral process with transparency at all levels and they must determine whether or not the outcome reflects the voters will on july 12 the presidential candidates from eight of the nine political parties signed a historic agreement for civility harmony and justice only the democratic revolutionary party decided it would not sign this accord the agreement recognizes that democracy is a system that guarantees our unity as a nation without undermining regional diversities or the ethnic religious political and cultural pluralities that identify and enrich us the political parties committed themselves to proceed with strict adherence to the law to ensure greater access opening objectivity and impartiality from the media coverage of the election and to encourage open and pressurefree participation by the electorate the document recognizes that it is not through violence that democratic progress will be accomplished the establishment of democracy can only nuture itself through the improvement of institutions in the republic and as a result of broad participation by society the election is likely to be one of theif not the most important in mexican history as our neighbors south of the border elect a new president 500 members of the

pay taxes to the united states government under convention people employed by international institutions do not pay taxes to the country in which the institution is located the kasich amendment would cut 56 million but in fact it has the impact because it is leveraged 118 times which makes it undoubtedly the most single costeffective element in our entire foreign aid budget and the impact would be to lose 6 6 billion in world bank lending the united states currently has a procurement benefit to our industries of about 1 billion as a result of projects fuhded by the ibrd this jeopardizes the

unfortunately most of those impacts that you hear about that you read about are 10 years old because of dramatic reforms that were pushed by the congress during the conable administration of the bank it has been a remarkable turnaround this year alone the world bank will be lending over s2 billion for projects which promote and benefit the environment last year for example the world bank lent

ratio because of international burdensharing and bringing in the private capital markets tell me where you can find that kind of leverage elsewhere in an international program or a unitedstates government program the world bank is a wellrun institution formerly headed by our esteemed colleague from new york mr barber conable and presently headed by mr lewis preston the distinguished and able former head of j p morgan bank it has a triple aaa credit rating on wall street it finances all of its operating costs out of service charges on loans paid by borrowing countries none of the 56 million we are talking about here goes to pay a penny of the world banks administrative costs this contribution pays the unitedstates equity share in the capital of the institution and determines the weight of the unitedstates voice in board discussions the unitedstates is currently the largest single shareholder and perceived leader of the institutions other countries would jump at the chance to pass the united states in shares and influence in the board of the single largest financial ir stitution in the world if we give them the chance remember it only costs them about 60 million to pick up

gave more than an elghteenfold return on the 62 million congress appropriated for the ibrd in fiscal year 1993 this is the type of costeffective contribution the amendment would cut because the world bank can mobilize more assistance at a far lower budget cost than bilateral aid the united states consistently relies on the world bank to address country and regional issues of critical importance to

targeted as horror stories but what is important is what the currently approved projects look like all projects now have an environmental impact assessment prepared and a substantial portion of the world banks portfolio this yearover 2 billlon wlll go to projects that promote and benefit the environment according to treasury estimates the gentleman from qhlo is concerned about resettlement issues so is this member the world bank pulled out of the narmada dam project in india this year because of the inadequate implementation of resettlement policies by the government of india there is no stronger way for the institution to send a message about the need for careful consideration of the rights of those displaced and disadvantaged by development projects this member believes that there continue to be reforms needed in the world bank this view is strongly shared by the management of the world bank which commissioned the recent wapenhans study of the quality of bankfinanced projects serious measures are being considered for action to address quality problems and to open the banks policies to more public scrutiny and review in order to spot emerging problems earlier without effective unitedstates advocacy on the board of the world bank these concerns may never receive the attentionand support they deserve other governments do not take nearly as proactive a position on environmental and management reform efforts in the ibrd as the united states has taken and continues to take for these reasons i strongly urge opposition to this amendment it will eliminate the most costeffective item in this entire bill and dramatically reduce unitedstates influence in the major institution of the international economic arena economic policy and trade are emerging as the central arenas of competition in the postcoldwar world and this member would not want to erode our capabilities and preparedness especially by the type of unilateral disarmament action

scheduled for floor action this congress originating from the subcommittee on oceanography gulf of mexico and the outer continental shelf where i serve as ranking republican member our marine environment constantly faces a number of growing and devastating pressures that impact our natural resources as a result problems such as overharvesting of our fish resources coastal and marine jpollution ard the destruction of coastal habitats have occurred this coupled with other growing problems indicate that it is time to develop effective management and enhancement programs that are designed to improve our marine ecosystem marine biotechnology does just that in addition the marine environment has proven to be a veritable bounty of useful drugs and other products for example a group of chemicals have been isolated from sponges and used to combat certain viruses and cancers as well as provide relief from arthritis and gout other cancerfighting compounds have been found in sea squirts and coral has been used to aid bone grafts and let us not forget that old medicine chest remedy cod liver oil president bush initiated a marine biotechnology research drive through the national sea grant college program in the 1980s while small this program has been an effective inducement in developing research ideas the time is now to expand the program and elevate marine biotechnology so that it receives the attention it deserves this legislation does so i also want to commend chairman studds for the effort he has made to accommodate those who are concerned about the possible environmental risks posed by marine biotechnology which involves the release of genetically manipulated marine species while we have not quite developed to the point where we can have an underwater jurassic park there is some real concern that improper containment of modified marine organisms could disrupt marine environments i also understand the concerns of the research community that placing prohibitive restrictions on such work is unnecessary i find that the compromise presented here in chairman studds amendment is a reasonable one we should all commend chairman gerry studds and chairman solomon ortiz of the oceanography subcommittee for their leadership in this fascinating and worthwhile area of research i urge support for the bill and the committee amendment"]]}
