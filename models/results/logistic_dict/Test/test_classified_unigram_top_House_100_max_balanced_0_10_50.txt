testimony did for the american people before oliver north took the stand the american people were taking their kids out to little league games and catching a flash of the television and maybe hearing a little radio on their way to work and maybe on saturday night going to the bowling alley they would catch a little flash on the electronic media the point is that central america is complicated most congressmen until the central american situation arose knew little about central america we knew more about europe than we did about our own hemisphere the american people were busy they work they have not had as much time as we do to scrutinize the situation and get the facts about half of the american people did not know what side we were on about half of them thought that we were on the side of the communist sandinistas they confused the sandinistas with el salvador and in el salvador it is a democratic government with communist guerrillas in nicaragua it is a communist government and the freedom fighters are guerrillas what north did was to elevate the debate and take the shroud off this debate that liberal democrats have liked and have worked to append to this entire issue the point is that it is much easier if you are a liberal in america to talk about ollie norths life and times and ask why he got the snow tires or whatever than it is to explain to the american people what we are going to do about the soviets building bomber bases in our own hemisphere or what we are going to do about the soviets building naval ports that can accommodate attack submarines a few hundred miles from the panama canal that was i think the great genius of oliver norths testimony that he raised the visibility of this issue and he framed the real issue and the real issue is are we going to let the russians establish this beachhead now we have debated and we have tortured ourselves over this issue and we finally decided to spend 100 million for the resistance fighters i just got back

went out and i memorized it at the time another one our ship is sinking our light is going out do not let the bolshevik tide overrun us that was radio free hungary and then it went off the air my wife was as pregnant as you can get with our second child bob junior who was born november 9 1956 a few days later i kissed my 9month pregnant wife goodbye we went down to operations we drew up our maps to fly to seymour johnson air force base in north carolina and then to the azores and then to a nato country and i do not mind saying what country it wasturkey we were going to stage out of there with what was then the worlds best fighter aircraft the soviets had no supersonic aircraft at that time except in a dive these were production straight and level f100 supersabers capable of supersonic straight flight in afterburn we were going to stage out of there and support the hungarian freedom fighters after all we had told them over radio free europe to revolt and we told them for months that under a 5star general and a pretty good president ike eisenhower everything cut loose that month the suez canal was going on britain and france and israel fighting the egyptians and eisenhower had a mild heart attack everything kind of went to heck eisenhowers vice president richard nixon was at the bridge watching the people come across as in the darkness tonight because managua is on chicago time just 1 hour earlier so it is 6 20 dark down there now still in winter and they are now coming across in the drought to low level across the rio cocos river which constitutes more than twothirds of the border between honduras and nicaragua those kids are coming across fording that some of them are wading dragging their compatriots freedom fellow fighters so that scence at the andau bridge is going on right now nixon witnessed that and told me he could never forget that it haunted him we told them to revolt and indicated we would help them and 7 days lateri looked this upi looked up how many members are in this chamber that were here in april 1961 when we did recruit and train and clothe and arm and put on the beach at the bay of pigs another latin fighting force with promises of air cover twentyone members where here including bob michel our leader and our other great leader as great as bob bill broomfield his colleague from michigan our senior man on foreign affairs they were here mo udall missed being here by 13 days that is the cutoff point he won a special election 13 days later but those 21 must have sat here and the house did not have responsibility then that was all a covert operation that had been set up initially under president eisenhower and john f kennedy opted to execute but pulled off the air cover now the words of the beach commander i usd to know his name fernando something his code name was pepe his words on april 19 the day it was all collapsing as two sovietexcuse the freudiantwo cuban given by us t33 jets which had been turned into p80 shooting star fighters because they put the 455caliber machine guns back in the nose our intelligence did not see that even with the best satellites you cannot see what is happening in hangars they were strafing the beach and they had tanks on the bluffs they were raking thesepeople in the crossfire so the beach commander the enrique bermudez of that operation who miraculously survives to this day to tell this horrible story is up to his knees in the surf and he is saying command that is the united states command this is pepe we are in the surf we are engaging in handtohand combat where is the promised air cover my men are being slaughtered do not let us die like dogs in the water give us the air cover where is the air cover and the dilettante nice man but he had a problem with coming to decisions in his life executing them the ambassador up at the u n adlal stevensona littleknown story about mr stevenson as a young boy he picked up a 22 rifle that he and some friends had been dealing with in a wealthy home in the chicago area as young lads they were doing the manual of arms with it and a little 13yearold girl a family friend appeared in the doorway and he inexplicablynobody could figure out kids do strange thingshe picked up the rifle and fired at the young girl and struck her between the eyes killing her dead on the spot without being an amateur psychiatrist people have analyzed for years that that incident which haunted his life a few weeks later as though she were still alive the little girl as though she were still alive in the letters that were found with no mention that he had killed her accidentally a few weeks before some people say that is why he was never able to come to a decision but he was in the u n and called up president kennedy and said how can you embarrass me with this incident he had been clued in on the intelligence operation of trying to liberate the cubans from 30 years of horrors and aids the aids epidemic that they brought back from central africa the killing of black young men and women freedom fighters that they are doingengaged in right now with soviet officers in angola right now that summer offensive is still trailing off with the forces of freedom probably going to win that one or at least fight to a standstill until the next dry season when the soviets will put in more armor more migs and more commanders down to the company and battalion level but with this order of adlai stevenson telling kennedy call off the air cover or i will quit kennedy supposedly a naval officer and a man of action in the south pacific called off the air cover those men were slaughtered i guess the only answer was pepe swim for it baby i do not know how you say that in spanish they started to swim out some of our young coast guardsmen navy men who were driving those landing ships the oldfashioned open type like at tarawa iwo jima with the falp in the front where you hear the bullets hittling tile flap and you are on the other side right before it does down and worrying about whether a bullet is going to catch you in the face some of those men came into the beach and circled under firewe lost some of thoseand tile men that survived that sinking got out and made it to other landing barges and they went out to the coast now what was classified top secret until recently is the unitedstates aircraft carrieri asked tom moorer in our republican study committee hearings if this was all true because he was then commander of the joint chiefs of staff from 1972no he was in a naval assignment he was commander in the pacific later in the seventies he became the chairman of the joint chiefs i said was not the unitedstatess essex not off the coast with the promised air cover he said yes i said did they not have the navy version of the f86 sabres called the fk fury on the decks ready loaded with bombs and bullets to give help to those men on tile beaches yes he said and i said were those planes spraypainted with the american insignias off as though they would be part of this strange covert operation of these mysterious unmarked you know americanprofile jet fighters shooting down the two t33s and buzzing the beach and he said yes absolutely what is also not known by most people in this or the other body is that the alabama national guard played a role in that because they were then flying obsolete b26 dodglas invader bombers they took them off active duty you know you put the resignation down in the bottom drawer of the squadron commander they went to nicaragua and appeared hence this obsession of castro to crush nicaragua and make it communist someday out of nicaragua a long 6 7hour flight to the combat zone these men from the alabama guard flew these older b26s they were to hit and take out the cuban air force on the evening of april 16 to set up the invasion the next day on the 17th they were sharpthey pulled off that raid and they did not catch these t33s with the guns in them making them shooting star fighters then the next day they came back the t33s shot down the alabama guard b26s one of the commanders one of the pilots a colorful character known all through the guard squadrons of the united states at that time because he weighed over 250 pounds was named riley shamberger you could not miss his portly body his body his corpse laid there in the wreckage of his b26 castro went over and put his foot on captain riley shambergers corpse and bragged about his t33s had shot down the one little effort of our air power used on the eve of this bay of pigs tragedy in our history and kennedy said he will never again believe anybody in government he got his answer quickly the next year with the missile crisis of october when nucleartipped missiles were in cuba what is the lesson we ought to learn from that here is the advice and i solicit please your comments what i would have done had i been president kennedy was i would have said look the men are getting slaughtered and if we are not going to give them air cover to try and make a successful beachhead and see if the people will get rid of this communist castro who betrayed his revolution as did he and his brother and the ortega brothers have we must at least give air cover to the rescue operation lets startlets call it a failure and lets extract these cuban lads that we put on the beach the 2506 brigade i will never forget president kennedy in the orange bowl holding up the flag which the survivors begged for years and finally got back from senator ted kennedy and kennedy held up that flag and said someday this banner will fly again over a free cuba holding up the banner that they rescued off the beach in the last terrible moments when we deserted them if i had been president kennedy i would have said extract them give them cover and try to save as many lives as we can because i have decided not to give air cover to the military operation you and i mr burton flew in honduran jets last september september 5 we flew in those little casa 101s one of them had a c47 painted on the side where they had shot down a drug airplane we saw the morale of those pilots the commander navarro who i flew with you flew with one of the young squadron commanders what the gentleman did not see and what i saw on a subsequent trip up at la ceiba on the coast were the ones flying the israeli super mysteres the very planes that turned back the arab attempt to annihilate israel in the lighting war of 1967 those young pilots when i went and walked in if i squinted i would not have told them from americans or british or fighter pilots anywhere in the world those young guys are straining at the bit tonight as we speak to take the few viable super mysteres that are left and go down to that nicaraguan border never penetrate their airspace just defend the sovereign soil of honduras and shoot those an26s and mi17s out of the air and the only reason they are probably not going down there is because president azcona whom we met with the next night and told him of our flying with his great young pilots in the honduran air force is wondering if we are going to follow through are we going to do to honduras what we did to thailand and malaysia pull out of this whole mess and stare down the barrel of this hemisphere and watch the consolidation of another communist country and then duartes fragile democracy begin to unravel as the farabundo marti continue their newly returned urban terror what are we going to do i suggest the least the president can do and i am telling him this through tile television in front of the american people who track this house the very least we should do is unleash the honduran fighter pilots many of them trained in this country their planes reworked up here in texas to keep them flyable these 25yearold frenchbuilt mysteres if we will not unleash them and not get them involved but just back them up that we will protect for example their bases at palmerola and la ceiba if we will not do that much then i think we owe it to ricky bermudez who stood in that hallway when i asked george miller of california to conic out and at least meet the military commander and he says i am not going to meet with any of your thugs dornan we owe it to bcrmudez and his men to maybe violate their airspace not to prosecute with some military operation but to do the minimum that kennedy failed to do and that is to give cover even if it is with our navy airplanes introducing combat americans only in a rescue operation to tell these hondurans lets get out of it we are getting the men out we are getting the nicaraguan kids out of there we are going to give them cover and extract them in amnerciful rescue operation and there would not be ally shooting if we told ortega you win this round you commie you communist you but you had better back off and let us get these kids out of there that we put in there and we will bring them to the united states hopefully to settle them at fort worth in your district jim waights district now what do you think mr burton of at least a rescue operation if we are not going to do anything else

the attorney general of the united states that an independent counsel be appointed to pursue the revelations that were coming forward from the downing of a c123 cargo plane on october 5 of that same year laden with munitions that seemed to have apparently been involved with private efforts to support the contras from this humble beginning and the outpouring of other events related to this we now find ourselves in the incredible and very difficult situation that now engulfs the executive branch of the government so i wanted to thank my colleagues the gentleman from california mr don edwards the gentleman from connecticut mr bruce morrison the gentleman from michigan mr george crockett the gentleman from massachusetts mr barney frank the gentleman from wisconsin mr robert kastenmeier our former colleague from ohio john seiberling the gentlewoman from colorado mrs patricia schroeder the gentleman from california mr howard berman the gentleman from ohio mr feighan and the gentleman from west virginia mr staggers those colleagues of ours on the judiciary committee it seems to me have done a very very important service to this nation in determining that long ago some 5 months ago we were in need of an independent counsel to investigate these activities in connection with that petition to the courts and to the attorney general it was required that we present some theory of the activities that would justify the courts complying with our request that an independent counsel or special prosecutor be appointed so we had to construct from that point of view some indication of a factual nature as to what may have happened that would require the granting of our request and i would like now to just go back over that with the members we must remember that this was back in october of 1986 and here is the submission that we made to the department of justice we said this it has been reported that in december 1983 a series of meetings involving lt col oliver north central intelligence agency director william casey the vice president of the united states george bush thenwhite house counselor edwin meese theninterior secretary william clark and president ronald reagan and others took place to plan a supply network to the contras it is said that these efforts were undertaken in anticipation of congressional prohibitions on aid to the armed rebels lt col oliver north is reported to have been given principal responsibility in administering the supply operation and is reported to have had frequent contact with the contras through intermediaries including united states general retired singlaub and robert owen donald gregg the vice presidents national security advisor and retired general richard secord were also detailed to assist the coordination of the network it is also reported that the unitedstates officials planned to fund the nicaraguan rebels through highly unusual and illegal methods on november 25 1986 attorney general edwin meese acknowledged in a press conference that funds obtained from arms sales to iran had been transferred to the nicaraguan contras lt col oliver north and national security advisor john poindexter were said to be immediately involved several trips to iran paid for with united states funds seem to have been made by united states officials or representatives to discuss arrangements news organizations reported that chief of staff donald regan had been informed and approved the details of the iran arms sales it also was reported by news organizations on november 27 1986 that documents might have been destroyed relating to the arms sales to iran and benefits from those sales derived and forwarded to the contras the initial supply network plan was reportedly drafted by lt col oliver north and to have been approved by thennational security council counselor robert mcfarlane and president reagan from 1984 to 1986 when direct or indirect unitedstates official involvement with the contras was prohibited by law the supply network seems to have flourished the supply network seemed to involve the use of unitedstates funds at air bases and elsewhere in violation of unitedstates law unitedstates officials were alleged to have been involved in and knowledgeable of activities that may have constituted felonies including illegal arms shipments neutrality law violations foreign agents registration act violations and other criminal acts during the 2 years in which legal prohibitions on involvement with the contras were in place key individuals who say that they were involved in the supply efforts claimed to have frequent contact with administration officials and that their activities were known to those officials general singlaub for instance who acknowledged publicly his principal role in the supply efforts said in a 60 minutes interview with mike wallace on october 5 1986 that he kept informed cia director william casey about his activities in supplying the contras with military aid and received encouragement from him there were also reports singlaub acknowledged clearing his actions with north and meeting frequently with cia director william j casey the hearst syndicate also reported on may 15 1986 that general singlaub operating with unitedstates gov ernment approval agreed to provide arms and other supplies to nicaraguan rebel leader eden pastora also during the time in which the restrictions were in place public funds are reported to have been used to assist efforts to supply the contras department of defense funds are said to have been used to upgrade military airfields at ilopango in el salvador aguacate jamastran and mocoron funds are also reported to have been used to maintain safehouses pay telephone bills and other activities that may be directly related to the supply network flight logs also showed that pilots involved in the supply efforts including one killed in the october 5 downing of the c123 which had eugene hasenfus aboard had flown to sensitive unitedstates military bases including bases inside the united states where classified military research is conducted individuals receiving public moneys including official contracts seem to have been involved in aiding the contras and administering the supply network john hull an american with cia connections who lives in costa rica is reported to have received 10 000 monthly from the nsc in 1984 and 1985 to coordinate contra operations it was alleged during that time that robert owen who received contracts from nhao used oliver norths office in his capacity as unofficial liason to the contras and fundraiser for them it is also reported that robert owen worked to aid the contras through private channels while working as a consultant to the nhao at the state department two sources are said to have told senator kerrys staff that they witnessed owen engaged in arranging a weapons transaction with adolfo calero in the united states in the period when the boland amendment was in force illegal arms shipments were alleged to have transpired and the office of the unitedstates attorney commenced investigation into them in miami one such shipment seems to have originated from fort lauderdalehollywood fl airport on march 6 1985 and was coordinated by john hull and robert owen who met the shipment at ilopango military base in el salvador francisco chanes who is an official of legal humanitarian aid is also alleged to have been involved in the arms shipment any administration involvement in this incident or knowledge of it and failure to report it could constitute a criminal violation key law enforcement officials who may have feared public and congressional reaction to revelations of illegalities on the part of the contras and their associates may have exerted pressure to slow or halt the investigation at this point information obtained by senator kerry does not seem to have been acknowledged or acted upon at that time two unnamed law enforcement officials in an interview said that attorney general meese and former deputy attorney general lowell jensen applied pressure to slow the investigation of illegal arms shipment from hollywood airport the c123 cargo plane downed on october 5 1986 revealed additional information an identification card found in the wreckage of the downed c123 identified captured flier eugene hasenfus as an adviser in the unitedstatesa group at the ilopango air base in el salvador entrance onto the base by americans was said to require approval by unitedstates officials hasenfus it had been frequently reported was recruited by members of the network established by the administration an unnamed salvadoran familiar with cia activities in el salvador and also knowledgeable of the supply operation is quoted as saying do you think the salvadoran government would let hundreds of guns and big airplanes fly in and out of here for more than a year taking stuff to the guerrillas if the united states government didnt tell them to approving access to the base maintained with unitedstates funds could constitute unauthorized assistance subsequently hasenfus is quoted as saying that 24 to 26 cia personnel acted as flight crews and maintenance crews that they were also involved in refueling of flights that came through ilopango and that they helped create the flight plans all fuel at ilopango is thought to be purchased by either the cia the pentagon or the unitedstates military aid program at a press conference hasenfus is reported to say that max gomez and another cia employee were responsible for the logistics and flight plans for private contra supply flights mr gomez it is recalled was recommended by none other than the vice president of the united states national advisor mr donald gregg to the salvadoran air force as a counterinsurgency specialist and the distinguished vice president of the united states mr busn and mr gregg are reported to have met with gomez on at least two occasions mr gomez is also reported to have dined with the ambassador to el salvador mr edwin corr the ambassador stated at one point that he did not know mr gomez several days after that statement an embassy spokesman retracted the ambassadors comments there are indications that unitedstates funds were used to support gomezs activities at a time when such support was specifically prohibited by law in a report in october 27 of last year it was stated that three salvadoran workers were paid by the unitedstates embassy to work on mr max gomezs house in addition the captured flier mr hasenfus claims to have stayed at mr gomezs residence located at 5272 pasco escalon in san salvador when a reporter an american reporter attempted to visit the location and gain entry it is reported that armed security agents carrying unitedstates embassy identification cards appeared promptly at the scene the reporter was turned away also in october of last year captured flights and record logs show that at least 15 private flights carrying weapons to resupply the contras originated at the honduran military base of aguacate and some used the airfield at mocoron both improved with unitedstates military exercise funds but unitedstates spokesmen for the exercises insisted that the airfields were only used to give american soldiers practice in field construction techniques and said they would not be used for or by the contras because of laws prohibiting indirect or direct aid to the contras captured flight logs also record trips to highly sensitive unitedstates military bases including one in nevada that is said to have conducted classified military research nicaraguan troops are said to have recovered a navigational targeting instrument from the cockpit of the plane which mr hasenfus said was placed there by the central intelligence agency to allow pilots to make more accurate drops of weapons shipments phone bills from a safe house in san salvador where mr hasenfus and others stayed are reported to show numerous calls to lieutenant colonel norths private line at the national security council in the capital of our nation the phone records show a series of calls to mr norths colonel norths office arms merchants and air supply companies were involved in these telephonic transactions it is suspected that the unitedstates government paid for these phone bills as unnamed unitedstates official is quoted as saying that the economic support funds for el salvador honduras and guatemala had been diverted and were critical to the supply network any number of other events reported including that of richard secords involvement in arranging for third parties to supply the contras including key officials and individuals in saudi arabia in possible exchange for a favorable disposition of the awac deal of saudi arabia have been noted it is also reported that the attorney general of the united states edwin meese and deputy attorney general donald jensen applied pressure on the office of the unitedstates attorney to halt or slow the investigation into illegalities emanating out of contra supply efforts as it might have interfered with the administrations foreign policy goals this was information that the members of the judiciary committee provided the attorney general and ultimately the threeman federal court in asking for an independent counsel and suggesting possible alleged illegal efforts by the unitedstates officials to assist the contras that involved such conflicts of duty on the part of the attorney general and others in the department of justice that an independent counsel should be appointed and i am very very pleased of course to suggest to you that they were appointed and that mr walsh is on the job and is proceeding forthwith there was yet another part of our response to the department of justice the request for an independent counsel that suggested to them as was required under our interpretation of the law to elicit the statutes that might have been violated what crimes what criminal statutes might these unitedstates government officials have violated in their overenthusiastic efforts to assist the contras we set forward a number of them among them was title 18 section 641 of the united states code which refers to the misuse of public money property or records this criminal statute

membership in the other body trent has served very ably as the minority leader for a number of years and of course has done a good job for his constituents back home in mississippi although he is from the other party i have a great deal of respect and admiration for trent as do most members on the democratic side trent has the kind of enduring personality that makes him esoeclally effective in dealing with people and on more than one occasion he has been the catalyst for working out compromises which have broken severe deadlocks that had hold us at bay i particularly want to participate in the special order on the farwell of trent lott because i have come to know him quite well for all of the 10 years that i have been in congress shortly after arriving i joined trent and former colleague jack edwards of alabama in continuing perhaps the longest running television show of its kind in the country in which we discuss congressional issues congressional report is a halfhour television program carried weekly by wkrgtv in mobile al which covers all or parts of the three districts we represent in florida alabama and mississippi after jack edwards retired he was succeeded by sonny callahan who then took his place on our show despite the fact that i am a democrat and the two other participants in this program are republicans i think that we have been able to discuss frankly the issues and at the same time present to the public a camaraderie that is complementary of the natinns lawmaking body yes there were times that we disagreed on certain aspects of proposed legislation or on major national issues but we always were able to go into depth on these matters without being unusually disagreeable trent always was tactful as well as eloquent in bringing forth the views of his party as well as his own one humorous incident about trent lott i will not forget in 1979 right after hurricane fredric had done considerable damage along the gulf coast trent jack edwards and i along with a couple of our staffers were flown down by the air force to survey the damage with the ideal of getting federal assistance on the way down trent was seated by my administrative assistant who ordinarily as a pilot himself had no problem with flying however on this occasion my aa developed a case of air sickness just before we landed in pensacola fl needless to say trent lott will not forget this either because he was the victim of my aas sickness and although trent was headed on to mississippi he had to delay the flight in pensacola for a few moments while

vision to have this special order and permit those of us who had the pleasure and great pleasure of serving with john grotberg an opportunity to speak to the record for the future as well as to extend our deepest sympathies and affection for jean and for the entire grotberg family i miss john very much and as a democrat who sat on the other side of the aisle from him in the committee on banking finance and urban affairs i still find myself looking down to where his chair was we had the opportunity to work together on several bills and i came so much to appreciate his quick wit and wry humor i think even in his brief time here i could see the imprint of his experience in the illinois legislature when you saw him function as an effective member of our committee we were abletogether and just for the record i wanted to say that the last bill that he had a hand in here was public law 99202 december 23 1985 the save for the usa year which had to do with savings bonds and increasing the sale of our public debt securities to unitedstates citizens he and i worked on that together for a very long period of time and it is really the bill that permitted me to get to know him better as a person i thought for the record it might be interesting just to tell the story of this bill and how very much it meant to him we had to get signatures we had to get 218 signatures and he knew i was interested in savings bonds and he was as well so we decided to hitch up as a team within about 2 days john had over 70 signatures i said gosh john i said i cant keep up with you i said how in the world do you do it he said i know how to work a cloakroom we within just a few days had the required number of signatures and in that particular session of congress we had the only bill that managed to make it through that committee get passed on the floor of this house as well as over on the senate side and be signed into law by the president of the united states when we were getting our signatures on this side i said gosh john i said weve got a problem over in the other body theyre not moving very quickly he goes no problem follow me so we went out this middle door we walked across the rotunda we went over to the senate side and we went into the cloakroom over there and of course i was a little cautious i wanted the officer to clear me to go into the cloakroom and john said just walk right in we walked in and he said to the person at the desk wheres dole well it turned out that the majority leader at that time was in an airplane somewhere over the united states and john made sure that we made a telephone call right there and within 10 minutes senator dole was back to us in the cloakroom and john said when can you schedule it on the floor the senator informed us we should go see the speaker pro tem strom thurmond and we got off the telephone at that time senator dole had two huge boxes of chocolate candy over in the senate john and i both managed to grab a couple handfuls of that candy on the way out the door and we proceeded to find the speaker pro tems office without any knocking or anything john walked right in to the office and he said to the young woman sitting at the desk wed like to speak to the speaker pro tem who was standing back in the corner completely startled that these two members from the other side would have walked in unannounced like that and john walked up to him and said i happen to be a freshman this lady is a sophomore and we dont have anything important to do over there were just lowerranking members so we decided to really get on savings bonds this year and push them and we need your help we need your signature and heres the bill and senator thurmond stood there and kind of looked at this bill and looked at the two of us and it had to be one of the most unusual requests he had ever had and we got his signature within 15 seconds it was in that way then that we got the bill moved over in the senate senator dole scheduled it the next day and it passed the senate on december 16 1985 after having passed the house here on december 12 1985 it was then signed by the president i said to john before we left washington you know john this is such a big thing weve got to promote savings bonds in america when can we go over to the white house we have to get the president involved in this the first lady involved in this he said well why dont we do it in january i said ok john when he said well you take care of it im going on vacation i said oh john you have to be back here for that you cant miss an event like that that was the last time that i really had an opportunity to speak with him i never knew he was ill and he was going into the hospital that christmas and when i got back here in january to try to recoup and to put our agenda together to go over to the white house i found that he was in intensive care never to come out again last year i had to go before the national committee the private sector group that promotes savings bonds sales in the united states and to accept a liberty bell on behalf of both john and myself for our efforts in promoting this particular legislation which resulted last year in the largest number of savings bonds sales in the united states in several decades i will tell you it was a very emotional moment for me because i felt that i wanted to say so many things for john he was alive at that point and i wanted him to be there with me and he was not able to be there so i think this bill and the savings bonds sales in 1986 are a true tribute to him it has been an honor to have served with john grotberg he put a human face on this house and i pray for him and for his family"], [0.9764161705970764, 0.9764161705970764, 0, "i appreciate the

the 27squaremile rocky mountain arsenal irmaj was established in 1942 and was used by the army to manufacture and dispose of chemical weapons such as nerve gas the army also leased a section of the arsenal grounds to a private company to manufacture pesticides the arsenal which has been placed on superfunds national priority list is considered one of the most toxic parcels of land in the world it is the no 1 cleanup priority for the department of defense environmental restoration program several toxic disposal basins are located on rma the 96acre basin f was used to dispose of chemical warfare agents and pesticides between 1957 and 1980 this basin which is surrounded by a tall fence contains chemicals considered so toxic that devices are in place to prevent birds from landing on the

and their livestock suffered neurological disorders eventually half of mr lands calves developed symptoms similar to pneumonia and died the surviving cattle suffered teeth damage and did not mature the lands hired a veterinarian who conducted water and diet tests on the cattle and concluded the sickness was caused by poison in the water during the 1970s the army denied responsibility indicating that the contamination was not emanating from rma on october 6 1976 the army sent a letter regarding mr lands claims to the lands attorney samuel l mcclaren the army indicated that no pollution to the area occurred due to government activities the armys 1976 letter was sent several years after the colorado department of health outside the rma boundaries after the cdhs december 1974 and january 1975 tests indicated the presence of cdpd the army notified cdh that tests taken in the summer of 1974 showed signs of diisopropylmethylphosphonate has seeped frun rma into the ground water emanating from the arsenal epa has further determined that rma is the sole source of contamination to the north of 80th avenue and rma the lands property was located within this identified area because the water in south adams county has been contaminated the army has provided 13 5 million to treat south adams county water and sanitation districts water homes located above 80th avenue which previously had drawn their drinking water from wells now have been hooked up to sacwsd facilities the lands attorney indicates that the army had administratively denied the lands case and that the lands have exhausted

citizens around the world for many americans and their families this nations minimum wage has really been a vital safety net for helping to hold them above poverty and keep them off welfare today that net has been ripped by inflation and illdesigned national economic policies it is really past time now to raise the minimum wage and restore the protection for workers that it was meant to provide congress last dealt with this subject in the last decade in 1977 when we legislated a series of four increases the last of those took effect 5 years ago in 1981 when we raised the minimum wage rate to 3 35 per hour after adjusting for inflation that wage has now plummeted by 26 percent in just the decade of the 1980s and today the real minimum wage stands at the lowest level it has been since 1955 the statutory hourly wage rate rose in real terms until 1968 then it stabilized in the 1970s and it has fallen sharply since 1979 the real wage is now 20 percent less than it averaged in the 1970s and is onethird less than it was at its peak in 1968 due to the failure to raise the minimum wage since 1981 its level has slipped below 40 percent of the average hourly wage for the first time since harry truman was president in 1949 for folks who rely on the minimum wage that decline has meant for them personally a steady slide into poverty 1350 the figures are painfully telling consider this an american working full time 8 hours a day 5 days a week never missing work but earning the minimum wage ends up at the end of the year with a salary that is below the poverty threshold if that worker has a family of three it is more than onefifth below the poverty threshold if that fulltime worker earning the minimum wage has a family of four the salary is onethird below the poverty level in the united states so you see the gap between what the government says people need and what they actually are getting when they work full time has to be closed it is the working poor that have been the real losers in legislation that has gone through this house and through the senate and been signed by the president during these past 6 or 7 years lowwage households were hurt by the budget cuts of 1981 which made it more and more difficult for poor people at the same time that they april 8 1 98 7 were going through various difficulties because of our budget cuts these working poor were not helped at all by the huge tax cut of 1981 that helped upper income americans not the working poor the taxes for the working poor went up social security taxes and income taxes on those folks went up

minimum wage reaches 50 percent of the average hourly wage in the united states and then our legislation would index the minimum wage to the average hourly wage so that as it increases the minimum wage automatically increases with it i can tell my colleagues that those of us on the democratic iide of the aisle are committed to a revision of the minimum wage act this year because this year marks the longest in fact this month marks the longest time america has ever gone without increasing the minimum wage we have broken the old record as of april 2 of this year and that inactivity on the part of the congress and the american people with regard to increasing the minimum wage really means that many folks maybe better off now to be on unemployment or welfare than they are to be on the

here today to expedite house consideration and final approval of certain amendments added by the other body to the fair housing amendments act of 1988 my colleagues will recall that the house considered the fair housing legislation on june 22 and june 23 and finally approved the legislation on june 29 subsequently when the housepassed bill went to the other body a series of negotiations ensued to resolve the remaining differences between the civil rights community and the administration our purpose here today is to consider and hopefully accept the changes to h r 1158 adopted by the senate it should be pointed out that these changes have the support of the unitedstates department of housing and urban development the department of justice as well as key elements in the business community principally the national association of realtors and the national association of home builders the amendments adopted in the other body do no harm to the spirit of the balanced compromise approved by this house just a few weeks ago in fact many of these amendments serve to enhance and reinforce some of the provisions contained in that compromise for example many members of this house were concerned about the potential adverse impact that the coverage of families with children could have on senior citizens retirement communities under the language of one notable senate amendment existing senior citizen communities will have increased flexibility and possibility to qualify for the exemption from the familial status requirements just as important is the senateadded language providing a transition period for the current residents of housing that excludes children they will not be required to leave that housing nor will they be subject to eviction that is existing residents whose presence in a community or apartment complex might otherwise cause the community to fall outside the protections in section 807 b 2 will not be counted in calculating whether the exemption should apply the bottom line is that senior citizens retirement communities across the united states will have a greater chance of qualifying for the housing for older persons exemption furthermore no one will be evicted whether in a senior citizens community or an alladult community because of the enactment of this bill litigation authority was also an issue when we considered h r 1158 on this floor approximately 6 weeks ago the language contained in the bill before the house today fully consolidates in the department of justice the authority to represent the federal government in all of the enforcement actions under the fair housing act however while the litigation will be conducted by lawyers from the department of justice the decision as to whether or not prompt judicial action is necessary to obtain injunctive relief or to seek court enforcement of a finding of discriminatirn will still be lodged with the secretary of housing and urban development so under the latest compromise the secretary will decide whether or not litigation should occur where the secretary authorizes the litigation it is transmitted to the attorney general and lie is required to promptly commence and maintain such action consistent with the terms of the senate amendment the amended version of h r 1158 also contains a technical amendment to the bills language providing for a transition period for state and local fair housing agencies making it clear that certain interim certifications by hud are included in the bill the language adopted in the other body also makes it clear that this legislation is not requiring the establishment of a federal building code because of the accessibility and adaptability requirement for newly constructed multifamlly dwellings these and the other changes made in h r 1158 are improvements and refinements fully consistent with the spirit of the housepassed compromise bill we are in the final stretch run of a circuitous race that began nearly 10 years ago this bipartisan effortto strengthen the enforcement provisions of the 1968 law and expand the coverage of the fair housing protections under title viii of the civil rights acthas tested the stamina of many of us in this house my good friend and distinguished colleague from california civil and constitutional rights subcommittee chairman don edwards in particular is to be commended for his patience determination and effective leadership in this effort we are on the threshold of finally passing a federal fair housing law that is workable and effective thirtysix million disabled persons will receive the protections of this fundamental civil rights statute families with children will no longer be arbitrarily limited in their choice of decent housing the secretary of hud will have new and significant powers to investigate discrimination complaints and to enforce the rights guaranteed under this statute if discrimination is found and proven state and local fair housing agencies will contintic their vital integral role in fair housing enforcement all across the united states the states and localities are given an adequate grace period to bring their statutes and ordinances in line with the new federal law so that they can continue to handle a majority of these fair housing complaints complainants and respondents in fair housing discrimination cases are guaranteed due process rights in administrative proceedings and the fundamental right to a trial by jury in a unitedstates district court in instances where they so elect either the adjudication or the trial that results from the election is intended to be a final decision concerning the claims raised by the aggrieved person or any intervenor the aggrieved person or any intervenor may not relitigate the same claims raised in the complaint or seek additional or alternative relief through a direct action in federal court as was reflected in the colloquy between the gentleman from california and myself during consideration of this legislation in june res judicata applies and the intent is that claims based upon the same set of facts should be consolidated into one case before concluding i want to take this one last opportunity to mention some of the individuals who over the years have made positive and prominent contributions to this effort i have already noted and want to reinforce the tremendous contribution made by the gentleman from california the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner deserves special recognition our thanks go to the secretary of housing and urban development sam pierce for his pivotal role in this entire effort through his 8 years in office as the hud secretary sam pierce has consistently and staunchly advocated fair housing reform now on the threshold of a final success secretary pierce deserves acknowledgment and acclaim for his many contributions in addition i also want to give muchdeserved credit to our former colleague and friend from the other body the distinguished senator from maryland charles mcc mathias for many years mac was the principal sponsor of this legislation in the senate and was always ready and willing to lend his time and his advice to this effort pivotal players over the years have been ralph neas the executive director of the leadership conference on civil rights as well as my good friend althea simmons executive director washington office of the naacp kerry scanlon of the washington lawyers committee for civil rights under law wade henderson of the aclu and penda hair of the naacp legal defense fund also brought their usual fairness and balance to this effort the compromise that brought about prompt approval of this legislation in the house of representatives just a few weeks ago could never have occurred without the assistance of these and other representatives of the civil rights community their willingness to compromise was the key this is also an appropriate time to give recognition to many of the unsung heroes which you may not read about in the newspapers but nevertheless have made major contributions to the development of this legislation and its prospects for success from the staff of the subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights chief counsel catherine leroy associate counsel stuart ishimaru and minority counsel alan slobodin i also want to express grateful thanks and appreciation to marion morris who served for 4 years as the legislative assistant to senator mathias during that time ms morris made numerous and significant contributions in the

judiciary committee for bringing this legal immigration bill to the floor without a patently unfair provision which was contained in the senate version the senate measure known as the kennedysimpson bill would add visas for underrepresented countries but would curtail eligibility for married brothers and sisters inlaws and nieces and nephews of unitedstates citizens this classification known as the fifth preference is especially important to chineseamericans who have waited for years to bring over those relatives legally and i might add who have traditionally made a great contribution to this country i had made my concerns known a few weeks ago in a meeting in the house majority leaders office between congressional friends of ireland and the deputy prime minister of ireland mr lenihan i made it clear then and i wish to reemphasize today that i welcome additional immigration from ireland but not at the expense of chineseamericans it cannot meet anyones definition of fairness to benefit one country or nationality at the expense of another i should also like to express my support for the section of this bill which at least temporarily prevents the deportation of nurses from the philippines whose visas are about to expire such deportations would cause a health care crisis in my district and many others i should like to add however that it is my hope that in the next congress we shall look at more longterm solutions to this problem again i thank the chairman for the bill before us today and hope that he and other members of the committee will stand firm in

of dollars and have the iuses shipped over to the united states in russian ships let me tell the members that one member of this congress without narring names protested that do members know what we got we got a concession aft r humbly begging on our knees begging the russians who had the contract begging thera on our knees and they conceded to give us half of the shipments of the buses from

do not think he and i disagree as it relates to a need for a reevaluation of the requirements for obtaining a job with the district of columbia government we disagree that there is such a crisis that the unitedstates congress should in fact move at this point in time as i understand the law of residency here in the district of columbia within 6 months from the date of employment the person must move into the district in order to continue to be eligible for that job that in effect means with this debate and with the report language that we have put the district on notice that if the district does not reevaluate its position the congress will in fact take action there is as i understand it an amendment by the ranking member today to put into place a preference system in addition to the amendment offered by the gentleman from virginia to prohibit the use of funds to enforce the residency requirement the floor of the house oy representatives is no place to legislate on either one of these issues and i would state that there is time before the conference with the senate on this bill for the district of columbia government to move on this issue the senate can consider this issue and i would say that now is not the time for this body to legislate a preference hiring system for the district government its immediate impact would be nil because people can be employed from outside the district and they would have 6 months iii fact to move into the district so we have plenty of time to work on this issue and this house floor is not the appropriate place to do it"]]}
