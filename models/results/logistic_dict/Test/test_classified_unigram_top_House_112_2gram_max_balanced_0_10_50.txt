five different countries over 17 days at a cost of 300 000 to the taxpayers rightly secretary lahood responded to our letter by immediately suspending the program but the question remains why did it exist in the first place and how many others like it exist throughout the federal bureaucracy we must continue to scrutinize the budgets at all federal agencies so we can put an end to this type of wasteful spending once and for all hopefully the suspension of this billboard program is just a sign of things to come"]], "top_unsure": [[0.00019621849060058594, 0.5001962184906006, 1, "i think it is

mercury is a trace element of these pollutants we think that we should go back and actually do a real economic analysis and also a health analysis my good friend from massachusetts was talking about the dangers of health those are real dangers but again given that the trace amounts of mercury that are emitted per year are in pounds it is a very tenuous connection to say that the mercury from a

will benefit from the jobs economic growth and energy security that comes with construction of the pipeline we cannot allow this opportunity to pass us by the project would be developed in keeping with all environmental regulations and constructed with the safest and most advanced pipeline technology available whats more the keystone pipeline takes advantage of canadas vast oil resources that are the secondlargest on the planet the time for delay has long since passed the house legislation would advance the approval and construction of the pipeline passed by the house on multiple occasions

allowing me to present this timely amendment to the fy12 intelligence authorization there are 72 fusion centers throughout the united states including one in massachusetts which is also the home of the sole joint terrorism task force that is housed in an airport however as noted yesterday by mr lee hamilton vice chair of the 9 11 commission during the committee on homeland security hearing which dealt with looking back 10 years after 9 11 all 72 fusion centers have varying degrees of quality and this results in gaps in communication gaps in sharing such as agencies failure to link information about the individual who attempted the december 25 2009 airline bombing prevented him from being included in the federal governments terrorist watch list a tool used by dhs to screen for persons who pose a significant security threat this week the gao released a report to the department of homeland security recommending that dhs improve its assistance and services to state and local homeland security partners and streamline some of the informationsharing mechanisms furthermore in july 2011 dhs reported that it established performance measures for assessing its informationsharing efforts these measures include for example the percent of intelligence reports customers rated as satisfactory enabling customers to anticipate emergency threats dhs plans to report on these metrics beginning in fiscal year 2012 while these are positive steps gaos work has shown that developing outcomebased performance measures that gauge informationsharing efforts are really necessary to strengthen the accountability of these efforts and we are still waiting for dhs to implement these steps now as a former district attorney of over a decade i understand how critical it is to share information and how not sharing that information enhances and enables critical activity that indeed carries over to terrorists themselves this amendment encourages this type of streamlining process by further integrating and leveraging fusion centers to enlist all the intelligence law enforcement homeland security capabilities in the united states in a manner thats consistent with the constitution to prevent acts of terrorism against the united states of america it was just a few months ago that secretary napolitano in testimony before the homeland security committee said that the threat of terrorism is at its most heightened state since 9 11 thats what shes saying now so i encourage all members to vote for this amendment as well as the managers amendment to strengthen this bill and

have 68 000 troops in afghanistan throughout the entire fiscal year 2013 however this is not the plan that our commander in chief has put forth nor is it the plan that many of us who would like to see the war come to a quick end would support as president obama has repeatedly stated we are winding down this war after withdrawing the surge troops by the end of this summer that will bring us to 68 000 troops at the beginning of the 2013 fiscal year we will continue to bring our troops home from afghanistan and i quote the president at a steady pace this amendment captures the billions of dollars that we will save by pursuing this steady drawdown of troops as opposed to maintaining troop levels at 68 000 throughout the entire fiscal year 2013 and then presumably on october 1 bring 28 000 troops home this amendment would cut 12 67 billion from the overseas contingency fund let me be clear about what this amendment does not do it does not cut funding for troops on the ground in afghanistan i believe as do all of my colleagues who have advocated for an accelerated end to this war that our troops in harms way should have all the resources they need to safely execute their mission and i am committed to ensuring that our troops on the ground have the best equipment and the compensation that they deserve this amendment does cut the oco funds that are unneeded and would not be used if we pursue the presidents steady drawdown plan in these fiscal times stringent as they are we should not be paying for things that were not going to buy and that we dont need and we certainly dont need to further pad the oco budget the committee has already approved an extra 3 25 billion cushion on the oco fund that was not even part of the presidents request we have already spent half a trillion dollars of taxpayer dollars on the war in afghanistan and the department of defense cant even account for many of those funds lost due to contractor fraud or afghan corruption when we take into account the longterm costs of this war such as servicing our debt and caring for the wounded warriors the costs are even more staggering many of us support a quicker timeline of withdrawing troops from afghanistan than the president has proposed after a decade of war we recognize that our core national security objectives have been met in afghanistan and that there is no unitedstates military solution to the remaining challenges in the afghanistan nation we began our military operations in afghanistan to eliminate those international terrorist organizations that threaten the united states thanks to the remarkable bravery and competency of our men and women in uniform al qaeda has been virtually eliminated from afghanistan terrorist training camps have been demolished and osama bin laden is dead thousands have given their lives to accomplish this and tens of thousands have suffered lifealtering wounds it is now time for our troops to come home it is also time for this house not to waste further money this amendment is not about ending the war it is about reducing the deficit by 12 67 billion we can do that by capturing the billions of dollars saved by the presidents proposed troop drawdown and by redirecting those funds towards reducing the deficit and by bolstering our fiscal security here at home with that i yield back the balance of my time"],
