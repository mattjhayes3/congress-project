other members of the progressive caucus we have long fought for the middle class and those aspiring to be in the middle class today specifically we want to address congressman paul ryans plan to help alleviate poverty in this nation needless to say we were excited to find out a republican wanted to talk about poverty given the votes that we have had this session in this body whether it be the draconian cuts that appeared in the house republican budget the slashing of food stamps and assistance to the most needy in this country to see a republican finally stand up and talk about poverty we were excited and we want to have that conversation this evening so just what is in congressman paul ryans plan to help alleviate poverty i am sure it must be something about raising the minimum wage to 10 10 in the next 3 years so that we can help lift people who are making 15 000 a year out of poverty i am sure it addresses equal pay for equal work so that men and women are paid for doing the same work but it doesnt appear that is part of paul ryans plan i am sure it addresses some educational issues i am sure it helps people pay back their loans at lower rates and makes sure we have expanded pell grants available so that no one should be denied a higher education simply because they cant afford it no that is not part of the ryan plan either i am sure there is an investment in early childhood education because every person in this room must surely know that if we help invest at those earliest years you can have a lifetime of experiences and opportunities for someone that is not in the plan either surely it must address investments in infrastructure we have crumbling roads and bridges we have bridges and roads that are old enough that they are eligible for medicare in this country surely putting people back to work at a time like this and investing in our infrastructure would make sense it is also not in the ryan plan let me try one more thing it has got to be here we must provide incentives to create goodpaying jobs here in america rather than overseas clearly the 21st century make it in america act must not be in the plan either all those things that i just mentionedraising the minimum wage making sure we have equal pay for equal work expanding opportunity through expanded pell grants and helping people refinance their student loans helping people get access to early education and investing in our infrastructure and jobs here at homeare part of the house democratic middle class jumpstart program they are what we would do in our first 100 days if we were to take over the majority after this fall but surely there must be something we could talk about today in paul ryans plan there has got to be something equally bold and hopefully not just old a bunch of old ideas warmed over brought back to us in versions of block grants and not really providing any real assistance that the most needy in this country need i am joined by a number of my colleagues today who are going to address exactly what is in paul ryans plan and perhaps how we can offer a little different perspective to help the most needy in our country i would like to start out with a very esteemed and respected colleague from illinois representative danny davis"], [7.450580596923828e-05, 0.9999254941940308, 1, "i yield myself such time as i may consume unfortunately the budget offered by our republican colleagues is not by any stretch of the imagination the solution to our problems it is the problem because this is not a budget it is a retreat it is a retreat from the high ideals noble goals and bold dreams that have made this country so great as the author and columnist nicholas kristof recently pointed out a new ranking of livability in 132 countries shows that the united states has fallen to 16th fallen but apparently our republican friends think that is just a little too high we now rank 24th in inequality in the attainment of education but the republican budget would cut pell grants that help lowincome students afford college we rank 29th in life expectancy and 24th in nutrition and basic medical care and the ryan budget would cut funding for food stamps and medicaid and raise the eligibility of medicare we rank just 70th in health and republicans want to repeal the affordable care act and snatch health care coverage away from millions who just received it this is not a budget mr chair this is a call to americans to dream small and aim low this is an attempt to shift costs onto the shoulders of the middle class the young and the elderly in a way that would cripple our ability to compete i believe we are a better people than this and a greater nation look at just about any poll on the subject these days and you can see that americans are most concerned about jobs and growing our american economy what the american people want to see from the congress is a plan that will help accelerate the growth of our economy and create good jobs but the crushing austerity of the ryan plan would do just the opposite this makes no sense because we know what actually works and what actually grows jobs and what doesnt we have seen it and we have lived it the record speaks for itself it shows whose ideas actually work in the real world and whose dont since 1961 the private sector has added a total of 66 million jobs twentyfour million of them were added under republican presidents and a whopping 42 million were added under democratic presidents lets take a look at this chart under president clinton this country grew a whopping 22 6 million jobs and he left office running an annual surplus of over 128 billion projected to grow into the trillions then under the 8 years of president bush we added only 1 2 million jobswhat a stark differenceand the budget surplus was turned into an annual 1 4 trillion deficit when president obama took office our economy was shedding over 800 000 jobs a month and the bush administration left office with the worst job creation record in 75 years nevertheless in the 5 years since president obama took office we have created 4 7 million jobs nearly four times what was created under president bush and we have more than halved the annual deficit the actions swiftly implemented by the president and democratic congress quickly turned the economy around and job losses diminished and as this next chart shows those actions have worked we have been gaining jobs for the last 49 months in that time the economy has added 8 9 million private sector jobs regaining more than all of the jobs lost during the great recession this chart shows what i call the deep red republican valley where we were shedding over 800 000 jobs a month since president obama took office with his economic plan we have been growing jobs democrats understand that in order to maintain our leadership in the world economy america needs to continually sharpen its competitive edge and we understand that while investing in the future may carry some risk refusing to do so carries an ironbound certainty the certainty of a slow decline and crippling decay instead of investing in the future and in the next generation the ryan budget guts funding for education workforce training critical infrastructure scientific research public health clean energy advanced manufacturing and public safety all the investments needed to make the american economy of tomorrow competitive and put us on the cutting edge instead of fully preparing the next generation for tomorrows economy the ryan budget cuts funding for early childhood education k12 education special education and higher education it slashes grants and charges students more interest on their college loans it lets the higher education tax cut expire saddling our young people with even more student loan debt and we know now that student loan debt is now larger than credit card debt in our country it is a crippling concern sadly the cuts extend far beyond education the ryan budget proposes draconian cuts to nutrition assistance home heating assistance and rental assistance snap which provides food security for millions of american children is cut more than 135 billion and 200 000 fewer women and children would get basic nutrition through the wic program we can all agree that the economic recovery has been too slow and yet this republican budget cuts critical investments to create jobs and enhance our competitiveness in 2015 alone the budget cuts 52 billion from efforts to update our crumbling transportation infrastructure that amounts to over 1 5 million jobs the budget cuts the national institutes of health and national science foundation threatening our edge in medical and scientific innovation the republican budget even eliminates funding for the arts humanities and public broadcasting which support the institutions that enrich our lives and chronicle our cultural and artistic heritage further the ryan budget would cut health care funding and increase costs for seniors it would raise the age to qualify for medicare to 67 and bring back the dreaded doughnut hole that leaves too many seniors to choose between their medication and putting food on the table after nearly a century of talking about doing it we have finally expanded health care to cover more americans yes there have been bumps along the way as there have been with the implementation of transformational social programs like with medicare and part d prescription drugs but the important thing is that it is working already 7 million people have signed up through the health insurance marketplaces and another 3 million young adults have been able to remain on their parents health plans until they turn 26 under the ryan plan these 10 million americans who thought at long last they had reliable and affordable health care insurance would have it snatched away from them but it is even worse than that by 2024 a staggering total of 40 million people would become uninsured under the ryan plan the cbo projects that 25 million people who would have gained coverage under the affordable care act will instead have to go without it and there are another 14 to 20 million people who would lose insurance as a result of the block granting and medicaid cutting laid out in the ryan budget after 53 failed attempts to repeal the affordable care act the ryan budget hopes to succeed in taking us backwards to those dark days when people with preexisting conditions couldnt get coverage when protections against lifetime limits didnt exist nocost preventive services like mammograms and cervical cancer screenings would be no more it would take us back to a time when women were charged more just because they were women and when the insurance companies called the shots from the smallest children to the oldest seniors who rely on medicaid for health care and to cover longterm health bills the ryan medicaid cuts will negatively affect literally millions women who make up almost 70 percent of adult medicaid beneficiaries will especially feel the sting the most vulnerable will be hurt the most mr chair budgets are about choices and we face a truly watershed choice now we can choose to continue to do things that have lifted the hopes of millions provided unparalleled opportunities and made our country the envy of the world we can choose to continue to help those who need it the most and provide a measure of care to those who have the least or we can choose to go down a radically different road concede the future to the bold defer to others expect less and turn our faces away from the downtrodden and the dispossessed yes we can make that choice but please mr chair lets stop referring to this as a budget and call it what it really is a retreat an act of surrender it is giving up on the america we have always known this is not a blueprint it is a black eye we are a better people than this and a greater

remarks let me thank you for your tremendous leadership on so many issues which address and affect the american people across the board i also thank you for being here every week during these special orders it is really raising the level of awareness on the critical issues of our day it takes a lot to do this but thank you for giving us a voice and an opportunity to be with you i join you and our colleagues tonight in the congressional progressive caucus really in strong opposition to the transpacific partnership we are talking about trying to ensure that people do not fall into the ranks of the poor but also that people have pathways out of poverty and into prosperity now here we are looking at another bill h r 3080 which is called the bipartisan trade priorities act of 2014 which would provide the administration with fast track authority for the tpp once again this is not a progressive trade policy it will not allow for people to be employed and get goodpaying jobs but rather just the opposite so unfortunately looking at this really worries many of us that we will fall backwards in terms of more people becoming unemployed let me just be clear up front though in that i do not oppose all trade agreements i support fair and free trade however the notion that congress should provide a rubber stamp for a complex free trade agreement is simply irresponsible and dangerous to our economy and to our constituents they elected us to provide a voice in all of these policies so to shut the congress out of having that seat at the table to me is downright undemocratic the tpp will have a devastating effect on the working class families and communities of color that i represent and that many of us represent it would sacrifice the wellbeing of working americans for the wealth of multinational corporations not to mention that in its current form the tpp would lock in higher prices for popular drugs threatening access to lifesaving medicines including hiv aids drugs for millions of poor and lowincome individuals and families around the world by exporting american jobs to countries where the minimum wage is just 28 cents an hour ceos will continue to get richer while working americans will lose their only sources of income we have seen this happen before past trade agreements have already cost us 3 4 million service sector jobs many of those jobs were in california we simply cannot afford to lose more nafta alone resulted in the net loss of 1 million unitedstates jobs it led to a trade deficit of 181 billion and it devastated the manufacturing sector these agreements have allowed corporations to ship good american jobs overseas while wages benefits and workplace protections and environmental protections are really declining and are denied rather than focusing on trade agreements that will hurt the middle class we really should be focusing on job creation eradicating poverty income inequality and improving economic mobility in 1980 ceos were paid an average of 42 times the salary of a blue collar worker in 2012 that number exploded to 354 times more than the average worker this is unacceptable it is really unconscionable that rather than building pathways to prosperity we are debating measures to make yes the 1 percent richer while holding working families down so i stand in firm opposition to fast track authority and to any final deal that sacrifices american jobs and environmental protections in the name of international corporate profits this must be defeated finally as many of us are talking about tonight we have 1 4 million people who did not receive their unemployment compensation checks this week the republican tea party house has totally abandoned these people who are living on the edge they want to work so it is incumbent upon us to do the right thing on behalf of these people and immediately extend unemployment compensation first of all it is the correct thing to do it is the american thing to do it is the moral thing to do but it is also economically wise to do this so we hope during the district work period next week that republicans hear from their constituents because it is not only democrats who have people who have lost their unemployment compensation but republican constituents all americans who are seeking to work and who want to work and who need that bridge over troubled waters have lost their unemployment checks also i hope for those who are people of faith they really draw from their faith and understand that this is the moment that now is the time to think about the least of these and to remember that we are our brothers and that we are our sisters keepers and that we need to pass unemployment compensation right away and then move forward and increase the minimum wage and hopefully one day increase the minimum wage to really a living wage because that is what the american people deserve thank you again for your leadership and thank you for giving me the chance to be with you tonight"], [8.249282836914062e-05, 0.9999175071716309, 1, "there are just 3 days before 85 billion in harmful acrosstheboard spending cuts take effect and here we are again with an alltoofamiliar manufactured crisis poised to strike our economy with another selfinflicted wound month to month crisis to crisis this is no way to run the worlds largest economy letting sequestration happen is not responsible government the sequester was designed last year to scare congress into responsibly reducing the deficit it created a doomsday scenario draconian damaging cutsdisliked by both partiesintended to force democrats and republicans to come up with a balanced alternative to reduce our deficit sequestration cuts are not targeted to eliminate waste or unnecessary programs rather they slash programs across the board regardless of their effectiveness this threatens our economic progress jeopardizes our military readiness and reduces funding for national priorities like education and medical research sequestration would be devastating for michigan and our nations economy the sequester eliminates jobs at a time when congress should be working to create them our country has been moving in the right direction 35 straight months of private sector job growth 6 1 million private sector jobs created theres no doubt we can do more to grow our economy and the middle class and letting sequestration happen is a giant step backward for our economy economists across the political spectrum agree that letting sequestration happen will slow our economy the nonpartisan congressional budget office estimates that sequester would reduce our economic growth by a third this year alone sequestration cuts affect the most vulnerable people middle class families seniors students people with disabilities the unemployed and those who may become unemployed if these cuts go into place we cant pretend that these cuts are just numbers in a budget if sequester is allowed to happen michigan alone stands to lose 31 000 jobs in just 6 months there will be 750 000 jobs lost nationally by october michigan schools would lose 22 million in funding eliminating 300 teachers and

eliminates taxpayerfunded subsidies for big oil companies in a time of record oil profits and 4agallon gasoline it baffles me that our country continues to subsidize companies like exxonmobil and bp yet republicans are willing to pinkslip 750 000 american workers just to protect billions of dollars in handouts for these five big oil companies its time to end these subsidies theres no question that we need to cut the deficit but we need to do it in a balanced way that protects the middle class the budget control act passed before i came to congress reduced the deficit by more than 2 5 trillion mainly through spending cuts there are certainly other areas that should be cut but we should be strategic in cutting spending to reduce our deficit sequestration takes the exact opposite approach it irrationally cuts programs that have proven to be effective and are worthwhile investments congress needs to act immediately in order to avert the sequester republican inaction threatens to leave these indiscriminate cuts in place killing jobs undermining public safety and first responders and injecting more uncertainty into our markets harming our economy our nation cannot afford any

processors raised the prices when the prices collapse 11 they didnt cut the prices ive sent out charts to you to explain that so what people need to understand is what were trying to do here is give farmers a way to protect themselves against the feed costs and this volatility now this program is voluntary nobody has to get into this program if they dont like the stabilization fund they dont have to take the insurance and they dont have to be involved in it but what were saying is if youre going to have the government subsidize your insurance which is what were doing then youre going to have to be responsible if this thing gets out of whack and what the goodlattescott amendment does is it puts that responsibility on the taxpayers not on the farmers which is irresponsible in my opinion the other thing you need to understand is in regular crop insurance the prices you can only ensure the price for that year but in this amendment in the goodlattescott amendment you ensure the price not based on what the market is its based on the feed costs plus the margin so youre going to insure milk for 18 per 100 weight but if the price goes to 11 the farmer still can have 18 insurance he doesnt

lets not take that away from the quality of these two pieces of legislation h r 3301 provides for an environmental review of the crossborder segment of the pipeline the entire length of the pipeline is reviewed for environmental impacts under existing law any time a pipeline crosses federal lands waters endangered habitats a national environmental policy act reviewalso known as nepa must be completed by the federal government otherwise the environmental permit must come from the state environmental agency if it is within the state there are more than 40 000 miles of pipeline in the unitedstates that have been constructed with indepth environmental reviews this will continue to be the case h r 3301 doesnt take anything away except the state department only has to deal with their responsibility in its coming from canada to the united states or from mexico to the united states or vice versa there will be environmental reviews by federal agencies and state agencies and this will

those who are being brutally silenced by the nicolas maduro regime in venezuela after 15 years of suffering under hugo chavezs rule the people of venezuela have watched their liberties continue to be violently stripped away as maduro further radicalizes the countrys failed policies these policies produce the highest inflation rates in latin america leading to shortages of such basic goods as milk and toilet paper and sending venezuela into a desperate downward economic spiral that worsens every day the corruption that is enabled by the maduro government and its supporters has also contributed to a society that is plagued by rampant violence in this country of 30 million inhabitants nearly 25 000 homicides were committed last year alone worse still the vast majority of these murders went unpunished creating a climate of impunity that leaves ordinary citizens paralyzed by fear and hopeless about their own future and the future of their country as if this was not harsh enough venezuelans are now facing the regimes repressive and violent actions weeks ago maduro and his cronies unleashed a bloody crackdown on students as they demonstrated against the regimes failed policies and peacefully demanded their basic human rights and democratic freedoms these students are expressing the sentiments of millions of venezuelans who are sick and tired of the regimes destructive policies and fear for what may happen next these students were exercising freedom of expression and peaceful assembly yet maduro responded to their brave calls of liberty with tear gas rubber bullets beatings and live ammunition as the number of venezuelan protesters swelled to the millions maduro has only stepped up the violence and his attempts to silence his critics by censoring radio and social media platforms by controlling the flow of information and the major media outlets maduro perpetuates his absurd conspiracy theories which cast blame on everyone but himself for this crisis of democracy in venezuela through the use of intimidation unjust detentions and violence maduro has followed the familiar playbook of other rulers who fear the desire of their citizens to live in freedom and under the rule of law this is especially the case with the brutal castro tyranny which has the biggest stake in keeping maduro in power because of its mutual disdain for freedom for democracy for liberty for the rule of law and because of castros dependence on venezuelan oil we have witnessed the castro regime parachute in their own hired guns to help the maduro regime continue its oppressive tactics against the people of venezuela since the countrywide protests began on february 12 maduros regime has murdered at least 14 venezuelans injured or unjustly detained hundreds more and committed the worst abuses against protesters as stories of torture and other human rights violations continue to pour in this relentless repression will continue and intensify unless the united states and the international community speak with a unified voice and help to promote the rule of law the human rights and the democratic aspirations of the venezuelan people i hope that we will be able to say that we did not stand idly by as the venezuelan people were brutally repressed and that we had a voice in making sure that people knew what was going on in venezuela i hope that we will be able to say that we stood for justice that we stood for peace that we stood for human rights that we stood for freedom and that we stood for the rule of law at the moment when these were needed the most"],

in creating the coastal national monument along the california coastline it had to be done by executive order because we couldnt get the bills out of committee i just really appreciate the fact that the committee is concentrating on this because a lot of these things that people kind of argue against they dont realize what the positive unintended consequences are what this bill does is it really talks about management of land as the chairman pointed out the substance of the bill allows the private enterprise the agriculture to continue and to have it in a way that is going to be costeffective management this is a winwin for the private sector and for the public sector in many cases the bureau of land management is a very effective land manager it essentially in the west has a lot of the land that actually was never picked up by forest service when you think of forest service you think of timbering or mining and those kinds of things or land that qualified for the national park system as kind of the leftover lands of the westward expansion they have a lot of land management responsibility and knowhow the california coastline is the number one attraction and the number one engine it is the whole engine of california most of the cities and stuff are all along the coast so any time you add to ability to expand accesswe sometimes forget in congress that the number one activity of interest in this country is watchable wildlife more people watch wildlife whether it is in the movies or channels or buy gear to go out than watch all the national sports it is huge business and it is jobs in the rural area this is key to job development since weve created the coastal national monument we have had little towns and counties in the rural area that have been identifying the rocks all of which have historical names from families or shipwrecks now it gives some attraction to it some historical attraction which people love to learn about it has been a great educational tool to teach us about this 1 100mile coastline in california sort of inch by inch this addition is going to be able to build more opportunity for job creation as people want to hire people to give them access want to buy pictures want to buy books want to buy art thats made from it so i really commend the committee on realizing that these things are responsible job development jobs not just government ownership of land when you say well it is taking it off the private tax rolls remember this is a private interest that wanted to sell it to a public system those lands will pay taxes in lieu of property taxes pil taxes it will continue the economy of the area but for the local areathis is pretty rural california really ruralthis will just be a huge economic boon tool i compliment mr huffman this is the

place has been one of the most bipartisan efforts that we engage in unfortunately for over the last year it hasnt seemed that way i think that the importance of maintaining the permanent law of 1938 and 1949 is not to suggest that farming today is as it was then of course it is not but the fact is that it has always provided in the past efforts back in 2008 and back in the last three or four decades the sort of incentive necessary to come together in a bipartisan fashion to put together a bill that reflects not just current farming needs throughout this great country of ours today but also to focus on the necessary importance of the nutrition programs that go to so many of those in our society that are in need now that brings me to the second point that is reflected in the senate measure that is reflected in this motion to instruct and that is bifurcating the nutrition programs it makes absolutely no sense there has been a tradition here that i think has worked well in maintaining the incredible amount of cornucopia of food that we produce in this nation and also never forgetting those in our society who are most in need that marriage between the nutrition programs which have benefited from the food that our farmers and ranchers and dairymen produce and those who need a helping hand has worked well so therefore why should we separate it why should we have a 3year nutrition program instead of the 5year that marries and complements the ongoing farm programs so for all of those reasons i support this motion to instruct and let me finally say the time has come the time has come to put away the posturing go to work go to conference and pass a farm bill that reflects americas needs"], [0.0007760226726531982, 0.4992239773273468, 0, "do you see this trophy
