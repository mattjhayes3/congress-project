balancing the federal budget i strongly support the ortonstenholm balanced budget because it is the only fair responsible budget this house will consider the ortonstenholm budget is the best option for a difficult task it balances the federal budget in 7 years it makes tough but reasonable cuts without dramatically hurting children and seniors as the kasich budget would it does not include tax cuts for the wealthiest which we cannot afford this is right because we should not cut taxes before our budget is balanced we tried this in 1981 and quadrupled the national debt in the process in contrast the republican budget is illconceived legislation the medicare cuts in the republican budget are devastating for both seniors and the institutions that serve them i will not support a bill which cuts health services to senior citizens especially after they have already paid into the system it will result in higher copayments deductibles and out of pocket costs and less choice of doctors no matter how you shape it less services for more money is a cut it cuts medicaid which will result in higher out of pocket costs to senior citizens for longterm care in nursing homes that is a cut and the republican budget cuts medicare and medicaid to pay for its tax breaks this is imprudent in my district these cuts will have a severe impact on the texas medical center i am particularty concerned about the cuts that will reduce funding for graduate medical education for many teaching hospitals such as baylor college of medicine and university of texas medical center these reductions will reduce the number of trained physicians medicare is a major contributor toward the cost of this education yet this budget will cut this function diamatically the ortonstenholm budget is better for our nations children another institution in my area texas childrens hospital receives 48 percent of its funding from the medicaid program in the form of reimbursement and disproportionate care the republican budget will cut medicaid by 30 percenl this is unfair and should be stopped the stenholm budget restores 50 billion for medicaid medicaid serves children and we should not forget these children in our efforts to balance the budget health research is also unfairly cut by the republican budget their plan would cut over 10 percent in fiscal year 1996that means many research projects for breast cancer alzheimers and hiv will go unfinished i am pleased that the ortonstenholm budget will provide 11 billion more for health research programs like those conducted at university of texas health science center m d anderson methodist st lukes baylor and hermann hospitals the ortonstenholm budget also incorporates all of the provisions of democratic welfare reform bill that requires welfare recipients to work ultimately with a good paying job welfare will not be necessary the ortonstenholm budget restores funding of 18 7 billion for student loans for many middleclass families these student loans are critical to pay for the cost of a college education the republican budget would give a tax break to the very wealthiest in the name of economic growth and investment and yet it would cut student loans education and job training this is an ironic folly the ortonstenholm budget helps veterans the republican budget hurts veterans by reducing benefits for those who have served the republican budget breaks the promise that we made when we asked these valiant americans to serve our nation i will not support breaking that promise the ortonstenholm budget is better for federal employees the republican budget will reduce pension benefits and health care benefits for federal employees the stenholm budget will not require these cuts the ortonstenholm budget also includes more funding for housing and economic development in my district a place to live and a job are the keys to ones success many of these housing programs help families to purchase their first home i believe it is good public policy to encourage home ownership not reduce it it is a question of fairness my constituents will accept cuts if they are fair ortonstenholm is fair the republican budget is not because it cuts benefits for senior citizens children students and veterans while giving a tax break we cannot afford to the very wealthiest as a new member of congress i was elected by my constituents to reduce the deficit and although there are many tough choices to be made and many programs ultimately will be cut the ortonstenholm plan is the best way to achieve a balanced budget and a healthier economy without sacrificing our investments in the american people"], [0.001397550106048584, 0.9986024498939514, 1, "i rise in opposition to the republican budget proposal we have before us today this is a proposal which shows that the republicans have not learned from last years budget debate last year when the republican proposals came to light the american people overwhelmingly voiced opposition to the extreme policies of cutting health care for the elderly gutting environmental protection and cutting such crucial investments as education in order to provide massive tax breaks and increase defense spending it was not just the dollars cut from the programs the gingrich dole budget also fundamentally changed these programs reneging on the basic assurances of health care education and work opportunities and devastating the environment i support responsible spending reductions and statistics show that the budget downpayment accomplished during 1993 and 1994 by congress and the president has paid off in terms of really reducing the deficit that downpayment has led to the lowest deficit level since the carter administration the congressional budget office reports that the deficit for fiscal year 1996 when measured against the size of the economy will be 1 9 percent of the gdp the lowest level since 1979 the numbers also show that it is the first time the deficit will have dropped 4 years in a row since president truman was in office the deficit is too high but we have made progress now the congressional republicans want to waste that hard work with tax breaks for short term political gain and platitudes of spending cuts way down the road it is largely because of improved economic figures and the fact that their budget window is now 6 years instead of 7 thatthe republicans come to us today with cuts which they claim are more moderate than last years budget proposal but although their numbers appear more moderate the gop gingrich core policy proposals arestill drastic with skewed priorities for our nations future the gingrich budget plan once again relies on massive cuts in medicare and medicaid programs which help over 70 million americans gain access to health insurance it is clear that there are serious problems with our current health care system congress should be acting to expand health care coverage and rein in escalating health care costs but instead republicans are focused on tearing our nations health safety net potentially adding millions more to the ranks of the uninsured the plan puts federal health care on a defined contribution basis not the existing assurance of health care to those who need it the republican medicare plan continues to include the same policy proposals as last years plan drastically cutting payments to providers restructuring the current program and heavily relying on untested medical savings accounts once again although changes are needed in the medicare part a program to extend solvency the republican plan goes too far changing medicare from reliable health insurance for our seniors to a secondclass health care system the claim of solvency is only a pretext for the outofcontext policy the gop pursues perhaps even more damaging than the medicare cuts are the cuts and program changes planned for medicaid medicaid provides health benefits to 36 million americans including 443 000 minnesotans under the republican plan the seniors people with disabilities and lowincome families who receive help from medicaid will be at risk of losing their coverage in addition states will be allowed to reduce their own share of funding for medicaid making the actual outs much more severe than they appear in the resolution again it is important to note that federal defined contribution plans will not provide the defined benefits that many rely upon each and every day as we head into the 21st century one of the most important investments our nation should make is in education republicans once again want to make the same extreme cuts as in last years resolution the budget hits students who need help with higher education costs by eliminating the direct loan program and eliminating new funding for perkins loans and state student incentive grants the budget makes a host of other education cuts such as eliminating goals 2000 bilingual education and immigrant education programs further the proposal slashes funding for job training such as the programs consolidated in the careers bill this budget resolution goes too far by cutting these programs 28 percent below the levels in the careers bill which already cut the programs by 20 percent alas it becomes clear that the goal of consolidation is the justification to shrink the block grant programs pretending that efficiency will make up 45percent cuts in programs doesnt hold up to commonsense evaluation on the environmental front the budget resolution calls for a 26percent cut in natural resources programs by 2002 even as we see more and more visitors to national parks and more public interest in protecting and enjoying our national heritage the republicans want to slash federal protection of these resources we all know that effectively protecting resources is expensive and that if we want to truly protect our environment we have to allocate sufficient funding the funding level in this budget resolution simply will not adequately protect our environment for future generations in addition the republican budget blueprint once again advocates destroying forever the arctic national wildlife refuge by permitting oil and gas exploration and drilling anwr is the last great piece of american wildemess and opening the refuge area to drilling will assure destruction of this priceless and irreplaceable treasure the budget blueprint contains negative policies which harm longstanding labor laws that protect american men and women such as repealing the davisbacon act and the service contract act and gutting osha under republican policies fair treatment for working families would be jettisoned and corporate management would set the rules without adequate safeguards or monitoring another area which merits concern are the cuts in housing and community and regional development continuing to cut housing when it has already been targeted for cuts in the past is pouring salt on the wounds of those most in need in addition the community development programs of cdbg and cdfi have their administration merged with the home program and transferred to states and local governments accompanied by severe budget cuts again the block grants are given short shrift how can this majority republican congress advance more block grants when it reneges on the basic tenet in fact the treatment of community development in this budget resolution shows the danger of turning programs into block grantsunderfunding block grants and ceding control of programs to the states have been the mantra of this new republican majority however as the budget belt tightens republicans seek cuts to the block grants leaving state and local governments with all the flexibility but with no funding to administer the programs or provide the services this should serve as a warning to all those who advocate block grants as the answer for every problem this gop budget recommends a 50percent cut in the federal flood insurance program areas that are cut from funding no doubt will not find affordable insurance and when the damage occurs the congress will reply with 100 percent federal assistance this is the final analysis it will not save money it will cost federal taxpayers and create political gamesmanship and more uncertainty the gop budget calls for 312 billion in unspecified domestic discretionary spending in the next 6 years meaning that the cuts already illustrated would be eclipsed by yet more savage slashes in future years however some sacrosanct pet programs are spared even while funding cuts and negative policy changes are proposed for health care education infrastructure the environment and community development the republicans plan proposes an increase in 1997 defense spending of 12 billion over the pentagons budget request most of this new spending goes to unrequested weapons systems including a host of new planes helicopters submarines and ships above what is necessary for our national defense the irony of these budget priorities is that the united states will enter the next century with more smart weapons systems but fewer smart soldiers to operate these sophisticated weapons systems we can continue to responsibly reduce the deficit and proposals have been put forth to show that we can do it in a fair manner the republicans make the task of deficit reduction a political sham by insisting on including tax breaks of 124 to 175 billion in their budget plans the amount that the republicans project for the cost of the one tax item is 124 billion and is not sufficient to pay for their additional proposed tax break policies meaning that the cost of the tax changes will be much higher when the entire policies are in place the tax policies in the resolution do not reflect fairness as the measure greatly reduces the eamed income tax credit for the working poor while making lowincome families ineligible for the new childrens tax credit the childrens tax credit will not benefit 34 percent of the nations children becausetheir parents income is so low that the nonreimbursement tax credit policy denies the child credit for low income families in addition the gingrich gop plan leaves the option open for a capital gains tax break a proven budget buster instead of including these unfair tax policies in their plan republicans should use these funds to moderate the cuts in other programs during the past year the republican majority has consistently shown that they do not value programs or protections for american working families and seniors ranging from affordable health care and a clean environment to quality education and a livable wage unfortunately as this fiscal year 1997 budget proposal shows they have not been listening to the consistent and concerned response of the american people which has been opposition to the republicans extreme actions the american people understand that in pursuit of fiscal and deficit balance we should not accept human deficit and social imbalance the people expect shared sacrifice not the gingrich cuts for people programs and tax breaks for the rich the policy that the gop is intent on advancing i urge my colleagues to oppose the republican budget resolution"], [0.0014195442199707031, 0.9985804557800293, 1, "i rise in opposition to h r 2425 the get old people gingrich republican put the hurt on seniors medicare destruction act of 1995 this bill is nothing more than a meanspirited attempt by the majority to destroy the basic health care rights all older americans now enjoy in order to give tax breaks to their wealthy big business special interest buddies never in all my time in congress have i witnessed a greater legislative travesty than the illconceived proposal we have before us today to begin with the rule we just considered stifles any amount of reasonable debate on this legislation for instance with the exception of pap smear testing this bill eliminates quality assurance guarantees that are now in place for patients who have diagnostic or other types of testing done in their doctors office laboratories it probably should not be surprising that the republican medicare proposalwhich bends so close to special interests and tilts so far from the best interests of americas senior citizenswould eliminate requirements for quality and accuracy of laboratory tests this like the republicans blatant and cruel elimination of national standards for nursing homes is one more way of saying to the ill the infirmed and the aged youre on your owngood luck where is the rationale for eliminating quality standards for cholesterol tests colon and prostate cancer screening needle biopsies to detect precancerous conditions glucose monitoring and so on there isnt any equally disturbing is the fact that this republican bill places a sevenyear freeze on medicare payments to providers of durable medical equipment such as wheel chairs electric beds walkers and yes even oxygen now this freeze is at a time when more and more americans are aging and the need will be greater this freeze will cause severe disruptions in the health care and quality of life for sick and or infirmed americans who need their wheelchairs and walkers to get around more easily electrical beds to rest comfortably and oxygen to breath effectively by putting a freeze on oxygen the republicans are literally taking the breath of life out of the bodies of old folk only god has that right i heard a member a few minutes ago say that he was glad that he had made 65 and qualifies for medicare a lot of people qualify for medicare who do not make 133 000 a year as he does and not only that people who use facilities like wheelchairs and the like were among those who are thrown outof the committee by the republican side in the committee on commerce julia searles 75 joseph rourke 90 years old theresa mckenna 68 years old bert seidman loretta adkins cecelia banks doretha beverly barbara greenwell gladys lyles roberta saxton annie earl marie roots lilly valentine gertrude snead ruth thorn edna custis all over age 69 who do not make 133 000 a year the 7year freeze on dme payments once again demonstrates the lengths to which the republicans have been driven by adopting an arbitrary cut of 270 billion in medicare so that they finance a tax cut for the rich in an attempt to protect these medicare beneficiaries i attempted to offer amendments to restore these provisions unfortunately the republicans would not let me let me also address the blatantly undemocratic process by which this proposal which will directly impact the health and wellbeing of 37 million older americans and nearly every family in the nation has been brought forth not one public hearing has been held in which the legislative specifics of the drastic medicare changes we are about to act on were in plain view this is appalling and flies in the face of the legislative process after flagrantly spending the taxpayers time and money without a second thought to conduct 28 days of hearings on whitewater 10 days of hearings on waco and 8 days of hearings on ruby ridge it is crystal clear that the republican party has put partisan politics above the public interest the fact that democrats had to convene hearings on the lawn of the capitol in order to provide a public forum to examine the gop plan is compelling evidence in and of itself that the speaker and his troops know that their proposals cannot stand up to public scru tiny moreover it speaks volumes to the enormous disconnect that exists between the republican party and the rights and needs of older americans today such a disconnect became extremely apparent on october 11 when 13 seniors some of whom were over 90 years old and relegated to wheel chairs came to ask questions about the republican medicare proposal prior to markup by the commerce committee they were promptly arrested and hauled off to jail at the direction of the committee chairman during the democratic lawn hearings however we helped answer the question just what does the republican medicare proposal do it charges seniors more for medical care medicine wheelchairs and medical devices it forces seniors to abandon their own doctors for some uncharted course through the hmo system it takes 270 billion in medicare funding away from seniors doctors and hospitals all to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy in short it devastates the health care program upon which so many millions of americans have come to rely among the many witnesses were several of my constituents from chicago who testified about the devastating consequences of the gop socalled reforms dr william troyer director of external services for the university of illinois at chicago medical center an academic health center which houses the nations largest medical school and serves thousands of 7th district residents gave a bleak view of the future under republican medicare changes to quote dr troyer a gradual weakening and eventual demise of uic medical center will result from the more than 7 billion in cuts to direct and indirect medical education funding proposed by the gop following dr troyer mr lacy thomas chief financial officer of the cook county bureau of health services was equally dismal in his predictions as a safety net provider for the disadvantaged and underserved in chicago the bureau will be unable to deliver basic care for this population due to the total eliminatior of assistance to nonunitedstates medical graduatesgraduates which comprise nearly 40 percent of chicago medical society physicians in addition 8 billion in reductions for disproportionate share payments to hospitals serving the indigent such as cook county will only serve to exacerbate the pain felt by these patients yet i believe the most compelling testimony came from ms irene nelson a senior from chicago who spoke eloquently regarding her fears of the republican medicare cuts she stated it is obvious to me that the people who are making these decisions are completely out of touch with the daily struggles of senior citizens like me i wonder if any of these people have ever been forced to decide between eating heating and paying that outstanding medical i doubt it very much but that is what i and many other seniors out there will be forced to do if the republicans are allowed to cut medicare it is of extreme importance that the american people are provided with this information on the republican plan to gut medicare in the dark of night and leave our nations seniors holding the bag after promising to balance the federal budget in 7 years increase military spending and provide hefty tax cuts to the richest americans in the country the gop is looking for a magic potion to fund these big promises unfortunately the republicans seem to think medicare is going to be the cureall in pushing a package of the deepest medicare cuts in the programs 30year history 270 billion the gop wants to immediately increase the cost of medicare to the average senior citizen by nearly 1 000 and force many to give up their own doctors this is bad policymaking and bad medicine for senior citizens in my state of illinois the proposed cuts will eliminate health care coverage outright for more than 58 000 individuals with disabilities over the next 7 years in addition 23 000 senior citizens will lose coverage outofpocket costs will increase by an average of 3 500 over the next 7 years for each of illinois 1 62 million medicare recipients further illinois will be denied 6 2 billion in federal health care assistance over the next 7 years i am outraged at the efforts of the gop to gut this essential program for no reason other than to pay for 245 billion in tax cuts for the rich it is unnecessary it is outrageous it is wrong as the saying goes you can fool some people some of the time but you cant fool all the people all of the time the vast majority of the american people are not fooled pass these medicare cuts and you will discover that cold hard fact pretty darn quick i

in the taxcuts in this bill go to corporations in 10 years the fact is the remaining part that goes to individuals the lions share of that goes to the wealthy you are not doing what you said you were going to do it is the same story through and through in this bill you deny you are proposing the policy deny you are passing the policy and deny the policy after it is enacted it does not take any courage to stand up here and vote for tax giveaways and then put the burden on someone else to do the cutting taking away kids lunches doing things of this nature that does not take courage it took

republican tax measure this might get applause as a trick but this pea and shell republican shift and shaft of middleincome families merits a no vote in the congress today and tomorrow i want to join with many of my colleagues in opposing this illconceived poorly timed legislation for big business and the very rich this bill may very well be the crown jewel of the republican political agenda but for the working families who i represent this republican legislation is a rhinestone a phony gemstone this is a tax shift bill placing over the next 10 years more burden on individuals and less on the big business corporations in fact corporations receive nearly 50 percent of the total tax cuts and today the corporations and big business pay half as much as they did in 1965 this tax shafts the middleincome families who are promised tax breaks this republican bill gives those breaks to the affluent the top income 12 percent get 52 percent of this gop bill tax breaks the republican bill is simply a tax shift and a tax shaft for american working families the rich get richer and working families get republican tax cut rhetoric there are clear winners and losers under the republican bill family households earning over 200 000 will receive an average tax cut of 11 266 per year while working families earning between 30 000 and 50 000 will receive an average annual cut of 569 touted as a family friendly bill the centerpiece of this legislation the 500 child tax credit does not help those families with 34 percent of our children over 24 million children are denied this tax credit since their families income would not be high enough for the credit to apply while many children will not benefit from this tax bill these children will pay the pricetoday and tomorrowthe loss of school lunches reductions in college loans and a 10 year 630 billion reduction in revenues to add to the federal deficit welcome to the republican idea of fairness the shift and shaft tax contract on america many of my republican colleagues talk about this legislation as the reflection of the peoples voice in november i do agree that the american people are angry but they werent angry about the rich not paying their fair share the american people werent angry that the inheritance exemption is only 600 000 the american people certainly are not mad because corporations now must pay an alternative minimum tax but the american people will be yet more angry when they read the fine print of this republican contract they will be angry when they learn that the american family rhetoric has been the vehicle to deliver tax breaks that primarily benefit the top 10 percent of americans their anger will be compounded when they understand that the price of their 500 tax credit will be megatax breaks for big business including a major loophole that will allow some corporate giants to get off without paying one cent in taxes while the middle class gets the bill for the republicans reneging on their childrens education from school lunches to college grants and loans the advocates point to the 189 billion in tax breaks over the first 5 years but this measure is back loaded because in 10 years revenue is reduced 630 billion the majority g o p havent put forth many of the cuts and reductions to achieve such savings and to offset and pay for this revenue loss those limited cuts that have been advanced are grossly unfair unworkable meanspiritedbut none the less most of the republican cuts are masked in budget ceilings not specific and certainly not achieved the republicans said they would cut spending first but they have reneged on that today it doesnt take much talent and certainly little courage to pass massive tax cuts spreading around the tax giveaways to every special interest group on the map no it doesnt take much thought to give away the store republican style and that is what this tax bill does provides instant gratification and a longterm economic bellyache the antifederal government rhetoric has led to a tax cut policy that will disable the federal government render the national government unable to responsibly respond to the needs of our nation this tax

socalled class warfare well the gop claimed that this tax measure was a middle income tax benefitwhat has been pointed out repeatedly is that this measure tax breaks go to big corporations and the

year 1995 from the very beginning of deliberations on this legislation it has been clear that draconian and callous cuts to funds already approved for federal programs were for the purpose of fulfilling the republican contract with america to cut taxes this is abundantly clear when you consider that the conference agreement rejects the house adopted amendment which required all budgetary savings from the rescissions bill be used for deficit reduction under the republican proposal these savings can be use to finance tax cuts to benefit the wealthiest persons in this nation take for example the 6 3 billion cut from critical housing programs serving the elderly low income and homeless families with children and the disabled the 1 9 billion cut from incremental assistance programs means a loss of 52 000 section 8 rental certificates an additional 815 million reduction in public housing modernization will prevent public housing agencies from rehabilitating some 40 000

wealthy under the gingrich medicare plan instead of letting the gingrich republicans make those cuts to do that we should be going after fraud in medicare the whole balanced billing issue that ms delauro mentioned that will cause more waste in medicare and will cause more medicare beneficiaries to have less services at higher cost what they tried in the medicare and the medicaid bills what the gingrich bills on medicare and medicaid said last year and this year that to allow physicians to refer for any kind of services diagnostic services mris or others to facilities that those physicians own we have in this body long before any of the three of us were here tried to go after some of those fraudulent aspects of medicare anyway to make sure that people really were getting their dollars worth and doctors were paid properly that hospitals were reimbursed properly and that patients had an opportunity to get good health care at the lowest cost possible now we are opening the floodgates when there is already according to the gao already something like 100 billion in fraud in medicare over 7 years that we could recover they are opening the floodgates more so we could have maybe twice as much fraud the fact is instead of giving these tax breaks instead of cutting medicare and giving tax breaks to the wealthiest people in the country as speaker gingrich and the republicans want to do we should be going after these in a variety of different ways some of these fraudulent practices that have happened in medicare go after some of the double billings and some of the problems that we have seen not opening up the floodgates so there can be more it is clear that that is the way to deal with the medicare that is the medicare solution for now rather than making major cuts and saying

review of history however recent history it reveals the true culprit is newt gingrich himself since april speaker gingrich has been threatening to shut down the government and throw the country into default quite frankly he is the only person that has talked about shutting the government down but now the day of reckoning has arrived and the speaker has developed a very serious case of cold feet so he is desperately trying to blame the president the fact remains that it is the speaker who put this blackmail scheme into motion months ago take a look at what speaker gingrich was saying in april he said the president will veto a number of things and we will then put them all on this debt ceiling that everyone is talking about and then we will decide how big a crisis that he wants quoting the washington times april 3 1995 in september it was reported that speaker gingrich was at it again continuing his threats and he says and i quote i dont care what the price is i dont care if we have no executive offices and no bonds for 30 days not at this time again the quote i dont care what the price is that says it all does it not well speaker gingrich may not care what the price is because he is not the one who is going to be asked to pay the price of a government shutdown and government default will fall squarely on the shoulders of middle class families in this nation when the speaker gets his wish and the government shuts down the speaker will keep his job he will keep his pay but over 800 000 federal workers will not when the government defaults on its financial obligations again the speaker will have his book royalties to cushion that blow but millions of middle class families will pay the price in higher mortgage payments in higher car payments and in higher credit card payments the blame for this manufactured crisis should fail squarely on the shoulders of newt gingrich and not on the shoulders of middle class families in this country the president is right to say no to a budget that calls for higher medicare payments for seniors as a matter of fact on january 1 it will be a 25 percent increase for this nations seniors higher college tuitions for students and their parents and higher taxes for working middleclass families this is not an agenda that the american people support and in fact it appears the public never did support this kind of agenda for months republicans have been promoting their contract with america by saying that more than 60 percent of the american public supported its policies however we find out from last friday that they had a political consultant whose name is frank luntz and he claimed he tested all of these policies in fact what he did and he was forced to admit this last week that he actually only polled and talked to the american public about slogans about 10 slogans so it turns out that the gingrich revolution is built on the 10 most popular slogans that the republicans could find it had nothing to do with programs there was no testing of how americans would feel about cutting 270 billion from medicare of increasing the payments for senior citizens and cutting student loans it is no wonder that the bumper sticker government of the new majority has worn thin with the american public all the sloganeering will not hide the devastating cuts to seniors to students and to middle class families in this country and in fact what is happening today is the more that the american public understands the nature of this program the more they did like the gingrich revolution as a matter of fact on friday in usa today public opposition to the contract with america was affirmed sixty percent of those polled want president clinton to veto the republican budget as it stands more specifically 75 percent oppose the gops medicare cuts and 74 percent oppose the gops student loan cuts let me just say that the republicans have lost public support for these policies so now what they have done is resorted to blackmailing the president to get him to sign this extreme budget that is what this is all about but i will tell my colleagues that the president is standing with the american people in opposition to these policies to my republican colleagues i say if they want the president to sign their budget make changes do not make threats if they want him to sign the budget lessen the blow to senior

country maybe not us maybe our children and maybe our grandchildren are in debt 5 trillion that is a fact my 2yearold grandson owes 187 000 on his portion of the interest on the debt if we continue to follow the lead of mr gephardt we would borrow another trillion over the next 4 years get into the 21st century and start borrowing a trillion every 3 years and next year we would pay more for the interest on the debt than we actually spend on defense and where would it end i think it is pretty clear if we continue to follow the gephadt plan that we are going to end up bankrupt we are going to end up a mess in this country with a standard of living that none of us want for our children there is another option we can follow the lead of the great south american economies and we can start

whatever we want to spend with no prioritizing just spend it if we like it and we could get into the 21st century and our children would be paying 85 cents out of every dollar they earn just for taxes just to keep this country afloat now it is my personal opinion my children are doing enough my father paid 1 out of every 50 he earned in federal taxes my son is paying 1 out of every 4 he earns they are doing enough our only alternative then was to do what the people i know in the 10th district of georgia said do they said for us to balance this budget by cutting spending and in addition to that they said we do not like the 103d congress and mr clintons 260 billion tax increase and if my colleagues do not believe they did not like it look around this body sometime and look at all the new

a tax cut i think of this as a tax return we are giving 245 billion back out of the 260 billion now we start doing what they told me to do start by cutting the spending that is precisely what this

work the republican bill is simply an exercise in cutting programs that serve children the disabled and families living in poverty what can possibly be the motive for launching such a cruel attack on the children of america the answer is the republican majority will cut programs for the poor to provide tax cuts for the wealthy cuts in child care school lunches and programs for the poor will be used to finance tax breaks like the capital gains tax cut we are literally shortchanging americas children to give tax breaks to individuals with incomes over 100 000 a year the republican bill will punish over 15 million innocent american children it would punish children who are born outofwedlock to a mother under the age of 18 iv punishes any child who happens to be born to a family already on welfare this bill does not guarantee that a child will have safe child care when their parents work it cuts ssi benefits to over 680 000 disabled children under this bill state accountability for the death of a child is limited simply to reporting the childs death finally this bill adds to the injuries of abused and neglected children by cutting 2 billion from federal programs to care for these children americans must ask what will happen to these children the result without a question will be an increase in the number of children who go to bed hungry the republican bill will increase the risk of a child in poverty suffering from abuse and neglect and yes the result will be that some mothers who want to give birth to a child will be pushed to consider ending their pregnancy the republican bill is a cruel attack on americas children but it also fails to provide the essential tools needed by parents who want to move from welfare to work a mother who takes a minimum wage job can only do so if she has access to safe child care unfortunately this bill will cut federal funds for child care by 25 percent in the year 2000 this means that over 400 000 fewer children will receive federal child care assistance pennsylvania alone will lose 25 7 million in federal child care assistance funding by the year 2000 that means that over 15 000 children in pennsylvania will be denied federal assistance for safe child care the legislation will result in americas poor children being left home alone mothers who are required by the state to work will no longer be guaranteed child care states that seek to provide childcare assistance will have to make up for federal child care cuts by raiding other state programs or increasing state taxes again the republican bill is

the arguments on the other side that insurance companies are holding down the mental health parity issue i will tell my colleagues the insurance companies would love to have mental health parity because they would like to have those premiums coming in the gentleman from washington who says it is terrible that we do not have mental health parity in the bill i guess if i was a psychiatrist i would think it was terrible also but that is a provision that we do not have in the bill i will tell members why there are two groups of people who lose when we put mental health parity in this bill i am talking about billions of dollars of cost not millions not thousands not hundreds but billions of dollars of cost first of all to people who buy insurance policies if mental health parity is in that bill it would cost the moms and dads the middieclass workers in this country an increased insurance cost which would be astronomical so there is a good reason that that is not in the bill the second good re ason is that the employers who provide health care and mental health care to their employees all of a sudden would have a choice your choice is mr employer that you will start to increase your health care costs astronomically because you are including a provision in here that has never gone through a committee in this house did not go through a committee in the senate but somebody would like to throw it in what happens the employer says i always provided mental health for my employees but the cost is so high i am not going to do it anymore who loses out the people that lose out in that provision are the people who for years were able to cover themselves with mental health policies but now because of a provision that was put in in the senate at the last minute without debate or anything else on a whim was knocked out in conference committee who wins because of that people who have to pay the bills my colleagues not the gentleman from california who advocated a big government health care takeover just 3 years ago or 4 years ago or the gentleman from washington who advocated that we do the canadian health care plan where the government does everything and we lose control of what happens in health care in this country so there is a reason things happen around here a good reason i think we have a bill before us today that has some provisions in it i again was wondering why my good friend who is the minority whip from michigan he said we are just denying moms and dads this ability to cover themselves i remember distinctly that my good friend from michigan denied the rowlandbilirakis bill from coming forward in this house 3 years ago when we would have given portability to moms and dads who wanted to move to better jobs that wanted lletter opportunity but they were denied that because some members in this house wanted to present a big government takeover of health care and they were afraid that the rowlandbilirakis bill would undercut that it is 3 years later there is a bill here that will give people portability in health care it will give the doctor the ability to tell his patient what the cost of a service is that patient can choose with his medical savings account whether he wants to go to this doctor or that doctor or that doctor because he knows what something costs he knows what the problems are and he gets straight answers because he makes that decision not a third party payer someplace to the gentleman from california that is going to save health care costs in this country billions and billions of dollars something that you wanted to deny when you wanted big health care to take over in this country the barber in illinois that told me awhile back that he wanted deductibility for the cost of his health care from his income tax we do that in this bill we do a lot of good things for people it is a good bill and i think it deserves the support of this body i thank the chairman and the chairman of the committee on ways and means and the chairman of the committee on commerce and the senate staff and all our staff who worked to make this thing happen"], [0.0002313852310180664,
