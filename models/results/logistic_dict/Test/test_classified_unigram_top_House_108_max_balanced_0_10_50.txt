everything around you right now we have troops in the field a war has begun and we should be doing everything we can to speak with one voice and achieve national unity yet the republican leadership insists at this moment in bringing to the floor one of the most partisan divisive issues of the entire year i question their judgment and their timing i would hope that we would move fairly quickly today to a resolution supporting our troops in the field unfortunately our republiqan friends prefer to have on the floor a matter of high partisanship which will divide this congress like all of my colleagues republicans as well as democrats and like the american people themselves i fully support our troops i hope and pray that they will accomplish their mission as quickly and safely as possible for that reason i have argued that we should not be considering this bill today republicans have offered a budget that is as partisan as it is divisive as dishonest as it is dangerous to the country and at a time like this when the united states congress should be demonstrating its unity to the world i fear that bringing it to the floor guarantees a divisive debate but that is what republican leaders have done today and unfortunately there is no minimizing the differences between the democratic and republican budgets the democratic budget alternatives offered by the committee on the budget ranking member the gentleman from south carolina is a responsible plan to strengthen national security and restore economic growth and fiscal responsibility it tightens federal spending and balances the budget using honest accounting but it still meets priorities like defense education and health care and it does more for homeland security than the republican budget does there are two other budget alternatives offered by groups of democrats the blue dogs on one hand and the congressional black caucus and progressive caucus on the other they are worthwhile and i am glad that they are in order under this rule the republican budget stands in stark contrast the republican budget is intellectually dishonest morally indefensible and just plain bad for our economy and our nation it explodes the deficit and raises the death tax on all americans it shortchanges homeland security to pay for tax breaks for millionaires and it proves once again just how out of touch house republicans truly are at a time which this nation must come together republicans offer a budget that will pull us apart simply put the republican budget separates americans into two categories winners and losers the winners are the wealthiest few who get hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks the losers are everyone else the people who have to sacrifice to pay for those tax breaks for the wealthiest few to paraphrase winston churchill never have so many been asked to sacfifice for so few the republican budget skimps on homeland security it slashes priorities like education and health care it shortchanges veterans and farmers and it still explodes the deficits that is because the republican budget is a shameless work of fiction it calls for draconian cuts cuts in priorities like veterans benefits student loans and law enforcement and still gives massive tax breaks to the wealthiest but it requires the tax breaks to be enacted by npril 11 and gives republicans until july 11 to make the spending cuts when you get your dessert before you eat your spinach you never eat your spinach any american parent can tell us that and so can anyone else who has watched the republican budget charade drive up the deficit over the past few years as the gentleman from texas the foremost proponent of fiscal responsibility in this house told us yesterday in the committee on rules the tax cuts will be enacted and the spending cuts will be abandoned and the deficit will continue to explode why are republicans foisting this dangerous budget on america and on our economy for one simple reason because they stubbornly insist on giving massive tax breaks to the wealthiest few they say that to govern is to choose well take a look at the consequences of the choices republicans have made in this budget american troops are at war but republicans chose to shortchange the veterans who defended this nation in past years and to give tax breaks to millionaires that is why the veterans of foreign wars opposes the republican budget republicans chose to slash education and to give tax breaks to millionaires they chose to cut health care for children and seniors on medicaid and to give tax breaks to millionaires they chose to cut assistance to farmers and to give tax breaks to millionaires that is why the conservative farm bureau opposes the republican budget republicans are even shortchanging homeland security and once again they are making sure millionaires get all the tax breaks they want despite all these cruel cuts cuts that touch almost all americans and their families this republican budget still explodes the deficit all the budget gimmicks and phony accounting inthe world what president bush once called fuzzy math cannot hide that truth all in all the republicans are proposing an economic horror show at a time when americans are still suffering from the latest republican recession since president bush took office 2 5 million americans have lost their jobs in the private sector the surplus has gone and last years deficit was 317 billion but republicans refuse to face that fact so they propose a budget that would actually harm the economy by driving the nation deeper into debt raising the debt tax on all americans and their children and increasing families mortgage payments and credit card bills moreover this republican budget does not account for how we are going to pay for a war with iraq that has begun so yesterday in the committee on rules the gentleman from missouri"], [0.00017529726028442383, 0.9998247027397156, 1, "i yield myself such time as i may consume today i am offering a motion to instruct conferees on the child tax credit mr speaker while many of my colleagues continue to believe that higher deficits and more tax cuts for the rich are the way to end this bush recession let us look at the facts since the beginning of the bush administration america has seen the loss of over 3 3 million jobs of which 2 5 million have been in manufacturing moreover taxes on working families have gone up this is via interest rate increases that makes your monthly mortgage payments higher and increases your monthly car payments tie national deficit has soared to almost half a trillion dollars this year and is increasing and what are you getting your tax dollars are paying over 300 billion this year alone on interest on the bush tax cut for the rich finally democrats working with senate republicans put forth a bill to give working families a real tax cut an extension of the child tax credit the republicans oppose it they are opposing a tax cut on working families tie people missing out on this tax cut include 6 5 million working families and their 12 million children who are struggling to make ends meet one in five of these chldhren are front active duty military families making even a republican senator from arizona who by the way ran for president just 2 years ago to say and i quote i dont understand how you the republican leadership and the president left enlisted men and women out of this tax package i do not get it end quote additionally this bill will disproportionately penalize african american and hispanic children 2 4 million african american children and 4 1 million hispanic childrens families deserve this tax cut but the republican party refuses to give it to them preferring tax cuts for millionaires and big business this according to the chlildrens defense fund this republican tax package ignores the needs of working families and by ignoring 6 5 million working families it will have a devastating impact on these families and the children across our country it will have a particularly devastating impact on latino and african american families those suffering some of the worst brunt of this bush recession we see 3 3 million unitedstates jobs disappear in america since january of 2001 we see the unemployment rate for african americans at 11 2 percent of the population we see the hispanic unemployment rate at 7 5 percent on top of that this most recent tax bill for the rich cut out child care tax benefits for the poorest children in america whose parents are working not on welfare as the republicans would have you believe but are working people who can barely keep their head above water thanks to the economic nightmare cast on america by this republican party and president bush these are people struggling to provide for their families and this republican congress refuses to fix it republicans are holding americas working families hostage by opposing any legislative remedy to help working families and instead by offering another huge tax cut for the richest 1 percent of americans again i believe it is shameful to be offering tax cuts to the rich while cutting benefits for the working poor cutting benefits for our veterans cutting benefits for seniors on medicare and allowing millions of american jobs to disappear since president bush and republicans began to set economic policy almost 3 years ago president bushs economic plan has failed the american people who should be some of the most cherishd members of our society our veterans working families and innocent children president bushs economic plan does more than ignore these groups in my opinion and many other peoples opinion it hurts them as the disabled american veterans wrote in a letter to speaker hastert and the republican party earlier this year during consideration of the republican budget which mandated massive cuts in veterans programs disabled american veterans asked have you no shame they were speaking to the republican party today i ask that same question on behalf of the working families of my district the bronx and queens the child tax credit bill passed by this republican house leaves children and families in my district behind particularly families of color families earning between 10 500 a year and 26 625 a year are excluded from claiming the child tax credit increase what does this mean for latino families half of all latinos report having an annual household income under 30 000 half of all latinos report having an annual household income under 30 000 the house republican child tax credit plan means most of these latino families will be excluded will be excluded from the child tax credit it means that approximately 1 6 million or 30 percent of the eligible latino families who might have otherwise benefited from the increase are being left out this is on top of the fact that the bush economic plan means more latinos are out of work moreover latinos have a fasterrising unemployment rate than the general population as of this summer it was 7 5 percent compared to roughly 6 percent for the average american this is on top of the fact that the bush tax cut on dividend income affects only 7 percent of hispanics who own stock latinos in my district want to work and they want to do what they can to provide good futures for their children but many latinos in my district are working in lowwage jobs or thanks to the number of fulltime jobs lost are only working part time they are being left out of the bush tax credit president bushs priorities are clearly not working for latino families and they are clearly not working for african american families either african american families are among the hardest hit by the bush tax plan and the house republican child tax credit about 932 000 african american children under the age of 18 according to the childrens defense fund live in extreme poverty given our economy it is unfortunately not surprising that this statistic represents a 50 percent increase since 1999 african american families like latino families are disproportionately left out of the bush child tax credit african american unemploymint is rising to above 10 percent those who are eligible to find work are often barely getting by these are the families that need the child tax credit the most and yet these are the families that the republicans and this president are leaving out a family earning 20 000 with two children is being overlooked by president bush in faor of the family earning 200 000 a year who does not necessarily need the child tax credit yet a family earning 20 000 is the family that sincerely needs a 400 child tax credit that credit would be equivalent to a 4 percent raise in pay but that tax credit does not exist under president bushs plan president bushs priorities are not the families that need the tax credit the most president bush continues to ignore the voices of latino and african american families our national debt increases our debt limit increases and president bush continues to increase tax breaks for those who do not need them and i believe and all of this side of the aisle believe that that is wrong mir speaker i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.0002753138542175293, 0.9997246861457825, 1, "i would like to thank the chairman of the congressional black caucus for organizing this special order and i too commend him for taking so much of his time to organize us to come to this floor to help shed light on what is going on in this congress and in this world i look forward to every opportunity that he affords me to participate the massive costs of the war and how they will affect americans in their everyday lives is an incredibly important issue that we must continue to discuss this past monday the president sent his fiscal year 2005 budget to congress we found out that under this presidents guidance the nations debt has grown to record numbers this year alone the deficit is expected to be at least 521 billion and the national debt has grown by 1 7 trillion since 2001 yet instead of taking the necessary steps to bring our fiscal house into order the president has proposed more of his failed policies i am having an interesting time discussing this with my friends they say to me maxine waters i thought that you were the one that has been accused of being one of those taxandspend liberals but now your president has outdone you he is spending money like a drunken sailor how can you explain it i say to him i cannot explain it but it falls into that category of misdirection of tales that are being told that just do not hold up when you place them under scrutiny the presidents budget is extremely dangerous it calls for eliminating 38 education programs and cutting funding for dozens of others it does virtually nothing for the 43 million americans who have no health insurance it cuts 1 6 billion from huds section 8 voucher program and an additional 130 million from public housing the presidents budget even cuts by 7 percent programs designed to protect our drinking water keep our air clean nd other important environmental programs the budget even calls for imposing copayments and enrollment fees for our veterans in order to receive health care for their injuries sustained while protecting our nation i find it appalling that our president would require our veterans to pay up to 250 enrollment fees in order to receive the care they need but these are just a few examples of the administrations policies that penalize working americans the war in iraq is a continuation of these policies it is the working american that is fighting dying and paying for this war the wealthiest of americans on the other hand are not being asked to make any of these sacrifices none are serving themselves and few if any have sons or daughters in the unitedstates armed forces and they are the beneficiaries of hundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts which makes it increasingly difficult to pay for this war to date the president has asked for and received 157 billion for this war in iraq amazingly recent press 7reports suggest that the president will ask for another additional 50 million shortly after the next election for military activities in iraq and afghanistan this will bring the total to 206 billion what is so disappointing though not surprising is the difference between what we were told the costs would be for this war and what the costs are turning out to be throughout the buildup to the war and even during the early stages the american people were assured that the costs would be minimal who can forget deputy secretary of defense wolfowitz statement in march of 2003 when he said were dealing with a country that can really finance its own reconstruction and relatively soon but the sad reality is that it is the american people who are paying for this war as we look at this administration and this war we cannot help but now understand why the american people are finally waking up to how they have been misled and misdirected by this president and this administration of course we heard refarences tonight to the reason we were told we were going into this war and we must say it over and over again we did a preemptive strike because saddam hussein and iraq had weapons of mass destruction and we were in imminent danger we were told this over and over again and colin powell even had some maps he pointed to some sheds where chemicals were being made and the weapons of mass destruction were being developed but we have been misled on many things by this president and now we find ourselves in a terrible situation in iraq we are not in control our soldiers are dying being picked off one by one suicide bombings are taking place soldiers are losing their lives i am sure their families are asking why or what does this all mean not only are they losing their lives we were told after the president could no longer support or justify the weapons of mass destruction that we really needed a regime change that we had to be about the business of creating democracy in iraq now we are at the point where our president has said they are going to turn over governance to the iraqis only to find out that this president does not want free and fair elections he does not want free and fair elections because oh somebody may win that he does not like and i want you to know that the protests are growing in iraq about the fact that this president now wants to select and choose who will be in charge of iraq he wants to put in a council through some kind of caucuses to avoid the shiites being in control because they may be the ones that get elected in this war as opposed to the sunnis that they would like to have elected but whether we are talking about iraq or afghanistan we really did not have a plan we really thought we could just bomb everybody into submission take over the oil fields and chop up the spoils and are we disappointed my goodness how much more insult do the american people have to take from this administration here we have the vice president of the united states of america mr dick cheney who is still receiving paychecks from his old company halliburton and what have we found out about halliburton they are cheating us right and left not only have they overcharged us for the oil they are importing from kuwait to iraq we find out they are cheating us on the amount of the food that they are serving to our soldiers they are giving us extraordinary numbers only to find out that they are not really serving the numbers that they represent i talked about some of this last night but it goes on and on and on we are paying for a war that we should not have been in in the first place we are paying contractors who are cheating us like halliburton who are getting nobid contracts and there is no end to all of this this administration is going to have to pay a price for what it has done i am glad that we are here talking about it this evening the administrations rhetoric does not support the situation we find ourselves in today we were not welcomed as liberators there are no weapons of mass destruction hundreds of unitedstates soldiers are dying and taxpayers are paying billions of dollars for a war that need not be fought meanwhile our responsibilities here at home are being neglected the senates ricin scare yesterday reminds us that our homeland is not as secure as it should be our schools continue to be in disrepair and hundreds of thousands of workers are losing their jobs we need to reassess our priorities unfortunately this budget does not do any of these things there is so much more we can say but i am going to yield my time to our leader here so that he can wrap this up tonight but we have more to say and we will be back again because the american public wants to hear from us"],

front lines in iraq as well as the needs of our dedicated members of the civil service here at home this bill includes much needed increases in separation allowance and combat pay for troops that are deployed in combat it also includes provisions that will greatly improve the a76 process which governs competitions between the private sector and federal employees these provisions will ensure among other things that federal employees are permitted to compete for their jobs before they are outsourced to the private sector and will give them the same legal rights as contractors enjoy these are important protections that i strongly support however i have a number of concerns with other provisions in the bill and believe it should have gone further than it does in some areas iraq is fast becoming a hall of mirrors when the administration says conditions are getting better they are probably getting worse when the administration says they have a plan they usually dont and when the administration says they are trying to build an international coalition they may actually be further alienating our allies we can add another contradiction to this list when the administration says they will closely scrutinize the work of private contractors in iraq what they mean is that they have given the contractors a virtual blank check the coalition provisional authority has identified over 2 000 specific reconstruction projects in iraq the contracts to perform this work should be bid competitively so that market forces would dictate the costs to taxpayers but under the administrations approach not a single one of the 2 000 reconstruction projects will be awarded on the basis of competition instead they will all be performed on a costplus basis by large private contractors who have been awarded monopolies over large sectors of the reconstruction effort the public wonders why unsupervised private contractors would be allowed to interrogate and abuse prisoners in abu ghraib how halliburton could be allowed to charge inflated prices for gasoline and to submit bills for millions of meals it never served and why there is so little to show for the billions that the administration has spent on the reconstruction effort there is one answer to all of these questions whether by design or incompetence the administration is failing in its responsibility to oversee the reconstruction effort and to protect the taxpayer from waste fraud and abuse under these circumstances aggressive and impartial oversight is obviously crucial yet as i and others described in a report released yesterday the administration has outsourced this essential oversight responsibility to private contractors who have significant conflicts of interest while parsons is supposed to oversee fluors electricity work in iraq parsons and fluor have a huge 2 6 billion joint venture in kazakhstan ch2m hill has been permitted to oversee the iraq work of washington group international fluor and amec even though it has existing contractual relationships with all three companies in the united states parsons is even in a position to benefit its own reconstruction efforts through the use of its oversight powers this is an unacceptable situation that i would have liked to address with an amendment to this bill unfortunately it was not made in order another way to ensure vigorous congressional oversight of the iraqi reconstruction efforts would be to require the defense department to provide contract information to both the chair and ranking members of committees with jurisdiction for months i have attempted to obtain information from the administration about the contracting in iraq for the most part the administration has a poor record of complying with these requests i have written four letters to the white house requesting information about the inflated prices halliburton was charging to import gasoline into iraq under a sole source idio contract from the army corps of engineers the only responses they received were two nearly identical twoparagraph letters from condoleezza rice saying that pentagon auditors are invdstigating the overcharges the white house hasnt offered any justification for halliburtons 2 64 per gallon price of gasoline from kuwait the white house hasnt turned over task orders or invoices for the gasoline importation work either its not just the white house ive also written to secretary rumsfeld to request information about halliburtons subcontractors and the process by which they were selected i sought basic documents like the subcontracts themselves and the bid proposals from potential subcontractors over five months have passed but the defense department has not produced any of the requested documents under the bill the department is required to respond to a request from the ranking member of the armed services committee that is a start i would have liked to offer an amendment to also require the department to respond to the government reform committee which has governmentwide jurisdiction over contracting issues but again unfortunately the amendment was not made in order one of the reasons events are not going well in iraq is that there has not been enough accountability and oversight by this house no one was held accountable for the administrations false claimthat iraq attempted to obtain uranium from niger or misleading claims about iraqs alleged weapons of mass destruction while we all agree that the abuse and torture of iraqi detainees at the abu ghraib prison is completely unacceptable and universally condemn this illegal and inhumane misconduct the house has yet to fully investigate this terrible episode today i offered a procedural motion to express the sense of the house of representatives that a select committee should immediately be established to investigate the treatment of detainees held by the administration in connection with the global war on terrorism a select committee is necessary because this house has ignored its constitutional responsibility for holding the administration accountable time and time again the republican leadership has demonstrated that it has no interest in performing any serious oversight of the administration i am disappointed that the motion failed by a vote of 202224 there are other troubling elements of this bill that i do not support i staunchly oppose the more than 10 billion authorized for ballistic missile programs plagued by massive cost overruns and consistent failures in testing i also oppose other wasteful programs like the 4 2 billion included for the f a22 raptor a fighter aircraft best known for its technical difficulties questionable utility and unprecedented pricetag of between 200 to 300 million per plane i find it most disturbing that the bill also allows continued research for the development of lowyield nuclear weapons for deployment in combat and directs 36 million to research the feasibility of an earthpenetrating nuclear weapon that existing research shows is more likely to spread contamination than destroy its target the bush administrations quest for usable nuclear weapons contravenes the basic principle of nuclear deterrence and threatens to undermine decades of unitedstates leadership nonproliferation efforts together with the doctrine of preemption and the presidents policy endorsing the use of nuclear weapons against nonnuclear states the effort sends the wrong message at a time when we are trying to get the international community to help us challenge proliferation in

among these substances used by teenagers was androstendione which mark mcgwire admitted using when setting the record androstendione is a steroid precursor it is not a steroid under current definition

must do everything it can to go after terrorists to root out terrorism as president bush said there are no good terrorists there are only bad and every nation has an obligation to protect its citizens and go after the terrorists that is why it was so disheartening to hear president bush say israels attempted kttack on one of the biggest hamas terrorists mr rantisi was not helpful i do not know whether a nation ought to think about what is helpful or not when they are trying to protect their citizens we in the united states went halfway around the world to destroy the taliban in afghanistan not because the taliban committed crimes against us but because the taliban harbored al qaeda which committed heinous acts against us if we are justified and we are in going halfway around the world to destroy terrorists surely israel is justified to do the same in her own backyard after all it was president bush who said osama bin laden wanted dead or alive and it was president busb who talked about saddam hussein and his connections with terrorists we went into iraq and overthrew saddam hussein certainly israel should be encouraged to go after terrorists not discouraged to go after terrorists and we should not set a double standard for israel we should set the same standard as we would set for ourselves last week there was an agreement to try to proceed on a socalled road map for peace in the middle east and all parties agreed that the palestinian prime minister the israeli prime minister and president bush all talked about going along the path to peace during that time the prime minister of israel has dismantled some of the settlements has talked about having peace with the palestinians and what was the response on the palestinian side the three terrorist organizations hamas the palestinian islamic jihad which is part of arafats fattah network and hezbollah all got together and took credit for the assassination of five israeli soldiers that was the palestinian terrorists answer to peace the palestinian prime minister machmoud abbas who said he would try to persuade the terrorists to have a ceasefire was not able to persuade them at all in fact they rejected his calls for a ceasefire machmoud abbas the palestinian prime minister then said he would not use force to try to get the terrorists to stop he would only try to persuade them i would say if mr abbas the palestinian prime minister is not going to attempt to use force to stop terrorists from committing terrorist acts then israel has the right to take matters into her own hards and to use force to stop terrorists from committing these heinous acts after all since mr rantisi is one of the leaders of hamas which kills innocent men women and children civilians why should mr rantisi think he is somehow immune to some kind of attacks on his life it is very important that israel the united states and all peaceloving countries in the world go after terrorism and when nations go after terrorism other nations should help them not say that it is unhelpful for peace let us talk about the road map which everyone seems to be so ecstatic about the road map will only work if and when thfe palestinians decide if and when they are going to put an end to terror and not use terror as a negotiating tool and the road map should be performancebased not timebased in other words the palestinians have to perform they have to stop terrorism before they get their state if they do not stop terrorism they do not get their state they should not merrily march along to statehood in 2004

did last night on cspan by the way and i know millions of americans were listening as well i thank the gentleman for the leadership he has provided on this issue in this congress and in politics around the country whether it is state legislatures or city councils or county supervisors there is a thing that has to happen in the dynamics in order for good public policy to be formed and that is that there are always two sides to an issue or it would not be an issue as those issues get pulled and tugged and massaged and people in the middle start to weigh in for and against the increments of that policy over time that policy is shaped in such a way where you finally get to the point where there is enough agreement where we can pass such a policy we are a long long ways from that in this immigration policy in the united states today i look back to the years when pat buchanan was running for president and he insisted that we have a nationwide debate on immigration i regret that we were not able to move that debate forward at that time shape this policy before we got to this critical situation that we are in today with massive numbers flowing over the border and not a policy to deal with it i understand the presidents motivation i think his head andhis heart want to go down that path to help 10 or 12 or 14 million people the other side of this equation is one the gentleman from colorado and i agree on and many many members of this congress and even a greater percentage of people across the country that intuitively understand that an immigration policy which by constitution is vested within the responsibility of the united states congress an immigration policy must be designed to enhance the economic the social and the cultural wellbeing of the united states of america what other purpose would we have i look at some things that happened in my state we have an affirmative action program within our universities that has been approved by the board of regents it is an 8 5 percent we cannot call it a quota it is an 8 5 percent minority goal well this minority goal almost moved some state legislation that would have imposed the equivalent of a high burden on the taxpayers of the state to try to reach this 8 5 percent in iowa we have about a 3 percent minority but we would do an 8 5 percent minority goal well in an effort to reach that goal within one of our regents institutions that institution set up a recruitment center down in san antonio texas i would like to be recruiting those folks of the same ethnicity if we need to do that from iowa we have sufficient numbers that are not accessing education but yet the recruitment office in san antonio was recruiting hispanics to meet part of this 8 5 percent goal for minorities and then they got overzealous and they went across the border and they brought in mexican nationals from mexico city to meet a goal for a minority setaside in iowa what is going on america i cannot connect my logic with this i wfll go back to affirmative action if we take it back to its inception it was designed to correct the institutionalization of segregation of american blacks in the south that was the specific narrow goal of affirmative action and it is preferential treatment in jobs and educational opportunities i do not know how we would have fixed that that is a sin against this nation and maybe there was a better way but i am not wise enough to tell what we should have done so i am going to let that one pass for a moment and just say we needed to fix that and we have to a large degree repaired the institutionalization of segregation of american blacks in the south now they are coming up in job opportunities but that affirmative action program that was instituted then for what ar guably was a good cause now has grown into this monstrosity of a policy that decides that every family reunion has to take place in the united states it cannot take place in any other country so we

unitedstates lao relationship as well as the internal changes that are not only noteworthy but address some of the issues raised in this resolution we are involved in major efforts and we are getting major cooperation in antidrug efforts in laos through the cooperation of the lao government aimed at reducing opium and amphetamine trade that reaches from southeast asia to the streets of the

sending forensic teams to laos several times a year to locate and repatriate the remains of those service people again according to our government we are receiving strong cooperation from the lao government but this resolution has been silent on that important effort certainly the issue of human rights and the hmong population as well as other minorities is a particularly sensitive subject in the laoamerican community in the united states and i imagine that is the issue pushing this resolution to the forefront at this time this resolution fails however to note that for a variety of reasons some having to do with international pressure and some having to do with internal economics and politics the lao government has been urging hmong and other dissidents to come out of the mountains where they have been hidden for many decades the government has pledged to assist in the relocation and settlement of these groups and i would note that secretary of state powell has told the lao government the united states would like to offer assistance in these efforts while there is reason aplenty for hesitation given the fate of others throughout the world who have acquiesced in resettlement campaigns the reports i received while in laos across the board testified to the positive response of the refugees moreover there were few if any reports of abusive or unhelpful treatment by the governrment there is no mention of that in this resolution the concerns that this resolution raise about conditions in laos are justified and we should be clear that virtually identical situations exist in far too many countries i would also like to make it very clear that the lao government fully cooperate with the opinion of the international community that has long been concerned with the treatment of minority groups within their country and make sure they in fact are open to allowing our ambassador to travel to the areas in question where people are engaged in coming out the hmongs and others to make sure that the resettlement issues are occurring that these people are being treated properly and that there is no action taken against them so i would hope that the lao government would be more open to the request of secretary powell of our ambassador of the international community but again i would state for those who have been there for the international community the international press the suggestion is that this resettlement is going very fairly well given the tensions that have existed for over so many years so i appreciate this resolution coming forward i would hope that it would have given a little bit more recognition to those areas that we are getting cooperation and that we will continue to work on opening this relationship with the lao people and clearly the support of the normal trade relations that we may have an opportunity to vote on later would go a long way in terms of improving the economy and some of the human rights issues within the

this is a delicate state in unitedstates lao relations we are deeply involved with that government in a range of initiatives that are critical to our own national security i met with several unitedstates personnel for example involved in major antidrug efforts in cooperation with the lao government aimed at reducing the opium and amphetamine trade that reaches from southeast asia to the streets of american cities our people reported strong cooperation from the lao authorities and progress in turning lao citizens against the drug trade but this resolution ignores this cooperation we are also deeply involved in powmia efforts in laos as was documented last week in the new york times hundreds of americans from the vietnam war era are still missing in laos and we are sending forensic recovery teams to laos several times a year to locate and repatriate the remains of servicemen again according to our government we are receiving strong cooperation of the lao government but

community in recent weeks including assaults on those peacefully demonstrating in support of expanded trade with laos arson and threats of assassination on certain radio stations members of the house should be helping to defuse this situation not adding to the illfeelings so it is very important that what we say and do regarding laos and the lao community not be misunderstood or misstated the concerns that this resolution raises about conditions in laos are justified but we should be clear that virtually identical statements could be made about many other countries in the region or elsewhere in the world including those with which we have very extensive economic and political relations we want improvements and we should continue our efforts both bilaterally and through the u n and n g o s to build a free and open society in laos one important step would be for more members of congress to visit the country and deliver the same message i did yet only one other member of the house has been to laos in the last 5 years i am told one important way for us to improve our relationship and encourage the kinds of reforms we would like to see in laos is to grant normal trade relations to that country laos is one of only three countries in the world with which we do not have ntr and the only country with which we have full diplomatic relations lacking that status laos is far too small and poor to have an impact on the unitedstates economy or jobs but granting ntr will have a significant impact on the economy in that impoverished nation allowing it to participate in the kind of positive economic improvements that have begun to transform vietnam and cambodia now that this resolution has been brought to the floor i would hope that ntr for laos would similarly be scheduled for house consideration i have many laoamericans in my own disotrict and i have had a close working relationship with them for a number of years most are refugees themselves from the repression of the postwar lao government they have built families businesses social and political organizations and productive and cooperative lives in the united states and together with many other laoamericans they have begun to reengage in a relationship with the country of their birth members of the usalao ntr coalition including the laoamerican exchange institute the laotianamerican national coalition and the laotianamerican chamber of commerce visited laos last year and produced the important citizen initiative report i would like to recognize in particular mr sary tatpaporn the coalitions coordinator and vice president of the laotianamerican chamber of commerce along with dr richard chansombat of the laoamerican exchange who authored the report on the trip detailing their meetings with government and private leaders many of these laoamerican leaders have reversed past opposition and now are urging the passage of ntr so that the economy of their former country can grow and more of their former countrymen can share in the prosperity that investment trade and modernization can bring our relationship with laos is long and complex and it is changing for the better we should be encouraging the positive steps laos is taking on a wide range of issues and we should be expanding our cooperation with that country as we have with other nations whose domestic policies we continue to question we also need to recognize that some of the suspicion and distrust within the lao leadership is due to continuing threats against that government from opposition elements within the united states as was acknowledged during the recently held conference of laoamerican leaders at the state department at the same time the lao government must fully cooperate with the opinion of the international community that has long been concerned with the treatment of minority groups within the country and wish to ensurethat current resettlement effort comport with internationally recognized standards as i have noted our own secretary of state has offered assistance in the resettlement efforts and our ambassador has requested permission for his staff to visit the areas where resettlement is occurring to assure that these citizens are being treated fairly international relief agencies also are interested in monitoring the efforts i would hope that the lao government would fully cooperate with these initiatives and allow for independent observation of resettlement activities that government should understand that a wellconducted independently verified resettlement effort will dramatically affect the perception of laos in the world community consideration of this resolution today should mark the beginning of a renewed interest and engagement in laos by the house not a onetime venting of opinion that ignores positive developments that are taking place and jeopardizes a longer agenda we should continue to pursue including passage of ntr later this year i look
