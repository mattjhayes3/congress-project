district showed a definitive difference in the amount of monies paid by senior citizens for prescription drugs it was higher in the 18th congressional district in houston than in canada and in mexico we find that those who are 85 years old 40 percent of them do not even have the ability to pay for any drugs they have no benefit whatsoever and we must realize that seniors are living longer we also find that seniors are paying twice as much for their prescription drugs if they are medicare beneficiaries and they do not have that provision and so they are buying onethird less drugs what does that mean it means sicker seniors that is what it means these are individuals who have worked hard in our communities then we find the cost of our prescription drugs the amount of money our seniors pay is far more than any other health need that they have and this i would say to my colleagues begs for us to have a prescription drug benefit under the medicare provisions i do not know why it is so difficult this is something we should support i cannot go home and tell my seniors in the 18th congressional district that in the united states of america they cannot have a drug benefit but yet in mexico and canada prescription drugs are cheaper i would say it is time now to support this motion to instruct today i rise in support of the spratt motion to instruct the conferees on the budget resolution the spraft motion sets the stage for enacting a medicare prescription drug benefit or other legislation to improve medicare before the reporting date for a tax cut reconciliation bill by setting september 22 as the date for reporting a tax cut bill protected by reconciliation furthermore the spratt motion recedes to the senates slightly smaller tax cut and also recede to the senate by dropping the reserve fund language in the housepassed resolution that provides for an additional 50 billion in tax cuts while the republicans propose large tax cuts over the next 5 years and reconcile the finance and ways and means committees to report legislation republicans do not show the 10year cost of this tax cut which could be as large as the 792 billion that the republicans proposed and the american people rejected in 1999 moreover the republicans do not intend to strengthen or support medicare due to the fact that there are no reconciliation instructions to require legislation that would actually use the 40 billion reserve earmarked in the budget resolution in addition the republicans have cut nondefense appropriations while defense significantly increased for the third consecutive year republicans have chosen to provide large tax breaks for the wealthy this budget resolution provides at least 200 billion in tax breaks over the next 5 years for the financial elite of america furthermore this resolution is a major down payment for george w bushs proposed trilliondollar tax scheme i will not stand by while our childrens future is bankrupted to fund this irresponsible budget resolution this budget contains deep cuts in domestic spending by 114 billion over the next 5 years fails to provide anything to strengthen social security or medicare cuts nondefense discretionary spending by 19 7 billion in 2001 and 138 billion over the next 5 years below the level needed to maintain purchasing power after adjusting for inflation and pretends to reserve 40 billion for a medicare prescription drug benefit contingent upon essentially turning medicare into a voucher program republicans have used slight of hand to hide the facts of their irresponsible budget by showing the effects of proposed tax cuts for only the first 5 years and not the full 10year projections commonly used during the last 4 years i am disappointed in the budget resolution because i do not believe that it provides adequate investment in our nations future americas future depends on that of her young people in providing them adequate resources and opportunities to become our future leaders including providing them education and ac cess to adequate health care the budget resolution provides inadequate resources for the education of our young

kindergarten to graduate school recent studies emphasize the importance of quality education early in a childs future development and yet despite these studies the budget resolution still inadequately funds programs that would provide for programs targeting children in their younger years in addition we need to open the door of educational opportunity to all american children it is well known that increases in income are related to educational attainment the democratic budget alternative rejects the republican freeze on education funding and allocates 4 8 billion more for education for fiscal year 2001 than the republican budget over 5 years the democratic party demonstrates its commitment to education by proposing 21 billion more than the republican budget resolution the congressional black caucus offered an amendnient in the nature of a substitute that promised to invest for the future of our nation the cbc substitute is a budget that maximizes investment and opportunity for the

diabetes the epidemic of our time the impact diabetes has on the health of our population on the national budget is staggering every year diabetes causes about 24 000 more people to lose their sight 28 000 more people to undergo dialysis or transplantation for kidney failure and 77 000 more people to lose their lives from heart disease these diabetesrelated side effects in combination shorten life expectancy by an estimated 15 years in the year 1999 approximately 800 000 people will be diagnosed with diabetes and the disease will contribute to almost 200 000 deaths in the united states the number of americans with diabetes has increased nearly 700 percent in the last 40 years again a primary reason that the cdc has called it the epidemic of our time the public and private costs of diabetes are enormous an estimated 105 billion annually including over 40 billion a year in federal dollars more then 1 out of every 10 health care dollars in the unitedstates and about 1 out of 4 medicare dollars is spent on diabetes care in new york state almost 600 000 people and 10 of our seniors have been diagnosed with diabetes at an annual public and private cost of about 8 billion diabetes kills one american every 3 minutes and a new case of diabetes is diagnosed in the united states every 40 seconds and unfortunately an estimated 52 million americans have diabetes right now and do not even know it but new research is filled with promise the diabetes research working group created by congress in 1997 has developed a comprehensive plan for future research that would cost 827 million next year congress mandated this study congress has received its mandated report and yet last year we gave 448 million about half of what is called for only 3 percent of the total nih budget for diabetes that is simply 28 per patient that is not enough yet every day research and new technologies are improving diabetes diagnosis and treatment for example current diagnostic methods cannot always detect adult onset diabetes at the earliest stage of the disease but a new technology has been developed that will diagnose adult onset diabetes as much as 5 years earlier than any current method by scanning the eye retina with low intensity florescent light an early diagnosis can significantly reduce the risk of serious complications we need to increase research for diagnosis blood testing is also becoming less obtrusive a continuous glucose monitoring system recently approved by the fda continuously and automatically monitors glucose levels underneath the skin future generations of this device may permit the patient to monitor blood levels and connect to an insulin pump for seamless care a glucowatch a device worn like a wristwatch will test blood levels easily and painlessly this device which is pending fda approval is as successful at blood testing as conventional methods that require pricking the finger multiple times every day and causes only a slight tingling sensation we need to increase research for blood monitoring we also must increase research for treatment for example we are at the brink of developing an ability to inhale insulin rather than inject it into the body multiple times per day another burden for people with diabetes is the need to inject themselves with insulin several new drugs taken orally may reduce the need to take insulin injections one class of drugs called insulin sensitizers helps to lower blood glucose primarily by reducing insulin resistance in muscles other groups of drugs work by suppressing glucose production from the liver increasing insulin production by the pancreas or decreasing sugar absorption from the intestine for those who will still need insulin a power is being developed that can be inhaled so that injections might not be necessary we need to increase research for treatment in juvenile diabetes type 1 insulinroducing cells called islets are destroyed making daily insulin injections necessary the juvenile diabetes foundation jdf has established three centers for islet transportation which will attempt to transplant healthy islets to cure juvenile diabetes and find new ways to prevent transplant rejection and other dangerous sideeffects the nih and the jdf are also developing new ways to manipulate the immune system by inhibiting harmful immune responses while keeping protective ones intact we need to increase research for cures ultimately genetics may hold the key to a cure the american diabetes association has initiated the genetics of noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus gennid study in order to maximize the rapid identification of the gene or genes involved in adultonset diabetes this study has established a national database and cellbank to store information and specimens from families with long histories of the disease the human genome project which is currently mapping the entire human genetic structure may also provide significant clues to the nature of diabetes again we need to increase research for treatment but the fight goes on we must increase support and research for diabetes for diagnosis for monitoring for treatment and

legislation will improve the prospects of passenger safety for every american who flies our nations skies air 21 significantly improves our nations airport infrastructure the aviation investment and reform act for the 21 st century is a comprehensive reauthorization of the federal aviation administration and the airport improvement program as a frequent traveler i am continually reminded how far our aviation infrastructure has declined i continually run into flight delays and hear more consumer complaints i understand that much of this is due to the increasing pop ulanty of air travel in 1998 there were more than 643 mitlion airline passengers in the united states at the current rate of increased travel in 10 years more than one billion people will use air travel annually for that reason we must act now we must pass this legislation to ensure that every passenger has the peace of mind that they are safe in the air this bill will do that by heavily improving our air traffic control system the air traffic control system in the united states is the most complex system in the world the united states has more than 32 500 facilities andsystems many of these facilities and the equipment that are used are 20 to 30years old the gao estimated that the faa would need 17 billion from 1999 through 2004 to modernize the air traffic control system air 21 will help address these problems by insuring stable funding to complete system upgrades throughout the country the most important aspect of this legislation is moving the aviation trust fund off budget air 21 will be largely funded through the collection of the aviation ticket tax deposited in the aviation trust fund it is important that when taxpayers pay a tax intended for a specific purpose that we in congress have the discipline to spend the revenue for that purpose and not use it to mask the size of the federal deficit these funds are paid by the people who use air travel and should be spent to improve air travel if we are not going to use the funds for that purpose we should not be collecting them air 21 ensures that all passenger facility charges and other ticket taxes will go for their intended purposeaviation infrastructure i urge my colleagues to join me in voting for this important legislation our nations aviation infrastructure is the envy of the rest of the world in order for it to remain as such we must plan now for the future for the safety of every citizen in your district who uses air travel for work or pleasure we must pass this important legislation"],

greatly diversified financial services industry oftentimes however these financial institutions their regulators and members of congress find themselves at odds on important policy business and competitive issues while some banks are a part of a very large diversified holding company and can take advantage of sophisticated delivery systems others are independent and must fend for themselves regulations are written chiefly to keep the large complex organizations operating within the law but then they are similarly applied to the same small independent bank this situation is made worse for the small community bank when we consider that their primary competitors escape the consequences of heavy regulatory and tax burden this is wrong federal policies should not be implemented to create an unfair competitive advantage that benefits one industry over another where they compete for the same customer base we often overlook the fact that small banks are small businesses themselves they serve as economic engines that drive the local rural economies benefiting millions of consumers small businesses family farms and local merchants having said that however and as a free market proponent i must also add that i am sensitive to the community banks concerns although i am sensitive to those concerns i cannot agree with their position that we should act to isolate them from competition no i say to my colleagues that is not a satisfactory answer to their concerns instead let us work together in passing this rule and h r 10 today and then work to pursue regulatory and tax relief for small community banks it is crucial that we act to preserve the open market competition rather than attempting to burden their potential competitors and rather than attempting to turn back the clock congress should work to help unburden the community banks in this coun try my second point concerns the unitary thrift issue h r 10 is designed to help increase competition and to benefit consumers communities and businesses with those goals in mind how can we justify reining in the unitary thrift holding companies for the record i would like to clarify that the unitary thrift holding company is not a loophole more than 30 years of experience and volumes of legislative history underlay the foundation of its structure congress acted specifically to bring both capital and management expertise into the thrift industry and to promote housing simply put restricting firms from transfering ownership in an attempt to thwart competition disadvantages investors in fact some thrifts were created at the urging of the federal government i am strongly opposed to a legislative taking that might lead to significant costs to the unitedstates treasury i feel strongly that investors should not have value taken from them through some arbitrary action of congress no evidence based on safety and soundness has been presented that would justify prohibiting unitary thrifts from being sold to other companies likewise no evidence suggests that financial companies that buy unitary thrifts should not continue operating their commercial activities today we are focused on promoting economic efficiency and growth congress should do something positive for our independent community banks rather than trying to do something negative to a group of potential competitors i urge my colleagues to pass this rule and adopt h r 10 and let us send it to conference"], [0.0004267692565917969, 0.5004267692565918, 1, "i disagree with virtually every word uttered by the previous speaker the previous
