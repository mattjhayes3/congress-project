and that will be dealt with in the upcoming session next year i thought we ought to kind of summarize a little bit about them before we close out the year a lot of us here are hoping next week is the last week we are out here there have been a lot of accomplishments i am going to spend some time talking about those accomplishments and how far we have come and i am going to conclude with a little discussion about where we might go to and what our hopes and dreams are as we move there are a couple of issues pending i am going to start with one that is current and that we may also have some discussions on in the next week that is national tests we are hearing a lot about this idea that washington somehow is prepared to develop this national test to test our students to see whether or not they get the education that washington thinks they should get i want to bring this up to discuss a little bit because as a former teacher i was actively involved in developing tests but it was not a national test it was a local test when i was teaching math i used to go to some of the folks in town they would say some of my kids did not know and i call them my kids because we really got pretty close in our classroom some of my kids did not know what they expected them to know on math how to balance a checkbook count change some of the elementary things i said yes they do they graduated from my math class so therefore my kids know this stuff people uptown said no they dont we took a survey of the people uptown and we found out what it was that our people in milton wi thought our milton high school graduates should know and then we developed a test to see whether or not our milton high school students knew what the people uptown expected them to know when they graduated from high school is this not how it should be done the local community the parents teachers school board working together to decide what it is that the students in milton wi should know or in the local communities should know that is how the test should be developed the concept of washington dc deciding what the students in milton wi should know instead of the parents and the teachers in the community is just the wrong concept that is one of the issues we still have pending before us out here during this session and it may be dealt with before we adjourn for the year but possibly will be put off until next year there is another one that we have had a vote on and it is actually one of the most difficult discussions that we have to have and i cannot believe that we have discussions on this topic in america and that is on partialbirth abortion one of the things that happened in 1997 is that the house of representatives passed a bill that said there will be no more partialbirth abortions in america except when the life of the mother is at stake the senate passed the same bill it was sent to the president and it was vetoed i think it is very important that we understand what a partialbirth abortion is and i think this practice hopefully can be eliminated in the next session in 1998 but if not the people that are preventing it from being eliminated should simply be replaced in the upcoming election cycle in a partialbirth abortion a doctor literally reaches into the womb of a pregnant woman grabs the ankle of the baby and literally pulls the arms and legs of that baby out of the womb at the last second just before the babys head is delivered the doctor sticks a scissors in the back of the head and kills the baby it is interesting when i talk about this people have a tendency to tune out it is like they do not want to talk about that we cannot even discuss that in america and they are right we should not be discussing this in america how can any citizen of our great nation possibly justify a nearly born baby having a scissors stuck in the back of its head and being killed this is something that is so outrageous what amazes me most about this discussion is not that it is very difficult to discuss because it is very difficult for me to discuss but what is amazing is that when i do discuss it people call me radical they call me radical because i do not think that when a babys arms and legs are literally delivered and moving that it makes sense in our great nation to stick a scissors in the back of that babys head and kill the baby it is outrageous the status of this bill it was sent to the president after passing both the house and the senate i am happy to say that the wisconsin delegation from the house of representatives that all of our delegates republican and democrats prochoice and prolife all of the people from the great state of wisconsin voted to end this practice in the house of representatives the bill was sent to the president the bill was vetoed and we would expect in 1998 that bill will be brought back to the house of representatives and in the house of representatives we will override the presidents veto because this practice is so outrageous and so wrong in this great nation i hear when i talk about this to our constituents mark you have no business talking about it that is not governments role to talk about this sort of thing it should be up to the doctor and it should be up to the mother i will tell my colleagues that when i took my oath of office i swore to uphold the constitution of the united states of america the constitution of our great land guarantees life liberty and the pursuit of happiness it does not guarantee life liberty and the pursuit of happiness to all those who vote but it guarantees life liberty and the pursuit of happiness to all american citizens it seems to me that when a child reaches the point when its arms and legs are literally moving around that that child is guaranteed protection under our constitution just like any other american citizen and doggone it it is time we talk about this and keep talking about it until the problem itself disappears because we have outlawed the practice of partialbirth or livebirth abortion in america i am optimistic that in 1998 we will see at least the house of representatives overturn the presidents veto of a ban on partialbirth abortions and i would hope that the senators that have voted against it and have not provided the necessary votes will see the light and will come around to vote to override the presidents veto in 1998 and hopefully in 1998 for once and for all we can ban partialbirth abortions or livebirth abortions in the united states of america there are some other topics that have been pushed to the back burner and i wouldlike to start with one that directly affects our senior citizens it affects them dramatically and that is social security i think it is important as we begin this social security discussion to understand exactly what is happening in 1983 when the social security trust fund was near bankruptcy they quote fixed the social security system what they did is started collecting more money out of the paychecks of working families and workers all across america they collected more money than what they paid back out to the senior citizens in benefits in 1996 alone they collected 418 billion in taxes out of the paychecks of workers across america and they only spent 353 billion they only send out 353 billion to our seniors in checks to most folks this would seem like it is working pretty good they collected 418 billion and only sent out 353 billion the idea is this by collecting that extra 65 billion they would put it into a savings account and when the baby boom generation gets to retirement and there is too much money going out and not enough coming in we will go to the savings account and get the money and make good on the checks the idea is if we collect 418 billion in 1996 and we only spend 353 billion that will leave 65 billion to put into the savings account to make sure that social security is safe for our senior citizens well unfortunately that is not what is going on in washington this comes as no big surprise to anybody who follows washington closely here is what washington does with the social security money they collect all 418 billion and then they put it in the big government checkbook the general fund they then spend all the money out of the general fund as a matter of fact they overdraw the general fund that is called the deficit they take the 65 billion extra they collected put it in the general fund spend all the money out of the general fund as a matter of fact they overdraw that checkbook so there is no money left and at the end of the year they simply put an iou an accounting entry down here in the social security trust fund so the fact of the matter is that this extra money that is being collected that is supposed to preserve and protect social security is not being putaway the way it is supposed to be in fact all that is in there is in nonnegotiable treasury bonds generally referred to as ious this practice is wrong we in our office introduced legislation and forgive me if this does not seem like einstein legislation it is not it simply says that the money that comes in for social security goes directly into the social security trust fund it does not go into the general fund it goes directly into the social security fund what does that mean it means that 65 billion that they collected more than what they paid back out to our senior citizens in benefits would actually go into that savings account the way it is supposed to be let me suggest the way it happens if this bill is passed it is a pending bill we have 100 cosponsors democrats and republicans have cosponsored this bill if this bill is passed social security is solvent all the way to at least the year 2029 and maybe significantly beyond that if this bill is not passed and we continue to spend the social security money that is coming in rather than put it aside the way it is supposed to be set aside then social security is in trouble not later than the year 2012 so let me say that once more if the social security preservation act is passed social security is solvent for our senior citizens for the foreseeable future if it is not passed and we continue the practice of taking the 65 billion putting it in the general fund and spending it if that practice continues social security is in serious trouble not later than the year 2012 so when we look at issues that need to be addressed in 1998 and 1999 this is certainly one of the key issues it is important that folks understand washingtons definition of a balanced budget and what a balanced budget means as it relates to social security remember the social security trust fund collected 65 billion and put it in their checkbook so when washington says their checkbook is balanced what they actually mean is they took this 65 billion put it in the checkbook spent all the money out of the checkbook but the checkbook was not overdrawn and that is a balanced checkbook so my colleagues can see even after we reach a balanced budget and we should not downplay that the budget has not been balanced even by washington definition since 1969 that is a monumental accomplishment and it appears that we are going to get that done in 1998 4 years ahead of schedule but even when we get that done they are still using the social security trust fund money to make it look balanced here is another way of looking at that same picture when washington reports the deficit to the american people they actually report this blue area so in 1996 when they reported a deficit of 107 billion what washington actually meant is the checkbook was overdrawn by 107 billion but in addition to that they spent the 65 billion that came in extra for social security so when washington says it is going to balance the budget it is very important people understand what they really mean is this blue area is going to go away but they are still going to be spending the social security trust fund money it is very very important that we do not downplay the accomplishments because getting to a balanced budget is important and it is obvious that we have to get to a balanced budget before we car stop spending social security money but it is also important that we understand that once we reach a balanced budget our job is not done we have no business spending the social security trust fund money and anybody who supports spending that money on other washington programs instead of setting it aside ought to be uneledted in the next election it is that simple and straightforward having said that i think it is important that we look at some other solutions to these problems look at how far we have come it is clear we still have a long way to go but we have made significant accomplishments during this year in order to understand how far we have come i think it is important to note where we started back in 1995 when i left the private sector to run for office it was because i had looked at this chart and i had watched this debt that faces the united states of america and i had just watched it grow that social security money those ious they are part of that growing debt facing this nation as a matter of fact as we look at this chart we can see from 1960 to 1980 the debt grew a very small amount but from 1984 it grew off the map by the way i know all the democrats say yeah thats the year that ronald reagan got elected and the republicans are going to say yeah the democrats spent out of control the fact of the matter is it does not matter if we are a democrat or a republican the bottom line is that our nation is this far in debt and we better do something about it this is what we came into office facing in 1995 this is the problem that brought many of us out october31 1997 of the private sector myself included having never held a public office before it is this picture that brought us out of the private sector and it is an understanding that this problem needed to be solved if we have hope that we are going to have a future for our children in this great nation that we live in how far in debt are we well it is 5 3 trillion as of today 5 3 trillion translates into 20 000 for every man woman and child in the united states of america if we take that 5 3 trillion and divide by the number of people in the country it is 20 000 bucks for every man woman and child in america today that is how much money our government has borrowed for a family of five like mine which is where the problem comes in for a family of five the unitedstates government has literally borrowed 100 000 most of it over the last 20 years the kicker to this whole thing is down here a lot of my constituents go so what does it really matter or doesnt it well yes it matters it matters because every month a family of five like mine needs to send 580 a month every month to washington to do nothing but pay the interest on the federal debt 580 a month for an average family of five to do nothing but pay the interest on the federal debt then my constituents go well that is not me i dont make that much money so im not sending 580 a month to washington but they forget to take into account that if we do something as simple as walk in a store and buy a loaf of bread the store owner makes a small profit on that loaf of bread and when the store owner makes a profit on that bread part of that profit gets sent to washington when we add up all the taxes on groceries or gasoline or whatever an average family of five is in fact spending 580 a month to do nothing but pay interest on that federal debt i think it is important we talk about how we got to that number what in the world went on in this country that we ran up a debt that the people here in washington decided it was appropriate to spend 100 000 on behalf of my family of five and every other group of five like it across america what is going on out there did they try to solve it what led us to this point i think this chart says a lot about it and i could show any one of a number i have got the grammrudmanhollings bill of 1987 but there was a grammrudmanhollings bill of 1995 and another one in 1987 there was a 1990 deal a 1993 deal but they all had the same basic elements to them they all said yes we had not ought to be spending our childrens money we are going to balance the budget in five years out or whatever but they all said we are going to balance the budget as a matter of fact this blue line shows how they were going do balance the budget by 1993 the red line shows what actually happened because every time washington set about controlling washington spending to balance the budget they broke their promises to the american people i could put any one of a number up here but they all look the same there is a blue line that shows how they were going to balance the budget and then there is a red line on top that shows how they failed to do what they said they were going to do for the american people so we got out here to 1993 after failing in 1985 and 1987 and 1990 and again in 1993 we get out here to 1993 and we are looking at this problem and washington decided that there was only one thing left to do we cannot control washington spending there are too many important things that washington wants to spend money on so what we are going to do is take more money away from the working people get it out here to washington so washington can decide how to spend that money because after all washington knows best how to spend the peoples money so in 1993 they passed the biggest tax increase in history the idea was if we got more money out of the pockets of the people that somehow that would lead us to a balanced budget that is what led to the revolt in this great nation that is what led to the turnover of congress in 1994 the people said enough of this stuff we have had it with the broken promises we have had it with raising our taxes that is not what we want we do not want washington deciding how to spend our money we want washington to let us keep our own money so that we can make decisions on how to spend it because we know best how to spend our own money this picture is what led to the turnover in 1994 it was the fact that they could not get to a balanced budget coupled with the tax increase that led tothe 1994 revolt if you like amongst the american people that sent a change in control of congress we are now 3 years into this thing this is kind of the background we laid out a plan to balance the budget we said we wanted to reduce taxes we made a bunch of promises when we got here in 1995 too i think the american people ought to be asking what has happened in the last 3 years how are you doing are you any different than the group that was there before you i brought a chart to show our promises in 1995 when we got here we laid out a plan to balance the budget too we were realistic and we said we will get there by the year 2002 we are now 3 years into that plan to balance the federal budget but notice where the red line is for the first time the red line is not out of whack we have not only hit our targets but we are significantly ahead of schedule we will have the first balanced budget in fiscal year 1998 the first time since 1969 we are going to see a balanced federal budget 4 years ahead of promise this is significant at the same time we balanced the budget we lowered taxes for the first time in 16 years and if time permits later on i would like to go through some of those they are heavily oriented toward education and toward families 400 per child grandparents can start putting 500 per child away in an education savings account college students 1 500 freshman and sophomore year tax credit that is you figure out your taxes and subtract 1 500 off the bottom line juniors and seniors in college continuing education young couples where one has gone back to school it is 20 percent of the college tuition credit capital gains lowered from 28 percent to 20 for those that were in the 15percent bracket earning less than 40 000 a year lowered from 15 down to 10 no more tax when you sell your personal residence if you have lived there for 2 years the list goes on and on encouragement for savings for retirement even if you are in a 401 k you can now join a roth ira and put 2 000 a year away when you take the money out at retirement you pay no taxes on the accumulated money the bottom line is this picture is very important it is very very different than this picture where the promises were made but they were not kept promises were made and they are being kept we are not only on track to getting to a balanced budget but we are significantly ahead of schedule i show charts like these out at town hall meetings the people say mark the economy is so good you guys are taking credit for that good economy if the economy were not that good of course you would not be doing these things partly that is true the economy is doing very well that is part of why this picture is true but the reality is we have had good economies between 1969 and today many times every time the economy has been good in the past washington saw that extra revenue coming in and they spent it this congress is different the economy is good but instead of spending the extra revenue we are getting to a balanced budget ahead of schedule i think this perhaps is the most significant picture that i can possibly show in terms of describing how different washington is the economy has been strong there has been over 100 billion a year in revenue coming in above expectations in the face of that this congress looked at spending it was growing at 5 2 percent before we got here this column shows how fast washington spending was increasing before we got here in 1995 we in the face of that strong economy and extra revenue coming in we slowed the growth rate of washington spending by 40 percent h9m5 october 31 1997 in 2 years the growth rate of washington spending now is down to 3 2 percent would i like it to be lower yes but the reality is we have slowed the growth of washington spending by 40 percent in 2 years in the face of a very strong economy i challenge anyone any of my colleagues anywhere in america to find a congress before us that had an extra 100 billion above expected revenue coming in and have that find a congress that spent less money than they said they were going to spend and slowed the growth rate of washington spending in the face of that strong economy it has not happened in our history this is new it is different it is the reason that we are able to both balance the budget and lower taxes at the same time in fact in real dollars washington was growing at 1 8 percent annually before we got here it is now growing at 6 percent the real growth has been slowed by twothirds do we still have a ways to go should we slow that to zero we do not need a bigger washington washington could do less sure we would like to go further but i do not think we should look past the fact that in 2 short years we have slowed the real growth of washington spending by twothirds in 2 short years this is what has led to this point where we have our first balanced budget since 1969 and we have a tax cut package at the same time are we finished absolutely not when we started this discussion today about social security and how when we talk about a balanced budget that social security money is still being spent we have a long ways to go we need to pass the social security preservation act which is the act that stops washington from spending that money we are not going to quit here we are not going to quit with this the other thing that we hear out at our town hall meetings is this would have happened even if you guys were not there no matter what you did this would have happened i brought a chart with me to show exactly what would have happened if we had played golf and basketball and tennis instead of doing our job almost no one in america can forget the first year that we were in office 1995 there were all sorts of things going on it was just short of bullets out here there was misinformation on medicare attacks there were school lunch attacks that were full of misinformation there was just short of a war in this country government shutdowns you name it the reason those things were going on is because if we had done nothing this red line shows where the deficit was going it was headed to 350 billion if nothing was done remember that is instead of balancing the budget even with the social security money on top of this it was going to be a 350 billion deficit the yellow line shows how far we got in our first year the green line shows our hopes and dreams that we were actually going to be able to balance the budget by 2002 and the blue line shows what is actually happening how far ahead of schedule we are we are winning a monumental battle for the future of this great nation we are winning a battle that is going to allow our children to have hope in this great nation that we live in this is not the end again i think it is very important that we understand that when we reach a balanced budget we still have problems in this great nation we still have a 5 3 trillion debt staring us in the face we still have the social security trust fund money being spent on other washington programs the battle is not over when we reach a balanced budget i have with me a chart showing what we suggest that we do next this is really the future we bring us to a balanced budget we start the process of lowering taxes we restore medicare for our senior citizens this ft next it is called the national debt repayment act what it says is this once we reach a balanced budget we slow the growth rate of washington spending we cap it at a rate at least 1 percent slower than the rate of revenue growth this picture shows what will happen if we do that this is the point we reach balance the red line shows spending growth in washington and i would like to see it slower that is just for the record but it shows that if spending is going up at a rate 1 percent slower than the blue line the rate of revenue growth if spending is just controlled that it goes up 1 little percent slower than the rate of revenue growth it creates this area in between here called the surplus with the surplus under this bill we do two things we take onethird of that surplus and dedicate it to additional tax cuts and we take twothirds and put our great nation on a home mortgage type repayment plan the twothirds of this surplus literally starts making payments on the federal debt much like you would make payments on a home loan as a matter of fact if this plan is followed by the year 2026 the entire federal debt would be repaid and the legacy we would leave our children would be a debtfree nation instead of a nation so overburdened with debt that they have to look forward to sending 580 a month to washington when they have their families the opportunity here to pay off the federal debt is so great and so monumental that we need to move rapidly in this direction as we reach the balanced budget this needs to be the next step that we put the nati6n on a debt repayment plan one other thing as we repay the federal debt the money that has been taken out of the social security trust fund that i spent time talking about that money that has been taken out of the social security trust fund those ious as we are paying off the federal debt that money is returned to the social security trust fund and social security once again becomes solvent for our senior citizens the tax cuts i think it is important we realize another piece of legislation that is being introduced part of my dream for the future of this country that we abolish the irs tax code as we know it today the legislation has been introduced to abolish the irs tax code as we know it today in the year 2001 so that we can replace it with a simpler fairer easiertounderstand tax code how does that relate to the national debt repayment act as we are providing tax cuts each year it gives us the opportunity to facilitate that move to a simpler fairer tax system so think about this for our dream and our vision for the future of america first we do not do what they did in the past anymore no more broken promises of a balanced budget no more tax increases we continue on the path that we are currently on we reach our balanced budget first time since 1969 we lower taxes for the first time in 16 years and we restore medicare for our senior citizens that is the present here is our dream for the future our dream for the future is that we put our nation on a debt repayment plan much like a home mortgage repayment plan as we are on that plan to pay off the federal debt as we are on that plan we put the money back into the social security trust fund that has been taken out so our seniors can rest assured that social security is safe and secure we lower taxes each and every year by utilizing onethird of that surplus for additional tax cuts we replace the irs tax code with a system that is easier simpler much fairer something the american people can understand and the most important part of this dream the most important part of this vision for the future of our country is that we in our generation can leave our children a legacy of a debtfree nation a legacy where they can once again look forward to having the opportunity to live a life that is as good or better than ours the opportunity to have a jobright here at home in america that is what this dream is about it is about balancing the budget paying off the federal debt restoring the social security trust fund for our senior citizens lowering taxes and most important of all providing the children of this nation and our grandchildren with a debtfree country so they can have once again the hope and the dream of living here in this great nation and having the opportunity of a better life much as we have had during our generation"], [0.0005241036415100098, 0.99947589635849, 1, "i want to congratulate my

thoroughly and no one questions that no one questions that in this body becauseit in fact is our responsibility as public officials let me just mention to my colleagues that there are a number of issues serious issues which the republican leadership in this house has stalled on refused to bring to this floor now as we are prepared to recess to go off for the memorial day holiday and we will leave here tomorrow afternoon i join with the american people with americans across this country in wondering and conjecturing why this house has not addressed and voted on the critical issue of campaign finance reform the chairman of the committee on rules has cited various transgressions of campaign financing if that is the case why does this body not have the time to vote to fix up a brokendown campaign finance system if we are genuine about wanting to reform that system and to prevent transgressions then we would be voting on that issue today why does the republican leadership not bring up the patient bill of rights to this floor with equal speed millions of americans are crying out for protection from unscrupulous health insurance companies and every single day patients are denied they are denied the information and the health care that they have paid their insurance companies to give out to them what the american people support is congressional action to protect the doctors ability to make medical decisions along with patients without interference from insurance companies bureaucrats and accountants why has that bill not been brought to this house when there is tremendous bipartisan support for that legislation in this body that is what we should be voting on today we have other health issues to debate my breast cancer patient protection act has 218 votes enough to pass this house this would say that women cannot be treated as outpatients for a mastectomy women today in this country are going home less than 24 hours after a mastectomy with drainage tubes groggy from anesthesia we have the votes in this house to pass that bill and they refuse to allow it to be brought to the floor that is what we should be passing today in this body why are we not doing something about child care legislation so that working families today will have the opportunity to go to work but to feel that they have affordable safe child care in which their kids can thrive and be ready for the future why have we not done anything about education and passing a modernization bill that says that what we are going to do is to make class sizes smaller have better and tougher standards why can we not have education legislation in this house that in fact says let us reduce the size of our classes let us make it a better atmosphere with tougher standards f6r more opportunity and a better environment for our kids to learn that is what we should be debating in this house today that is what we should be passing on that is what parents are concerned about and rightly so and in fact why are we not debating in this house tobacco legislation they are doing that in the other body today why do we not want to prevent underage kids from being able tosmoke and a tobacco industry that has targeted 12 years old an r j reynolds report in 1984 says that 12 years old are replacement smokers they are the new revenue stream three thousand of our kids take up smoking every single day 1 000 of them will die from a tobaccorelated illness that is what this body ought to be debating is how we prevent our children from smoking and how we prevent the tobacco industry from targeting our young people that is what our obligation is that is what our responsibility is but this house is too busy this house is too busy to consider all of this legislation let me just say that these resolutions have been brought up in an instant that is the prerogative of the majority in this body to bring up legislation to schedule it to get it passed the majority in this body has decided to bring up an investigation and we should investigate again i said at the outset no one questions our need to investigate but the american people are crying out for a congress for a house of representatives that says do something about my living standard do something about my ability to get my kids to school do something about my health insurance and my retirement security do something about preventing my kids from using tobacco and illness and potentially death that is what our obligation is here today we should take it seriously and be true public servants"],

to my constituents i think the whole matter of our legislating has at its kernel the idea of conveying confidence to the american people that they should be able to rely on the promises and the agreements that we make with respect to the programs that we enact less than 2 years ago this congress enacted the welfare reform bill and it was hard fought and one of the ingredients in that welfare reform bill was an agreement that was struck with the governors there was a commitment made to the states that there would be even funding over the length of that program 5 6 years and the governors went and made this agreement with the congress in the assumption that we would keep our word that we would not go back on this deal sometime around 9 00 last night the majority decided that they would breach that agreement that was struck with the governors today we have a letter sent to us by the national governors association signed by 10 governors expressing their dismay that the congress is being asked by the republican party to renege on their agreement what they did in the committee on rules was to take 10 billion additional from the tanf program the welfare program that we just enacted they said cut the function 600 program which is the income security item but if we look in it all that is vulnerable for a cut for a raid is the tanf program and it completely decimates the agreement that the governors are relying on so they have asked this congress to reject this resolution and so have the national conference of the state legislators i ask my colleagues here tonight is our word good or are we going to go back on it i rise today in strong opposition to the kasich budget resolution which sets this nation on a budgetary course that will end in disaster at a time when our nation is experiencing its greatest economic boom in decades we should be asking ourselves what can we do for the people of america not what can we take away from them this budget resolution proposes to take away 100 billion from programs critical to the overall health and wellbeing of this nation the american public will not stand for cuts in medicare medicaid education health care health research and social services even programs that have strong bipartisan support like head start and wic will not receive enough funds to maintain current services under this budget hasnt the majority learned by now that we can balance the budget and still address the most pressing needs of our people the budget before us today is a shift back to the draconian cuts and radical proposals that forced a budget showdown and government shut down bringing forth this proposal which even senate republicans agree is too radical only proves that the majority cant keep a promise they cant keep the promise made in last years balanced budget agreement and they cant keep the promise made in the 1996 welfare law i am outraged to find out that at the last minute in the wee hours of the night this resolution was changed to cut 10 billion of the welfare program tanf this cut is on top of cuts already in the bill which totally eliminate programs to move families from welfaretowork some may argue that the 10 billion is not specified to come from tanf but it is a cut required in the income security function which includes tanf well lets look at some of the other programs in the income security function that would have to take the cutunemployment compensation ssi child support child care the eitc and foster care i dont think anyone is willing to take a 10 billion chunk out of any of these programs certainly states cannot live up to the mandate of moving welfare recipients to work if their funds are cut by 10 billion during the debate on welfare reform in 1995 and 1996 the majority constantly preached the ethic of work and championed the idea that welfare mothers must work now they seek to eliminate the very programs that help these disadvantaged women find jobs the resolution eliminates 1 5 billion dedicated for welfaretowork programs the elimination of these funds would result in direct loss of funds to 44 states and jeopardize the job training and job placement of 300 000 welfare recipients and with an additional cut of 10 billion from the tanf program there will be virtually no federal training funds dedicated to moving families from welfare to work the 1996 welfare law becomes an unfunded mandate under this resolution the resolution compounds the problem by eliminating the employment and training money under the food stamp program the 1996 welfare reform law limits food stamp benefits to ablebodied adults with no children between the ages of 18 to 50 to 3 months unless they are working or in a training program the resolution eliminates funding states use to help train and employ these individuals so that they can achieve selfsufficiency or meet the work rule under the food stamp program this budget resolution unfairly targets the most vulnerable in our nationfamilies that are struggling to make ends meet and striving for selfsufficiency the democrats in great contrast seek to lift up those who are struggling in our society by helping to ease their every day burdens nothing signifies this more than the huge investment the clinton administration and the democrats have proposed in expanding the availability of child care in this nation currently the federal government spends about 9 4 billion fy 1998 on child care programs including afterschool and child care nutrition programs we propose the presidents child care initiative unveiled earlier this year which adds a 16 billion investment over five years in child care and early childhood education programs this includes the expansion of existing programs such as the child care development block grant and head start in 1996 we passed a welfare law which requires welfare mothers to work but it fell short 1 4 billion short of the funding necessary to provide child care for those welfare parents the presidents child care initiative would allow us to take care of the working welfare families as well as lowincome working parents who are hot receiving public assistance it also includes 3 billion over five years for a new early learning fund to improve the quality and safety of services to children ages 0 to 5 years in the past year we have all heard about the ground breaking research which revealed the significant capacity for learning in the first three years of a childs life assuring quality child care and early childhood education is critical in those early learning years and important to the future success of our nations children and indeed our entire nation 800 million over five years would go to expand afterschool programs this funding would support an estimated 4 000 programs serving half a million children afterschool activities are a way to keep children in a safe place to provide additional learning experiences and tutoring and most importantly it keep children off the streets and involved in productive activities rather than destructive or delinquent activities unfortunately the majority not only rejects these much needed child care programs but freezes the current child care programs so that they wont be able to keep up with inflation the child care development block grant will lose 107 million over five years the head start program will lose 536 million over five years and the tite x social service block grant will be cut by 3 1 billion i oppose this resolution also because it is clearly an attempt to undermine federal education programs in the budget resolution the chairmans may 12th draft clearly stated the intention to turn the title i program for disadvantaged students into a voucher program and to block grant other education programs during the committee debate the chairman was unclear about his intentions but made specific references to block granting title i and other education programs whether it is a block grant proposal or a voucher proposal it is clear that the majority is once again attacking federal education programs that send billions of dollars to our states and local school districts i am deeply concemed about any effort which would virtually eliminate the title i program and replace it with a voucher program title i was enacted in 1965 to assist low income communities in educating their most educationally disadvantaged it was an attempt to equalize educational opportunities for our most needy students based on current funding levels individual title i vouchers are likely to be about 700 dollars per student hardly enough for parents to pay for private education as intended by the proponents of this proposal title i dollars helps to raise the individual achievement of disadvantaged children but also it helps the overall educational opportuni ties within the school taking the dollars away from these most needy schools through a voucher system will do nothing but leave the school with less resources and at a greater disadvantage criticism about title i during committee debate focused on the ineffectiveness of some programs and how the federal bureaucracy was to blame this criticism is really not about the federal government but a complaint against state and local school districts which manages the title i program only 1 of the title i funds stay at the federal level for evaluation and administrative costs that means that states and locals have responsibility for 99 9 of the money so when the republicans complain about how that money is being spent they are criticizing the states and local school districts what is ironic is that majoritys criticizes the state and local management of the title i yet at the same time they propose to block grant even more federal programs with less accountability to the very same people they contend are running ineffective title i programs while there is always room for improvement the reality is that in the vast majority of school districts throughout the nation title i is making a significant difference in the lives of disadvantaged students to eliminate the title i program as we know it today is a terrible mistake that would have serious consequences in many lowincome communities throughout the country in my estimation education should be this nations highest priority and the majoritys budget block grant and voucher programs fall far short of what is necessary to improve education in this nation finally i need to mention the elimination of the native hawaiian health care program assumed under this budget it is clear that the majority lacks the understanding of special relationship between the native hawaiian people and the federal government much like the relationships forged between native american tribes and the federal government programs like the native hawaiian health care act were specifically enacted to acknowledge the federal governments responsibility and relationship with the native hawaiian people elimination of this program would mean the end of valuable services which address the significant health needs of the native hawaiian population and it abrogates the federal governments responsibility to assist in improving the overall wellbeing of the native hawaiian people this budget fails the american people it fails to set forth a vision for our nation worthy of our economic prosperity it fails to invest in our most precious resourceour human capital and it fails to address the needs of the most disadvantaged in our society i urge my colleagues to reject this radical budget which turns away from the balance budget agreement and the welfare law of 1996 we can do better we must do better"], [0.0017241003224626184, 0.0017241003224626184, 0, "today cbo or the congressional budget office the agency that is responsible for tracking revenues and expenditures of the united states government on behalf of the house of representatives and the senate released a new set of estimates and it does verify that for the first time since 1969 we are going to have a surplus in fiscal year 1998 this is great news for america the first time since 1969 i was a sophomore in high school the united states government spent less money than what they had in their checkbook to me when i came here 3 years ago this was deemed an impossible dream when we said we were going to balance the budget by the year 2002 people looked at us yawned and basically said we do not believe you because they had made so many broken promises in the past today we stand here with final documentation and verification that in fact the budget is not only balanced but we are running a surplus cbo the scoring agency or the agency responsible for making predictions here in washington is suggesting that we have about a 5 maybe a 10 billion surplus i would like to go a step further than that i believe the surplus is much more significant than that i believe that we will run a surplus in fiscal year 1998 in excess of 25 billion i think it is worth talking about where we are from a budgetary point of view where we are going to and especially how social security fits into this overall picture because i have just spent days in wisconsin where we were in about eight or nine different cities and everyplace i went the social security issue came up so i would like to begin with where we are today and how we got here then i would like to look at what we can do in the near future and then i would like to look at the bigger picture of where we are going to i would like to start today by just taking a look at how fast and how rapidly the federal debt facing our nation has grown what i have in this chart is i have a picture of the growing debt facing the united states of america it can be seen that before 1980 the growth in this debt was pretty minimal as a matter of fact it is not quite a flat line but it did not grow very much between 1960 and 1980 but from 1980 forward the growth of the federal debt is very very substantial as a matter of fact when i left the private sector i had never been in office before when i left the private sector we were about here on this chart i realized that if this growth pattern of federal debt was not stopped that our children did not have a very bright future in this great country we live in so that is really the primary reason for leaving the private sector and coming in was to change this picture here today if we had said a while ago that this was going to flatten out and it was going to steady out here and actually start coming back down because we are running a surplus people would not have believed us as recently as 3 years ago when we looked at 1980 at the point at which the debt started growing dramatically in this country all the democrats blamed ronald reagan and all the republicans blamed the democrats for not being able to control spending again i would like to point out that the fact of matter is that we are here on this chart it is not a republican problem it is not a democrat problem it is an american problem the only way we can solve this problem is if we as americans step forward and put forth solutions to the problems that is what our last 3 years here in washington have been all about for members that have not seen how large this debt is i would like to point out the number we are 5 5 trillion in debt today translation if we divide the debt by the number of people in the united states of america the united states government has literally borrowed 20 400 on behalf of every man woman and child in the united states of america or for a family of five like mine the united states government has borrowed 102 000 the real kicker in this picture is down here on the bottom line this is real debt just like any other debt in the united states of america interest is being paid on this debt in fact for a family of five like mine i have got three kids and a wife at home for a family of five like mine we are paying 580 a month every month to do absolutely nothing but pay interest on the federal debt when we think about a family earning 40 000 to 50 000 a year from wisconsin or anywhere else in the great country that we live when we think about that family being required to send in 580 bucks a month an average family of five to do absolutely nothing but pay interest on the federal debt it is a pretty staggering number the amazing thing is people do not even realize they are paying all this money in one dollar cut of every six that the united states government does absolutely nothing but pay interest on this federal debt one dollar out of every six the united states government spends does nothing but pay interest on this debt when a family does something as simple as buy a pair of shoes for the kids and the family they go into that store and they buy the pair of shoes the store owner makes a profit on the sale of that pair of shoes to the kids and when the store owner makes a profit on the sale of that pair of shoes part of that profit gets sent to washington and of course what it does is nothing but pay interest on the federal debt i emphasize that one dollar out of every six that the united states government spends today goes to pay interest on the federal debt let me put that a different way so it makes a little more sense one dollar out of every six that the united states government collects in tax revenue from our working families all across america one dollar out of every six does absolutely nothing but pay interest on that federal debt i think the question begs asking how in the world did we get to this kind of a situation where we are 5 5 trillion in debt 20 400 for every man woman and child and to a point where a family of five in america pays 580 a month to do nothing but pay interest on the federal debt when we look back at this picture how we got here i have a picture here of the grammrudmanhollings act and most folks remember either the grammrudmanhollings of 1985 or maybe the one of 1987 or maybe they remember the 1990 budget deal when we look back in the past and how we got into this mess time after time the people that were in washington promised they were going to get to a balanced budget this blue line on the chart shows the grammrudmanhollings promise of 1987 but the one for 1985 is the same thing they had a blue line that said they were going to balance the budget 1987 is the one i have shown the 1990 budget deal they are all the same this red line shows you what actually happened to the deficit the american people got very cynical looking at this picture time and time and time and time again they had been promised a balanced budget and it was not delivered by washington d c and by our government so in 1994 the people looked at this picture and they said we are really fed up with these broken promises we need a change in washington d c 1993 was the year we had the biggest tax increase in american history it was the year they looked at this picture and said the only way we can solve this big deficit that remains out there in 19931994 it was still 350 billion of deficit that is the government was spending 350 billion more than it took in they looked at this picture and said we know how to solve that let us go to the american worker let us take more money out of their pocket that way we can maintain washington spending and while we maintain washington spending of course we will just collect more tax dollars from the american people that was the 1993 solution so it was the broken promises that led to 1993 that was the 1993 solution of raising taxes to solve this problem what we found out in 1993 what i knew all along because i was in the private sector working our tail end off when we were in the private sector we did not want government to take more money from the people to balance the budget that is not what we wanted what we wanted was government to control their own appetite for spending to reduce the size of washington and lead us to a balanced budget not by higher taxes but by less washington spending so in 1993 the people saw this picture they survived the tax increase 4 3 cents a gallon for gasoline it was not even spent to build roads it was put into social welfare programs social security tax increase marginal tax bracket increases the taxes went up on virtually every american citizen in that 1993 tax increase so what did the american people do this is america and a great country the people in this country had the opportunity to change that and they did in the 1994 elections in the 1994 elections they saw their way clear to put republicans in charge of the house of representatives and the senate for the first time in a long long time 40 years to be exact now we are 3 years into this changed group of people in charge of washington or our government i think the american people ought to be asking the question is there really any difference or are these people the same and are they breaking their promises like before i would like to answer that question when we got here in 1995 we laid out a plan again to balance the budget we said we were going to get there by the year 2002 i have to be honest with my colleagues what the people said they yawned and they said yes sure we will believe it when we see it the time has come to believe it we not only got the job done by 2002 as promised we have actually hit our first balanced budget since 1969 4 years ahead of schedule we not only got the job done i think it is very important in the picture form to see that the red line is now below the blue line that is we are outperforming what we said we would do as opposed to what happened before we got here it is a very very different picture in washington d c let me emphasize this once more for the first time since 1969 for the last 12 months running the united states government spent less money than they had in their checkbook this is a monumental accomplishment and it has been done in 3 short years well ahead of schedule of what was initially promised in 1995 when we got here an interesting thing happens when i am out in wisconsin at a town hall meeting talking to our constituents about this what happens is they go hey marx the economy is so strong you politicians are taking credit and you couldnt have messed it up if you tried the facts are the economy is very strong lots of extra revenue is coming into the united states government because hardworking american families are busting their tail ends and being successful out there in the private sector and of course the more income that they earn for their family they send extra tax revenue to washington that is true there is no question about it but that is not the end of the story because between 1969 and today there have been other time periods in this government where the economy was strong and extra revenue came in and every time in the past when washington got their hands on more revenue they figured out exactly what to do they spent it and that is the difference i brought a picture here to help see that a little easier and clearer in the past every time the economy got strong and extra revenues started coming in in the past every time that happened washington just spent more money so that we still did not balance the budget that is why the budget has not been balanced since 1969 this government was different the people that came here and were put in charge in 1995 were different newt gingrich john kasich some of the others that were here deserve a lot of credit for this picture bob livingston to mention another name before we got here growth in spending and this red column shows you how fast spending was going up before we got here in 1995 in the face of this very strong economy with extra revenue coming in the spending growth rate was reduced to 3 2 percent in our first 3 years so you see in the face of this strong economy sending extra revenue to washington instead of increasing the growth rate of spending this government saw fit to decrease the growth rate of spending it is a combination of the strong economy coupled with the reduced growth rate of washington spending that has put us in the position where we have actually balanced the budgetfor the first time in 30 years and we have done its 4 years ahead of schedule it is this distance from here to here that has put us in this wonderful position where the budget is in fact balanced for the first time in 30 years and a tax cut has been provided forthe first time in 16 years and i would just mention that a lot of folks say well we should not want to be cutting taxes until we get the debt paid off we should not be cutting taxes but then they put in a because i want to point out that the tax cut came about because instead of this blue column being way up here the spending growth rate being the same as it was before we got here by bringing that growth rate down to here it provided money available to reduce taxes on working families all across america and does a tax cut matter sometimes i get out there and people start complaining that the tax code is so complicated they do not even understand the tax cut let me just walk through a couple of things that are very real to the folks in my district and to the folks all across america let me start with the 400 per child and remember when we talk about this 400 per child it is less washington as seen in this picture this distance from where this red column was down to here is less washington so these families can keep more of their own money in their own home a family with three kids three kids under the age of 17 from wisconsin earning 50 000 a year in that family sounds like a lot of money well 50 000 a year and three kids is not a lot of money it goes very fast that family under the tax cut package that was passed last year will keep 1 200 more in their own home instead of sending it out to washington twelve hundred dollars is 400 per child more in the home instead of being sent to washington i always ask the question out there too and i show this kind of chart and i say look we could have done more here in washington we could have spent more money and kept this blue column up here even with the red column so the spending growing was the same as it was before we got here we could have done more in washington we chose instead to let families keep more of their own money then i ask if we had spent more in washington instead of doing the tax cut package for the families 550 000 in wisconsin alone get to keep more of their own money if we spent more in washington would we do a better job in washington of spending those families money than the families would themselves there is not a single person anywhere we have seen so far that would be willing to stand up and say the united states government in washington can do a better job spending those families money than the families can i will give another example of a family from wisconsin we had at a town hall meeting they have one in college a freshman in college and they have two kids under the age of 17 still at home for that family under the tax cut package and they are a middleincome family they did not tell me exactly but between 40 000 and 60 000 a year that family with three kids at home one in college a freshman and two kids under the age of 17 still at home when they get a 400 credit on the bottom line for each of the kids still at home that is 800 for the two kids and they get a 1 500 assist for the college tuition because in a middleincome family in america today sending a child off to college is very very expensive so the tax cut package contained a provision that if a family hasa child that is a freshman or sophomore in college they can subtract 1 500 off of what they would have sent to washington and keep it in their own home to help pay that college tuition so for this family of five that we are talking about two kids at home under the age of 17 and a freshman in college this family of five is going to keep 2 300 more in their home this year rather than send it to washington and again when we ask a family like this do they really think washington could have spent that money better than they can do they think washington could make better decisions on how to spend that money or do they think they can make those decisions themselves we have not found anybody in wisconsin that is willing to stand up and say send the money to washington we do not think we pay enough taxes and washington knows best how to spend it better than we do that just does not make sense in wisconsin and i do not believe it does anywhere in this country so i am happy to be here to talk about the things we have accomplished when we look to the past and see the broken promises of grammrudmanhollings promises repeatedly of a balanced budget that did not occur and then we look to the past where they raised taxes to try to solve this problem like in 1993 and then we compare that to the present where for the first time in 30 years we are actually spending less money than we have in our checkbook this is really great news the first time in 16 years taxes are coming down capital gains we did not mention before but for those people investing in stocks and bonds and mutual funds all over america and by the way i hope they make a profit because that is what investment is all about it is not evil and rotten to invest in a stock or a bond or a mutual fund and make a profit that is not bad that is good and when they make the profit the capital gains tax rate has been reduced from 28 down to 20 and if they are in the lower income bracket the rate has been reduced from 15 down to 10 so this idea of looking into the past and seeing the broken promises and the higher taxes and understanding something different is going on in washington today i think that is a very important idea as we look at the changes that have occurred out heresince 1995 so we have what is called a balanced budget we have taxes coming down i think we have to ask ourselves what next and i think to answer that question we need to describe and this is not going to be quite as positive from here on out i think we need to keep it in perspective this is very positive thus far and actually balancing the budget 4 years ahead of schedule by washington definition that is good and the definition they are using here in washington is the same as it was all the way back to 1969 but we still have some problems and as we look to the future we will have to address those problems to explain this i want to start by defining exactly what is meant by a balanced budget in washington d c let me preface this by saying i am a home builder and we had a home building company and we had employees working with us in that company and my definition of a balanced budget in my home building company would be very different than washingtons definition of a balanced budget but having said that let me define what washington calls a balanced budget washington says their budget is balanced when the dollars collected in taxes equal the dollars sent out in checks so if we look at all the dollars coming into washington the dollars in equals the dollars out that is washington or the governments definition of a balanced budget now on the surface that makes a pretty good amount of sense but i want to get beneath the surface and look at what isactually going on when we talk about this balanced budget and let this not take any credit away from reaching this point after 3 short years but let us recognize we still have a very serious problem facing our country the reason it is important to understand that is because social security plays into this picture dramatically in the social security system which is part of those dollars in and it is part of those dollars out what is going on in social security today is the social security system is collecting 480 billion out of the paychecks of workers all across america so when we look at our pay stubs and see there has been money taken out for social security if we add up all the money coming in for social security it is 480 billion if we look at the money being paid back outto senior citizens in benefits so we have 480 coming in the amount going back out to senior citizens in benefits is 382 billion the difference the surplus is 98 billion if we are looking at just the social security system and again this is very important it is pretty easy to understand if this was our checkbook at home and we are sitting down to do our bills and we had 480 in our checkbook and we wrote out a check for 382 we would in fact have 98 left in our checkbook that is social security today it is collecting 480 billion paying 382 out and there is 98 billion left now just as many people out there in america might be saving this 98 or 98 billion in the case of the social security trust fund for when they reach retirement so that when they do not have enough money coming in they can go to that account that they have been building and saving over a period of time and get money out in order to still pay their bills that is how american families do this all across our country social security is supposed to work the same way we know in the not too distant future that when the baby boom generation gets to retirement this number of dollars coming in as compared to the number of dollars going out is going to turn around and the dollars coming in is not going to be enough to pay the dollars going out that is when the problem hits in social security now in washington and in many government agencies they have misled our seniors into believing this does not happen until the year 2029 that is absolutely not true the amount of dollars coming in versus the number of dollars going out turns around in the year 2012 and perhaps sooner so what we are really saying here is that the shortfall occurs in social security in the year 2012 now the reason they talk about 2029 as opposed to 2012 is they assume between 2012 and 2029 that they can get their hands on this money that is supposed to be in the savings account just like in our families when we run short we go to the savings account get the money and put it into our checkbook and make good on our checks so once more through this today there is 480 coming in there is 382 going out there is 98 supposed t6 go into a savings account between now and 2012 these two numbers turn around and there is not enough money coming in too much going out and we have to be able to get our hands on that money in the savings account now i find when i am out in my district and i ask the next question with 98 billion extra coming into social security what do you suppose the united states government does with that 98 billion i find that the people in my district generally say they spend it and the people in my district are absolutely correct the 98 billion that has been taken in for social security goes into think of this as the big government checkbook or the general fund they then spend all the money out of the general fund and at the end of the year we have actually been running deficits since 1969 so after that 98 billion comes in and they write all the checks out of the general fund there is no money left to put down here in the social security trust fund so what they do is put an iou in the social security trust fund instead now it is important to understand that when washington says they are balancing the budget what they mean is that this circle right here is balanced they mean that after the 98 billion has been put into the checkbook and then all the checks have been written out that the remaining balance is zero that is a balanced budget in washington the problem with that is there is still no money being put into the social security trust fund now in my business in the home building business if this would have been the pension fund we absolutely could not have gotten away with this it would have been illegal and we would have been arrested for doing this but in washington that is the way this program is set up i want to be specific on this and please do not shoot the messenger we are trying to solve this problem in some groups i am with in wisconsin i almost feel like i am going to get shot when i tell them about what is going on it is important to understand that what is going on down here is an iou it is a nonnegotiable nonmarketable treasury bond the significance of nonnegotiablenonmarketable is that when those two numbers that we just had up here turn around and there is not enough money coming in for social security we cannot take what is in this account and sell it and get the money we need or we cannot go to our savings account and get the money out now in this town it is great people run around and they say those ious are backed by the full faith and credit of the united states government so why should i question the value of those ious in the social security trust fund i always ask the next question they are backed by the full faith and credit of the united states government so when we need the money in 2012 or sooner where is the united states government going to get that money from to make good on those ious that is when the lights begin to dawn and they see how serious the problem is because when we need that money in 2012 and perhaps sooner and the united states government has to make good on those ious there is only a very limited number of things that can happen one is they could raise taxes on our children and our grandchildren i do not find that very inviting i think the tax rate is too high as it stars the second thing they could do is put off the date when those ious come due and of course that could be done by changing benefits to our senior citizens i do not find that very desirable so if we do not raise taxes and we do not put off the date the ious come due what is the other option the other option really is to go into the private sector and start borrowing money out and when we start talking about that picture we are right back to this chart i started with i do not know of any american citizen that is going to suggest that the right solution to the social security problem is to recreate this climbing debt chart that has been given to us over the last 15 to 20 years i do not know of any american citizen that would contend that this is the right thing to do as we look to the future of this great nation so the question should be asked what are we doing about it in our office we have introduced a piece of legislation it is called the social security preservation act it is bill number h r 857 and this may seem pretty obvious to most people in america i notice when i am in wisconsin it seems to be an obvious solution we simply take that 98 billion that is coming in extra for social security and we put it immediately into the social security trust fund we do that by buying treasury bonds the same kind of thing that any senior citizen could buy at any bank in the united states of america the advantage of doing it this way number one we start reporting honestly what is going on in the budget process because the money now does not get into the big government checkbook or the general fund and number two when those numbers turn around and there is not enough money coming in and we have to make good on those ious we will now have an asset in this trust fund much like a savings account that could simply be sold to generate the money we need to make good on the social security payments to seniors so again the solution to this problem apd i am happy to say there are democrats and republicans both supporting this bill it is h r 857 it is called the social security preservation act i would encourage my colleagues that have not joined with us yet to join us on this bill as soon as possible so that we get the support necessary to bring this bill to the floor of the house if this bill is passed social security becomes solvent for our senior citizens all the way to the year 2029 now i might say after 2029 there is still a problem but at least between now and 2029 social security would once again be solvent for our senior citizens as we look at this picture then i think it is reasonable to ask we have got this balanced budget at least on balance by the definition that has been used v the government over the last 30 years where are we at and where are we going as a nation in the future i think the first thing we need to recognize and do to solve the social security problem is our bill h r 857 the social security preservation act but there are other problems still facing our country one of the problems as i see it is taxes are too high i have been having fun with this in wisconsin i ask the question repeatedly is there anyone in the room who thinks taxes are too low to their credit no one has raised their hand and said yes i think taxes are too low raise taxes please so i think when we look at the problems that are still facing us as a nation taxes are too high the social security trust fund needs to be restored and we still have that 5 5 trillion debt hanging out there over our heads to solve these problems we have introduced a second piece of legislation it is called the national debt repayment act as it relates to social security let us remember that even if we start putting away the cash from this year we still have this 700 billion that is supposed to be in this counted already that is ious so when we start talking about this 5 5 trillion debt part of it is that money that has been taken out of social security over the last 15 to 20 years in the national debt repayment act what we do is look at any surpluses coming into the united states government we allocate twothirds of those surpluses to debt repayment specifically restoring the social security trust fund so twothirds of it goes to debt repayment including social security and prioritizing social security the other onethird is dedicated to reducing taxes on working families all across america we are here in the present now we have our first balanced budget in nearly 30 years as we look down the road and think about these problems that are still staring us in the face a 5 5 trillion debt the social security trust fund taxes are too high it seems to me to make sense that what we do is dedicate twothirds of our surpluses to debt repayment prioritizing social security so we pay off the social security notes that is 700 billion that belongs there and we dedicate the other onethird to the tax rate le t me just say on the tax rate because i think this is very important today we have a 37 percent tax burden on our working families if you take all the taxes paid in in this country take the state taxes the property taxes the local taxes the sales taxes and the government taxes washington government taxes the tax burden on our families today is 37 percent back in 1955 it was about 25 percent the outcome of that is seen all through our society because the tax rates are so much higher than they used to be we find that our families that would like to make decisions to allow one parent to stay at home or one of the spouses to stay at home and raise the children are forced into the workplace because the tax rate is so high and they wind up actually working just to pay more taxes i understand that in a lot of families both spouses want to work for whatever reason they may want to work because they want a better lifestyle and that is fine but what is wrong with that picture is that when they start doing it simply so they can pay the extra tax burden so the government can get bigger and bigger and bigger that is what is wrong with the picture as we look ahead to the future the concept of reducing the tax burden as i know speaker gingrich has called for from the 37 percent back to a 25 percent i would like to again lay this out as part of our vision for the future as we look forward in this country would it not be great if we could get to a point where the tax burden on families was again reduced to 25 percent or maybe even lower would it not be great if we could have a onethird reduction in the tax burden what we are really saying here is that in the future the government might do less and we might leave more money in the pockets of people and then if the people still want some of those extra services they canmake the decision that with the extramoney in their pocket they go out and buy it but the concept is that government is less involved in the lives of the american people and the people get to keep more of the money that they have earned i might add that that is just one of the problems that we face here in washington it seems to me sometimes we forget that the money we are talking about out here it is not our money here in washington that money belongs to the hardworking americans who have earned that money and it ought to be treated in that way and with that respect i would like to just address a little bit more on the tax cut package that has already been passed i know i am kind of jumping out of this vision for the future and back into the present but i would like to do this because i find in wisconsin that when i talk with folks a lot of them do not understand that a tax bill has been passed i would just like to run through just a few of the provisions that are in this tax cut package because folks generally do not understand that this bill is already passed what happens i find when i am there is they kind of look at me almost as a politician and that scares me because i am a home builder and a math teacher and not a politician they start looking like you are making us these promises but are you really going to do any of this the fact is the tax cut package is passed into law it is done it is on the books and it should be reflected in your current taxable income let me just start with the 400 per child tax credit i described this briefly before starting this year for every child under the age of 17 with certain income limits for moderateincome americans for every child under the age of 17 when you figure out your taxes next year and you get down to the bottom line how much you would have sent to the united states government you subtract 400 off the bottom line if you have got a college student a freshman or a sophomore again you figure out how much you would have sent to washington but if that freshman or sophomore has spent more than 2 000 on room board books and tuition you subtract 1 500 off the bottom line for juniors seniors grad students et cetera you subtract 1 000 or up to 1 000 off the bottom line for homeowners in america and this is a very dramatic change in the tax code if you have lived in your house for 2 years or more and you sell it there are no federal taxes due when we think about our senior citizens and the benefit to our senior citizens of this tax code change it is very very dramatic many seniors took the old onetime 55 exclusion sold the bigger home that they raised their children in bought a smaller home and are now ready for whatever reason to go to some sort of different home either a nursing home or some sort of skilled care facility t hey are now selling this home and they took that onetime exclusion back when they were 55 and there would be a gain at least i hope there is a gain on the house they have owned in the interim period there are no longer any federal taxes due on the sale of that home medicare another dramatic change under the tax code and the revisions that were written last year for senior citizens when i took office in 1995 medicare was headed to bankruptcy the fix for medicare in the past was always to go out to the american people and raise taxes our government in their wisdom was treating senior citizens in exactly the wrong way in solving the problem of medicare by simply throwing more money at it what we needed to do is what has been done in the last 3 years sit down look at the situation and see if there was not maybe a better way to do the same thing let me give one example of how this improvement took place diabetes is a major problem for seniors what the government did in their wisdom is they wafted until some sort of a complication developed in diabetes they would not pay for screening what they did is waited until something dramatic happened to a senior whether it was a heart problem or an amputation or eye problems or any of the other negative outcomes from diabetes many of these things were treatable if they were caught earlier what the government was doing in medicare was saying we are not going to pay for screening diabetes that is destroying your life but if you get good and sick and you need a good and expensive procedure then we will help you pay for it through medicare it is not only the right thing to do for the health and the wellbeing of our senior citizens to do the advanced screening it is also much more cost effective to find the problem early and treat it early so the senior citizen can live a healthier life of course that eliminates the high cost burden on the medicare system so instead of just throwing more money at medicare and leaving the system the way it was we looked at what was going on and looked for better ways to spend the same money that was being spent in the diabetes situation alone they are saying as much as 14 billion a year will be saved and again let us not transform this into medicare cuts by providing our seniors with the opportunity to live a healthier life by this advanced screening for diabetes alone we are talking about a 14 billion a year change in the cost of medicare to the united states government that is not all though there are also things like screening for breast cancer colon cancer a wide variety of other preventive care was very similar to what i just described with diabetes that was changed in medicare rather than just looking at medicare and saying okay we are going to raise taxes on the people and throw more money at medicare we looked at how the same dollars could be spent in a better manner that is very very different than the people that were here in control in the past it is a very different model for solving solutions as we go forward the other dramatic change in medicare is in the past the united states government in their wisdom said we here in washington know what is best for all our senior citizens so we are going to develop this plan called medicare and our seniors get the plan like it or not what has happened in medicare is that now if our seniors do not like the governmentrun plan they have the opportunity to take the same money the government was spending on their behalf in the government plan and use it to purchase private insurance of their choosing we not only revise the plan to make it much more effective providing preventive care to seniors we also put what type of insurance and what type of medical coverage they would like back in their hands where it belongs i think what it says is really a statement of respect that we have for the senior citizens in the united states many of these senior citizens are the same people that fought in world war ii that preserved this country and got it to where it is today and those people deserve to be treated with that respect while i am on medicare and it does not directly relate to the changes of last year there are a lot of nasty rumors going on out there about what has happened in medicare that if a citizen for example would like a second mammogram in a year and medicare says you only can have one that is covered but a citizen would like a second one there is a lot of rumors going around out there that if a citizen wants to buy additional coverage for some procedure that is not covered under medicare that somehow if the doctor provides that coverage and charges the patient that the doctor is kicked out of the medicare program for 2 years let me just say definitively that that is absolutely not true there are a lot of different groups putting this information out it is absolutely not true let me give this in a specific example let us just say someone had a mammogram and for whatever reason 3 months later they decided they would like a second one medicare says i am not going to cover the second mammogram and the patient says well i want it done anyway and i will pay the doctor for doing it and the doctor says okay i will do it that is perfectly legal it is permitted there are no repercussions back against the doctor the doctor makes that decision to do it if the patient decides they would like to pay for it outside of medicare so specifically on things that are not covered under the medicare program if a doctor provides those services there are absolutely no ramifications back against the doctor i just mention that as it relates to medicare because we have heard so many different stories when i have been out there in public so i am going back now to the tax code change and just a few other details in it one other one that is very important to me i had mentioned capital gains before but i did not mention the adoption tax credit i think this really says something about where we are going as a nation i have got a lot of charts and graphs here and they talk about numbers and they are showing lines and different things that happened but that is not really what this government is about this government is about people it is about values it is about where we are going as a nation what kind of a country we are going to have it is about how much government is going to be involved i think when we look at that we need to understand that the government does in fact have a heart and that we understand that there are tough situations out there in a lot of places in this country we also should understand that when we changed this tax code we looked at the possibility of adoptions in this country what we found is that to have an adoption in america it costs roughly 10 000 so if we have got a middleincome family say they are earning 40 000 or 50 000 a year and for whatever reason that family finds out they cannot have their own children 10 000 might have been insurmountable in terms of adopting a child so what we did in the tax code is we changed the tax code there is now a 5 000 tax credit to assist that middleincome family with the process of adoption and paying the bills that are involved in the adoption so this tax code change it is not all about numbers and it is not all about these charts i have here there is a large degree of feeling involved in these and we recognize that things like the 400 per child leaving that money in the familys home as opposed to having it out here in washington it is not just about numbers it is about people it is about the impact that this money in the family will have on these families another example on the 400 per child i was in with a group of people who had many of their children enrolled in parochial schools i talked to them about the potential of government providing them some sort of tax assistance for parochial schools and right away they reacted no no no no we do not want any government support for our school because they are afraid with government support come government rules and regulations that may not match up with what our parochial schools are teaching my own kids included that go to a parochial school so i explained to them how the 400perchild tax credit allowed them to make the decision on what they were going to use their own 400 for if they choose to use that 400 to help pay tuition at a parochial school well so be it that is money that would have been sent to washington that is now in their home and they can then choose to make the decision to send their kids to a parochial school if they so desire but it is not washington telling them what to do with the money and it is not washington telling their parochial school what to teach in their school but rather it is now the parents in their own home making the decision as to how to spend their own money i would like to wrap up my time here on the floor today with kind of just a brief summary of some of the things we have talked about we have looked at the past and we have looked at how in the past we had a series of broken promises to balance the budget before 1994 we had grammrudmanhollings the budget deal of 1990 we looked at how in 1993 they reached the conclusion on how to solve this problem rather than control washington spending the conclusion was to reach into the pockets of american citizens i know for all the people out there it was not the first time i know it was part of the 1990 deal i know it was part of the 1993 deal but i also know that every timethey reached in the pockets and took more money out here to washington all it did was allow them to spend more out here in washington and that is not what the people wanted that path of broken promises of the balanced budget and the path of higher taxes that is over it ended in 1994 when the american people stepped up to the plate and said enough is enough it is going to stop they put a new group in charge out here in washington we are now 3 years into that new group the new group has brought us a balanced budget not in 2002 as promised but 4 years ahead of schedule the announcement today great news cbo from the organization that watches budgeting out here we are in fact running a surplus for fiscal year 1998 the first time since 1969 we are going to have a budget surplus great news three years into this thing we have done it by controlling the growth of washington spending we have been effective enough at slowing the growth rate of washington spending that we have not only gotten to a balanced budget 4 years ahead of schedule we have been able to provide the american people with a tax cut when i say we provide shoot it is the american people that earn that money all we are doing out here in washington is saying keep more of your own money it is yours to start with just do not send it out here to washington the present the present has a balanced budget for the first time since 1969 the present the present is lower taxes for the first time in 16 years the present the present is a restored medicare and done the right way with feeling and understanding for our senior citizens the future as we look forward to this we have 3 major problems remaining the first is we still have a 5 5 trillion debt staring us in the face the second is the social security money that needs to be put aside for social security and the third is taxes are still too high so as we look down the road to the future in this great nation the national debt repayment act which we have introduced in our office bill number h r 2191 takes twothirds of any surpluses that develop and it uses it to pay off the debt prioritizing repayment to the social security trust fund for our senior citizens the good news under this bill is that by the year 2026 and maybe sooner we will have repaid the entire federal debt that will restore the social security trust fund for our senior citizens and it will allow us as a generation to pass this country on to our children debtfree i can think of no higher goal that we might have in this government today than to work to a point where we repay the federal debt so our children can inherit a nation that is absolutely debtfree in doing so we also restore the social security trust fundfor our seniors the other onethird of the surpluses that are developing let us use those to lower taxes and let us set our vision for the future that we get the tax rate from 37 back to 25 percent would it not be great if onethird of all taxes paid by all americans at every level of government was reduced and those american citizens could keep it in their own pocket to decide what they would like to do with it whether it be to help their children whether it be to put their kids through college whether it be to provide their kids with a private school if that is what they would like to do if they in their own wisdom think that is better for their children but the bottom line is to leave that money in the hands of the people that earned it in the first place would that not be a great vision for america paid off debts so our children get a debtfree nation a restored social security trust fund for our senior citizens and lower taxes a onethird reduction in the overall tax rate all across america lest anybody think we cannot do it i just remind the american people of what was said in 1995 when we were first elected they said you cannot balance the budget and lower tax here we are three years into it four years ahead of schedule with the budget balanced taxes coming down and medicare restored it can be done if it is the will of the people and if the people get actively involved in making sure that this government does what they want this government to do"], [0.0025684237480163574, 0.9974315762519836, 1, "i thank my colleague for yielding me this time and for the outstanding job that he has done on this piece of legislation the democratic alternative let me point out before i begin my remarks that the charts that we have just seen on thisside of the aisle when they talked about the child tax credit let me just reinforce the comments by the gentleman from new york the percentage of dependent children ineligible for this 500 child tax credit in the state of texas 54 percent 54 percent of kids from families in the state of texas do not get it in connecticut 44 percent of the children would not be able to get it so when they put up these charts it is just for a select few it is not for the hardworking middleincome folks that really need it the most americas working families deserve a tax cut the democratic tax plan gives it to them under the democratic plan 71 percent of the tax cuts go to households earning less than 100 000 under the democratic plan the 500 child care credit goes to lower and middleincome families the teachers the police officers the nurses the people who are working harder than ever to achieve the american dream under the democratic plan the hope scholarship is fully funded making it possible for people from working families to afford that 13th and 14th year of education the democratic plan helps americas working families the republican bill we are debating does just the opposite it punishes americas working families and rewards the wealthy and the biggest corporations the new york times said this bill the republican bill showers tax cuts on the nations wealthiest families conservative commentator kevin phillips said this bill is a payback to big contributors speaker gingrich admitted this last month when he spoke to hundreds of wealthy contributors at a black tie dinner given by the republican party people paid as much as a quarter of a million dollars each to go to that dinner he said whatever you have given this is the speaker to these wealthy contributors whatever you have given is a tiny token of what you have saved that is what he is paying them back with today their bill what they have saved who is paying for this giveaway to the rich americas working families under the republican tax bill the working parents of almost 1 4 million children in michigan in my state will be excluded from the child care credit that is almost half the children in michigan under the

big corporations you have got to pay something like the rest of us we had in the 1980s corporations like texaco and boeing and at t that were not paying any federal income taxes the corporations in the early 1960s would pick up about 25 percent of the tax load in this country that has decreased because these large corporations paid no income taxes to the point that they were down to about 7 percent of the load in the mid1980s everybody was embarrassed so we passed a corporate minimum tax where they were required to pay something now under this bill the republicans want to give them a 22

people who pay capital gains need the ability to understand that they should not be penalized for being successful in this society consider these important facts from the congressional budget office about half of all families in this country own assets such as stocks bonds real estate and businesses that generate capital gains the elderly and this is bad news for the generational warfare types in this house the elderly realize a disproportionate amount of capital gains in 1993 those over 65 in this country realized 40 percent of all capital gains although they make up just 12 percent of the population they also paid 18 percent of all capital gains taxes a joint economic committee report in 1993 found that onethird of all taxpayers reporting capital gains had incomes of less than 30 000 why do folks in this country who love to punish producers who love to punish people who undertake risk in this society why do they want to not index capital gains inflation is an unfair tax on producers in this country to fight the indexation of capital gains in my view is grossly unfair the nonrefundable tax credit we have heard other speakers tonight talk about this aspect of the child tax credit democrats claim the ways and means bill is unfair because it offers a nonrefundable credit to middleincome families over 18 million lowincome families in this country receive a tax break already it is called the earned income tax credit and we spend 26 billion on that earned income tax credit now folks on the other side of the aisle say that lowincome workers should receive another tax break because they pay fica taxes and i hope the american people are listening to this argument tonight and tomorrow and in the weeks ahead payroll taxes are different from income taxes income taxes which lowincome workers do not pay because of the earnedincome tax credit go to general revenues and are used for government programs for general revenue purposes fica taxes are earmarked for social security and medicare revenues from fica taxes go to the social security trust fund and are used to pay benefits under medicare and social security today lowincome workers like all workers are required to contribute to the social security system they will receive all of what they pay into that system and more in the years ahead and it is a very interesting difference between the parties when it comes to fairness this concept of fairness the democrats seem to define fairness as follows middleincome earners in addition to financing the earnedincome tax credit should also subsidize the retirement and health benefits of lowincome workers in essence they say it is unfair for the working poor to contribute to the social security and medicare system which will return benefits to them when they retire those of us on this side of the aisle define fairness as follows all working americans with kids deserve a tax break middleincome workers should not be responsible for subsidizing the payroll taxes paid by lowincome workers we all benefit from social security and medicare and we all need to contribute our fair share last the great class warfare attack of 1997 the alternative minimum tax the amt passed originally in 1986 as part of the tax reform act of 1986 with all good intentions to make sure that truly individuals wealthy and corporations could not avoid paying taxes and i am fully in support of that have goal but i go to the factories as many of us do we talk to the small business people in the capitalintensive industries in this country and they have got a problem with the alternative minimum tax like so many provisions of the tax code the amt has produced unintended consequences let us be clear what the bill of the committee on ways and means does not do in the way of alternative minimum tax under current law the alternative minimum tax treats investment in business machinery and equipment as income rather than as an expense under the proposal it does not exempt the wealthy from paying taxes it does not exempt companies from paying taxes no companies with taxable income will be able to avoid paying taxes we should all recognize this simple fact enough of class warfare enough of class envy let us go give a break to the producers and middle class of this country"], [0.9640942215919495, 0.9640942215919495, 0, "committee should run it

relative to just three legislative days ago as our friends across the aisle said actually it was a little more than that because it was on the calendar a couple of weeks ago when we tried to come up with a rule to protect the lowey amendment do the things they asked and lo and behold 135 democrats took a hike on us and did not support the bill we listened to them before we tried to work it out in a deliberative and i think nonpartisan way and we did not get their support so now we are trying to do our job faithfully and we have come back for what is one of the important appropriations bills and we have tried to craft a way to let the deliberative body work its will there has been some mischaracterization if not misrepresentation of the fact that the sky is going to fall automatically if we pass this rule that is not the case if somebody some member wishes to get up and strike on a point of order that is a privilege that happens to be a house rule if somebody says that is unfair what they are really saying is the house rules are unfair if members are saying that the rules that have served this house so well for so long are unfair then come on up to the committee on rules and let us talk about changing them and why members think they are unfair but that is not something that is done lightly so i think there has been a series of mischaracterizations going on as i have listened to the concern about the people who have failed to get the authorizations of measures that they want enacted we all know that we are not supposed to do a lot of authorization on appropriations bills the failure of the authorizations process to get the work done now has been picked up by the appropriators trying to pick up what pieces they could to do a good faith job and the committee on rules tried to do a good faith job to bring a rule forward that would get enough votes to pass so we could have a debate that went down by a big number that went down 291 to 125 three legislative days ago so i remind members of that now we are coming back with a different one and saying okay let the body work its will in a different way we will have what is basically an open rule now open rules used to be something we spoke of around here with a certain degree of reverence that that is something we all strive to achieve is the open rule i know the number of times that the gentleman from massachusetts when he was chairman moakley of the committee on rules we brought him to task because he did not have enough open rules i know his colleagues on the other side regularly tried to do that to chairman solomon and the rest of us in the majority we understand that but we do strive for open rules and we do it in a goodnatured way the only thing that is different is that we did protect the issue of the pay raise so if members are trying to shoot this rule down they are basically saying let us get the pay raise back on the floor at least some will characterize it that way i think there is much more at stake than the pay raise issue obviously we had the contraception question we have had the question of y2k on the contraception question again we had our chance 135 members on the other side voted against the lowey provision apparently because it was protected in that rule we had the y2k it surprises me a little bit that we are talking about y2k as an emergency it is not an emergency to those of us who understand the consequences of y2k we have been for some time trying to encourage the clinton administration to get a grip on the fact that the calendar is real that the year 2000 is coming and that we do have a problem most people in the world know that the year 2000 is on the calendar and they have a fairly approximate idea of when it is coming even if one does not know much about the computer problem one can at least understand the calendar we have not done well with the clinton administration some agencies are ahead of others again i will join with my colleague who congratulated the gentleman from california for the work he has done trying to bring attention to that and trying to stimulate some interest in the administration to get that job done the debate about whether or not is it an emergency payment or not an emergency payment therefore if it is an emergency we all know we do not have to figure out a way to pay for it if it is not an emergency then we have to figure out a way to pay for it it is a little extra harder because we have to actually designate the money from some revenue source so i would say that that is a secondary debate to the debate that y2k is very serious we all agree on that we are not going to put off the solution because we cannot decide whether to pay for it from here and designate what the source of payment is going to be i think that is a bit of a red herring before us i think what is frankly out here is this that the authorizers did not get that their job done the appropriators tried to pick it up the committee on rules has tried to work with everybody apparently it has not happened the next step is we can go the other route and say fine we can bring a rule out here with no protection at all on it and let it go to the floor i would urge all those listening to understand that this is a good faith effort to try and bring forth some kind of a workable rule to get this legislative appropriations bill on the floor it is a legislative appropriations bill because it is about 80 percent legislation we know that it is way overburdened that is wrong but that is what we are presented with we are presented with a schedule we are presented with a calendar of our own we are presented with a budget we have to deal with so if the question is shall we go forward and deal with the business of getting these agencies funded the answer is yes vote for the rule yes vote for the previous question voting no on the previous question throwing this thing into a controversy which is sure to destine it to another defeat another round of this is not going to get this appropriations bill passed some of those members who live in the area and represent workers in the area have a great concern naturally doing good jobs of representing their districts and the people in their districts are going to be very very concerned if this thing goes down a couple of more times because we cannot get it together i can guarantee members that the provision that has been suggested with regard to the motion on the previous question on members pay and the lowey amendment and y2k will appeal to some members but it will not appeal to enough because we did that we already did that a couple of days ago three legislative days ago we did some other things as well but you will not be allowed to bring a rule forth that will get necessary majority support with just those provisions it is not going to happen the final point i would make on this is there is not going to be a better offer right now than voting yes on the previous question and voting yes on the rule to get this piece of legislation on the floor if we do not pass it it goes home i include for the record the following"],

without penalizing the very children the law is designed to help while we want to ensure that states have the most efficient mechanism in place to collect and distribute child support payments to families in neet we must also make certain that the penalties for failure to meet the federal deadlines are not so extreme as to jeopardize funding intended for those same children my own state of illinois did not meet the deadline established by the 1988 family support act and if this legislation is not approved today illinois will be forced to forfeit 650 million in federal funding for child support services child support programs provide vital assistance in locating parents establishing paternity and collecting child support payments and a large penalty such as the one facing illinois is extreme and serves only to hurt those we seek to help the bill before us would still impose a penalty of almost 3 million on illinois but by reducing the penalty and restoring funding for these programs we can be certain efforts in illinois will continue to ensure that more deadbeat parents are located and made accountable after all collecting financial support from parents is what this

unanimous fashion today unfortunately that is not the bill that has come to the floor of the house of representatives the committee on rules has not only blurred the distinction between the

4194 the fiscal year 1999 appropriations bill for the veterans administration the department of housing and urban development and independent agencies while i believe h r 4194 is a good bill and could garner strong bipartisan support i am opposed to the rules treatment of chairman leachs amendment to include h r 2 the draconian reform to our federal housing programs in this funding bill the rule before us violates the principles of this house the house is divided into committees as i see it the work of those committees is divided into two categories appropriating and authorizing authorizers such as myself are charged with considering programmatic policy questions while appropriators are charged with making difficult funding decisions within the constraints of the budget resolution these are two very distinct roles in recognition of that fact the rules of the house permit members to strike authorizing provisions included in or offered as an amendment toappropriations bills by raising points of order against such provisions nonetheless it appears that the rule before us applies that longstanding policy only when it is convenient to the majority party for instance the rule waives points of order against chairman leachs amendment to incorporate h r 2 the draconian public and assisted housing reform bill into the hudva bill despite the fact that the house and senate democrats along with the administration have been negotiating to resolve the contentious policy issues raised in h r 2 and its senate counterpart s 462 the rule facilitates efforts to circumvent negotiations

veterans research and the national science foundation it is a priority of the administration and reflects a good compromise between the administrations request and private sector interests
