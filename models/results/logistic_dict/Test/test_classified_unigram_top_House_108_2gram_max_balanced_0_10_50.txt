everything around you right now we have troops in the field a war has begun and we should be doing everything we can to speak with one voice and achieve national unity yet the republican leadership insists at this moment in bringing to the floor one of the most partisan divisive issues of the entire year i question their judgment and their timing i would hope that we would move fairly quickly today to a resolution supporting our troops in the field unfortunately our republiqan friends prefer to have on the floor a matter of high partisanship which will divide this congress like all of my colleagues republicans as well as democrats and like the american people themselves i fully support our troops i hope and pray that they will accomplish their mission as quickly and safely as possible for that reason i have argued that we should not be considering this bill today republicans have offered a budget that is as partisan as it is divisive as dishonest as it is dangerous to the country and at a time like this when the united states congress should be demonstrating its unity to the world i fear that bringing it to the floor guarantees a divisive debate but that is what republican leaders have done today and unfortunately there is no minimizing the differences between the democratic and republican budgets the democratic budget alternatives offered by the committee on the budget ranking member the gentleman from south carolina is a responsible plan to strengthen national security and restore economic growth and fiscal responsibility it tightens federal spending and balances the budget using honest accounting but it still meets priorities like defense education and health care and it does more for homeland security than the republican budget does there are two other budget alternatives offered by groups of democrats the blue dogs on one hand and the congressional black caucus and progressive caucus on the other they are worthwhile and i am glad that they are in order under this rule the republican budget stands in stark contrast the republican budget is intellectually dishonest morally indefensible and just plain bad for our economy and our nation it explodes the deficit and raises the death tax on all americans it shortchanges homeland security to pay for tax breaks for millionaires and it proves once again just how out of touch house republicans truly are at a time which this nation must come together republicans offer a budget that will pull us apart simply put the republican budget separates americans into two categories winners and losers the winners are the wealthiest few who get hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks the losers are everyone else the people who have to sacrifice to pay for those tax breaks for the wealthiest few to paraphrase winston churchill never have so many been asked to sacfifice for so few the republican budget skimps on homeland security it slashes priorities like education and health care it shortchanges veterans and farmers and it still explodes the deficits that is because the republican budget is a shameless work of fiction it calls for draconian cuts cuts in priorities like veterans benefits student loans and law enforcement and still gives massive tax breaks to the wealthiest but it requires the tax breaks to be enacted by npril 11 and gives republicans until july 11 to make the spending cuts when you get your dessert before you eat your spinach you never eat your spinach any american parent can tell us that and so can anyone else who has watched the republican budget charade drive up the deficit over the past few years as the gentleman from texas the foremost proponent of fiscal responsibility in this house told us yesterday in the committee on rules the tax cuts will be enacted and the spending cuts will be abandoned and the deficit will continue to explode why are republicans foisting this dangerous budget on america and on our economy for one simple reason because they stubbornly insist on giving massive tax breaks to the wealthiest few they say that to govern is to choose well take a look at the consequences of the choices republicans have made in this budget american troops are at war but republicans chose to shortchange the veterans who defended this nation in past years and to give tax breaks to millionaires that is why the veterans of foreign wars opposes the republican budget republicans chose to slash education and to give tax breaks to millionaires they chose to cut health care for children and seniors on medicaid and to give tax breaks to millionaires they chose to cut assistance to farmers and to give tax breaks to millionaires that is why the conservative farm bureau opposes the republican budget republicans are even shortchanging homeland security and once again they are making sure millionaires get all the tax breaks they want despite all these cruel cuts cuts that touch almost all americans and their families this republican budget still explodes the deficit all the budget gimmicks and phony accounting inthe world what president bush once called fuzzy math cannot hide that truth all in all the republicans are proposing an economic horror show at a time when americans are still suffering from the latest republican recession since president bush took office 2 5 million americans have lost their jobs in the private sector the surplus has gone and last years deficit was 317 billion but republicans refuse to face that fact so they propose a budget that would actually harm the economy by driving the nation deeper into debt raising the debt tax on all americans and their children and increasing families mortgage payments and credit card bills moreover this republican budget does not account for how we are going to pay for a war with iraq that has begun so yesterday in the committee on rules the gentleman from missouri"], [2.86102294921875e-05, 0.9999713897705078, 1, "i yield myself such time as i may consume today i am offering a motion to instruct conferees on the child tax credit mr speaker while many of my colleagues continue to believe that higher deficits and more tax cuts for the rich are the way to end this bush recession let us look at the facts since the beginning of the bush administration america has seen the loss of over 3 3 million jobs of which 2 5 million have been in manufacturing moreover taxes on working families have gone up this is via interest rate increases that makes your monthly mortgage payments higher and increases your monthly car payments tie national deficit has soared to almost half a trillion dollars this year and is increasing and what are you getting your tax dollars are paying over 300 billion this year alone on interest on the bush tax cut for the rich finally democrats working with senate republicans put forth a bill to give working families a real tax cut an extension of the child tax credit the republicans oppose it they are opposing a tax cut on working families tie people missing out on this tax cut include 6 5 million working families and their 12 million children who are struggling to make ends meet one in five of these chldhren are front active duty military families making even a republican senator from arizona who by the way ran for president just 2 years ago to say and i quote i dont understand how you the republican leadership and the president left enlisted men and women out of this tax package i do not get it end quote additionally this bill will disproportionately penalize african american and hispanic children 2 4 million african american children and 4 1 million hispanic childrens families deserve this tax cut but the republican party refuses to give it to them preferring tax cuts for millionaires and big business this according to the chlildrens defense fund this republican tax package ignores the needs of working families and by ignoring 6 5 million working families it will have a devastating impact on these families and the children across our country it will have a particularly devastating impact on latino and african american families those suffering some of the worst brunt of this bush recession we see 3 3 million unitedstates jobs disappear in america since january of 2001 we see the unemployment rate for african americans at 11 2 percent of the population we see the hispanic unemployment rate at 7 5 percent on top of that this most recent tax bill for the rich cut out child care tax benefits for the poorest children in america whose parents are working not on welfare as the republicans would have you believe but are working people who can barely keep their head above water thanks to the economic nightmare cast on america by this republican party and president bush these are people struggling to provide for their families and this republican congress refuses to fix it republicans are holding americas working families hostage by opposing any legislative remedy to help working families and instead by offering another huge tax cut for the richest 1 percent of americans again i believe it is shameful to be offering tax cuts to the rich while cutting benefits for the working poor cutting benefits for our veterans cutting benefits for seniors on medicare and allowing millions of american jobs to disappear since president bush and republicans began to set economic policy almost 3 years ago president bushs economic plan has failed the american people who should be some of the most cherishd members of our society our veterans working families and innocent children president bushs economic plan does more than ignore these groups in my opinion and many other peoples opinion it hurts them as the disabled american veterans wrote in a letter to speaker hastert and the republican party earlier this year during consideration of the republican budget which mandated massive cuts in veterans programs disabled american veterans asked have you no shame they were speaking to the republican party today i ask that same question on behalf of the working families of my district the bronx and queens the child tax credit bill passed by this republican house leaves children and families in my district behind particularly families of color families earning between 10 500 a year and 26 625 a year are excluded from claiming the child tax credit increase what does this mean for latino families half of all latinos report having an annual household income under 30 000 half of all latinos report having an annual household income under 30 000 the house republican child tax credit plan means most of these latino families will be excluded will be excluded from the child tax credit it means that approximately 1 6 million or 30 percent of the eligible latino families who might have otherwise benefited from the increase are being left out this is on top of the fact that the bush economic plan means more latinos are out of work moreover latinos have a fasterrising unemployment rate than the general population as of this summer it was 7 5 percent compared to roughly 6 percent for the average american this is on top of the fact that the bush tax cut on dividend income affects only 7 percent of hispanics who own stock latinos in my district want to work and they want to do what they can to provide good futures for their children but many latinos in my district are working in lowwage jobs or thanks to the number of fulltime jobs lost are only working part time they are being left out of the bush tax credit president bushs priorities are clearly not working for latino families and they are clearly not working for african american families either african american families are among the hardest hit by the bush tax plan and the house republican child tax credit about 932 000 african american children under the age of 18 according to the childrens defense fund live in extreme poverty given our economy it is unfortunately not surprising that this statistic represents a 50 percent increase since 1999 african american families like latino families are disproportionately left out of the bush child tax credit african american unemploymint is rising to above 10 percent those who are eligible to find work are often barely getting by these are the families that need the child tax credit the most and yet these are the families that the republicans and this president are leaving out a family earning 20 000 with two children is being overlooked by president bush in faor of the family earning 200 000 a year who does not necessarily need the child tax credit yet a family earning 20 000 is the family that sincerely needs a 400 child tax credit that credit would be equivalent to a 4 percent raise in pay but that tax credit does not exist under president bushs plan president bushs priorities are not the families that need the tax credit the most president bush continues to ignore the voices of latino and african american families our national debt increases our debt limit increases and president bush continues to increase tax breaks for those who do not need them and i believe and all of this side of the aisle believe that that is wrong mir speaker i reserve the balance of my time"], [5.238398443907499e-05, 5.238398443907499e-05, 0, "i move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution h res 277

much of his time to organize us to come to this floor to help shed light on what is going on in this congress and in this world i look forward to every opportunity that he affords me to participate the massive costs of the war and how they will affect americans in their everyday lives is an incredibly important issue that we must continue to discuss this past monday the president sent his fiscal year 2005 budget to congress we found out that under this presidents guidance the nations debt has grown to record numbers this year alone the deficit is expected to be at least 521 billion and the national debt has grown by 1 7 trillion since 2001 yet instead of taking the necessary steps to bring our fiscal house into order the president has proposed more of his failed policies i am having an interesting time discussing this with my friends they say to me maxine waters i thought that you were the one that has been accused of being one of those taxandspend liberals but now your president has outdone you he is spending money like a drunken sailor how can you explain it i say to him i cannot explain it but it falls into that category of misdirection of tales that are being told that just do not hold up when you place them under scrutiny the presidents budget is extremely dangerous it calls for eliminating 38 education programs and cutting funding for dozens of others it does virtually nothing for the 43 million americans who have no health insurance it cuts 1 6 billion from huds section 8 voucher program and an additional 130 million from public housing the presidents budget even cuts by 7 percent programs designed to protect our drinking water keep our air clean nd other important environmental programs the budget even calls for imposing copayments and enrollment fees for our veterans in order to receive health care for their injuries sustained while protecting our nation i find it appalling that our president would require our veterans to pay up to 250 enrollment fees in order to receive the care they need but these are just a few examples of the administrations policies that penalize working americans the war in iraq is a continuation of these policies it is the working american that is fighting dying and paying for this war the wealthiest of americans on the other hand are not being asked to make any of these sacrifices none are serving themselves and few if any have sons or daughters in the unitedstates armed forces and they are the beneficiaries of hundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts which makes it increasingly difficult to pay for this war to date the president has asked for and received 157 billion for this war in iraq amazingly recent press 7reports suggest that the president will ask for another additional 50 million shortly after the next election for military activities in iraq and afghanistan this will bring the total to 206 billion what is so disappointing though not surprising is the difference between what we were told the costs would be for this war and what the costs are turning out to be throughout the buildup to the war and even during the early stages the american people were assured that the costs would be minimal who can forget deputy secretary of defense wolfowitz statement in march of 2003 when he said were dealing with a country that can really finance its own reconstruction and relatively soon but the sad reality is that it is the american people who are paying for this war as we look at this administration and this war we cannot help but now understand why the american people are finally waking up to how they have been misled and misdirected by this president and this administration of course we heard refarences tonight to the reason we were told we were going into this war and we must say it over and over again we did a preemptive strike because saddam hussein and iraq had weapons of mass destruction and we were in imminent danger we were told this over and over again and colin powell even had some maps he pointed to some sheds where chemicals were being made and the weapons of mass destruction were being developed but we have been misled on many things by this president and now we find ourselves in a terrible situation in iraq we are not in control our soldiers are dying being picked off one by one suicide bombings are taking place soldiers are losing their lives i am sure their families are asking why or what does this all mean not only are they losing their lives we were told after the president could no longer support or justify the weapons of mass destruction that we really needed a regime change that we had to be about the business of creating democracy in iraq now we are at the point where our president has said they are going to turn over governance to the iraqis only to find out that this president does not want free and fair elections he does not want free and fair elections because oh somebody may win that he does not like and i want you to know that the protests are growing in iraq about the fact that this president now wants to select and choose who will be in charge of iraq he wants to put in a council through some kind of caucuses to avoid the shiites being in control because they may be the ones that get elected in this war as opposed to the sunnis that they would like to have elected but whether we are talking about iraq or afghanistan we really did not have a plan we really thought we could just bomb everybody into submission take over the oil fields and chop up the spoils and are we disappointed my goodness how much more insult do the american people have to take from this administration here we have the vice president of the united states of america mr dick cheney who is still receiving paychecks from his old company halliburton and what have we found out about halliburton they are cheating us right and left not only have they overcharged us for the oil they are importing from kuwait to iraq we find out they are cheating us on the amount of the food that they are serving to our soldiers they are giving us extraordinary numbers only to find out that they are not really serving the numbers that they represent i talked about some of this last night but it goes on and on and on we are paying for a war that we should not have been in in the first place we are paying contractors who are cheating us like halliburton who are getting nobid contracts and there is no end to all of this this administration is going to have to pay a price for what it has done i am glad that we are here talking about it this evening the administrations rhetoric does not support the situation we find ourselves in today we were not welcomed as liberators there are no weapons of mass destruction hundreds of unitedstates soldiers are dying and taxpayers are paying billions of dollars for a war that need not be fought meanwhile our responsibilities here at home are being neglected the senates ricin scare yesterday reminds us that our homeland is not as secure as it should be our schools continue to be in disrepair and hundreds of thousands of workers are losing their jobs we need to reassess our priorities unfortunately this budget does not do any of these things there is so much more we can say but i am going to yield my time to our leader here so that he can wrap this up tonight but we have

ignoring the need of the majority of americans two years ago the administration and congress were looking covetously at a staggering 5 6 trillion cumulative surplus through 2010 at the time congress was continually reassured by the administration that we could afford an enormous tax cut ensure the solvency of social security and medicare pay down the national debt fund our domestic priorifies and still have a large surplus reserve fund to front anticipated emergencies like many of my colleagues i cautioned the administration at the time that its budget and enormous tax cut were based on unrealistic surplus projections that would never materialize not surprisingly the congressional budget office confirmed that in less than 2 years the 10year projected surplus has been erased while portions of this decline are a result of our efforts to defeat terrorism and preserve national security both at home and abroad the depletion of the surplus to date was largely caused by the administrations fiscally irresponsible policies of 2001 what do we get for these tax cuts which were supposed to stimulate our economy well we now have the highest unemployment rate in 9 years severe cuts in state budgets and programs and the largest among deficit in national debt in our nations history not content ivith these successes the republicans now want more tax cuts largely skewed to the wealthiest americans the top rate income tax reduction in dividend taxation provisions are particularly egregious when 8 8 million americans are unemployed with the average length of unemployment now at about 20 weeks the republican tax cuts ignore the situation of those americans furthermore our nation will have to borrow to pay for the funds to pay for these tax cuts at a time when the united states has a 6 4 trillion national debt and spend 1 billion per day on interest payments for that debt in fact debt interest payments are now the third largest expenditure in the federal budget money that could instead be used for homeland security health care prescription drugs for our seniors or education for our children almost as outrageous as the provisions of the republican tax plan was the house leadership decision not to allow the democrats to offer their alternative was even more egregious our plan was far more fiscally responsible costing only 129 billion in immediate spending and even those costs would be offset for long term economic gains such as income taxes from newly employed americans the democratic plan would create 1 million new jobs more than double the estimate for the republican plan additionally it would put money in the pockets of families most likely to spend provide tax relief for businesses most likely to invest and hire and provide direct financial assistance to states that are struggling to provide health care and other vital human services to their citizens this financial assistance would forestall state tax increases or service cutbacks that would otherwise deepen the recession and destroy jobs i am deeply disturbed by the outcome of todays vote as well as the heavy handed tactics used by the republican leadership that denied a debate on

largest public airport systems and position houston as the international gateway to the south central united states unfortunately the current tracon facility was constructed in the late 1960s and is inadequate to meet the needs at these three airports the facility is in a low lying area which floods often disrupting air traffic and cannot be expanded to provide the airspace capacity needed to achieve the full benefits of the additional runway capacity expected to be online at bush intercontinental in spring 2004 expedited construction of the new tracon is necessary to realize the 36

the persecution of jews throughout the world this week the international court of justice under dubious jurisdiction ruled that israels security fence was illegal in essence the ruling declares that israel has no right whatsoever to defend itself protect its people or to live at peace israel did not want to build a fence i am sure that they would have preferred to spend the time and money on something else unfortunately terrorist attacks and an unwillingness or inability by the palestinian authority to rein in those terrorists forced israel to construct the fence whereas the palestinian authority has been unsuccessful the fence has proven to be effective in combating the waves of homicide bombers that once flooded israel with death and destruction the number of successful attacks has fallen significantly innocent lives have been saved the international court does not seem to care about saving lives it would rather assist the terrorists it would rather promote religious bigotry it would prefer that israel throw its hands in the air and surrender tq certain annihilation before during and after the icj case israel has borne the brunt of unmitigated hatred from the world community only israel is at fault only israel kills only israel is intransigent on the peace process how many innocent israelis have to be killed while riding on a bus sitting in a cafe or walking down the street too many to count who refuses to stop terrorist organizations such as hamas and hezbollah the palestinian authoritys inaction is a resounding refusal rather than waiting for the palestinian authority to do something israel has decided to protect children walking to school mothers shopping for groceries and commuters riding the bus to work no one questions our right to protect our citizens but apparently the icj believes convenience for the palestinians trumps the right of the state of israel to protect its citizens the international community has blinded itself to the criminal and terrorist activities of israels neighbors and the residents of the west bank and gaza strip there has been no condemnation of homicide bombers there has been no condemnation of persecution of religious minorities in areas controlled by the palestinian authority there is no condemnation of arab treatment of palestinians in other middle eastern countries only israel is singled out for criticism the fact that israel alone is criticized for socalled human rights violations and for the persecution of palestinian arabs shows in my opinion that religious bigotry rather than a true sense of justice and fairness is what has been driving this issue a just and fair examination would question where millions of dollars in aid given to alleviate palestinian poverty has gone a truthful assessment would also recognize israel as a democracy in sea of autocratic states a balanced portrait of the situation would show that israels arab minority enjoys full citizenship in israel can the same be said of jews outside israel can the same be said of palestinian arabs living in other middle eastern states the international court of justice has ruled that they would prefer a middle east without israel they would rather see a democratic state where all people can live work and practice their religion disappear from the face of the earth most assuredly if the security fence is

a psychologist the importance of helping to make sure that children get to the right professionals and that there is not coercion or threat that goes to the families i want to take a few moments first of all to lay out with regard to this bill the issues involved with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder an often misunderstood and often maligned diagnosis that because of that lends itself to prejudicial comments as certainly the gentleman from rhode island was also alluding to attention deficit disorder has a number of diagnostic criteria which are laid out in what is called the diagnostic and statistical manual they include categories of inattention hyperactivity and impulsiveness because psychiatric and psychological symptoms are described in behavioral terms they oftentimes seem 1 ague and only behavioral for example under the inattention category it might mean a perso n who fails to give close attention to details or has difficulty sustaining attention in tasks or often does not seem to listen when spoken to directly or does not follow through on instructions to finish school work et cetera often has difficulty organizing tasks and activities or avoids or is reluctant to engage in tasks that require sustained mental effort when one just hears some of those symptoms one may think that those could cover a wide range of behaviors that may not necessarily reach a diagnosis that requires medication and there is something to that that is why it is so very important when there is a concern raised about a childs symptom picture perhaps fitting the diagnosis of attention deficit disorder that that child be thoroughly evaluated by perhaps a team of professionals psychiatrists psychologists people who are trained to do this but not simply referred on the basis of this child is difficult in the classroom and let me lay out why in terms of attention behaviors we look upon this as a primary secondary and tertiary diagnosis a primary attention deficit disorder is one where a child actually has the symptom pictures of attention disorder related to the biological and in some cases some inherited factors for that but it is pretty clearly in that category they meet the diagnostic criteria secondary attention deficit disorder is when the child may have the same problems with concentration and attention and getting their work done but it is secondary to some other problems for example a child may have an anxiety disorder they may be suffering from depression they may have sensory problems i have known children who were referred to me for attention disorder only to find out they needed glasses or they had a subtle hearing loss they may be havidg social problems cultural problems as they are moving from one school district to another and have a great deal of difficulty they may have speech and communication problems where they have trouble understanding the teacher and yet those childrens symptom picture can look similar they are not paying attention not concentrating they are not getting their work done they are agitated and hyperactive it is important that those other problems are diagnosed clearly and those are treated and those are not the children who should be given medication a third type is a tertiary problem and this is not the problem with the child so much as it is a problem with expectations that is people may expect a preschool child to sit still people may expect a teenager to concentrate and not daydream we know anybody with any rudimentary knowledge of having children knows that those are not realistic expectations and yet there are those sometimes who feel that children who are out of sync with their expectations will somehow require medication and that is inappropriate these diagnostic criteria i should also add in the testimony that was given to the committee on education and the workforce there were some who raised the question of whether or not this was biological i draw some attention to some research that was done i believe in 1990 where they did positron emission tomography that is they could look at the activity in the brains of people who were identified with attention disorder and those who were not and found in those who had a diagnosis of attention disorder 1heir brain activity was somewhat lower that is not to mean that they had brain damage it simply meant by looking at levels of brain activity they found that those parts of the brain that generally control impulses and thought that is the frontal lobe et cetera were not as active as those in people who did not have attention disorder that lent a great deal to the science of understanding attention disorder because all along before that we thought that the brains were overstimulated and it may actually be they were undercontrolled in some regions this of course also lends credence to why sometimes one may use medication the medications used such as ritalin or adderall or dexedrine are stimulant medications and we for many years wondered about this paradoxical effect of why would you give a stimulant medication to actually slow someone down and the point is that it appears to stimulate those portions of the brain basically sometimes a layman can understand that if they feel tired and groggy and overwhelmed and they are having trouble staying alert and staying focused sometimes a person as they are driving down the road will be overactive but the point is this what i am trying to lay out here is the complexity of this let me end with this one anecdote when i was practicing as a psychologist i received a call to evaluate a child and did so then calling back to the school district said this child does not appear to have primary attention disorder i think there were some other issues here but not that i was told then by the referring source in the school district put this child on ritalin or we will never refer another child to your practice again i challenged that person on that immediately and said i need to go by what i believe an appropriate diagnostic criteria is and suggested they withdraw that threat but that is the very reason why we need legislation like this to say this is not something that should be done to control children this should be something that is done to help do the best thing in the childs best interest with the best people involved using the appropriate diagnostic criteria this is a positive thing for children and ultimately a positive thing for families and i certainly implore my

commerce it was from monticello that jefferson conceived this idea and he chose captain meriwether lewis to lead the exploration thus began what would become the lewis and clark expedition on march 15 1803 meriwether lewis left the presidents house in washington d c and began preparations for his adventures toward the pacific he stopped at the arsenal in harpers ferry with an authorizing letter from the secretary of war and purchased items he proceeded to philadelphia where he studied a wide range of scientific topics lewis returned to washington when he wrote to captain william clark to enlist his aid and to share command of the expedition in pittsburgh lewis had a keelboat constructed and recruited boatmen to man the vessel that would enable him and clark to make the long journey preparations for the expedition beginning at monticello and ending in wood river illinois and the return phase beginning in st louis and ending in washington d c included visiting sites in ten states in the east these states include virginia maryland delaware pennsylvania west virginia ohio kentucky tennessee indiana and illinois as well as the district of columbia currently no sites visited in these states are recognized as lewis and clark national historic landmarks nor are they locations along the lewis and clark national historic trail i am pleased that title ii of h r 3819 implements a
