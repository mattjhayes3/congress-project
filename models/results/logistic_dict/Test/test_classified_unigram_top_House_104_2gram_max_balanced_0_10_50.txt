about what has been going on in this house in a truly historic time this is the first time in a generation that the executive branch and the legislative branch have come together and decided that we were going to do what americans have had to do for over 200 years and that is balance our checkbook to only spend as much money as we take in and to stop stealing from our children and our grandchildren and future generations i think a lot of people have heard the numbers before they have heard that this is a country that is now 5 trillion in debt we are a government that spends 4 for every 3 that we take in we are a government that continues to steal from future generations and our children and grandchildren i have got a 7yearold boy and a 4yearold boy right now the debt that they are holding on their head is 20 000 in fact every man woman and child right now is 20 000 in debt if we divide that 5 trillion by the number of people that are in this country if you want to drive it home and figure out how much my 7yearold boy joey and my 4yearold boy andrew will be owing in taxes over the course of their lifetime if we continue down the same failed path that we continued down when the democrats were in control for 40 years and if we followed the presidents plan my children and your children your grandchildren would owe 187 000 simply in interest on the federal debt that is money that they would be paying over the course of their lifetime as their taxes continue to escalate we cannot say it enough that today and this past week and over this past year we have drawn a line in the sand we have ignored the polls we have ignored the pundits we have ignored everybody that said you cant do it you cant balance the budget washington will not let you the bureaucrats will not let you the president will not let you in fact it was 1 year ago that the president the man who is on the other end of pennsylvania avenue and who has been telling the american people for the last 2 weeks that he has always been for a balanced budget it was that same president who 1 year ago introduced his budget 1994 style to the american people he introduced that budget that continued to allow deficits to skyrocket continually into the future ninetynine senators voted on that budget 1 year ago and all 99 senators voted no on the presidents plan i guess they are pretty smart over there in the other body they followed the president once the democrats followed the president in this chamber and in the chamber over there when in 1993 the president introduced his blueprint of what he wanted america to look like do you remember what that blueprint said it said that president clinton wanted to raise taxes he wanted to raise spending and he wanted to continue to let the deficit soar the fact of the matter is his 1993 plan raised taxes more than any other president in the history of this country he claimed it was the largest deficit reduction plan of all time the fact of the matter is that if you look at it through the life of it deficits soared at the end because he put off all the cuts until the very end now he says well weve brought the deficit down some in the past few years well sure if we wanted to tax americans and continue to tax americans and continue to tax americans and continue to tax americans we could bring the deficit down too of course we would continue down the same failed path that we have continued down before and would continue to punish people for being productive would continue to take their savings away from them would continue to tax seniors this is a thing that has amazed me the most about the debate that the president and members from the liberal side could look with a straight face at the american people and say we want to protect senior citizens because the fact of the matter is that when they had their budget in 1993 when they had their chance to make a difference what did they do the first thing they did was they raised taxes on senior citizens how much well they made senior citizens pay taxes on 85 percent of their social security benefits but that was not enough nosiree bob they decided that if you are a senior citizen and you actually want to be productive with your life after you start drawing social security benefits well productivity is something that liberals cannot put up with so we are going to have to tax you they lowered the earnings limit from 34 000 to 11 000 basically told senior citizens if you work we are going to punish you so let us fast forward that is 1993 if they wanted to raise taxes on seniors i guess that was their business they paid for it not a single republican in 1993 voted for the largest tax increase in the history of the world bill clintons tax increase and the democrats tax increase not one republican voted for it and we saw what happened last year the republicans said elect us and were going to lower your taxes and were going to balance the budget were going to save future generations from the debt that is now crushing us we did that we got rewarded for it there was an unprecedented landslide i refuse to believe despite what the president says despite what the democrats say i refuse to believe that americans now are against a balanced budget or that americans now believe 1 year later that they are not being taxed enough or that 1 year later americans believe that they are not being regulated enough but if you get past the rhetoric and you look at what the president has done and what liberal democrats in this chamber have done they have continued to espouse higher taxes more regulations and a balanced budget is nowhere in sight i know it has got to be confusing to some who do not live in washington and are lucky enough to live outside the beltway but the fact of the matter is that the president has changed his mind so much on the balanced budget that it is hard to keep track back in 1992 he promised he would balance the budget in 5 years by my count he has another year or two well that changed very very quickly we all remember the horror that americans watched as they watched the president tell us that yes he had promised a balanced budget plan and yes he had promised a middleclass tax cut in fact we remember him in new hampshire holding up the plan when people ridiculed him he said you laugh at me but ive got the plan right here but then we watched when governor clinton got elected and became president clinton what was the first thing he did he got on the airwaves and said well i know what i said in the campaign i know i know but listen weve been looking at the numbers and were not going to be able to give you the middleclass tax cut it gets worse were going to have to raise your taxes it gets worse were going to have to pass the largest tax increase in the history of this country well obviously americans were upset he paid for it in the polls he paid for it by reneging on his promise to balance the budget in 5 years and in the offyear election the republicans and conservatives were swept into power across this country how did the president respond he was in the denial stage and he denied that americans really wanted a balanced budget that it was not a priority he introduced a budget plan that did not balance the budget then he moved forward and later on he came in an he said well maybe we can balance the budget maybe we can balance it in 10 years in fact he went up to new hampshire which was coincidentally the site of the first primary and somebody told him that he needed to support a balanced budget so he said i support a balanced budget then he came back to washington his advisers got a hold of him we said no no no maybe i do not support a balanced budget then he went back up to new hampshire they said mr president do you support a balanced he said yes we can balance the budget then he came back down to dc changed his mind no we cant finally he put out a plan that he says will balance the budget in 10 years unfortunately it was about 200 billion short we run deficits of 200 billion well into the future the plan did not balance the budget house democrats were enraged enraged that the president of the united states would actually dare to put forward a plan to balance the budget the ranking member of appropriations got on the floor and like many others was very up upset what did he say he said we are upset about the fact that the president proposed to balance the budget but what we found is if you do not like the presidents position on any issue just be patient wait a couple weeks it is sure to change and sure enough 2 weeks later it changed again and he went from 10 years saying we can do it in 7 years then he went to 9 years and 8 years and it was sort of hard to nail down the president exactly on what number he thought finally the house republicans said we demand a balanced budget in 7 years using true numbers that too much is at stake and we did that now they are starting to try to weasel out of it again and are now saying well i know we have said that we will commit to 7 years but it is 7 maybe 8 years well we are sending a message to the democrats to the president on the other side of pennsylvania avenue and to all americans the freshman class of the 104th congress will not compromise we will balance the budget in 7 years using true figures or we will not go along with any plan it is that simple it is that simple why do we need to do it we need to do it to ensure future generations have unprecedented economic growth we need to do it to stop driving up the deficits and we need to do it to save protect and preserve medicare i have got to tell you i am new to washington i have never been elected to office before this year i have got to tell you one of the most shocking things to me has been the demagoguery that has flown around on this issue of medicare the president came out himself in april of this year saying that medicare was going bankrupt the trustees reported that three members of his own cabinet are on the medicare trustees they said medicare is going bankrupt if you do not do something about it you are going to pay because the system is going to go bankrupt in the year 2002 well we sent a cr to the president that reflected our plan to save protect and preserve medicare and the president got on the tv and said he could not sign that cr that he was going to veto it and he was going to send all the federal employees out that he could not have medicare destroyed like this it was unbelievable these meanspirited republicans and the press bought into it and judging by some of the polls a lot of americans bought into it but here is the catch our plan was almost identical to the very same plan that president clinton had been supporting for some time i mean can you believe that look at the news footage of him this past week and last week you would think that this man had a plan that was radically different from the republican plan and that the republicans were meanspirited and that only bill clinton could protect and preserve medicare and he had to save the senior citizens from the meanspirited republicans but the unpleasant fact in fact they are difficult things to get around but the facts show our medicare plan is almost identical to the presidents medicare plan let me tell you something there is a washington post editorial that was written last week on this issue and the editorial reads at the top the real default now the washington post has never been an ally of the conservative movement or the republican party but let me tell you something this i believe is probably the most important editorial that has been written by any publication in the past 5 years because it was after this editorial was written that the white house was finally shamed into backing off from their unabashed demagoguery let me read a little bit to you bill clinton and the congressional democrats were handed an unusual chance this year to deal constructively with the effect of medicare on the deficit and they blew it the chance came in the form of the congressional republican plan to balance the budget over seven years some other aspects of that plan deserved to be resisted but the republican proposal to get at the deficit partly by confronting the cost of medicare deserved support the democrats led by the president chose instead to present themselves as medicares great protectors they have shamelessly used the issue demagogued on it because they think thats where the votes are and the way to derail the republican proposals generally the president was still doing it this week a republican proposalto increase medicare premiums was one of the reasons he alleged for the veto that has shut down the governmentand never mind that he himself in his own budget would countenance a similar increase this is still the washington post talking weve said some of this before it gets more serious if the democrats play the medicare card and win they will have set back for years for the worst of political reasons the very cause of rational government in behalf of which they profess to be behaving politically they will have helped to lock in place the enormous financial pressure that they themselves are first to deplore on so many other federal programs not least the programs for the poor you see getting medicare increases under control is not about protecting the rich the post has come out before saying the medicare cuts have no correlation to the tax cuts that we are saving medicare and in saving medicare we are saving the system we are making it solvent it is about helping all americans helping get this debt out of the way and the deficit out of the way but some people still want to default on leadership and in the washington post article yesterday written by matthew miller the post wrote though many of the presidents advisers think that the g o p s premium proposal is sensible and differs very little from his own plan the president fired sound bites from the oval office daily taking the low road in ways that only washington pundits could recast as standing tall as the polls show it worked the fact of the matter is it worked in the short run many when asked in this body many had been asked when is this shutdown going to end and many were cynical and said well it ends when the presidents poll numbers start going down it is not a coincidence that it was late friday night that the presidents approval ratings in this crisis had gone down six points the next morning leon panetta marched on capitol hill and actually sat down and started negotiating seriously i have got to tell you i have been deeply dismayed by this whole process deeply dismayed not only by the administrations comments but by what leon panetta said he of course said republicans were terrorists he said we were holding a gun to the presidents head because we simply insisted that he balance the budget in 7 years the fact of the matter is leon panetta time after time after time after time attached things to the continuing resolutions in the 1980s when he was dealing with a republican administration he was not called on it but that is fine then we hearhim talking cbo numbers and saying that we should have omb numbers well it was president clinton himself who in 1993 stood right here in this chamber and told the american people the cbo estimates were the most accurate estimates and we must adhere to cbo estimates so the american people do not think we are playing games well we listened to the president we want to adhere to cbo estimates because they are the most conservative but as conservative as those cbo estimates are one important fact remains when the president in 1993 stood in this chamber and said we needed to go by cbo estimates because they were the most conservative estimates those estimates in 1993 had been overly optimistic for 13 years in a row which meant the deficit continued to shoot up for 13 years in a row we have got to be conservative with our childrens and our grandchildrens money we have got to stop stealing from future generations we have got to balance the checkbook and stop worrying about shortterm political gains my childrens futures depend on it all of americas childrens future depends on it we have to draw a line in the sand that is what we have done and that is why the president finally sat down and adhered to absolutely every demand that we asked and do it here too i would like to turn now and have a good friend of mine the gentleman from the state of minnesota discuss the issue were you not surprised at the turn we saw of the president this past week how he was at 10 years we were at 7 years he wanted omb numbers we wanted cbo numbers he came and compromised sure he compromised with the freshman class he wanted to balance the budget in 5 years now he has come in an said he will balance the budget in 7 years using cbo numbers despite what the administration has been saying today that is what they are committing to is that your understanding"], [3.0517578125e-05,

"i rise today in opposition to the republican budget resolution for fiscal year 1997 the new republican budget is nothing more than a rehash of the same extremist priorities from last year including large tax breaks for the wealthy paid for by deep cuts in medicare and medicaid house concurrent resolution 178 also includes misguided cuts in education funding unneeded boosts in defense spending and tax increases on 6 million hard working american families there is no doubt that spending in certain areas can be reduced and programs can be reformed particularly in the area of health care but this budget goes too far the majority refuses to abandon the most outrageous part of their budgetunnecessary cuts in medicare to finance tax breaks for the wealthy this budget cuts 168 billion from the medicare program 124 billion from part a and 44 billion from part b this plan sacrifices the quality and availability of seniors health care for a tax giveaway which primarily benefits people making over 100 000 a year the impact on senior citizens and hospitals is even more devastating than the cuts proposed last year house concurrent resolution 178 puts the squeeze on hospitals through deep cuts in the part of medicare that pays hospital bills these cuts could force many hospitals to close or reduce the services they now offer to their communities regardless of inflation hospitals would get less than they do today in nominal dollars under this budget in philadelphia our health care system and entire economy will be endangered by these insidious cuts many hospitals in my district whose beneficiaries are predomiiantly medicare and medicaid patients may have no alternative but to shut their doors house concurrent resolution 178 contains the same damaging structural changes to medicare and medicaid the president vetoed last year it continues to rely on the untested and dangerous medical savings accounts as its centerpiece the majority proposal would segment the medicare population leaving the traditional program with fewer dollars and a sicker pool of beneficiaries it would drive up premiums and causing medicare to wither on the vine this proposal is of extreme significance to my district the 20th oldest in the nation more than 100 000 senior citizens in my district rely on medicare and they live on fixed incomes this proposal could truly end universal health coverage for elderly effectively reversing 30 years of progress the majority tries to hide its true intentions behind lofty rhetoric abut saving medicare for the future house concurrent resolution 178 extends medicares solvency for the same number of years as the presidents planyet the gop plan takes 44 billion more from medicare it is obvious that the majority is using funds cut from medicare to pay for their crown jewela 176 billion tax cut for wealthy americans in addition the majority is still insisting on ending the medicaid guarantee for 36 million americans including millions of senior citizens and children approximately 400 000 people in philadelphia rely on medicaid as their only source of health care without that guarantee families will be forced to sell their homes to pay for nursing homes for their elderly parents this budget cuts federal medical spending by 72 billion but the total cuts could still reach 250 billion over 7 years if states spend only the minimum required to receive their full block grant allocation this potential 250 billion cut reduces spending growth per person below the general rate of inflation deep total cuts in medicaid could place older americans and people with disabilities at risk of losing optional medicaid benefits these cuts would place an additional financial burden on families caring for their parents and others with longterm care needs in addition the majority still insist on repealing federal enforcement of nursing home quality standards that have dramatically improved the quality of nursing home care house concurrent resolution 178 also would raise taxes on between 6 and 10 million hard working american families by cutting the earned income tax credit program the earned income tax credit benefited 40 million americans in working families and has been proven to help people move off welfare in addition this budget continues the assault on educational opportunities for our nations young people by cutting more than 4 5 billion in educational assistance over the next 6 years the republican majority has proposed to eliminate the direct student lending program which provides educational assistance to over 2 5 million students nationwide as well as the goals 2000 program and the state incentive grants program we cannot afford to slam the door of educational assistance on our young people nor rob our senior citizens of their right to adequate health care instead we should continue on the path to balance with a bipartisan budget that rejects the radical

here this morning and i certainly did enjoy the comments of the gentlewoman from texas on gas prices minimum wage and other issues which i am also going to be addressing this hour but i will be addressing them for a slightly different perspective it may surprise the gentlewoman many on her side of the aisle and also many in this audience that the arguments that i will be making today on gas prices on gas taxes on the minimum wage on medicare on tax cuts on a variety of issues are the same exact positions that governor bill clinton took in 1992 but of course between 1992 and 1996 now that it is time to get reelected things have changed every time i walk in here i am very honored to be a member of congress and honored by the history this has been a great experience for me it has been great to visit the monuments to jefferson and to washington and to lincoln and to others who have made great changes in this country i think this is a good decent congress i think it is a noble government i think that many many members try to do their best to make sure that workingclass americans do not suffer because of what washington does but unfortunately for the past 40 years washington has done more to damage workingclass americans than anybody else the gentlewoman talked about the contract with america and talked about the contract with america in very disparaging terms all last year people talked about newt gingrich and the contract with america and in the same sentence talked about how horrible it was i guess my biggest frustration as much as i have loved being in washington dc has been how short some peoples attention spans can be because let us talk for a second about the contract with america let us talk about these items that are supposedly so radical that democrats claim to be so destructive and radical let us have a quick refresher course on what the contract with america was about the first thing it was about was balancing the budget and ending 40 years of waste and abuse 40 years of deficit spending where this congress run by democrats passed deficit budgets for 40 years now of course they had to get a lot of republican presidents to sign those bills i suggest that when we are 5 trillion in debt there is enough blame to go around for both parties but let me say this in 1994 part one of the contract with america was we said enough is enough we are going to stop stealing money from our children and grandchildren i have got two boys ages 5 and 8 who right now have about a 20 000 debt on their head because this government has not had the decency to balance its budgets we are spending so much more money than we have and we are sending our check to our children we are 5 trillion in debt i must admit i am not very good in math that is why i went to law school instead of becoming an engineer and i guess that is why i got in politics i am not good with math i try to deal in images and stories i had an interesting story told to me an interesting illustration to explain to me what 5 trillion meant this is what it means if somebody made 1 million every day from the day that jesus christ was born to today may 2 1996 he would not make enough money to pay off our federal debt let me repeat that if someone made 1 million every day from the day that jesus christ was born until today he would not make enough money to pay off our federal debt it gets worse you can work another 2 000 years making 1 million a day for the next 2 000 years and still be unable to pay off how much we owe by the federal debt democrats think that it is radical and have said that that plank of the contract with america was radical because we wanted to balance the budget in 7 years there are still many here believe it or not despite the fact that we are 5 trillion in debt who are telling us we do not need to balance the budget in 7 years that it is too harsh we are being too harsh on our children it may be too harsh on their political fortunes to finally show a little bit of discipline and stop sending our bills to children and grandchildren but it is not too harsh for an america that wants to take care of their future generations and if you do not really care about children and grandchildren and the 21st century you are just in it for today i will also appeal to your greedy instincts if we follow the first plank in the contract with america and pass the balanced budget amendment and pass those budget deals that we passed it will also cause interest rates to go down 2 percent that causes the economy to explode we passed the first balanced budget in a generation and the president vetoed it he did not like it he said we were moving too quickly he said last year that he has studied it and you just cannot balance the budget in 7 years that is what he said last summer in 1992 he was on larry king live and larry king asked the governor he said governor clinton will the clinton administration if elected give us a balanced budget he said yes larry i will balance the budget in 5 years his 5 years are just about up he did not balance the budget he went back on his word he vetoed the first balanced budget plan sent to a president in a generation and now is claiming once again that he wants a balanced budget facts are stubborn things mr president let those who have ears to hear hear he has changed his position so many times on this issue that it is almost impossible to keep up with him another plank that we had in the contract with america was tax cuts for middleclass americans it is very interesting because we are talking about the gas tax today the former speaker talked about how they wanted to get gas prices down they were trying to figure out how can we get gas prices down what the democrats will not tell us is that they voted for about a 5cent a gallon tax increase which costs this economy billions and billions of dollars the gentlewoman probably thinks raising gas taxes in 1993 was the right thing to do i know the democrats did i know al gore did because remember he cast the deciding vote it was tied 50so in the senate and al gore acting on the presidents behalf voted to pass the largest tax increase in the history of this country in that tax increase was a 5cent tax increase on gas prices the president was not happy about it mind you he actually wanted to pass even more fuel taxes on to the american people in the form of a btu tax but even the liberals said no thats taxing too much today after the president passed the largest tax increase in the history of the country after the president increased gas prices on all americans now the president is fighting our attempts to cut taxes to repeal his tax increase they are saying we are ridiculous for saying this will help workingclass americans that this will help the poor i take out a quote that president clinton made in 1992 when he was running for president again mr president facts are stubborn things you can change your position a million times but we have got them all down on paper this is what the president said in 1992 during his presidential campaign bill clinton said i oppose a federal gas tax increase it sticks to the lower income and middleincome americans and it sticks to retired people in this country and that is wrong facts are stubborn things the president said it was wrong to raise gas taxes in 1992 he got elected and 6 months later he passed gas taxes on to senior citizens on fixed incomes on to workingclass americans that could ill afford to pay more in taxes and on to all americans who woulil have to pay not only at the pump but at the grocery store because when you raise fuel taxes you raise taxes on every item you buy there is a multiplier effect because people have to drive your bread and your milk to the market and these other issues and it causes a drain on the economy a multibilliondollar drain but the president went ahead despite what he said in 1992 again facts are stubborn things let us remember what the president said then and what he said now in 1992 he was running against paul tsongas who made fun of him and said governor clinton you will not cut middleclass taxes and the governor was defiant bill clinton in the new hampshire debate raised his plan and said ive got a plan im going to cut middleclass taxes facts are stubborn things he said that in 1992 in 1993 he passed on the largest tax increase in the history of this country and he passed it with the help of liberals in congress and passed it without a single republican vote yesterday i was on cspan on the morning round table and i had a democrat with me who had voted for that tax increase and was trying to justify the fact that he and the president voted for the largest tax increase in the history of this country he said well republicans voted for it too i said no they did not and he said i will guarantee you republicans voted along with the democrats and the president for the largest tax increase in the history of the country then i pointed it out to him again to check the record and not a single republican voted for bill clintons massive tax increase but i will tell you what we did do because i had a caller call me up and say all you republicans do is talk about what bill clintons not doing what have you done let me tell my colleagues what we did again going back to the contract with america we promised tax cuts for senior citizens we promised tax cuts for workingclass americans we promised tax cuts for business men and women we promised tax cuts for small businesses not irresponsible tax cuts mind you simply tax cuts that would repeal bill clintons 1993 massive tax increase we promised a 3500 per child tax cut that bill clinton vetoed we promised a tax cut for senior citizens because bill clinton in 1993 raised taxes on senior citizens social security checks to 85 percent we promised to repeal that and we did well the president thought senior citizens needed to be taxed at 85 percent so he vetoed our attempt to cut taxes for senior citizens republicans believe that senior citizens ought to be able to work and make money without the federal government punishing them for doing it so we had an earnings limit of 34 000 the president and many of the democrats here did not like that i guess they do not think it is a good thing for senior citizens to remain productive in the work force so they lowered that limit from 34 000 to 11 000 when you make 11 000 the democrats punish you the president punishes you because i guess he does not think senior citizens should be in the work force we repealed that and pushed it back to 34 000 but the president vetoed that also yet today the president can stand in front of the camera and i still have not figured out how he does it but he can stand in front of the camera with a straight face and tell you that he supports tax cuts it is the most unbelievable thing i have seen in my life i have no idea how he does it but he has gotten very good at changing his story every week and acting shocked if anybody calls him on it i talk to reporters around here i talk to people behind the scenes even staffers for the democrats i talk to everybody everybody is shocked how the president and the democrats can just move in so many different directions at the same time it seems to me either you believe that washington taxes too much spends too much regulates too much wastes too much of americas money and gets in our way too much or you do not say what you will about michael dukakis and walter mondale but at least those men believed in something they would tell you where they stood and if you did not like it you could vote against them and americans voted against them well bill clinton cannot afford that to happen and the democrats cannot afford that to happen so they attack this thing called the contract with america when in fact they are attacking a balanced budget they are attacking tax cuts they are attacking regulatory reform they are attacking term limits let us talk about term limits ninety percent of republicans voted for term limits 90 percent of democrats voted against term limits is that radical i do not think that is radical i think we need to limit the terms of people who serve in congress i think that is how we keep it fresh i see a lot of young people in the audience today they should not have to wait until they are 65 or 70 for their member to step aside i think there are visitors up in the audience today in the gallery today that will be members of this congress that need to be members of this congress because the challenges facing us in the 21st century are going to be monumental if the future leaders of this country do not step forward today tomorrow next week next year and the next 5 years we will lose the momentum we have gained through the 21st century the next century will not be the american century the next century will be the asian or chinese century if we do not act now so i support term limits i support younger people coming and infusing this chamber with new ideas on how we save not only future generations but how we save senior citizens i have got to say i have talked about how the president has waffled andchanged his mind on taxes and on the balanced budget and on term limits and on all these other issues i have got to admit something to you i think the most frustrated i ever was was during the medicare debate just mentioning medicare on the floor it is like the electrified third rail of american politics touch it and you die supposedly well we dared to touch that rail last year and if it was not death it was a neardeath experience you heard the president every day coming out shaking his fist and he bit his lip he is real good at biting his lip kind of quivering makes him look really sincere and then he says i will not let the republicans destroy medicare i am going to protect senior citizens well mr president facts are stubborn things in 1993 the president and fist lady of the united states bill and hillary clinton were lobbying to save medicare and the first lady in her testimony said before congress said before a democratic congress mind you we have got to lower the rate of increase in medicare to twice that of inflation the first lady wanted to lower the rate of increase from about 10 percent in medicare spending to approximately 6 9 percent in medicare spending in our plan to save medicare we decided to take it a step further in taking it a step further we said okay we will save medicare but what we will do is cut the increase from 10 percent to 7 2 percent so we will give medicare recipients even more than the first lady suggested in 1993 after we made that recommendation my goodness you would have thodght that this was a radical new idea that nobody had ever thought of before and that we had gone into a cave one weekend came out of the cave with clubs and said how can we stick it to senior citizent but mr president and members of the democratic party facts are stubborn things this proposal is more generous for senior citizens than even the presidents proposal in 1993 and what did the press say about it well there was a silence there was a conspiracy of silence for some time in an article in roll call this morning morton kondracke talks about how a new study shows that 89 percent of journalists in washington voted for bill clinton in 1992 and only 6 percent voted for george bush i really do not care who they voted for i care about how they report the news unfortunately during the medicare debate the way they reported the news for a good portion of the time was onesided and shameful there are notable exceptions and i have got to say one of the most notable exceptions has been the washington post long considered to be an enemy of conservatives the washington post told it straight when they talked about the presidents demagoguery and shameful behavior on medicare the post started with an editorial talking about medagoguery talking about how the democrats and the president were more interested in scaring senior citizens and allowing medicare to go bankrupt than they were in helping senior citizens later they wrote an editorial talking about what they called the real default when this government was close to defaulting they said the real default was the president and the democrats refusal to help senior citizens in fact the terminology was they said the president and the democrats quoting the washington post have shamelessly demagogued on the medicare issue to scare senior citizens because that is where they think the votes are another editorialist robert samuelson for the washington post wrote later in straightforward terms that the president and i am quoting robert samuelson i would not say this on the floor myself but robert samuelson said the president lied on medicare to win votes from senior citizens when the president knew that social security was going bankrupt matthew miller a former employee of president clinton wrote a front page article for the very liberal new republic and the headline was why the democrats demagoguery on medicare is worse than you thought and millers quote was the president has taken the low road on medicare in ways that only the media could call standing tall"],

more than a meanspirited attempt by the majority to destroy the basic health care rights all older americans now enjoy in order to give tax breaks to their wealthy big business special interest buddies never in all my time in congress have i witnessed a greater legislative travesty than the illconceived proposal we have before us today to begin with the rule we just considered stifles any amount of reasonable debate on this legislation for instance with the exception of pap smear testing this bill eliminates quality assurance guarantees that are now in place for patients who have diagnostic or other types of testing done in their doctors office laboratories it probably should not be surprising that the republican medicare proposalwhich bends so close to special interests and tilts so far from the best interests of americas senior citizenswould eliminate requirements for quality and accuracy of laboratory tests this like the republicans blatant and cruel elimination of national standards for nursing homes is one more way of saying to the ill the infirmed and the aged youre on your owngood luck where is the rationale for eliminating quality standards for cholesterol tests colon and prostate cancer screening needle biopsies to detect precancerous conditions glucose monitoring and so on there isnt any equally disturbing is the fact that this republican bill places a sevenyear freeze on medicare payments to providers of durable medical equipment such as wheel chairs electric beds walkers and yes even oxygen now this freeze is at a time when more and more americans are aging and the need will be greater this freeze will cause severe disruptions in the health care and quality of life for sick and or infirmed americans who need their wheelchairs and walkers to get around more easily electrical beds to rest comfortably and oxygen to breath effectively by putting a freeze on oxygen the republicans are literally taking the breath of life out of the bodies of old folk only god has that right i heard a member a few minutes ago say that he was glad that he had made 65 and qualifies for medicare a lot of people qualify for medicare who do not make 133 000 a year as he does and not only that people who use facilities like wheelchairs and the like were among those who are thrown outof the committee by the republican side in the committee on

marie roots lilly valentine gertrude snead ruth thorn edna custis all over age 69 who do not make 133 000 a year the 7year freeze on dme payments once again demonstrates the lengths to which the republicans have been driven by adopting an arbitrary cut of 270 billion in medicare so that they finance a tax cut for the rich in an attempt to protect these medicare beneficiaries i attempted to offer amendments to restore these provisions unfortunately the republicans would not let me let me also address the blatantly undemocratic process by which this proposal which will directly impact the health and wellbeing of 37 million older americans and nearly every family in the nation has been brought forth not one public hearing has been held in which the legislative specifics of the drastic medicare changes we are about to act on were in plain view this is appalling and flies in the face of the legislative process after flagrantly spending the taxpayers time and money without a second thought to conduct 28 days of hearings on whitewater 10 days of hearings on waco and 8 days of hearings on ruby ridge it is crystal clear that the republican party has put partisan politics above the public interest the fact that democrats had to convene hearings on the lawn of the capitol in order to provide a public forum to examine the gop plan is compelling evidence in and of itself that the speaker and his troops know that their proposals cannot stand up to public scru tiny moreover it speaks volumes to the enormous disconnect that exists between the republican party and the rights and needs of older americans today such a disconnect became extremely apparent on october 11 when 13 seniors some of whom were over 90 years old and relegated to wheel chairs came to ask questions about the republican medicare proposal prior to markup by the commerce committee they were promptly arrested and hauled off to jail at the direction of the committee chairman during the democratic lawn hearings however we helped answer the question just what does the republican medicare proposal do it charges seniors more for medical care medicine wheelchairs and medical devices it forces seniors to abandon their own doctors for some uncharted course through the hmo system it takes 270 billion in medicare funding away from seniors doctors and hospitals all to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy in short it devastates the health care program upon which so many millions of americans have come to rely among the many witnesses were several of my constituents from chicago who testified about the devastating consequences of the gop socalled reforms dr william troyer director of external services for the university of illinois at chicago medical center an academic health center which houses the nations largest medical school and serves thousands of 7th district residents gave a bleak view of the future under republican medicare changes to quote dr troyer a gradual weakening and eventual demise of uic medical center will result from the more than 7 billion in cuts to direct and indirect medical education funding proposed by the gop following dr troyer mr lacy thomas chief financial officer of the cook county bureau of health services was equally dismal in his predictions as a safety net provider for the disadvantaged and underserved in chicago the bureau will be unable to deliver basic care for this population due to the total eliminatior of assistance to nonunitedstates medical graduatesgraduates which comprise nearly 40 percent of chicago medical society physicians in addition 8 billion in reductions for disproportionate share payments to hospitals serving the indigent such as cook county will only serve to exacerbate the pain felt by these patients yet i believe the most compelling testimony came from ms irene nelson a senior from chicago who spoke eloquently regarding her fears of the republican medicare cuts she stated it is obvious to me that the people who are making these decisions are completely out of touch with the daily struggles of senior citizens like me i wonder if any of these people have ever been forced to decide between eating heating and paying that outstanding medical i doubt it very much but that is what i and many other seniors out there will be forced to do if the republicans are allowed to cut medicare it is of extreme importance that the american people are provided with this information on the republican plan to gut medicare in the dark of night and leave our nations seniors holding the bag after promising to balance the federal budget in 7 years increase military spending and provide hefty tax cuts to the richest americans in the country the gop is looking for a magic potion to fund these big promises unfortunately the republicans seem to think medicare is going to be the cureall in pushing a package of the deepest medicare cuts in the programs 30year history 270 billion the gop wants to immediately increase the cost of medicare to the average senior citizen by nearly 1 000 and force many to give up their own doctors this is bad policymaking and bad medicine for senior citizens in my state of illinois the proposed cuts will eliminate health care coverage outright for more than 58 000 individuals with disabilities over the next 7 years in addition 23 000 senior citizens will lose coverage outofpocket costs will increase by an average of 3 500 over the next 7 years for each of illinois 1 62 million medicare recipients further illinois will be denied 6 2 billion in federal health care assistance over the next 7 years i am outraged at the efforts of the gop to gut this essential program for no reason other than to pay for 245 billion in tax cuts for the rich it is unnecessary it is outrageous it is wrong as the saying goes you can fool some people some of the time but you cant fool all the people all of the time the vast majority of the american people are not fooled pass these medicare cuts and you will discover that cold hard fact pretty darn quick i urge my colleagues to vote no on h r 2425 lets not take the care out of medicare"],

circus because of everything they want ^ clowns elephants and they could play they could play their pea and shall game in which they are shifting taxes why are we talking about families they are not receiving it because they are not getting the family tax cut it is not this bill fortyfive percent of the benefits in the taxcuts in this bill go to corporations in 10 years the fact is the remaining part that goes to individuals the lions share of that goes to the wealthy you are not doing what you said you were going to do it is the same story through and through in this bill you deny you are proposing the policy deny you are passing the policy and deny the policy after it is enacted it does not take any courage to stand up here and vote for tax giveaways and then put the burden on someone else to do the cutting taking away kids lunches doing things of this nature that does not take courage it took guts 2 years ago to stand here and say we have to pay if we are going to deal with the deficit it is tough work but you are not willing to do that you just want to go down the easy road in terms of this and pass this tax cut and leave the mess for the american people i think this bill

everything they like elephants clowns and they could have been hired to do their bait and switch trick on middieincome family tax cuts the old pea and shell game in which middleincome families get peanuts and in 10 years 45 percent over 300 billionof the tax benefits go to corporate americabig business continuing to shift the tax burden onto individuals and families middleincome america gets the shaft when the wealthy families receive over 53 percent of the individual tax breaks the lions sharethe republican tax measure this might get applause as a trick but this pea and shell republican shift and shaft of middleincome families merits a no vote in the congress today and tomorrow i want to join with many of my colleagues in opposing this illconceived poorly timed legislation for big business and the very rich this bill may very well be the crown jewel of the republican political agenda but for the working families who i represent this republican legislation is a rhinestone a phony gemstone this is a tax shift bill placing over the next 10 years more burden on individuals and less on the big business corporations in fact corporations receive nearly 50 percent of the total tax cuts and today the corporations and big business pay half as much as they did in 1965 this tax shafts the middleincome families who are promised tax breaks this republican bill gives those breaks to the affluent the top income 12 percent get 52 percent of this gop bill tax breaks the republican bill is simply a tax shift and a tax shaft for american working families the rich get richer and working families get republican tax cut rhetoric there are clear winners and losers under the republican bill family households earning over 200 000 will receive an average tax cut of 11 266 per year while working families earning between 30 000 and 50 000 will receive an average annual cut of 569 touted as a family friendly bill the centerpiece of this legislation the 500 child tax credit does not help those families with 34 percent of our children over 24 million children are denied this tax credit since their families income would not be high enough for the credit to apply while many children will not benefit from this tax bill these children will pay the pricetoday and tomorrowthe loss of school lunches reductions in college loans and a 10 year 630 billion reduction in revenues to add to the federal deficit welcome to the republican idea of fairness the shift and shaft tax contract on america many of my republican colleagues talk about this legislation as the reflection of the peoples voice in november i do agree that the american people are angry but they werent angry about the rich not paying their fair share the american people werent angry that the inheritance exemption is only 600 000 the american people certainly are not mad because corporations now must pay an alternative minimum tax but the american people will be yet more angry when they read the fine print of this republican contract they will be angry when they learn that the american family rhetoric has been the vehicle to deliver tax breaks that primarily benefit the top 10 percent of americans their anger will be compounded when they understand that the price of their 500 tax credit will be megatax breaks for big business including a major loophole that will allow some corporate giants to get off without paying one cent in taxes while the middle class gets the bill for the republicans reneging on their childrens education from school lunches to college grants and loans the advocates point to the 189 billion in tax breaks over the first 5 years but this measure is back loaded because in 10 years revenue is reduced 630 billion the majority g o p havent put forth many of the cuts and reductions to achieve such savings and to offset and pay for this revenue loss those limited cuts that have been advanced are grossly unfair unworkable meanspiritedbut none the less most of the republican cuts are masked in budget ceilings not specific and certainly not achieved the republicans said they would cut spending first but they have reneged on that today it doesnt take much talent and certainly little courage to pass massive tax cuts spreading around the tax giveaways to every special interest group on the map no it doesnt take much thought to give away the store republican style and that is what this tax bill does provides instant gratification and a longterm economic bellyache the antifederal government rhetoric has led to a tax cut policy that will disable the federal government render the national government unable to responsibly respond to the needs of our nation this tax policy path coupled with even the limited reductions in spending advanced this session demonstrate a retreat and abandonment of our responsibilities and the people we represent our nation that has achieved unparalleled economic and social statusnot without problems or difficulty but

benefitwhat has been pointed out repeatedly is that this measure tax breaks go to big corporations and the affluent families i urge my colleagues to reject this unfair policy and to just say no to the

legislation and in strong opposition to the illconceived republican tax bill i am opposed to the contract on america tax bill because it is a return to the failed pciicies of the 1980s it provides much for the welltodo and little for the middleclass and it will massively increase the deficit it is also interesting to note that this tax cut bill actualy would raise taxes on federal workers in the 1980s the american people were told that tax cuts for the wealthy would trickle down to the average american they didnt the american people were also told that the deficit would be cut well it wasnt regrettably the republicans are ready to try this experiment again today proponents of the contract tax bill claim it will help the american middleclass well it wont indeed it is estimated that 51 percent of the benefits from this bill go to the top 12 percent of earners for the average family most of us would consider middleclass those making 30 000 to 50 000 would get a tax break of 569 but a family making over 200 000 gets 11 266 if this isnt unfair enough to make someone question this bill the repeal of the alternative minimum tax which president reagan introduced further tilts the balance against working americans the amt ensures that large corporations have to pay at least some tax prior to president reagans introduction of the amt large profitable companies paid no tax and in some cases actually gct rebates for exampe at t got a 636 million rebate even though its profits were 24 9 billion dupont got a 179 million rebate but made 3 8 billon ge didnt get a rebate it just didnt pay taxes for 3 yars between 1982 and 1985 how does li s help midd eclass families not only does the contract tax b l do little for the middleclass it also swells the deficit over the first 5 years the contract tax bill would cost roughly 200 billion which the majority has paid for by cutting child nutrition programs and tightening the caps on discret onary spending however the total cost over 10 years would be almost 700 billion i beieve this is why many in the senate like senator chafee are opposed to the contracts tax cuts if the republicans follow through with their pledge to protect social security and defense spending while balancing the budget this tax bill will require 30 percent cuts in all other domestic programs like student loans transportation and job training cutting the deficit further than we did in 1993 will be a tough job but the contract tax bill makes achieving a balanced budget all the more difficult if not impossib e i would also like to remind my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that they promised to pass specific spending cuts before they passed any tax cuts i know many of my republican colleagues share this concern over the deficit impact of their partys tax bill indeed many of them tried to add a provision to the bill to prohibit tax cuts before the deficit is eliminated however their partys leadership was not willing to support that proposal instead the contract tax bill only requires an annual report on progress in balancing the budget however the democratic alternative requires that all tax cuts would be revoked if deficit targets are not achieved this democratic provision guaranteas that deficit reduction coms before any tax cuts i support cutting congressonal pensions and bdnging them in line with private sector pensions winlich a provision of this bill will partially do however i am disappoinied that this initiative was included in this mistaken tax bill solely for political effect in response i wrote and urged minority leader gephardt to include congressional pension reform in the only amendment allowed by the republicans therefore i am glad that the motion to recommit includes congressional pension reform and i plan to support this motion which requires that the ways and means committee fix congressional pensions however i cannot support fixing congressional pensions as part of this spurious republican tax bill the contract tax bill would a so require the new governor of rhode island to makeup the loss of 280 million in revenues over 10 years rhode island already faces a budget crisis and unfortunately this bill just compounds this problem but rhode islands governor might be lucky compared with new jerseys governor whitman whose state loses 3 billion over 10 years in contrast the democratic alternative provides fair reasonable and targeted tax benefits aimed at helping middleclass families make a productive investment in their childrens education the democratic tax fairness bill provides a 10 000 tuition deduction it expands the number of americans who are eligible for a tax deductible ira which will increase our savings rate the democratic alternative would create new unitedstates savings bond which would help middleclass families save money for their childrens education it would also allow students to deduct the interest on their loans the democratic alternative is geared toward education because education is an investment in our future education means an increased earning potential greater global competitiveness and selfsufficiercy of course there are other pr3posals that the minority leaders substitute might have included but to the alternative b ills credit it maintains deficit reduction as the major focus of congress this debate did not have to be them against us the republicans could have worked with democrats to develop an affordable fair bipartisan tax bill indeed there are many items in the contract tax bill that i support and wish we could have worked together to pass first i am in favor of reducing taxes for families making under 100 000 second i have voted for targeted capital gains tax breaks in the past in order to spur productive investments in jobs not just for wall street billionaires third i would like to see a repeal or modification of the change in the amount of social security that is subject to taxation

country into default quite frankly he is the only person that has talked about shutting the government down but now the day of reckoning has arrived and the speaker has developed a very serious case of cold feet so he is desperately trying to blame the president the fact remains that it is the speaker who put this blackmail scheme into motion months ago take a look at what speaker gingrich was saying in april he said the president will veto a number of things and we will then put them all on this debt ceiling that everyone is talking about and then we will decide how big a crisis that he wants quoting the washington times april 3 1995 in september it was reported that speaker gingrich was at it again continuing his threats and he says and i quote i dont care what the price is i dont care if we have no executive offices and no bonds for 30 days not at this time again the quote i dont care what the price is that says it all does it not well speaker gingrich may not care what the price is because he is not the one who is going to be asked to pay the price of a government shutdown and government default will fall squarely on the shoulders of middle class families in this nation when the speaker gets his wish and the government shuts down the speaker will keep his job he will keep his pay but over 800 000 federal workers will not when the government defaults on its financial obligations again the speaker will have his book royalties to cushion that blow but millions of middle class families will pay the price in higher mortgage payments in higher car payments and in higher credit card payments the blame for this manufactured crisis should fail squarely on the shoulders of newt gingrich and not on the shoulders of middle class families in this country the president is right to say no to a budget that calls for higher medicare payments for seniors as a matter of fact on january 1 it will be a 25 percent increase for this nations seniors higher college tuitions for students and their parents and higher taxes for working middleclass families this is not an agenda that the american people support and in fact it appears the public never did support this kind of agenda for months republicans have been promoting their contract with america by saying that more than 60 percent of the american public supported its policies however we find out from last friday that they had a political consultant whose name is frank luntz and he claimed he tested all of these policies in fact what he did and he was forced to admit this last week that he actually only polled and talked to the american public about slogans about 10 slogans so it turns out that the gingrich revolution is built on the 10 most popular slogans that the republicans could find it had nothing to do with programs there was no testing of how americans would feel about cutting 270 billion from medicare of increasing the payments for senior citizens and cutting student loans it is no wonder that the bumper sticker government of the new majority has worn thin with the american public all the sloganeering will not hide the devastating cuts to seniors to students and to middle class families in this country and in fact what is happening today is the more that the american public understands the nature of this program the more they did like the gingrich revolution as a matter of fact on friday in usa today public opposition to the contract with america was affirmed sixty percent of those polled want president clinton to veto the republican budget as it stands more specifically 75 percent oppose the gops medicare cuts and 74 percent oppose the gops student loan cuts let me just say that the republicans have lost public support for these policies so now what they

will have safe child care when their parents work it cuts ssi benefits to over 680 000 disabled children under this bill state accountability for the death of a child is limited simply to reporting the childs death finally this bill adds to the injuries of abused and neglected children by cutting 2 billion from federal programs to care for these children americans must ask what will happen to these children the result without a question will be an increase in the number of children who go to bed hungry the republican bill will increase the risk of a child in poverty suffering from abuse and neglect and yes the result will be that some mothers who want to give birth to a child will be pushed to consider ending their pregnancy the republican bill is a cruel attack on americas children but it also fails to provide the essential tools needed by parents who want to move from welfare to work a mother who takes a minimum wage job can only do so if she has access to safe child care unfortunately this bill will cut federal funds for child care by 25 percent in the year 2000 this means that over 400 000 fewer children will receive federal child care assistance pennsylvania alone will lose 25 7 million in federal child care assistance funding by the year 2000 that means that over 15 000 children in pennsylvania will be denied federal assistance for safe child care the legislation will result in americas poor children being left home alone mothers who are required by the state to work will no longer be guaranteed child care states that seek to provide childcare assistance will have to make up for federal child care cuts by raiding other state programs or increasing state taxes again the republican bill is tough on children and weak on work it allows states to push a person off the welfare rolls and then count that person toward meeting the republicans socalled work requirement there is no requirement for education training and support services for individuals who need help moving from welfare to a job in fact nearly 10 billion for job trainingprograms have been cut from the first republican welfare plan apparently these funds were needed more to pay for tax cuts for upper income americans the republican plan is not welfare reform it is a cruel attack on children that fails to solve the welfare mess i urge that the house reject the

multitude of legislative provisions which prohibit the environmental protection agency from enforcing current federal law and in doing so preserving and protecting our nations environment i support this amendment for two reasons h r 2099 abuses the legislative process and seeks to achieve harmful policy objectives with respect to my concerns about the process the manner in which some of epas opponents are seeking to handcuff the agency is flatout wrong the appropriations committee should not be including some legislative language regarding epa in its hudva bill these issues must be left to the authorizing committees who have the responsibility to devise environmental protection policy under the standing rules of the house second i strongly disagree with the underlying policy objectives of these legislative provisions in years gone by the republican party has been a leader in environmental protection in fact it was president nixon who created the epa in the first place and the american people have come toagree overwhelmingly they want a healthy environment for the children and their grandchildren and speaking of grandchildrentheres that old adage out of the mouths of babes my grandson jimmy kuhn and his kindergarten class in littleton co were so concerned about changes in the clean water act that they wrote to me and president clinton one line says it all congresswoman dirty water can hurt you too this bill includes an unprecedented number of legislative riders which will severely restrict or even eviscerate the ability of the environmental protection agency to implement key provisions of environmental laws such as the clean air act the federal water pollution control act and the federal food drug and cosmetic act many of these riders have been included in the bill even though there have been no hearings little public discussion and no congressional debate on the issues this is a terrible way to make law and creates enormous uncertainty for business trying to plan the future and make appropriate investments h r 2099 includes riders that stops enforcement of existing programs addressing stormwater runoff the effect on my state alone would be that raw sewage would continue to pour into local waters from outdated or inadequate sewage treatment and collection systems at 281 locations in new jersey stormwater controls would be eliminated for many urban areas the result would be widespread degradation of water quality which would threaten the states 96 3 million commercial fishing and shellfishing industry and 12 1 billion coastal tourism industry stops enforcement of the wetlands protection program my state has worked hard to develop the special area management plan that would provide new developers streamlined wetlands permit procedures in exchange for environmental improvements permits to develop these wetlands will be required with or without this budget provision however this bill would jeopardize the whole project without the project permits would be piecemeal and subject to many more administrative transactions hurting both environmental and developmental interests blocks enforcement of permits to prevent raw sewage overflow the need for continued sewer overflows enforcement is strongly evidenced in the new jerseynew york metropolitan area where there are over 780 discharge points which directly convey untreated overflows to the new yorknew jersey harbor threatens communitysrighttoknow about toxic emissions this rider would stop efforts by epa to make the toxics release inventorya nonregulatory program which requires public disclosure of toxic discharges to the environmentmore comprehensive by including chemical mass balance information which would promote source reduction of toxic chemicals prohibits action to avoid childhood lead poisoning this effeqtively will prohibit epa from issuing rules under recent housing act provisions intended to reduce the likelihood of childhood lead poisoning by requiring certain notices and disclosures to be provided to prospective purchases and renters by imposing certification and training standards for lead removal contractors and by controlling lead levels in dust paint and soil prohibits epa from issuing a tap water standard for arsenica known carcinogenand radon and other radionucleides have we lost our senses unbridled zeal health and safety first rememberarsenic poisons can hurt you too these are just some of the 17 objectionable riders that have been included in this bill these provisions represent a serious threat to the hardfought but welldeserved progress that we have made in cleaning up our environment in the last 25 years in new jersey alone many of these riders would prevent or delay progress in solving some of our highest priority problems in conclusion this amendment does not involve the expenditure of any additional funds it simply allows the epa to enforce the laws that have been enacted for those who want to change the laws lets go through the normal authorizing process the quality of our water air and food is far too important to decide in this type of piecemeal approach moving too quickly on

that thought we should do it a little different way but the idea was that we have to balance our budget for our children and our grandchildren now i want to speak a little bit to why we are dealing with the problem what really caused this reconciliation package for a balanced budget over 7 years we in this country maybe not us maybe our children and maybe our grandchildren are in debt 5 trillion that is a fact my 2yearold grandson owes 187 000 on his portion of the interest on the debt if we continue to follow the lead of mr gephardt we would borrow another trillion over the next 4 years get into the 21st century and start borrowing a trillion every 3 years and next year we would pay more for the interest on the debt than we actually spend on defense and where would it end i think it is pretty clear if we continue to follow the gephadt plan that we are going to end up bankrupt we are going to end up a mess in this country with a standard of living that none of us want for our children there is another option we can follow the lead of the great south american economies and we can start printing a lot of money well we all know what happens there our economy goes to ruin a third option for us might have been to follow the presidents lead and continue to do what we are doing and spend whatever we want to spend with no prioritizing just spend it if we like it and we could get into the 21st century and our children would be paying 85 cents out of every dollar they earn just for taxes just to keep this country afloat now it is my personal opinion my children are doing enough my father paid 1 out of every 50 he earned in federal taxes my son is paying 1 out of every 4 he earns they are doing enough our only alternative then was to do what the people i know in the

260 billion now we start doing what they told me to do start by cutting the spending that is precisely what this reconciliation has done as we talk about more details of our tax return and details of

a better way to get a balmake sense if you are in the hole is anced budget a much better way we the first thing you do to cut your in can do it without touching medicare come no i do not think so but that we can do it without slashing veterans is what the republican budget 350 bil benefits but we have to go after corlion slanted heavily toward people porate agriculture big time like 50 earning over 100 000 a year and the billion cats in their subsidies we are largest most profitable corporations going to have to go after corporate welthat is the republican budget fare and the large most

with medicare we have balanced budget that meets the priorgot to fix it of course they do not tell ities and needs of this country us what the fix is they just tell us exactly how much we have to reduce benefits in order to fix it and we will fig the budget ure out later what it is we are doing it is a little bit like burning down the speaker pro tempore under the village to save it as we did

balance this countrys budget large profitable corporate agriculture how we make congress and the federal undertakings like sam donaldson a government do what middle class famous commentator he gets 75 000 a americans have had to do for over 200 year not to grow sheep on a ranch he years and that is spend only as much does not live on is that essential money as they take in i have got to tell you i believe that this 4 9 trillion debt is one of the great issues of our time it is not just what i believe it is what republicans and even democrats grudgingly alike have to believe because we can talk about every single issue we want to talk about talk about education talk about military issues talk about the environment talk about the infrastructure talk abouthealth care talk about crime control all of these issues are important but if we are spending more money on servicing the interest on our huge 4 9 trillion debt than weare spending on any of these programs then there obviously is a problem about 50 percent of every man and womans income tax is spent on servicing the debt in a few years we are going to be spending more money on servicing the national debts interest than we spent today on our defense bill what does that mean we are burning money we are throwing away more money on interest on this national credit card than we are protecting our children and protecting our shores again it is time that the president comes to the table and says okay i am going to step forward with a plan to balance the budget we certainly welcome him the last speaker on the floor began his speech by saying fiscal sanity has finally penetrated the beltway the president has now come to the table with a balanced budget plan the fact of the matter is fiscal sanity penetrated not only the beltway but this entire country on the evening of november 8 1994 when the republican party was swept into power on both sides of congress where not a single republican incumbent governor congressman or senator from alaska to florida got voted out and where americans stood up and said enough is enough we have been writing bad checks for 40 years it is time for us to step forward and balance the budget we got that message came to washington tried to make a difference the president now claims to have also gotten that message but i have to tell the members it is kind of hard to figure out where he is on this issue and other issues at times let us follow his policy over the past few months he stated out by opposing the balanced budget amendment he worked overtime to kill the constitutional amendment that would make congress abide by the same laws and make congress abide by the same fiscal restraint that middle class americans have had to abide by for over 200 years he said we did not need a balanced budget amendment that we could do it on our own we just needed a little bit of discipline he succeeded in killing the balanced budget amendment which over 70 percent of americans supported what was his next step after he killed the bill and said we could do it on our own he then stepped forward and said i changed my mind this country really does not need a balanced budget right now it would be too harmful then we went to hew hampshire in may and he said he would balance the budget that he would step forward with a plan to balance the budget that it was important then he came back from new hampshire later on in may and said no he changed his mind he really did not need to balance the budget right now then he went back up to new hampshire when he came back again from new hampshire this week he changed his mind again and said yes we are going to balance this budget i have to tell you his budget policy is as confusing as his policy on bosnia and other issues in fact the ranking member of the committee on appropriations a democrat from wisconsin said today in the washington post if you do not like the presidents position on a certain issue just be patient wait a few weeks and watch it will be sure to change i am here today to tell the members that i certainly hope the president does not lose his attention span on this issue that he sticks with it long enough to sit down at the table with congressmen and senators and americans alike and figure out a way to balance our budget we have to do it i have two boys one 7yearsold and the other 4yearsold both of my boys have about an 18 000 debt on their heads already as do all americans because of the 4 9 trillion debt this country is carrying it is time for leadership from washington it is time for leadership from the white house it is time for leadership from congress from the house and senate i certainly hope the president will sit down and debate these issues in the coming months and let us put demagoguery behind us and let us do what is best for the american people that being said i welcome him to the table but at the same time i have some real concerns about some of his proposals the first concern that i have concerns senior citizens the president of the united states several months ago got a report back from trustees that studied the issue of medicare and medicaid it is a dirty little secret in washington dc that medicare and medicaid is going bankrupt the president got a commission working on it the trustees came back and told him mr president if we do not do something about medicare and medicaid it is going to go bankrupt in the year 2002 think about that we will have no more money for medicare and medicaid we will not be able to take care of our senior citizens we will break the sacred contract between generations that we made with our senior citizens if you do not do something to reform medicare and medicaid what did we do congress stepped forward and passed a budget resolution that balances the budget in 7 years and more importantly saves the medicare and medicaid systems makes them solvent they do not go bankrupt by the year 2002 we stood up and said to the trustees we hear you we understand your concerns we cannot allow senidr citizens to go unprotected we cannot allow the poor to go unprotected we cannot allow them to be harmed we are going to step forward with a balanced budget amendment that makes medicare and medicaid solvent beyond the year 2002 and far beyond into the future we did that the president of the united states attacked us attacked us because quite frankly we were following the recommendations of his own trustees save the system then he came out with his budget did his budget follow the advice of the trustees did his budget make medicare and medicaid solvent no it still goes bankrupt think about that i cannot for the life of me imagine running a business and let us talk about running government like we run business i cannot for the life of me think about running a business bringing in my top advisers and saying to them you guys go out you women go out and tell me about the health of our business of our company tell us what we need to do to make sure that we are just as strong 10 years from now as we are today and you send them out you give them money you give them resources you give them time and they come back to you and they say if we do not make these changes this company is going under by the year 2002 in 7 years if somebody came back to me and told me that i would sit down take a long hard look at it and then i would act on it that is something we have done as a congress when we passed the budget resolution unfortunately the president is not willing to make those same steps for the sake of our senior citizens for the sake of our poor who depend on these programs i ask the president of the united states to step forward and show some real courage and show some real leadership dare to make a difference dare to enter into the arena that teddy roosevelt talked about and allow himself to be bloodied if that is what it takes expend a few cents of political capital to help our senior citizens and to help our poor he has not done it yet but i think there is hope he has come forward with a balanced budget proposal so let us see what happens a second concern with the presidents budget is the fact that he says we can balance the budget in 10 years let me tell the members something when we talk about a dirty little secret the dirtiest secret in washington d c is what we do in the out years when it comes to balancing the budget congress says we are going to balance the budget in 10 years then a new congress gets elected a few years down the road they get a little antsy and say we do not want to make these cuts so we are going to push these cuts off 5 10 more years after a while it does not get balanced in 10 years it does not get balanced in 20 years it does not get balanced in 40 years which has happened in washington dc it is just like his 1993 plan to reduce the deficit he had massive tax increases and marginal cuts the tax increases not only did they apply the very next year he applied the tax increases retroactively so he got you coming and he got you going what did he do on the spending cuts those spending cuts were pushed 7 years out pushed to the end of the plan because he knew and cynical politicians around washington dc have known for a long time that if we push the cuts far enough out in the future that new politicians will come to congress and when they come to congress we will not have to make those tough cuts that is the problem with saying we are going to balance the budget in 10 years we need to do it now we cannot go beyond 7 years we need to balance the budget now i certainly hope the president will shorten his timeframe third and i think most importantly for our children in this country i have great concerns about what the president of the united states said about education and education funding as i said before i have two boys my 7yearold is in the public school system in florida my 4yearold will enter into the public school system next year so i have a personal stake in the health and wellbeing of our nations schools in fact if our children are going to enter the 21st century workplace and be able to compete with japan and with germany and other countries that are in the g7 that the president is speaking with today we are going to have to do better we are americans we can do better but we are going to have to make sure and not in washington d c we are going to have to make sure that funding for your childrens education is made in your home town and not in washington d c we are going to have to make sure that funding for your grandchildrens education is made in your home town and not behind some bureaucrats walls in washington d c when the president of the united states says we have to increase spending on the federal level all i can do is sadly shake my head because i know the history of our horrible experiment with the federal department of education i understand that it started out as a back room deal between jimmy carter and the neas teachers union i understand that when it was set up this education bureaucracy was set up in 1980 that we were spending 14 billion a year on our national education bureaucracy today that number has exploded up to 33 billion let us make no mistake of it i have children i understand the importance of education it is at the top of my list on issues that are important in this country however sending 33 billion to washington d c for an education bureaucracy that has failed over the past 15 years simply is not the answer look what has happened since 1980 since we went from spending 14 billion on this new agency to 33 billion in 1995 test scores for reading and writing have plummeted while funding has shot up for this bureaucracy test scores for arithmetic and science have stagnated while funding for this federal bureaucracy has skyrocketed we are not getting the best bang for our buck when the president of the united states says to us that he needs more money for education he is actually saying he needs more money for his washington d c education bureaucracy do not take my word for it i ask you to take that education bureaucracys word for it and read their budget what would you think if you knew that the department of education was cutting 100 million from schools infrastructure programs across the country 100 million this year they say they do not have the money they do not have the money to keep your childrens schools safe they do not have the money to upgrade school systems to make sure that children can go to school in safe schools they say we are too financially constrained right now we are going to have to cut 100 million from the program to keep schools safe then they turn around in that very same budget and say we are going to increase spending by 20 million for our own education bureaucracy which sits a few blocks down from capitol hill in washington d c think about that they are not robbing peter to pay paul they are stealing from our schools in our hometown to pour more money into their education bureaucracy building down the street does that make sense when the president says he needs more money for education and that is how education is defined in washington dc does that make sense when your education dollars and my education dollars are not getting back to our children and to our teachers and to our principals and to our school boards and to our communities and to our hometowns and to our states but instead are strangled in the bureaucracy of washington dc does that make sense is that the type of education policy we need to move into the 21st century to help us compete in the 21st century workplace i do not think so i know you do not think so i certainly know that our founding fathers did not think so i carry with me a copy of the constitution of the united states if you want to know what our founding fa thers thought about education all you need to do is read the constitution of the united states and specifically read the 10th amendment in the 10th amendment it states all powers not specifically given to the federal government through the constitution are reserved to the states and to the citizens what does that mean it means if it does not say it in the constitution that this body that this congress is not permitted to spend money on it is not permitted to interfere in it is not permitted to interfere in the education of citizens children that is why for almost 200 years we got by fine without a freestanding department of education bureaucracy that is why we have gone from spending 14 billion to 33 billion and actually seen a decline in our educational standards have seen drops in our test scores have seen ail increase in violence in schools and have seen an increase in dropout rates when you start measuring those dropout rates with 8th grade students we can do better and we will we are going to start doing better in the coming weeks as we introduce a bill to congress that is called the back to basics education reform act of 1995 is that not really what it is all about getting back to basics moving away from the social engineering that we have been trying to accomplish and that we have failed on for the past 30 years would it not be great to get back to reading and writing and arithmetic and the basics most importantly would it not be great to once again allow parents and allow communities and allow hometowns to decide how to educate their children instead of having bureaucrats in washington dc decide without their input james madison wrote over 200 years ago as he was framing the constitution we have staked the entire future of the american civilization not upon the power of government but upon the capacity of each of us to govern ourselves control ourselves and sustain ourselves according to the 10 commandments of god it was thomas jefferson who said that the government that governs least governs best why did jefferson say that did jefferson say it because he was antigovernment no jefferson said it because he was profreedom because he was proindividual because he was prostates rights because he believed and james madison believed and our founding fathers believed that when you allowed individuals and communities and states to experiment with education reform in the free marketplace of ideas that only the strong ideas would survive that we did not need big brother and big sister telling us from washington dc this is the only way you can educate your children it is timeto move away from that failed vision we have tried it for over a generation now and we are getting nowhere with it we need to move beyond and dare to experiment to dare to give power back to the states and to the citizens where it belongs i believe like many americans believe that we can have 50 state legislatures and governors experimenting with education reform and we will have 50 legislative laboratories where only the strong ideas survive instead of being dictated from washington dc by a bureaucracy that says this is how you do it and if you dont do it this way were not going to send money back to your school communities oh i understand we ripped money out of your communities we took away education funding from your community and brought it up to washington dc but we aint giving it back unless you do a b and c let me tell you something there is a new way to do things and that is to do it the old way the way that thomas jefferson and james madison and our founding fathers intended with the back to basics education reform act we are going to start down that path i ask you when the president of the united states pleads for more education dollars remember he is not talking about education dollars for children he is talking about education dollars for bureaucrats we can do better and we will and we must if we are going to compete in the 21st century"]],

congress serve but considering the chaos that dominates our lives it has not worked well and i therefore support term limits with this thought lets try change even though it may be wrong this reflects my frustration and the frustration of the american people i find it intriguing that this issue which was so evasive during decades of democrat control has incredulously found its way to this house

track criminals who are the most violent the most horrible and the least likely to be rehabilitated criminals who attack children and who are sexually violent predators since the enactment of jacob wetterling states have made great progress in building effective tracking systems to make sure that these criminals are tracked however this legislation does three important things first it creates a nationwide system that will help state and local law enforcement track offenders as they move from state to state second while most states have established or are about to establish tracking systems this legislation will ensure that there is no placeno one statewhere sexual predators can hide and not register this system will track all offenders even if a specific state does not track such criminals finally this legislation ensures that the most serious predators will be registered with law enforcement officials for the rest of their lives this legislation works by requiring all offenders to verify their addresses on a regular basis by returning verification cards with their fingerprints and a recent photograph a nationwide warning will be issued whenever an offender fails to verify his address or when an offender cannot be located there are also tough penalties for offenders who deliberately fail to register i am pleased that we have worked in a bipartisan fashion to
