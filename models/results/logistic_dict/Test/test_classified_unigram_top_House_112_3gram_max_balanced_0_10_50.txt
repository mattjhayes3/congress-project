the global economy they want us to invest in infrastructure build bridges highways clean energy and cut our dependence on foreign oil because when we make it in america thats when america will make it americans can make it cut yes what we ought to cut are the republican giveaways to the big oil companies to the wall street barons to the hedge fund managers who enjoy massive tax breaks thats where the cuts ought to be they ought to be cut out and what of this legislation thats before us we ought to vote no cut what doesnt create jobs for middle class families like republican giveaways to big oil companies and save what actually works like innovation to jumpstart new industries and education to help middle class people get good jobs i therefore rise in strong opposition to h r 2560 the cut cap and balance act this bill is an extreme version of the republican budget plan that would make permanent the dangerous budgetary and constitutional measures that would destroy medicare and medicaid and reduce social security benefits for those who need them the most the bill would also handicap the governments ability to respond to economic downturns and create jobs and it fails to address some of the real drivers our debttax breaks for corporations and the rich and runaway pentagon spending including our misadventures in iraq and afghanistan this legislation is an affront to the very principles of this nation in 1961 president john f kennedy in his inaugural address said if a free society cannot help the many who are poor it cannot save the few who are rich unfortunately it seems that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have no regard for this fundamental american value as the bill they have brought to the floor today attempts to balance the budget on the backs of those with less for the benefit of those with more it attempts to balance the budget on the backs of seniors by taking away their medicare benefits it attempts to balance the budget on the backs of the disabled by taking away their social security benefits it attempts to balance the budget on the backs of lowincome americans by taking away their medicaid and who stands to gain from taking away medicare medicaid and social security benefits special interests and the rich in addition to taking away medicare medicaid and social security benefits h r 2560 would also subvert the federal governments ability to respond to downturns in the economy or special needs including a possible national security crisis during inevitable cyclical downturns it will be necessary to raise the debt limit to stimulate growth by cutting taxes and providing unemployment benefits to help people get back on their feet if theyre laid off among several proven effective measures furthermore in the event of a security threat we have an obligation to act this bill including the proposed balanced budget constitutional amendment would make it nearly impossible to respond to any economic or security

hardest by the economic downturn its really beyond shameful that over 45 million americans including over 16 million children are living in poverty in the wealthiest nation in the world the data also shows a wide racial disparity with the poverty rates for whites standing at 9 8 percent while the rates for african americans and hispanics remain unacceptably high at 27 6 percent and 25 3 percent respectively in 2005 i founded the congressional out of poverty caucus because of the rising tide of poverty some of us saw this unfortunate day coming that was beginning under the failed policies of

those striving and fighting to become middle class and to get into the ranks of the middle class to enhance their quality of life but far too many americans are continuing to suffer joblessness and have dropped out of the middle class and into poverty because of this republican donothing congress republicans in congress have continually blocked efforts to extend and expand vital safety net

states and localities has caused widespread layoffs of dedicated public servants like teachers police officers and firefighters in communities all across the country this attack on our countrys public servants has had a particularly hard impact on communities of color and on women across the country i just have to tell you african americans and women have long found job opportunities in the public sector in public employment african americans in particular often found work with the city or the state because of racial bias and barriers and obstacles in the private sector the american people know that you cant have it both ways government spending cannot kill jobs on one hand when spent on hiring teachers and police officers and create jobs on the other hand and those services are desperately

the equivalent of a unitedstates state supreme court it is authorized to review all final orders judgments and specified interlocutory orders of the virgin islands superior court appeals from the virgin islands supreme court are made by petitions of certiorari to the unitedstates court of appeals for the third circuit federal statute specifies that discretionary review by the third circuit exists for the first 15 years following inception of the virgin islands supreme court or until it has developed sufficient institutional traditions to justify direct review by the supreme court of the united states from all final decisions whichever is sooner the third circuits judicial council evaluates the progress of the virgin islands supreme court in 5year intervals following extensive review the council published its initial 5thyear report last april the council recommends that the unitedstates supreme court exercise direct review of all final decisions made by the virgin islands supreme court h r 6116 adopts the third circuit recommendation the bill simply authorizes the unitedstates supreme court to review at its discretion all final judgments rendered by the virgin islands supreme court the suspension version under consideration makes two technical changes to the bill as introduced first it clarifies that the unitedstates supreme court may review final judgments of the virgin islands supreme court pursuant to cert petitions in other words the unitedstates supreme court may exercise its own discretion to accept or reject cases secondly the suspension version expands the unitedstates supreme courts appellate jurisdiction through an additional reference to chapter 81 of title 28 of the unitedstates code chapter 81 sets forth the jurisdiction and venue of the unitedstates supreme court judges lawyers and litigants look to it when they have questions about the courts appellate jurisdiction the creation of an additional reference to chapter 81 makes it

committee on intelligence under the procedures described in my announcement to the house on wednesday the modified schedule of authorizations is and has been available for review to members for the period of time required by the rules of the house i think this is an important day for the community certainly rolling into the weekend of the 10th anniversary of that tragic event on 9 11 it is important it is crucial that we continue to monitor to improve to provide support for our intelligence services who so bravely around the world and here at home serve to protect the united states of america the bill before us today is a vital tool for our oversight of the intelligence communitys classified activities and is critical to ensuring our intelligence agencies have the resources and authorities they need to do their important work passing an annual intelligence bill is vital to keeping the laws governing our intelligence operations up to date the fy12 bill sustains todays intelligence operations and provides for future capabilities while achieving significant savings the unitedstates intelligence community plays a critical role in the war on terrorism and securing the country from many other threats that we face this bill funds all unitedstates intelligence agencies spanning 17 separate agencies totaling roughly 80 billion the bills comprehensive classified annex provides detailed guidance on intelligence spending including adjustments to costly programs it provides oversight and authorization for critical intelligence activities including but not limited to the global counterterrorism operations such as the one that took out osama bin laden tactical intelligence support to combat units in afghanistan and iraq and other places cyber defense by the national security agency detecting and countering the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction the r d research and development of new technology to maintain our intelligence agencies technological edge including work on code breaking and spy satellites the bill also reflects our tough economic times as well after passage of the budget control act the committee revamped the bill it reported out of committee in may to double its budget savings the bill is significantly below the presidents fy12 budget request and further still below the fy11 authorized and appropriated levels we accomplished this without impacting the mission the savings were achieved through a whole series of joint work and effort by many to merge services and find savings that would bring efficiencies as i said again without impacting the mission of the intelligence services the bill curbs unnecessary personnel growth the cost of additional personnel would squeeze funding for hightech investments which is our competitive advantage in intelligence while the bill denies most of the administrations requested personnel increases it adds some key positions in high priority areas such as cyber defense the bill also promotes major operating efficiencies in a number of areas including data processing it and office leases finding over 100 million in savings this bill also makes only best value investments and shaves 1 billion from a handful of very largeticket hardware items and programs that the intelligence community is involved in the bill protects investments in cuttingedge r d and redirects 500 million of savings to invest in some gamechanging technologies the bottom line is this bipartisan bill preserves and advances national security and it is also fiscally responsible secrecy is a necessary part of our countrys intelligence work so the intelligence committees must conduct strong and effective oversight on behalf of the american people that oversight is impossible however without an annual intelligence authorization bill thats why we stand before you today with a bill that i think this body can be proud of america can be proud of and our intelligence community can take
