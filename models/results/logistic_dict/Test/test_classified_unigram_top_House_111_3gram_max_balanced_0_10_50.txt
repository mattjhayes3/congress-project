last day of school we think the voting is done for this year and yet the work is not done in fact america among other things is suffering from a considerably high level of unemployment and that was going to be the topic for this evening i want to talk a little bit about employment spending and the different theories that people have as to how jobs are created and there are some theories out there that dont work very well and there are some that do work well and history tells us the difference between the two i thought what i might do this evening would be to start with something which in a way may seem remedial it should seem fairly basic because most americans have plenty of common sense and i think that its important though to start at the basic level and start defining your terms as we talk about the problem of unemployment now there are certain series of things i have identified sixthere may be other ways economists might look at it differentlybut there are six things that are job killers to start with we need to understand where jobs come from jobs come from businesses what sort of businesses well if you take a look at businesses that have 500 employees or less those businesses employ about 90 percent of the americans that have jobs in the private sector five hundred or less employees those many people would say are small businesses well what are the things that these small businesses need in order to create these jobs 90 percent of the jobs in america well the first thing is that there are certain things that are killers of jobs the first is economic uncertainty lets talk about that for just a minute economic uncertainty put yourself in charge of a business say you have 100 employees and youre manufacturing some product and you just really dont know whats going to happen with the economy and so there is a level of uncertainty maybe political things are going on which increase your level of uncertainty you dont know whether or not perhaps we are going to go into some kind of economic slump and so what are you going to do if you are a president of a small business well what youre going to do is in the state of missouri they call it hunkering down you say im not going to take a lot of risks im going to prepare for some sort of an economic storm or at least be prepared that im not too extended i dont want to take a lot of risk when there is economic uncertainty and what sort of risks might those be the risk might be to add a wing on your building to buy a new machine to start a new process to patent a new invention and decide to try to produce it and sell it on a market all of those things create jobs but youre not liable to take a highrisk position if theres a high level of economic uncertainty so economic uncertainty is a job killer the next thing is consumption reduction thats a fancy word for saying you got a business slowdown people arent buying as much stuff everybody is worried people are having a hard time economically they are not spending as much money people arent making investments and so your business is going along with all the other businesses around you when you are in a time when there is a recession going on its an economic uncertainty its a form of economic uncertainty i suppose and that is youre thinking hey it used to be last year we had orders for 100 widgets but this year it looks like we are only getting orders for 50 so youre not going to be thinking about getting a machine that will make widgets more efficiently youre not going to be thinking about making investments in adding to the building so you can increase production because youre expecting that youre going to sell less this year than you did because of the fact that there is a slowdown in the economy so a slowdown in the economy tends to affect businesses and therefore affects jobs pretty much common sense i think and then excessive taxation how does that hurt jobs well here is the deal youre again the president of a business maybe you have 100 employees and you find out all of a sudden that your taxes are really going up now if you have a lot of taxes that means you dont have very much choice youre going to have to pay those taxes what is the tax going to be paid with well its going to be paid with the money from your company from the profits and the proceeds of the company that you have and hopefully you have 100 employees youre paying them youre selling product and youre selling product for more than it costs you and so youre making some profits and youre pocketing those profits but now you understand that theres going to be a whole lot of taxation coming down the pike so one of the things that taxation is going to do is take money away from the guy that owns the business and when you do that he doesnt have the money to spend on adding additions to the building or perhaps taking a risk on introducing new products or maybe even inventing some different ways of doing things and so the taxation takes the place of investment that would normally be made in the company when that investment is made that usually results in hiring more people but the hiring more people isnt going to happen if you have excessive taxation in fact we have found historically that if you drive the business owners with enough taxation you can not only stop job creation you can stop the whole business and bring it into bankruptcy and destroy the engine that creates jobs so excessive taxation is a big factor in killing jobs another thing is insufficient liquidity now that sounds like a fancy thing theres nothing too fancy about it the fact is that businesses need money to run on just like the engine in your car needs oil and what happens is the business lets say its a machine shop decides that they want to buy a new piece of equipment that new piece of equipment is going to cost them 5 million well you have got your machinists there in your company but you dont have any 5 million to buy this new piece of equipment but you figured out that if you had that piece of equipment that in a matter of 21 2 or 3 years you could pay for the whole piece of equipment just by the kinds of products that you could make on it so you can say hey this is a great investment i can pay this off relatively quickly but i dont have that million couple million dollars to buy this new piece of equipment so what do you do well youre going to have to go out and a get a loan and when you take a loan youre going to pay interest on that loan but then you get that piece of equipment in and its running just beautifully for you you get all those orders you make these parts and pretty soon you pay off the piece of equipment how did that happen it happened because you were able to borrow money which people call liquidity and you can borrow money and get that tool or whatever it was when you did it you hired a few people to run the new piece of equipment and of course you created jobs if you do not have that liquidity if you cant borrow money that you need then what happens well then you cant buy the new pieces of equipment and guess what youre killing jobs or the potential for creating jobs another thing is excessive government spending oh now wait a minute now how can the government spending affect jobs in america well it turns out that there is an effect indeed and what it is is when the government spends a lot of money it has to get that money from somewhere guess where the money comes from the private sector where does the money come from from taxes and so as the government tries to collect more and more money to appease its appetite for spending what happens is that affects liquidity and it plays out as taxation and so as the government does a whole lot of spending you find that it tends to kill jobs now it may not appear to kill jobs in the short term if the government does a whole lot of spendinglets just say the government decides to spend 150 billion we just decided to do that a few hours ago here on the floor 150 billion for son of stimulus this is stimulus jr ministimulus 150 billion stimulus still real money to most people and real money to the unitedstates government although you wouldnt know it by the way we spend it today by the way we did a pretty good job of spending money we spent about 1 1 trillion today but ministimulus was just 150 billion still a lot of money and that government spending lets say you go out and hire a whole lot of people well wouldnt you create jobs congressman akin well you would in a temporary sense you could put some people on a government payroll but what economists have found is that when you temporarily hire someone from the government what youre doing is youre taking money out of the economy through this government spending in fact what happens is for every one job you create in government youre taking 2 2 jobs out of the private sector so its one of these things where it may seem like youre doing well its a little bit like drinking salt water youre getting a drink but the salt makes you even more thirsty than you were before so its kind of very much a losing proposition when you start to get into this excessive government spending and then the other thing of course is excessive government mandates and red tape we have a picture here that my staffer found of some poor ceo buried in red tape all kinds of memos pieces of paper and all kinds of regulations i think that your common sense will show why this is a problem because lets say particularly youre a small business well you have a certain number of employees those employees you have them working right away making product that you can sell because you have a clean lean and efficient process and you dont have very many people that are management people just a few people to try to keep an eye and organize things and get some orders in the door and all of a sudden somebody from the government knocks on your door knock knock knock and says hey you didnt fill out such and such form and somebody else knocks or calls and says you didnt fill out this form you didnt fill out this form did you do this have you applied for this did you get this and pretty soon you have all kinds of employees and what do they produce they produce paperwork paperwork for whom for the government and so if you get more and more red tape and excessive mandates obviously that is one of the things where you may seem like youre creating jobs but in effect youre making the business less efficient so it cannot grow and really put those good producing jobs on to the payroll in a sense those are like excessive government spending because theyre really government jobs that in fact tend to get rid of the actual productive private so all of these things all of these conditions kill jobs so if the federal government wants to create jobsfirst of all we have to understand something the federal government cant create jobs the whole concept of stimulus is a false assumption the only thing the federal government can do is create the conditions so the people in the private sector can create the jobs we can create an environment that is helpful in producing jobs but the federal government when it tries to hire people all that does is take jobs away from the private sector so all of these things are job killers so lets go in a more positive light and say well what do you do to create jobs well just the reverse of these things and that will tend to create jobs in fact you might even have some trouble in a couple of areas but youre doing very well in some other areas and you could create some jobs this whole bit about the problem with unemployment in america is not really that complicated when you understand that the jobs come largely from these 500employee and smaller size companies and that theyre created by the fact that those companies and the owner of those companies have enough money they can invest in their company and can do the new processes innovation and the ideas that americans are so great in doing thats what makes the economy strong and thats what makes jobs now we have here a cartoon we have the president here speaking to a small businessman and the president is saying here now give me one good reason why youre not hiring and what do we have coming into the china shop well we have three big bulls one is the health care referendum there is capandtrade or capandtax and then another is a war tax well the point here in a cartoon form obviously the bulls are not going to have a good influence on the china shop and the president doesnt seem to get whats going on with the businessman hes not looking too excited about a good reason for why youre not hiring with these guys coming in the door now lets take this back to what we were just talking about health care reform health care reform was going to introduce probably at a minimum 1 trillion worth of spending or close to it so what happens if the government does a whole lot of spending well theyre going to do a whole lot of taxing guess who is going to be taxed with several different types of taxes to pay for socialized medicine well it was going to be the small businessman so now what have you done relative to our chart here when you have the senateand the house has already passed this 1 trillion socialized medicine bill that has all these mandates on small businesswhat have you done in terms of jobs when you pass this socialized medicine well first of all you are creating economic uncertainty because the bill hasnt passed we dont quite know whats going to happen so there is uncertainty there is also the slowdown in the economy which of course is not helped by a tremendous level of spending and debt excessive taxation of course the taxation in the socialized medicine bill is going to fall very heavily on these small business owners if you take their money away and force them to provide all this health care theyre going to have an incentive one to get rid of employees because they cant afford them anymore because the health care is so expensive for them so theyre going to figure out ways to get rid of employees not hire them and what theyre going to do because of the excessive taxation is theyre not going to be investing in new equipment so its going to be a job killer that was what one of these bulls is and then capandtrade or capandtax here bull number two that of course is the large tax that was going to be part of the solution to global warming and were going to talk about that a little bit too but that also had a very very large tax associated with it not only did it have a very big tax to increase the cost of energy it had a very large tax in terms of red tape in fact i suppose that the red tape and the amount of additional federal authority to regulate anything in the energy area including even how individual american citizens houses are builtthat is building codes at the federal level building codes regulating how you build your house and whether it has the proper carbon footprint or green footprint all in this bill with not only the largest tax in history but also a great deal of red tape these are all things that hurt jobs and so should we be surprised that were getting a high level of unemployment we should not be surprised we are breaking all the basic laws here is the first stimulus bill we were told last springlate spring and early summerthat we needed to pass a 787 billion stimulus bill and what was the idea of the stimulus bill the idea of the stimulus bill was that government is going to spend a whole lot of money and by spending money the economy is going to be better now that entire premise is suspect if the economy was going to be better by us spending money we would have one of the most robust healthy economies in the whole world we wouldnt have any unemployment we would be going gangbusters if federal spending was the thing that was going to make the economy good but most people with a little common sense if your family budget is in trouble the thing youre going to do is not run down to the local store with your credit card and stack up a whole lot of debt and spend like madunless youre a little bit nutty or had too much to drink but anyway we were told that the thing to do is weve got to pass this 787 billion stimulus bill and we were told if you dont pass it do you know whats going to happen america and you congressmen that are representing americans if you dont pass this stimulus bill you may see unemployment go up to 8 percent if you dont pass this stimulus bill so this is the presidents forecast of whats going to happen if we pass this stimulus bill right here you see this is 8 percent unemployment and he says were going to keep it under 8 if you just get this 787 billion into our hands to spend without the stimulus he said this is whats going to happen if you dont pass the stimulus its going to do this first the red line here is what has actually happened is this red line a surprise no it wasnt a surprise at all i stood here on this floor 6 months ago with similar charts and said this stimulus isnt going to work is it because im very smart or brilliant no its not at all its simply because i know a little bit about history i know what will and i know what will not work if the democrats had known something about history they would have at a minimum learned something from a fellow democrat this democrats name was henry morgenthau he was franklin roosevelts treasury secretary and he appeared before the house ways and means committee right here in congress in 1939 now we have some old people in congress not too many people probably remember henry morgenthau but they could know something about history and about franklin delano roosevelt and here is what henry morgenthau said after 8 years of spending money on thisits called keynesian economics henry morgenthau was a close buddy and associate of little lord keyneshe was a strange little fellow that british manand came up with this idea that we could stimulate the economy by spending money and so they went at it hammer and tongs stimulating away spending lots of money at the end of 8 years this is how well it works henry morgenthau appears before the house ways and means committee we have tried spending money we are spending more than weve ever spent before and it does not work thats pretty straightforward english weve been spending money more than we ever did before and it doesnt work i say after 8 years of the administration we have just as much unemployment as when we started and an enormous debt to boot and so its not rocket science to see that this idea of spending 787 billion that we dont have its not rocket science for us to be able to stand here 6 months ago and say hey we hope it works but its not going to work it has never worked in history before its a lousy solution its going to make the problem worse we said all of those things dozens of people stood on this floor and said those things and its not because theyre so smart its just because we understand the basics of what it takes to make jobs and the thing that kills jobs is too much government spending now i will say about the stimulus bill that we put in place it would have made henry morgenthau very uncomfortable because it wasnt even traditional oldfashioned stimulus oldfashioned stimulus is like making highways or building hydroelectric plants or hard job creation this thing was more an expansion of wealth here it was giving money so that organizations like acorn could apply for community organizing and a lot of things that really were never going to create jobs in the first place or if they were they were government jobs and those things the result has been look weve got unemployment by the time you get into the latter part of this year up in excess of 10 percent not 8 percent but 10 percent unemployment and thats not a big surprise and so today what did we do we passed ministimulus little brother to big brother stimulus this was only instead of 787 billion 150 billion today and did we learn anything from our experience no nothing at all apparently i think it was einstein who said that if you repeat the same thing over and over again expecting a different result you may just be crazy and thats what we have done today we came up with a junior stimulus bill and we passed it on this floor and the people who voted for it were the democrats they were a little reluctant in voting for it because it didnt work very well the first time when they did the stimulus and theyre not so confident that its going to work again so what are we looking at in terms of obamapelosi spending well youve got the second half of the wall street bailout here 350 billion then youve got this economic stimulus thing that has not worked that we said it wouldnt work it doesnt work it will never work and yet they spent 787 billionwell they havent spent it all theyre just slopping it into other government programs and then youve got the schip and then the appropriations another 410 billion over there imf bailoutthat chart is wrong its probably about 110 billion and then the house got really excited about doing some really serious spending and they passed this capandtax which is that global warming bill and that waslet me see what the number on that is here get the chart turned aroundthat was 846 billion the reason on this chart that thats a little hazy is because the senators werent brilliant enough to go along with this 800 billion capandtax or capandtrade bill now this is going to extend a huge government net over the energy business and it was probably worse in terms of red tape and government than it was in terms of its tax now the ironic thing is that im an engineer and the thing about this bill thats particularly frustrating is that it doesnt appear that there is a consistency between the stated purpose and what the bill does lets assume for a minute that global warming is an imminent threat its something that we need to spend billions of dollars on that sometimes people dont call it global warming anymore because it isnt clear that the planet is warming and so they call it climate change but anyway the theory runs along the lines that there are these various organic kinds of pollutants particularly c02 carbon dioxide thats the bubbles in soda pop and the theory runs that if mankind makes enough of this co2which we make by burning carbon or burning coal or burning gasoline or diesel or whatever we make co2 and if we make enough of this what happens is the co2 then reacts with other kinds of effects particularly water vapor and clouds in the atmosphere and they amplify the effect of the c02 and the sun warms it up and the climate gets hot and melts down thats the general idea now lets just assume for a moment that that were true and that it were a bad thing for us to make co2i dont believe that thats entirely true some of that is true but a lot of its not but lets just say for instance that we really did believe co2 is a big problem and we needed to spend billions of dollars do we need to give the federal government all this regulatory authority over building codes how you put a wing on your house and all this kind of stuff the answer is of course its not necessary at all lets say that instead what we wanted to do was to reduce the co2 in america reduce the co2 by the amount of all of the passenger cars that drive on the highways in america lets say thats our objective just to start with were worried about c02 we want to basically make it so that it was the equivalent from a generation of c02 of turning off all of the american passenger cars on our roads in america that would be a pretty ambitious goal if you were worried about c02 that would be a pretty good place to start maybe how would you possibly accomplish something like that well the fact is you could accomplish it relatively easily for much much less money than what is here and with much less government regulation what you would have to do would be to simply take the coalfired plants that produce 20 percent of americas electrical output and replace them with nuclear plants currently 20 percent of the electricity in america is produced in nuclear plants if we were to go from 20 to a little over 40 percent in nuclear generation we would eliminate the co2 from effectively every passenger car in america that is not that complicated and the nuclear plants are pretty efficient over time they would probably prove to be not much different in cost than the coalfired plants are but that is the question is that really the objectiveto get rid of c02 or is it that we just want more taxes and government control ive become a little cynical because the engineering solution to this problem is not where the legislation went in the house then of course weve got this other thing here its a little bit of a sidetrack the bottom line is if you make energy cost expensive and if you tax people a whole lot for energy what is that going to do to jobs its going to get rid of jobs so everything weve been doing hereeverything we are doingis killing jobs and we cant seem to understand why the small business cant make the jobs now we go on to the government health care proposal passed here on this floor not so long ago what is the price tag on that well even with a little bit of financial hocuspocus it is still up there in terms of 1 trillion we spent 1 1 trillion today but some of it was for the appropriations for the defense of our country to add to this big socialized medicine bill to add 1 trillion more on top of all of these other things is going to bury our economy well now wait a minute congressman akin arent you overstating your case i mean you are a republican and it seems like youre bashing those democrats for overspending under the bush administration didnt you spend too much money well lets just take a look at that question the worst deficit of the bush administration occurred in 2008 under the pelosi congress that worst deficit was 455 billion now that was a bad deficit 455 billion maybe even a more effective number to ask is what was that deficit as a percent of the gross domestic product of america thats a way of looking at that number that was about 3 1 percent which is actually fairly common as you look back over a number of presidents who did that kind of spending anyway that was 2008 under a pelosi congress bushs worst spending 455 billion what happened this year under a pelosi congress and president obama instead of 455 billion it was 1 4 trillion thats more than three times more than bushs biggest spending i wasnt fond of his biggest spending and people who know my voting record know i did not support some of the costly elements that were there this year were three times over what we were with bushat 1 4 trillion what does that do to our deficit as a percent of gdp we go from 3 1 to 9 9 percent of our debt to gdp which is by the way the highest level since world war ii so this track record here doesnt make a lot of sensebillions and trillions of dollars well what does this all mean if you put it in context what were saying here is this year there was three times more spending than bushs most aggressive spending were making bush look like ebenezer scrooge with the level of spending this year what does that spending do of course it affects unemployment it affects jobs because that spending has to come out of the pockets of american taxpayers some of those pocketsin fact some of the deep pocketsare the people who own the businesses who can no longer do the innovation and make the improvements to create jobs that is a very very serious problem you have to say that this is a new era of irresponsibility the national debt of the united states at 16 17 trillion so in other words have we been spending too much money yeah we sure have but this year has been a regular budget buster and that is of serious serious concern of course in the long term we have the concern with medicare and medicaid growing over time absorbing more and more of the budget there is a certain level the american economy can sustain in taxes if you raise the taxes higher what happens is that the economy suffers so badly that you dont actually collect any more money from the government and that overtaxing is pointed out by a guy by the name of laffer he had a thing called a laffer curve its an interesting idea you think well look we really want to spend all this money because its really good to take care of global warming and to pay for everybody and to give them all free health care with a socialized health care system and weve got to do this because this is all kinds of additional money that were schlepping around and giving to different people weve got the wall street bailout weve got to pick winners and losers and so were going to be having to spend this wall street then as people come back and pay back some of the wall street now what were going to do is turn that money around and give it to other businesses so now the government is playing in the private business if wed had a president whod fired the president of general motors a number of years ago that would have raised some eyebrows indeed so when we get done with all of this the problem is that it is creating unemployment its a problem of jobs it gets back to these things here which are just awfully simple but theyre inflexible immovable kinds of facts and that is when you follow the policy that weve been doing which is first of all were increasing red tape and government regulation were engaging in excessive government spending unlike anything that has ever happened before in our history we have a problemand i havent talked about thisof insufficient liquidity this is also a problem weve got about a perfect storm going on for small businesses in america here is what has happened the federal reserve doesnt actually print money but they call it printed money theyve increased the liquidity in america and they did that by a factor of 10 last year in other words if you look at a chart of the amount of ml money supply it runs along up and down like a saw tooth and all of a sudden we get to last year andboom excuse me i think it was the end of last yearthis yearand the thing jumps by a factor of 10 so the federal reserve created all of this money boom it printed a whole lot of it and thats available at a very low interest rate and the big banks have access to that the question is does all of that liquidity get down to the small business man because if you could get that liquidity into the hands of the small business man and if you could knock his taxation back all of a sudden presto zingo youve got the formula to get the economy back chugging and churning its not the government that is going to fix the economy its american individuals its the free enterprise spirit of americans its the people who love freedom who have the ingenuity who say theres a better way to do this i think i could do it i think i could build my own business and i could make a living for my family this way these people have the courage to take the risks to put the equipment together to put the systems together to put the inventions together america grows one dream at a time they are the people who pull us out of recessions and it is those people who we are hurting with excessive taxation as to this liquidity thing the problem now is that the small businesses cant get their hands on money at a reasonable interest rate here is what happened that liquidity that the big bank has trickles down to the little bank and the little bank gets some of it all of these federal regulators are running around and the bank is saying man i am not going to loan money to any small business unless i know its a slam dunk theyre going to pay me back because im already skating on a very thin edge ive got a lot of assets that my bank owns that are not too strong and im afraid theyre going to shut me down and that my bank is going to go out of business so i am not going to loan money very easily to just anybody who comes down the pike when you do come down the pike and want to borrow money ill tell you what im going to charge you a pretty good interest rate on that money so what happens is the small business man is already intimidated because of the threats of all of these taxations that are coming along and the economy has slowed down he has got economic uncertainty he has got a slowdown in the economy hes getting excessive taxation now i havent even talked about all of the taxes hes facing first of all the bush tax cuts are expiring so the death tax is coming back the dividend tax the capital gains tax all of those are coming due because those tax things are expiring and theyre coming back resetting at a higher rate so the small business man sees the death tax capital gains dividend taxes now hes seeing the other taxes we talked about which are socialized medicine energy taxes and capandtrade what other things has he has got coming he has got these taxations coming now with that hes thinking oh my goodness im not too sure i really want to borrow anything even if he does get the courage to borrow something because he has to hell go to the bank and the bank will say ah before i was giving you a couple percent interest on those loans it was a 3year a 5year loan for your business now im going to need to get a little more interest from you i think about 4 or 5 or 6 percent is what i want now all of a sudden the small business man even if he qualifies and if he has a solid strong business its going to be harder for him these days its increasingly harder for him to get liquidity so aside from the taxation excessive government spending aside from the red tape and mandates the economic uncertainty and the slowdown now hes also getting hit with the problem of liquidity this is fairly close to a perfect storm for small business so guess what were not very surprised that unemployment has been going up now do we have any good news its always nice to have a little bit of good news somewhere until we fix these things or at least a number of them you are not going to hear much about good news people can say oh the stock market is fine and everything is going well weve hit the bottom everybody looks at these things like theyre cycles that repeat it doesnt have to be a cycle you know fdr managed to take a recession and turn it into a great depression because he did the wrong things we can follow in his footsteps but we dont have to the point is we dont have to follow keynesian economics we dont have to do all of this tremendous level of spending and taxation its not necessary its not what the republicans are proposing we know it wont work and we have learned from morgenthau and we have learned from other people as well what is the solution well actually its kind of interesting one of the people who learned the solution was jfk a democrat what he did was what well he cut taxes oh my goodness a democrat cutting taxes yeah jfk actually did we had a recession he understood that businesses have to have some breathing room so he cut taxes guess what the economy improved then ronald reagan comes along ronald reagan had the same basic idea he said hey weve got a bad economy how can we ever compete with the soviet union when our economy is all in trouble so what did he do he had a huge tax cuttwo or three times what george bushs tax cut was everybody called it trickledown economics and made fun of ronald reagan for about a year or so until the economy turned around and took off like a horse and it pulled us on ahead he continued to spend money on defense he bankrupted the soviet union the berlin wall fell down and the western world was freed from the threat of an aggressive marxist communist regime that was bent on taking over the free world this is all because he understood these basic principles so who is it who has given us the model jfk ronald reagan and also president bushthe last presidentall understood this principle youve got to get off of the taxation and big government spending here is the funny thing that is interesting it was called sometimes supply side economics people made fun of it but here is how it works and you can see in your own logic how it would be lets say somebody appointed you to be king for the year and that your job was to raise money for your little government and your kingdom and that the only thing you could do was tax loaves of bread people in your kingdom liked to eat bread they bought loaves of bread so you had the power to tax them on loaves of bread well you start thinking in your own mind how would you do that well you might say first of all well i could put a penny a loaf on the bread and i could collect a certain amount of money you could figure out how many loaves of bread are sold at a penny apiece you could figure out some revenue then you get to thinking you know ill bet i could raise more money for my little kingdom if instead i put a 10 tax on every loaf of bread then youd think wow that would be a whole lot except what would happen is people wouldnt buy as much bread so i really wouldnt get as much tax as i first thought i would so as you play with this back and forth in your mind you come to the conclusion that there is an optimum point where if you raise or lower the taxes you will get less tax revenue well thats the thing that ronald reagan jfk and bush ii understood they understood that if you get off the taxes the government can actually take in more money than they would have taken in if the taxes were higher it sounds like making water run uphill but it isnt as you think about the loaf of bread you think wait a minute you can tax something so much that no one will buy it anymore and youll basically stall the economy what happened when bush was faced with a recession when i first came to congress in 2001 he was criticized roundly for this after a little whilei guess it was about 2003he got around to this he reduced dividends capital gains and death taxes now those things affect the guys that own these small businesses when he did that almost immediately what happened was government revenues went up even though the taxes rate of taxation went down well how in the world could that be its this same principle it was called the laffer curve it was first published i think by art laffer an economist the solution to this doesnt mean that americans have to sit around with no jobs and suffer tremendously with a lousy economy the solution is available the solution has been used time after time in american history the thing that we are doing now has also been used to turn a recession into a depression what we have to do is stop spending too much money its not very complicated the same thing you would do in your family budget you cant say that you are fiscally responsible criticize george bush for creating all of these problems when his highest level of spending at 455 billion is less than onethird of what we have just spent in this year at 1 4 trillion when we get the ratio of debt to gross domestic product higher than its been since the second world war you know something is wrong and it is not that complicated this whole idea of employment and what makes jobs is very straightforward what i hear the democrats frequently doing is beating on their drum we are going to tax that old rich man we are going to get the rich man we are going to take his money away from him and give it all to other people well the only trouble with that is the trouble with socialism is sooner or later you run out of other peoples money guess who it is you are going to tax if you say you are going to tax the rich man some of those rich men are the guys that own these companies the men and women the entrepreneurs who own the companies many times the amount of profit that the company makes is like their profit they plow it back into more jobs now if you tax those people out of their hides guess whats going to happen they dont have any money to reinvest in their company and you kill jobs you cannot separate the people that run the business and the jobs they are not separable if you really want jobs you have to have employers you cant have employees with no employers if you tax the employers too much then they cant have employees its not that very complicated yet what we hear constantly is all these fat cats we are going to run the tax up on these welltodo people well as it is today you might be amused to know that 50 percent of americans pay about 1 percent of the tax revenue in america fifty percent of americans pay about 1 percenti believe my numbers on that are pretty close to right you could also say that a very very large percent of taxes are paid by a very small percent of americans now if you drive that too hard what happens again is you squeeze the small business and the wheels come off the tracks thats what we have been doing and we have not been making the situation better its not complicated we can fix it but we cant fix it with what we did today today the democrats decided to increase the debt ceiling another 300 billion they decided to spend money on the defense of our country which i supported and voted for but also another 150 billion in this stimulus kind of thing which didnt work before and we know its not going to work again we are not using the right approach we are not going back to the basics of how jobs are created what we are doing is we are spending americans money not just our own money not just our kids money our grandchildrens money at this kind of rate we cannot afford these kinds of programs in the condition of our economy we can right the economy theres things that can be done to fix it theres a great deal that can be done with health care even if you believe in global warming and it is a high priority to spend billions of dollars on it even if you believe that there are a whole lot of better solutions and a whole lot of government redtape and taxes you can move to the nuclear model which is going to reduce c02 significantly this economic stimulus we saw how effective that was thats the thing that we are claiming we are going to keep our unemployment below 8 percent and here we are closer to 10 now of course the wall street bailout this was a failed idea from the start it was sold to the congress that the entire american economy was going to collapse that there was going to be sulfurous smoke billowing out of the earth there are going to be hail storms and brick bats falling from the sky if we didnt come up with 700 million in unmarked bills and we wanted it in a big hurry because we made a big public announcement the stock market is watching you congress congress obliged i think it was a bad decision they passed that stimulus bill now we have got politicians running around inside the private sector deciding on the salaries of private employees the recent bill that we passed here just last week gives the federal government the authority to regulate financial transactions and at least in theory could give them the power to determine the salary of a bank teller do we really think that thats a job that congress and the federal government can do efficiently is to determine the salary of people in private industry is that what we really want our government doing do we trust our government to be telling us whether we can put an addition on our house and we have to prove that the carbon footprint of our house is just right to be able to allow us to put an addition on our house do we need to have a energy taxed a whole lot more when the economy is in the condition it is now is this threat of global warming whichby the way a whole series of emails and electronic files were released from the scientific university in england that is the center for collecting all the data on global warming it found that these scientists had been fudging the data what they found was in fact that they were very less than professional and had been doing everything they could to quash any article appearing in a journal that would question the absolute rigid science that global warming was an imminent disaster on this planet well when the evidence of the fact that the data had been doctored that they had been intentionally trying to quash the opinions of dissenters trying to say that its settled scienceits nothing settled at all what these emails revealed in east anglia but that was kind of dubious science all the way along the question is is that as important as our dependence on foreign oil i am not so sure that it is even if it is theres a solution to that which is replacing coalfired carbonburning plants with nuclear plants france has 80 percent nuclear generation if we went to 40 we would equivalent get rid of the c02 from all of those passenger cars this is not the approach we have been taking the whole wrong economics of what we have been doing is wrong thats why people are feeling pain they are feeling unemployment thats why people cant make their mortgage payments thats why people are having to move in with their parents and all kinds of other sacrifices are being made thats a tragedy because this is something thats not that complicated its something thatthere are models that show us what we should be doing in government the republican party has proposed all of the things that i am talking about in solutions that is in terms of health care are we saying there isnt something that should be done of course there are things that should be done in health care if you have got a problem with the plumbing in the kitchen sink it doesnt mean you remodel the entire kitchen thats what the democrats have proposed in socialized medicine the government could take over all of health care you dont have to do that but there are things that we can do to improve the situation and can build on what we have we have a very very good health care system in terms of delivery the payfor piece of it is broken and its because about a third of americans dont pay anything for their health care no wonder that starts to create stress in the system there are things that we can do to improve the efficiency and the way our health care system works but it doesnt mean scrap the whole thing and give it to the government in each of these areas there are good proposals ways to solve these problems when we are talking about jobs and employment we have to remember what the basic principles are the basic principles are those small businesses have to be healthy and they are never healthy when we spend too much money when we create too much redtape and when we tax too much and also when we dont get the right rules in terms of liquidity i heard on the floor here not so long ago the democrats saying that this entire recession is the fault of george bush of course he is the one that brought the hurricaneits always convenient to find somebody to blame but whats to blame in this recession whats to blame in terms of job losses well its these things here anybody who has ever run a small business you can check these with anybody who has a friend talk to somebody who runs a small business ask them is economic uncertainty a problem in terms of creating jobs oh yes yes slowdown in the economy yes that makes me concerned excessive taxation oh yes you are going to tax me a whole lot we have got this thing called a death tax the death tax the way it works is when it goes back into effect in 2011 or 2012 lets say you have got a business maybe its a farm you have got the thousand acres and dad is running the farm dad dies and passes the farm on to his son the government says well your dad died so we are going to tax you well how come you are taxing he already paid his taxes yes we are going to tax him again its a double taxation and we want 45 percent of the value of the farm the son says well that means i would have to sell half the land from a thousand acres and go to 500 i would have to get rid of half of my tractors and combines and other equipment the farm really wouldnt work at 500 acres it needs a full thousand acres sorry bub you owe uncle sam the death tax what that does is what it kills small business when you do that death tax these are things that people know you just cant do this and expect to have a strong economy thats where we have been making some mistakes unfortunately this last year these mistakes have come home to roost you could say well this is bushs mistake because he got the whole economy messed up in the first place well lets go back to that record lets go back to that conservative newspaper the new york times on september 11 september 11 2003 the new york times reported first of all that president george bush was worried about what was going on with freddie and fannie freddie and fannie had apparently lost a few billion dollars didnt know where they had put it that said these financial institutions that were quasipublic the implication was that the government would be in the bag if something went wrong with freddie and fannie he is quoted september 11 2003 in the new york times saying that congress needs to give him authority to regulate freddie and fannie more in a matter of a year or two we here in the house it was a republican house at that time passed a bill to give the president authority to get into freddie and fannies finances and to regulate them more because they were out of control the bill went to the senate as you can expect but it was killed by the democrats in a filibuster on the floor it never saw the light of day it was never passed so it was that freddie and fannie failing along with other parts of that real estate market which was created by laws that we had made saying that banks had to make loans to people who couldnt afford to pay them and also this wild speculation that came from a very very low interest rate and a lot of liquidity created by greenspan you put that all together and you get a bubble in the real estate market the bubble pops and things come apart now you could try and blame that thing on bush but it really wouldnt be accurate to do that he saw at least in 2003 that we were in trouble and recognized we should do something about it its easy to try to blame problems that are created by overspending and overtaxation on the republicans but the fact of the matter is this congress has got 80 democrats more than it does republicans this is not exactly what you call a republican control of the congress or the house over in the senate the democrats have a working 60vote majority so they could even break filibusters and pass what they want they have had a year to work on this and we can see what they have done we have seen what happened to their spending we have seen all these different things they put money into these ones that are foggy are the ones that are just done by the house the senate has not passed them we have seen whats happened to employment as a result of that excessive spending it has not been good and its not been good for a reason we have today again continued in the same policy i think americans are getting tired of it i think they realize you cant blame it on someone else that these are basic factors that people understand its businesses that create jobs and if you tax the businesses too much and if you have the wrong environment for the businesses they are not going to be able to keep the economy going ironically something that suffers a great deal in a poor economy are governments governments depend on tax revenues for their revenues and the states really take a beating because many of them have balanced budgets that they have to meet so if you happen to be some poor governor in a state when you have a congress like this thats spending money wildly and forgetting the basic principles of economics youve got a lot of problems so this cartoon is as a lot of cartoons that have a certain amount of sense and humor to them now give me one good reason why youre not hiring well weve seen a whole lot of reasons why were not hiring and the trouble is that we have essentially exasperated every single one of these things and thats why there are not jobs here so were closing up here then on this segment on unemployment and on spending and what it is that creates it theres nothing here thats very complicated like most things in life if you understand the mechanics and how they work theyre not very difficult were doing some things that are wrong in terms of jobs if we want to have jobs we can do it its not the government thats going to create the jobs its you my friends the american people that will create the jobs but we have to give you an economic environment that is conducive to creating jobs and that does not mean a whole lot more money in spending such as our 150 billion in stimulus ii son of stimulus if you want to call it that the failed bill from last summer that didnt work it does not include increasing the debt limit as we did today by 300 billion what it includes is the same basic principle that jfk ronald reagan and bush used which is getting the government off the backs of the people of the united states this is a sad situation my father fought in world war ii and their mindset was were going to give of ourselves a whole lot so the next generation our children can have more than we did some of them didnt go to college and they said we want our kids to go to college we want to leave america a better place is that the heritage of this day that we want to leave america a worse place that we want to leave our kids and our grandkids up to their ears in debt having a less bright future than what we had cant we learn from the great generation that fought world war ii that we want to leave america a better place i believe the american public will say we want to go back to leaving this a stronger better freer country than when we inherited it and i think we will do that but we will do that by changing these false premises and policies that are leading us down the primrose path i thank the speaker for allowing me to talk on these very important questions and i would say merry christmas wonderful holidays to americans god bless you and goodnight"], [2.288818359375e-05, 0.9999771118164062, 1, "i ask unanimous consent that

stand just before a daytomorrowof great political drama i am trained as an engineer and not much of an expert on drama or plays but i have at least one theory about acting in plays and drama and that is usually its very good or very bad as we take a look at the drama that faces people who will be watching tomorrow the question tonight is what drama are they liable to watch are they going to watch the olympics the last part of the olympics which will be very exciting or the political drama of 6 hours of discussions or debate i think there will be more drama that will take place tomorrow on the health care bill now we have been talking about this health care bill for more than a year and the subject has had a tendency to get a little bit stale but tomorrow is an attempt to revive that discussion one of the things that is required in good drama is the theme or the major topic and the different parts of that drama have to be believable i think thats one of the things that may make the drama tomorrow more difficult in terms of its success lets just talk about what really is believable the president claimed about a year or so agoi guess it was in a state of the union messagethat this new health care was going to save money and that it wouldnt cost us a dime well i guess thats true its going to cost more like 1 trillion is that believable the president repeatedly said that republicans had no ideas yet in baltimore just a month or two ago he said not that the republicans had no ideas but that hed read a good number of the bills that had been introduced by the republicans is that believable the president also pledged transparency and openness in the whole process of developing a health care bill what we have seen has been that bills are developed behind closed doors and for tomorrow the bill that has been created behind closed doors is going to be revealed only for 24 hours so is the transparency openness pledge believable in baltimore the president talked about the fact that he has a lot of economic experts scoring the bill and taking a look at whether it works financially or not whether or not the different component parts come together and whether or not it achieves the economic results that he wants yet when the congressional budget office which is supposedly and to a large degree politically neutral scored the bill they said that the republican bill actually reduces premiums by 10 percent while the democrat bill makes them more expensive then there is a question about whether or not the meeting tomorrow which is attempting to be billed as bipartisan and bipartisanshipdoes that really make sense because if you write a bill behind closed doors unveiling it at the last minute within 24 hours and then demand that the republicans agree to it is that really bipartisanship i wonder if that is believable the president promised us that the bill that he was going to present when he was in baltimore would include tort reform yet the bill that we have seen did the exact opposite the states that had already enacted tort reform were forbidden from using those tort reform laws so in effect it would reverse tort reform and would go in the exact opposite direction is that believable we were told that the special deals have been taken out yet in a few minutes we will take a look at those special deals which remain in the bill then last of alland it is the one that i find most amazingthe republicans are obstructionists i find that hard to believe how anybody could even repeat that let alone believe it i wish it were true i sorely wish it were true the republicans here in this chamber my republican colleagues are 40 votes short of a majority there is nothing that we could obstruct if our lives depended on it the democrats could lose 20 voters and still pass anything that they choose to pass so how we could be as republicans obstructionists again seems very hard to pass the old sniff test now it seems that the president in setting up this great drama of 6 hours of televised discussion on health care has made a major assumption which is if people just knew what was in his bill they would really like it probably the opposite is true what we have seen is our constituents my constituents have called in and they have read portions of these bills they know what is in the bill guess what they dont like it in fact this bill that is being proposed is ugly its so ugly it has to sneak up on a glass of water just to get a drink well lets take a look specifically at why it is that we are going to have this great health care political drama tomorrow and yet we are not really passing the believable test lets just take a look to see if anything has really changed at all first of all this bill imposes 500 billion in medicare cuts thats a whole lot of money five hundred billion dollars is going to be taken out of medicare the old democrat bill took 500 billion out of medicare the presidents new bill takes 500 billion out of medicare the republican alternative takes nothing out of medicare well nothing seems to have changed here this bill enacts jobkilling tax hikes and government regulations costing hundreds of billions of dollars in the old democrat bill yes that was true for it the presidents new plan which is online likewise enacts a lot of jobkilling tax hikes and government regulations that cost billions of dollars yet the republican alternative does not it spends 1 trillion on a government takeover of the health care system this is something that people are really conscious of this is a government takeover of an entire sector of the unitedstates economy 1 trillion i think that number is short because its not counting the unfunded mandates to states the old democrat bill does that the presidents new bill does it the republican bill does not so what has changed here it benefits trial lawyers by failing to enact tort reform well the old democrat bill did not have any real tort reform in it in fact it went the opposite way the presidents new bill is not different the republican alternative is the opposite it protects backroom deals with washington special interests weve been told these deals have been taken out but theyve not been taken out the old bill had those special deals the new bill does the republican bill does not it puts government bureaucrats in charge of personal health care decisions this is something a lot of americans are very concerned with its bad enough if some insurance company is getting between you and your doctor but its even worse if a government bureaucrat does because if you dont like the insurance company you can change companies you cant change governments so again the new proposal is no different than the democrat proposal and the republicans are not doing that it breaks president obamas pledge not to raise taxes on those who make less than 250 000 well certainly the old democrat bill did raise taxes on people making less than 250 000 the new proposal still taxes people more who make less than 250 000 the republican proposal does not it forces individuals to purchase governmentapproved health insurance thats something that people are pretty sensitive tothe governments telling you that you must buy health insurance the old democrat bill does that the presidents proposal still does it republicans reject that idea it forces employers to choose governmentapproved health insurance or they are going to have to pay a new tax so the government is going to tell you what kind of insurance you have got to purchase or you are going to have to pay a new kind of tax the old democrat bill did that what the president is proposing continues to do it the republicans dont so is this great drama that is supposed to take place tomorrow really something new im not so sure that it is in that it seems to follow the same pattern now if we take a look at the proposal the proposal is still pretty much the same thing here is a picture of what this bill looks like you have got a 2 000page bill and it is pretty complicated to try and read 2 000 pages in 24 hours is quite an undertaking the only advantage that some of us have is that its so much like the other proposals that it is not really that different you dont have to read all 2 000 pages of it to know whats in there as i mentioned the president makes an assumption which is that if people just understood the bill betternow thats obviously something that he could talk about for 6 hours i think if its that complicated if people just understood the bill better they would like it what i would propose is that the president is mistaken in that regard what i would like to talk about for just a few minutes are the people who are not going to like this bill when they see what it has got in it because there are a lot of these groups of americans various groups and i will tell you which groups they are and why theyre not going to like this bill i think the more that this bill is talked about and the more that people read it and see how it works whats going to happen is that youre going to see these numbers change right now in the public opinion of health care 58 percent of voters nationwide oppose the obama health care reform plan 58 percent oppose it 50 percent of voters strongly oppose the plan and 78 percent of voters expect the plan to cost more than projected so its not very popular now the question is if they see 6 more hours of drama are they going to like the plan any more i would suggest that there are all kinds of groups of people who are not going to like this plan let me talk to you about some of those groups of people the first is a category that i am increasingly putting myself in and thats the group of people who are older i just hit 62 years old so im feeling a little bit older and older people arent going to like this plan for a couple of reasons the first reason they wont like it is because of something we mentioned just a minute ago which is that this is going to take 500 billion out of medicare now when i was first getting started in politics years ago the democrats always accused republicans of taking money away from medicare yet ironically this bill which is being proposed by the president is taking 500 billion out of medicare so if youre an older person you probably wont like it for that reason if you are an older person there is a bigger and more serious reason that you will not like this bill if you are older you will go to see the doctor more if you go to see the doctor more what this bill is going to do is it is going to harm the quality of american health care it will harm the quality this has been the experience of every nation that has had its government take over health care it has also been the experience of two statesmassachusetts and tennesseewhich have had their state governments try to take over health care in every one of those experiences the quality of health care has gone down and the cost of health care has gone up so if you are an older person and if you see the doctor a little bit more first of all youre not going to like that great big cut to medicare second of all the quality of your health care is going to go down now lets say instead of being older youre young certainly you would like the bill if the older people dont like it no wrong if youre young you wont like the bill because this bill forces you to pay for government insurance which is written the way the government says you have to buy the insurance if you dont buy that insurance youre going to be penalized youre going to have to pay a penalty if you are a young person if you like freedom and if you dont want the government telling you what kind of insurance to buy or if you have to buy insurance you wont like this bill for those reasons the next group of people that will probably not like this bill is the group of people who are married what this bill does to married people is it says if youre married youre going to have to pay more money for your health insurance than if youre single so there is a marriage penalty in this bill in other words if you have two individuals who are both making the same amount of moneysay you have two individuals making 32 000 a year if you take a look at what those two single individuals have to pay because they get all the subsidies under this bill they are going to have to pay a lot less than the two people as husband and wife who are making the same amount of money those people will have to pay 2 000 more so this bill contains for that example 2 000 of penalties for people who are married so if youre married you probably wont like this bill now if you happen to fall in the category of being prolife or at least if you fall in the category of not wanting government money your tax money to pay for abortions you wont like this bill because the bill thats being proposed is the senate bill and it allows in these insurance policies which are government funded for people to get abortions through the policies so there is not a strict and clean line in the bill the way the house version of the bill was passed which says that there is absolutely no using these government policies to do abortions so if youre prolife you will not like the senate version of this bill and you will hear people who are involved in the prolife cause standing and arguing vigorously that the senate version is unacceptable now if you own a small business youre not going to like this bill if you own a small business this is going to cause you trouble in a number of different ways first of all youre going to be taxed a tremendous amount of money to help pay for this whole thing if you think about small business in america as being people who have 500 employees or less that is 80 percent of the jobs in america are small business people those companies are not going to like this bill the people that run those companies because of the fact that it requires those companies first of all to pay a great deal of increased taxes to help pay for the trillionplusdollar bill in this package but also it requires those companies to buy the insurance that the government tells them they have to buy and if even one employee doesnt like it then there are going to be additional penalties this is going to cost small businessmen a lot of taxes and a lot of regulations and red tape if youre a small businessman youre not going to like this bill if youre unemployed you wont like this bill because this bill is going to cost jobs it will make it harder for you to get your next job how is it that this bill will make it harder for you to get your job well get into that in a little bit more detail later but the basic elements of creating jobs in our economy is allowing the small businesses to create the jobs by creating an environment in the small business that makes jobs how does that happen well one you dont want to tax the guy that owns the business because you want him to put his money back into the business to expand it to buy new equipment to put a new wing on the building in order to create more jobs this bill does the exact opposite it buries the small business owner in taxes and red tape and a lot of unknown costs for health care when you do that its going to make the small business less likely to hire people and therefore if youre unemployed its going to make it a lot harder to get a job because this is a jobkilling proposal so if you are an unemployed person this is not something that you want to see passing right away the people in america who own health insurance are not going to like this bill if you own health insurance what this bill is going to do is its going to charge you more money for your health insurance to help pay for the people who havent bought any health insurance so this bill is going to cost you more for the health insurance if you own health insurance lets just run through the list of who wouldnt like this bill if youre older you wont like the bill if youre young you wont like the bill if youre married you wont like the bill if youre prolife you wont like the bill if youre a small business owner you wont like the bill and if youre somebody looking to get a job from that small business owner you still wont like the bill then also if you have health insurance youre not going to like the bill either so theres a whole lot of people that just naturally when they take a look at what all of this complicated maze means to them those are all people who arent going to like this proposal is that all there are who wont like the proposal oh no there are a lot of other people who wont like the proposal as well lets take a look at some of the others if you are concerned about illegal immigration you wont like the bill because this bill provides no guarantee that illegal immigrants cannot come in and get health care and get the subsidies to health care that will have to be paid for by the american public and all the people who are taxed to pay for this measure so if youre concerned about illegal immigrants coming and getting a free ride in terms of governmentpaidfor health care this bill does not contain the protections if youre worried about illegal immigrants coming into this country and getting subsidized health care this bill does that and there is no protection against it if youre one of 36 states who do not want the federal government to mandate that everybody in your state has to buy governmentcertified health care if you want the people in your state to have some sovereignty if you care about state sovereignty and you want the people of your state to make their own decisions how theyll spend their money and you dont want the federal government to force the people in your state to pay for insurance then this bill is something that you dont want and there are 36 different states out of 50 36 states that have legislation that is in the process of moving in those states essentially banning the federal government from requiring citizens of those states to have to buy health insurance product so if youre one of those 36 states where the legislators are saying we dont want the federal government butting into our business telling our citizens that they have to buy insurance then this is something that you certainly wouldnt want the other people that might not like this and this probably goes almost without saying are people who make a fair amount of money people who make a fair amount of money are going to be taxed very heavily in a number of different regards to try to help subsidize this new health insurance plan if youre welltodo and you dont like huge taxes then you certainly are not going to like this plan if you happen to be somebody thats concerned with doing things in a just way that is if youre concerned that every state gets the same deal that there are no special deals in this legislation youre not going to like it weve been told that the special deals have been taken out but unfortunately thats not true here are some of the special deals in this proposal that are still there one of them is what they call louisiana purchase no 2 and that is something for i believe mary landrieu out in louisiana the cost is 300 million and it provides a special assignment for states recovering from a major disaster its written just to include this one state and its 300 million to add to the state medicaid program so thats a 300 million special deal for louisiana how about for connecticut yes there is a special deal for a connecticut hospital 100 million which appears to apply only to some connecticut hospitals theres millions of medicaid dollars for vermont and massachusetts thats 1 1 billion total it helps with the medicaid program and gives about 600 million to vermont massachusetts 500 million for those states cash for new jersey drug companies new jerseys getting a deal the cost is 1 billion for special deals for new jersey extra cash for union health care plans this is a deal of 5 billion it says that theres going to be a reinsurance program to defray the medical costs of union members so thats 5 billion for union member health care costs are there other special deals yes in fact there are we dont have to pay any medicare advantage remember how i said this bill is going to cut 500 billion from medicare but it wont cut medicare advantage for people in florida so if youre in florida you wont get that medicare advantage cut the other states will special funding for coal miners in montana yes it does the cost were not quite sure what that is but its medicare coverage for workers exposed to environmental health hazards there is a fee exemption for politically connected insurers in michigan apparently higher medicare payments for north dakota providers hawaii hospitals are getting exempt from the cuts and longshoremen are exempt from tax or health plans there is a whole series of special deals so if you dont like special deals for various states that your state doesnt get you wont like this plan i think one of the groups and this is probably not exactly small that doesnt like this plan would be doctors why would that be well what does a doctor do why does a doctor become a doctor many of them will say that they really wanted to take care of people and help them with their health care why then would a doctor dislike this plan other than its great complexity well one of the things thats extremely frustrating to doctors as well as patients is something that we dont like but has happened and that is you allow an insurance company to come between a doctor and a patient i think most people consider that doctorpatient relationcertainly my republican colleagues would say if theres anything in health care that should be principally sacred it would be the fact that the doctor and the patient need to make the final decisions on health care thats something that we dont want to have disturbed and if an insurance company is allowed to come between the doctor and the patient we dont like that we dont want somebody thats not a doctor getting involved in medical decisions unfortunately in versions of this plan what you have is you have insurance companies who are allowed to make medical decisions and are not held legally accountable for the outcome of those decisions thats bad enough but a doctor particularly wont like this plan because instead of an insurance company which you can always change or at least you have some chance to change you have no chance to change the federal government if the federal government is the one that is coming between you and your doctor so if youre a doctor a lot of doctors do not like this plan in fact there have been a dozen different republican doctors on the floor over the period of the last year talking about the fact that they dont like this plan they think its terrible and that should tell us something there is another constituent group that does not like the plan theres another group of people who will not like this plan i happen to fall into this group and its one that you might not think of off the top of your head and that would be people who have cancer why would people who have cancer not like this plan well one of the things that has been done is to take a look at the survival rate in people who have cancer in various countries what you find in england is the survival rate is much much lower than the survival rate in america the survival rate of cancer patients in canada is lower than the survival rate of cancer patients in america so if america then changes our medical system to be more like england or canada we have to assume also that then the survival rate of cancer patients is going to be less its going to be harder to try to survive cancer when you have a staterun system doing cancer so theres cancer patients the list does seem to be getting a little bit long and is it really such a good idea on this great drama thats supposed to take place tomorrow in competition by the way with the olympics this great political drama is the assumption really true that if the american people see this bill more closely theyre going to love it more or is it possible that in this drama the real villain in the drama is this very bill itself is it possible that all of these different groups of americans really do have it right lets run through this again this is a pretty significant list as i go through it i would like you to ask yourself do i fall into that group myself is this something that is going to affect me in a bad way certainly a great majority of americans believe it will hurt them and it is not a bill that they want but lets take a look at who these people are that wouldnt like it first of all if youre old then if youre young if youre married if youre prolife if youre a small business owner if youre unemployed if you have health insurance if youre concerned about illegal immigration and they are getting health insurance if you are one of the many states who are concerned with a government mandate that every citizen has to purchase government certified health care if you are welltodo if you are those who dont like the special deals that some states get and other ones dont get if you are a doctor you are not going to like this plan and if you care about the doctorpatient relationship you particularly wont like this plan and if you happen to be a person with cancer youre not going to like this plan but then again you may be dead so you might not care as much and then you have other people leaders who are in state government governors legislators various senators or house members in state government why would they not like this plan well here this is another group that has a pretty good concern and that is the trilliondollar bill that has been attached to this plan that trilliondollar bill is not the full cost of the plan a lot of cost is going to be passed down to the various states so this plan contains unfunded mandates on the various states now a lot of states because of the recession and the high level of unemployment their state revenues are very tight in fact some of them are in the red and if we through this plan produce something that first of all is going to create more unemployment and going to cost more money to the various states people who have to manage the state budget unlike the federal budget many states have a balanced budget requirement and so if you keep adding more costs to those states they are going to have to cut other things on the state budget in order to pay for this big governmentrun program the exact numbers on what unfunded mandates this includes are not entirely known particularly when a plan is being released and you have 24 hours for different economic experts to look at it now is it possible that the reason that this bill after it has been put together behind closed doors is trotted out for only 24 hours that the reason for that is people really dont want a good economic look at what this is going to cost i hope that is not the case but it is very hard in 24 hours for the congressional budget office to come up and say well here is what it is really going to cost and even if you take their best estimates which i think they try in the past their estimates of medicare were way way off by a factor of two or three or as much as seven times off those numbers tend to be much lower than what the real costs of the programs are so there are a lot of people in various state leaderships that are not going to like this plan people who do not like red tape i dont think we need explain that one very much if you dont like red tape you are not going to like this this is a simplified version of a 2 000page bill and every one of these new boxes is some government creation to try to make this thing work because the government is taking over you have to remember almost a fifth of the unitedstates economy and when they do that they have got to create a lot of bureaucrats and boxes and flow charts and all that kind of stuff if you dont like red tape you are not going to like this bill and then people who dont trust the government to run the economy well i think there are a lot of people who think that the government is not proving to be very efficient in the way it runs a lot of things even the premise behind this bill is well weve got a problem with medicare so were going to take the money out of medicare and medicare isnt working quite right so therefore what we need to do is to replace medicare with the government taking everything over there is something about that logic if you take a look at the overall finances of the unitedstates government what you find is it is not a big problem with earmarks the real big problem is with three entitlement programs which are growing because of the demographics in our country and because of the nature of those entitlement programs the entitlement programs are social security medicare and medicaid two of those are medical entitlements medicare and medicaid both of those are growing to the point that over time and people disagree exactly what year it happens but they bust the entire federal budget they grow so big they balloon so large that you cant derive taxes any more and they basically shut out all of the money that congressmen are supposed to spend on different things like defense or all other kinds of government programs so these things like a cancer are growing so big that they threaten to break the federal budget and the federal piggy bank in fact right now those three programs medicare medicaid social security have almost gotten to the point where they are taking half of the disposable budget of the country so now we have got medicare and medicaid out of control and so what are we going to do oh well were going to have the government take over all of health care that doesnt seem to be a credible solution to that problem this is an article from the new york times as a result this is talking about this great meeting this great political drama that is supposed to take place tomorrow democrats now are considering a plan to use a parliamentary maneuver called budget reconciliation to attach changes to the senate health care legislation as a budget measure which cannot be filibustered and requires only a simple majority for passage in the senate now does this look like a bipartisan effort to cooperate on health care i dont think so what this is is a call by the captain of the ship to go to ramming speed to take the bill which a majority of americans do not support and to try to jam it through now there can be a nice political drama tomorrow but is it really working in a cooperative spirit to go behind closed doors put together a bill pop it out within 24 hours and then demand that the republicans all go along with it is that really working in a bipartisan way or is it really just more of my way or the highway i will leave that to your decision but that is what the new york times not exactly a conservative oracle is saying this is the plan is to take the bill that went through the senate which a great majority of americans do not support and push it through anyway this is where the public is now fiftyeight percent of voters nationwide oppose this health care reform plan will 6 hours of drama tomorrow change that is this going to change is it really going to be drama or does it lack credibility i would suggest that when i take a good look at this i think people may yawn and say this sure looks like the same old same old we havent seen very much changing and the olympics is a whole lot more exciting as i started by saying i have observed things about drama and plays and the things that i have observed are that they tend to be either really good or really bad and boring and so that is my concern about the high level of drama tomorrow now one of the connections that i think we need to make and it is something that has been made is the connection to something that i think is on the minds of americans maybe more than a governmentrun health care program and that is the problem of unemployment i would like to connect these two because these two do connect together i see that i am joined by my good friend

big government takeover of health care is not an option almost a year later this message unfortunately hasnt been received by the liberal majority instead of working across the aisle and reforming the bill to include less government and more commonsense bipartisan principles liberal leaders are talking about bending the rules and rushing this by way of a process called reconciliation this is a

abject failure an abject failure there have been very few private sector jobs created around this country what has been created are a lot of government jobs here in washington dc if someones looking for a job here in washington they have a lot of opportunities because government continues to grow exponentially exponentially but whats not happening are jobs are not being created out in georgia or around this country where theyre so desperately needed private sector jobs i was talking to one of my county commission chairmen just recently and he said paul 1 year ago in our country the employment rate was 14 3 per cent i said oh my goodness of course in my district we have a very poor district except for the two major cities athens and augusta the augusta area and the athens area and this is not one of those counties he said a year ago the unemployment rate was 14 3 now its 10 7 percent officially and i said that is great hallelujah praise the lord whered the jobs come from he said paul there arent any jobs people have just gotten discouraged and quit looking theyve fallen off the unemployment roles there are no new jobs here were losing jobs and our people in our county are leaving theyre just disgusted theyre disappointed and thats whats happening all over this country how do i know that republicans a couple of months ago launched a web site asking the american people to speak out its called americaspeakingout com and we are asking americans to go on americaspeakingout com to registerits very simple no costand to tell us what we should be doing here in congress right now today not only to create jobs but to get the economy back on track how to deal with health care how to deal with the issues that the american people are facing today we are asking america to speak out you see we live in a republic representative government and the only way we can continue representative government is if representatives listen to the american people and ive got a sad sad thing to saythat the leadership in this house doesnt listen to the american people i will give you an example when we were debating obamacare threefourths of america did not want that bill passed threefourths of america said no to obamacare twothirds today sayat least 60 percent or moresay repeal it repeal it our leadership here in the democratic side didnt listen to the american people president obama didnt listen to the american people they forced down the throats of the american public a bill which is now law that was designed to fail its designed to fail america why do i say that because it was designed to push people off private health insurance designed to push people into a whats now called a public exchange and thats going to force people into more and more government its designed to lead us where the president just before obamacare was passed into law said that he wanted to go where everybody in this country would be on one insurance policy one pool is what he said that means socialized medicine where bureaucrats here in washington d c direct the health care for everybody in this country to tell doctors like myselfi am a general practice medical doctorhow to practice medicine who we can give care to what medicines we can use what tests we can do and in fact right now today the federal government tells me or other physicians across this country whether we can admit a patient thats on medicare to the hospital or not its not determined by the doctor or the patient its determined by a government bureaucrat thats not a doctor not even a nurse or even a health care professional but more importantly what is obamacare going to do i spoke to just recently the head of a manufacturing entity in my district in rural north georgia that hires over 400 people and he said paul with the tax burden obamacares going to put on me as a businessman with all the big government programs the stimulus bill and tarp bailouts and taking over of the private sector he said paul im trying to find a place to move my company offshore away from america think about that if we continue down this road that this leadership and the democrats are leading us down that plant will close over 400 people in rural north georgia will be put out of work theyre going to lose their jobs and in fact we knew that while we were discussing obamacare we knew that it was estimated by experts that at least 5 million to 5 5 million americans were going to lose their jobs strictly because of obamacare and that has not changed we must repeal it and replace it with something else i introduced a bill h r 3889 comprehensive health care reform system totally constitutional according to the original intent of the constitution totally in the private sector would radically change healthcare financing would radically lower the cost of health insurance for everybody in this country would solve most of all of the problems with portability and uninsurability et cetera would leave the doctor and patient in control of their health care decisions its 106 pages a major piece of legislation not almost 3 000 like obamacare was and its very simple you can read it and understand what that bill says our speaker of the house ms pelosi said weve got to pass obamacare to find out whats in it just the other day we heard about this financial reform bill that weve got to pass it to find out whats in it the american people deserve more they deserve to know whats in a bill and deserve to know how it will affect them we are killing jobs by bill after bill by bigger government program by bigger government program its going to hurt our economy destroy our economy and were borrowing from our children and our grandchildrens future our children and grandchildren are very probably going to live at a lower standard than we live today if we dont stop this outrageous spending thats been going on ever since nancy pelosi has been speaker of this house and even more so since president obama has been in office its got to stop its got to stop now ive done many america speaking out town hall meetings all over the 10th congressional district in georgia just listening to my constituency i have done these in small groups weve done big town hall meetings weve gone into factories and asked factories and companies to speak out and to tell us what we should be doing in congress right now today in fact i went to the cocacola plant in athens georgia and spoke to the employees there and asked them to speak to me and encouraged them to go on america speakingout com i did a town hall meeting in columbia county in evans georgia and did the same thing did one in athens which is the most liberal county in my district in fact politically its a speck of blue in a sea of red its a very democratic county its where the university of georgia is its a very liberal county and i did an america speaking out town hall there invited the whole public to come anybody who wanted to come because i wanted to hear thats what america speaking outs all about we want to hear what america thinks we should be dealing with here in congress and offer us suggestions of how to create jobs were asking where are the jobs the policy thats being followed by the democratic majority is taking away jobs i already mentioned how obamacare is going to eventually put over 5 million americans out of work just because of that one bill the stimulus bills going to put people out of work its put a few people to work more government employees than privatesector employees but were asking americans to speak out to go on americaspeakingout com to tell us what we should be doing here in congress today to offer suggestions to vote on suggestions that are already made or comments already made americans can make their own comment these are just some of the things thatthese are sheets actually that my staff wrote to suggestions of legislation that people in the 10th congressional district of georgia suggested that we do no energy tax boy if that energy taxi call it taxandtrade my democratic colleagues call it capandtradebut its about taxes in fact the president himself said that his energy tax the taxandtrade bill is necessary to fund obamacare its all about revenue the experts tell us that the national energy tax is not going to reduce carbon emissions worldwide its going to hurt our economy and its going to put millions of americans out of work and americans understand that and they said no to the energy tax no to the finance bill that was just signed into law this week defund obamacare no to socialized medicine repeal obamacare pass alternatives to health care reform i would love to see my bill h r 3889 be put into place in fact i reintroduced it as a repeal obamacare to repeal all of this onerous bill onerous law thats going to lead to socialized medicine here in the country as the president has said that he wants to go to and replace it with something in the private sector to maintain the doctorpatient relationship and to lower the cost of health care for everybody alternatives to health care reform keeping bills germane the american people have told me even the liberals in athens georgia we need to have bills that are germane in other words we shouldnt tack onto bills things that arent germane to those bills the house passed and in fact were waiting on the senate amendments to the emergency appropriations for the war supplemental bill a 75 billion bill only 33 billion of that 75 billion have to do with the military and war supplemental all the rest of that 75 billion is bigger government programs bigger spending that the democratic majority pushed through americansliberals conservatives independents republicans democratshave told me keep bills germane no to capandtrade i can go on down this list but the overwhelming thing i heard where are the jobs what are we going to do to create jobs in the private sector and ive heard my democratic colleagues just speak over and over again about how great this stimulus bill has been its been an abject failure where are the jobs mr speaker where are the jobs mr president where are the jobs my colleagues on the democratic side theyre not there in fact the policies and the spending that we see going on over and over again from bill after bill since this president has taken office will actually take away jobs and its going to push jobs and manufacturers to go overseas i talked to one manufacturer and asked him what can we do to get you to start hiring employees and he said the best thing you could do is lower my corporate income tax rate my democratic colleagues say that we need to tax the rich so we need to keep those corporate tax rates high we have the second highest corporate tax rate in the world its 35 percent second only to japan in fact ive talked to manufacturer after manufacturer and they tell me paul if you just lower my corporate tax rate to 25 percent that would help me be able to create jobs in my company just lower it 10 percent i think corporate tax rates should be zero in fact not only should corporate rates be zero but dividend taxes should be zero death taxes should be zero capital gains taxes should be zero we should have an immediate writeoff of capital expenditure for business not have this prolonged depreciation schedule that the internal revenue code forces them into they have to write the check they should be able to write it off if we could change just the tax law we would create jobs in fact i introduced h r 4100 the jobs act my jobs act is an acronym for jumpstart our business sector what it would do is for 2 years it would cut in half the payroll tax for business as well as for individuals it would lower the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent it would suspend the death tax suspend the dividend taxes for 2 years and it would lower the two lowest income tax brackets down to 10 percent and 5 percent respectively and if you think about that what would that do from a monetary perspective what it would do is it would leave dollars in the hands of small businesses and it would leave dollars in the hands of the american public the consumers that would give small businesses the opportunity to expand their business to buy inventory to modernize to hire new employees and it would give dollars to the consumers so that they could buy the goods and services that they need it would give some stability to our economic situation so we dont see the stock market jumping up and down as we do today it looks like a yoyo why is that because theres so much uncertainty and why is there uncertainty out there its because of what this congress and what nancy pelosi and company are doing right here and what barack obama is proposing for more and more government more and more of the federal government taking over the private sector that uncertainty is creating a lot of fear ive had businesses small businesses large businesses in my district tell me theyre sitting on cash but theyre afraid to hire new employees why because of obamacare because of the debt because of the outrageous spending because of the socalled financial reform bill that was just signed into law this week theyre afraid and i dont blame them ive said in multiple floor speeches here that we have a steamroller of socialism being driven by nancy pelosi harry reid and fueled by barack obama we need to put that steamroller of socialism in a parking lot if we would do so if we would put the steamroller of socialism that my democratic colleagues are driving if we would put that in a parking lot we would put certainty back in the financial sector and we would see a growth in our economy but with that uncertainty that our leadership of this house and the senate and the president are giving to the private sector were going to see the business sector afraid afraid to hire new people some economists say were fixing to go into a great depression in fact some even say were going into a depression worse than we saw in the previous great depression i hope and pray not i pray that god prevents that but whether we do or dont i know this the simple truth is bigger government bigger government spending more debt being created for our children and grandchildren to have to pay is not going to solve the economic problems of our country weve got to stop the outrageous spending here that congress has been doing that this administration is doing that the previous administration was doing i wasnt here during the first 6 years of the bush administration i was elected in 2007 is when i took office but i voted against the tarp bill the toxic asset relief program because i thought it was wrong it hasnt helped the second tranche that president obama forced through the congress it hasnt helped taking over gm and chrysler hasnt helped taking over the student loan program taking over the health care system hasnt helped the stimulus bill has been an abject failure by and large the company that makes these huge signs to proclaim that barack obama and his policies are the messiah which costs lord only knows how much has helped that company but it hasnt helped the american taxpayer it hasnt helped small businesses around this country by and large america speaking out gives the american people an opportunity to give us ideas about what they think what america thinks about what we should be doing now to solve the problems you see im excited about the socalled tea party movement in this country ive spoken to many tea party rallies but theres a great misunderstanding particularly in the press particularly with my liberal friends what the tea party is all about we started a tea party caucus just this week i was one of the original signers of membership into the tea party caucus ive done a number of interviews just yesterday i did one on fox i just did one this afternoon ive done many interviews recently and its very apparent to me and its apparent to me to the questions that were asked during the news conference that we held yesterday after the tea party caucus started that theres a tremendous misunderstanding particularly by my liberal colleagues and by the press about what the tea party movement is all about and im excited about it the tea party simply is this its freedomloving americans people who just basically want to live their lives without all the government intrusion theyre teed off tea in the tea party stands for taxed enough already its an acronym and they see the socalled jobs bill that my democratic colleagues keep bringing to the floor of the house ive already mentioned my jobs act which is an acronym for jumpstart our business sector i believe every one of the socalled jobs bills that my democratic colleagues have introduced is an acronym for just one big slush fund because thats what it seems to be the american people are angry theyre angry about not being listened to theyre angry about seeing their freedom being taken away their jobs being taken away the previous speaker during the 5minutes was touting how great the stimulus act has been but its not been great they have to try to spin how disastrous the spending bill has been its not created very many jobs its created some but not very many and certainly not very many in the private sector the american people are asking where are the jobs when are we going to get this economy back on course weve seen a liberal icon my democratic colleagues one of their icons one of this countrys icons john f kennedy considered to be very liberal at the time today theyd call him a wacko a crazy man because he proposed tax cuts i hear from my democratic colleagues that they want to tax the rich they want to tax them even more well who are the rich its the small businesses of this country most small businessmen and women file their taxes as a sub s corporation which means they file their business taxes on personal income taxes my democratic colleagues say theyre making too much money we want it here in washington to create a bigger government a bigger socialistic government and whats that going to do its going to kill jobs its going to take jobs away from millions of americans and my democratic colleagues want to tax small business to the hilt theyre not happy with the high tax rates that small business are already suffering from they want more taxes on the socalled rich the rich of the little momandpop grocery stores the little hardware stores the small community businesses mens stores its not the wal marts the at ts the boeings those arent small businesses but we have developed policy and the policy of the democratic majority is antibusiness its antifreedom its antijob creation why do they want to do that its because they believe in my opinion that government is the solution to everything you see they think in my opinion that government has to tell them how to run every aspect of their lives ill give you some examples weve already seen where our democratic colleagues want to tell us how much salt we can have in our food im a physician and i have prescribed lowsalt diets to my patients i dont use salt i hardly ever pick up a salt shaker i dont even salt watermelon or eggs when i eat those or tomatoes and i know as a physician we have plenty of salt for most of our bodily needs unless somebody has a particular reason that they lose salt in an abnormal way even athletes for the most part dont need salt when i was playing football in high school our coach would give us salt tablets that was absolutely the wrong thing to do but my colleagues want to say they want to control salt in our food they say they want to control what kind of light bulbs we can putin fact thats what theyve donewhat kind of light bulbs we can have in our lamps at home they want to tell us what kind of cars we can drive how much water comes out of our shower heads they want to control every aspect of our lives every aspect theres a word for that that word is socialism central control from washington d c we have had a greater takeover of the private sector since barack obamas been the president of the united states than hugo chavezweve had a greater takeover in the private sector in this administration than the communist dictator hugo chavez has nationalized the private sector in venezuela thats a shock to most people when you tell them that but thats factual weve had a greater takeover of the private sector under president obama than hugo chavez has done in venezuela its got to stop the american people are understanding that theyre sick and tired of it they want their freedom back they want their nation back they want their jobs back theyre asking where are the jobs when are we going to put our economy back on the right track thats what were asking here as republicans weve got to stop this policy of bigger government and higher taxes more intrusion in peoples lives and thats all weve seen over and over again from the democratic majority in fact not all democrats believe in that ill give you an example during the debate on obamacare i proposedin fact i wrote an oped along with congressman dent and congressman shadeggones from pennsylvania and ones from arizonachallenging our democratic colleagues to introduce a democratic bill that i had the language for all they had to do was write the name of the sponsor in a blank and introduce it it would be a democratic bill they could claim it to be obamacare it would do four things crossstateline purchases for businesses and individuals number two anybody in this country could join an association poolall across the country multiple associationsto have the opportunity to buy and own their own health insurance through the association number three to encourage states to set up highrisk pools to cover those who are uninsurable and number four to have tax fairness so that everybody in this country could deduct 100 percent of their health care and health insurance cost off their income taxes i had democrat after democrat tell me this they said paul that makes sense it really makes sense but i cant do it i cant do it because my leadership would punish me if i did if i introduced that bill and tried to push it through the democratic caucus my leadership would punish me for doing to so i was told by democrat after democrat that they were focusing on only one thing and thats obamacare as we know it the debate was over whether we were going to have a robust public option a public option not so robust or a public exchange and thats what we wound up getting which is actually public option lite public option on a diet all three of those are geared and guaranteed to force everybody in this country into a governmentcontrolled health insurance program controlled from washington d c the only bipartisan vote on obamacare was no we had democrats and republicans voting no every republican voted no seventyfive percent of america said no but we have it now as law because ms pelosi and the democratic leadership are not listening to america theyre not listening to america when america says where are the jobs were doing that im doing that i hold america speaking out town hall meetings republicans are going to be doing that all over this country during this august district work period we want to hear from america i encourage every american who is concerned about where were going as a nation thats concerned about public policywhether youre a democrat or a republican independent whether youre a liberal or a conservative whether you consider yourself a moderateim encouraging everybody in this country to go to americaspeakingout com and speak out give us your ideas about how to solve the problems the economic problems give us your ideas about how to solve this unemployment problem i want to hear thats the reason ive done many i have even lost count somewhere between 10 and 20 america speaking out town hall meetings and meetings with small business and large groups over the last several months and i will continue to do so republicans are doing that all over the country i wish my democratic colleagues would do the same thing and listen to the american public since last august our democratic colleagues went and hid because of the ire of the american public at least most of them did a lot of them did some you can see that didnt you can see the result on youtube right now today theres a tremendous anger expressed all across this country to our democratic colleagues about that bill i held town hall meetings last august in the 10th congressional district in georgia multiple of them and i was cheered because i was against obamacare i was cheered america has an opportunity to speak out now through americaspeakingout com but we need to change the policies weve got to stop this socialization nationalization of our private sector weve got to stimulate small businesses and the only way we can do that is to give them the money they need to expand their business to buy inventory my jobs act h r 4100 will do just that i hope that the american public that are watching right now will ask their congressmen to cosponsor it i ask my democratic colleagues to cosponsor h r 4100 and lets make it a bipartisan jobs act jumpstart our business sector the way i pay for all that is to take the unspent stimulus dollars to pay for the tax reduction so its paid for wont create any more debt it wont borrow from our childrens and our grandchildrens future it is a commonsense solution but thats not what were getting from our democratic colleagues were getting more government more central control from washington bigger bureaucracy higher taxes that are going to cost americans jobs send jobs overseas where people in the philippines or in china or whatever are working and doing jobs that americans could very well be doing but americans are not having the opportunity to do those jobs because the policies of nancy pelosi barack obama and harry reid are driving jobs offshore driving jobs away from america weve got to change those policies we do that through tax cuts john fitzgerald kennedy president kennedy cut taxes and what happened when he did we saw a tremendous growth of the economy president reagan did the same thing tremendous growth of the economy george w bush cut taxes tremendous growth of the economy the leadership of the house right now today wants to see those tax cuts that were put in place during all the years of the bush administration wants to see them expire thats going to kill more jobs here in this country and its going to mean that farmers and small businesses are going to have to close down and sell their assets just to pay their higher taxes that are going to be required im told from some of my democratic colleagues that there are many democrats that dont want to see those tax cuts expire theres some of our democratic colleagues that understand that allowing those tax cuts to expire at the end of this year is going to cost jobs so again the bipartisan approach to creating jobs is for us to at least keep those tax cuts because the jobs that are going to go away if those tax cuts expire wont go away so well save jobs the president has a fondness to talk about the jobs hes created or saved well nobody can know how many were saved weve seen some kind of funny finance calculations or accounting here because i know of one instance for instance as an example that one company got some stimulus funds and they gave everybody in their company raises they didnt hire any new persons not the first new employee but the government counted every one of those increases in wages as a new job as a new job thats inane its disingenuous its deceptive thats what we see over and over again weve got to stop that the american people deserve better and im excited about the grassroots movement if you want to call it the tea party movement its not just the tea party patriots tea party express americans for prosperity freedomworks i can go on and on about different groups the 9 12 group there are many what my liberal colleagues and the press dont understand is that this is a grassroots organization an effort in all these organizations its not one monolithic thing it is american citizens all over this country in their local communities that are speaking out theyre saying that theyre taxed enough already they see their jobs going away they want to go to work they see that the policies that we have been handed by barack obama and nancy pelosi and harry reid those policies are destroying jobs theyre putting millions of americans out of work and what they see is more of the same and they dont want more of the same theyre taxed enough already they want to see some changes and im excited because i believe were going to see some big changes in november big changes on november 2 see the most powerful political force in this country today is written about in the constitution of the united states and if you look at the document if you look at the document itself our founding fathers when they wrote the document those three first words of the constitution were bold and much much larger about four times larger three or four times larger than all the rest of the text what are those three words we the people we the people are speaking theyre saying where are the jobs republicans are saying where are the jobs what im hearing from the leadership on the other side from ms pelosi and company were going to give you more government more taxes more government control bigger government more government jobs but less in the private sector is what the bottom lines going to be weve got to stop this weve got to stop growing government and shrink it weve got to stop this outrageous spending weve got to repeal or replace obamacare with commonsense solutions that will maintain the quality of health care in this country continue to allow the doctors and the patients to make decisions instead of some washington bureaucrat which is going to happen under obamacare weve got to stop bailing out wall street and start bailing out small businesses by giving them the money that they need by allowing them to do business and leave the dollars in their pockets thats whats going to create new jobs thats whats going to put our economy back on track thats whats going to solve this economic downturn i heard when the president signed the financial reform billsocalled which its not it puts in place permanent bailouts for wall street its going to hurt main street banks the community banks its going to create bigger bureaucracy more government jobs it is going to make it more difficult for small businesses to go to their local banker and get a loan the president my liberal colleagues blamed a lack of financial regulations on the economic downturn but that is not what caused the economic downturn they are blind they want to blame as the previous speaker to me just blamed the bush administration that is what i keep hearing it is all bushs fault when are they going to take time when is ms pelosi going to take responsibility when is barack obama going to take responsibility for the disastrous disastrous policies that they are forcing down the throats of the american people it is past time for them to take responsibility but they are not doing it they are blaming the bush administration what caused the financial collapse was the government it is the community reinvestment act freddy and fannie poor fed policy there is some blame an wall street absolutely there is some blame even in main street main street banks greed is part of the cause of that but it was policy that was established by congress under the carter administration with the community reinvestment act then a reform socalled reform which essentially forced banks to make loans to people who couldnt pay it back then we have freddie and fannie who would buy off those loans poor fed policy that kept the interest rates low so that freddie and fannie could set up these nodocumentation or lowdocumentation loans that is what created the bubble and the burst so it is government the best way to control quantity quality and cost of all goods and services is a free enterprise system unencumbered by taxes and regulations you have two things on the one hand you have government control socialism on the other hand you have the free market system and the free market system will create jobs if we will allow it to do so that is not what we are getting we are getting bigger government which is going to kill jobs we need to stop that we need to create what has made this country so rich so powerful so successful as a political experiment in all of history we have got to go back to those foundational principles those foundational principles that are expressed in the declaration of independence and embodied in the governing force in the constitution of the united states as it was intended psalm 11 god asked a question he says if foundation should be destroyed what are the righteous to do god goes on talking about that he is sovereign and he reigns but how does he reign in public policy how does he reign in this country well certainly our creator reigns supernaturally but he also reigns through those of us who know him as lord and savior those of us who look to our creator for direction those of us who look to the judeochristian principles that our founding fathers held so firmly and those principles are based on personal responsibility and accountability those principles are based on the free market system on free enterprise where people have the ability and opportunity to succeed but they also have an opportunity to fail without an opportunity to fail you dont have an opportunity to succeed we see class warfare by our democratic colleagues where they hate the rich they want to tax them to the hilt they want to have a redistribution of wealth as president obama keeps talking about but what is he saying he is saying that he knows how to run everything in human endeavor that is what the leadership here believes they believe in central planning they believe government knows best they believe that government should tell us what to eat what car to drive and how to live our lives and what kind of health care we can have those policies destroy the free market destroy small business we see examples all over the world socialism has never worked never will work and i dont care whose socialism it is whether it is stalins mao zedongs castros hugo chavezs or barack obamas it is not going to work it never will work we have got to stop it and it is up to the american people to stop it the american people need to speak out go on americaspeakingout com demand from your congressman your senator that we stop this inane policy of creating bigger government higher taxes more regulation more government more control from washington say no to all of that and say yes to tax cuts to the free market system to freedom they want socialism i want freedom america

authority for an additional 3 months through march 31 2011 this 3month extension is not intended as the final decision on how long an extension should be authorized if the longterm bill cannot be

been compensated by that fund could not be because their sicknesses did not become evident till the fund closed thats why ken feinberg testifying before the judiciary committee urged us to reopen the fund which is one half of this bill this bill is necessary so that people in the future will know that you go and help people in a time of emergency this is not a new york bill this was an attack on the united states and is a special moral urgency because many of the people wouldnt be sick today if the federal government in the person of the epa had not lied had not told them the air was safe to breathe when we knew perfectly well that it wasnt safe to breathe i remember telling people dont go back to school dont go to work there dont go back to work in the federal office building because the air was not safe to breathe but the epa was saying go to work people went to work they are sick we owe them this bill we owe them their health we owe them treatment if we are going to get support in the future when we have another emergency i urge the passage of this bill i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.0005334615707397461, 0.5005334615707397, 0, "i yield myself such time as i may

of the tremendously successful habitat for humanity millard led the organization for more than three decades and through the application of what he called the economics of jesus helped to provide over 300 000 homes to the destitute and downtrodden across the globe however more than any of these things millard was a great man his selflessness serves as an inspiration to people throughout the nation and all across the world born to a grocer in lanett alabama millard refused to allow his modest beginnings to define the course of his life although he attained great fortune from his tireless efforts as a businessman he soon found that in order to live a life of fulfillment he had to dedicate himself to a simple life of devotion and service to a higher purpose 0i 1915 he traveled to africa in

law thats number one this bill will clarify that any use of the word census that is visible through the envelope would trigger a requirement to disclose the name and return address of the sender congress should not have to act twice to make it clear that it is wrong to imitate the census which is mandated by our constitution unfortunately the foolishness of the rnc has forced us to act again i want to thank all of my colleagues especially the ranking member of the committee congresswoman maloney and mr chaffetz and others especially their staffs who understand and recognize how important the census is and that we should not get involved in any kind of trickery when it comes to the census because there are so many things that depend on the census therefore to play around with it to me is so unfair when youre talking about really playing around with the lives of people because so many things are based on the fact that the count the count is so important so its my hope that the rnc will recognize this and stop this trickery because there is no place no time do we need that today we need to make certain that everybody fills out their census form and gets it back in as soon as
