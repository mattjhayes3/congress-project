racial health disparities i would like to thank my colleagues congressman hakeem jeffries and congresswoman joyce beatty for hosting this timely special order historically racial and ethnic minorities are likely to have the highest uninsured rates and are less likely to receive preventive and quality health care while the affordable care act has helped minorities afford health insurance and access quality care there is still a need to eliminate existing disparities for example the department of health and human services is currently working to expand access end racial and ethnic discrimination perform outreach to underserved communities improve workforce diversity and expand data collection and reporting while this is an ambitious plan it is one that is extremely necessary unfortunately coverage access and outreach may not be the only keys to eliminating disparities demographic characteristics contribute heavily to racial and ethnic health status for example research shows that privately insured african american and hispanic adults fare worse than privately insured white adults along measures to access and use of care unfortunately african americans and hispanics are less likely to have a regular provider than their white counterparts the same research also showed that privately insured african americans and hispanics had less confidence in their ability to pay for medical costs since social determinants like economic stability education and environment play such a large role in how we each view and access health care many of the changes necessary to eliminate racial and ethnic disparities require a much larger plan than just a focus on healthrelated programs reducing disparities in health truly entails addressing racial and ethnic social determinants such as availability of safe housing affordable food access to education job opportunities communitybased resources public safety public transportation and more our society must make many changes before we can truly eliminate racial and ethnic health disparities because that also means eliminating disparities in many other sectors i thank congressman jeffries and congresswoman beatty for hosting this

bipartisan 2year budget agreement that set guidelines for appropriations we should have final bills signed into law by now there are no excuses for these constant delays unfortunately republicans insistence on including dangerous harmful policies in spending bills that would restrict womens reproductive health decisions harm the environment and roll back consumer protections just to name a few delayed the ability of congress to come to a fair bipartisan agreement on time however we did know throughout this process that republicans would need democratic votes to pass the omnibus that is why i am pleased to say we were able to get rid of more than 150 poison pill riders including those related to womens health labor such as efforts to block the fiduciary rule and the joint employer rule consumer financial protection clean air and waterall gone however i was disappointed we were unable to reverse a 19yearold prohibition on federal funding for the research of gun violence the budget agreement enacted in november provided additional funding allowing us to make critical investments reflecting democratic values there are some large increases to the national institutes of health and

really speaking truth to power each and every week on behalf of the black caucus also to you congressman don payne thank you very much for your leadership and for really rising to the occasion on so many issues in the very short time that you have been here you have hit the ground running and really have made a tremendous difference i want to just speak for a few minutes as it relates to the review of the congressional black caucus for the last year or 2 years i have to just say that our leader mr butterfield has been a very bold and tremendous leader we have accomplished quite a bit and we have a lot more to do while 2015 has been very challenging i believe that the congressional black caucus has really stepped up and made a huge difference not only for the african american community and communities of color but for the entire country it has also been an inspiring year we have seen the birth and growth of the vital black lives matter movement we have also witnessed powerful and moving protests across the country in places like missouri new york and even in my district in oakland and in berkeley california with people of all backgrounds and ages coming together to demand justice to petition their government to exercise their democratic rights i am so proud of the young activists who are standing up and demanding an end to racism and injustice in many of our communities they are truly bringing the civil rights movement into the 21st century i want them to know that they have allies here in the peoples house for too long congress has ignored or brushed aside issues affecting the african american community and other communities of color it is past time that everyone steps up and does the good work that we were sent to washington to do that the congressional black caucus has done for many many decades we need to start by talking about and looking at what has happened with the voting rights act as you know this year marks the 50th anniversary of this landmark legislation the voting rights act was gutted by the supreme court in its shelby v holder decision and of course republican state legislators have fallen all over to restrict voting rights across the country everywhere these dangerous restrictions come in the form of voter id requirements elimination of sameday voter registration and really severe reduction in early voting efforts we must call these efforts for what they are republican attempts to take away one of our most fundamental rights but we will not let this happen i am so proud of the congressional black caucuscongresswoman terri sewell and john lewis and mr clyburn the entire congressional black caucus our bill h r 2867 the voting rights advancement act sponsored by congresswoman sewell who represents selma alabama would restore the preclearance provisions of the voting rights act for any state that has had 15 or more voting rights violations in the last 25 years in the preclearance process as dr king once said give us the ballot and we will fill our legislative halls with menand of course womenwith goodwill we can fill this body with those who really want to see democracy fulfilled so we need our young people to keep up the street heat and demand that congress act it is past time that we get serious about restoring the voting rights act and ensuring that all americansand that means all americanshave free and unobstructed access to the ballot box also the serious economic disparities that persist in the african american community are very very evident according to a report released earlier this year by the joint economic committee led by ranking member congresswoman carolyn maloney and the congressional black caucus we learned and it is very glaring that more than one in three black children are born into poverty and the african american poverty rate is three times that of white americans the cycle of poverty and inequality starts in our school systems where black students account for 42 percent of preschool student expulsions despite accounting for only 18 percent of enrollment now that is preschool expulsion every time i remember this and say this it really makes me very terrified about what is taking place with young black kids especially with young black boys because there is no way anybody no kids should be expelled from preschool that is ages 1 to 4 that is outrageous i am the mother yes of two fabulous great black men and i am the grandmother of two black boys and i find statistics like that very very troubling for african americans we have allowed our school system to be turned into a pipeline to prison we must act now to address systemic issues facing our education and our criminal justice systems i want to applaud congressman bobby scott and congressman conyers because they have worked for decades on criminal justice reform and we are beginning to see some progress as a result of their very diligent work our criminal justice system is broken it needs to be rebuilt from the ground up so alongside of our cbc colleagues once again we are calling for comprehensive criminal justice reform also i want to mention our effort which i cochair with chairman butterfield our tech 2020 initiative silicon valley is right next to my district in california there are great opportunities there for everyone however the tech industry has not been inclusive of hiring and contracting with and working with communities of color especially the african american community so i am very pleased that the tech 2020 of the congressional black caucus has been initiated we are working with our great leader reverend jesse jackson with an insideoutside strategy many of the tech companies understand what is taking place and that they need to be an industry that is inclusive of everyone so the black caucus along with rainbow push along with the tech industry are working on a variety of strategies to make sure that this industry which provides goodpaying jobs and opportunities is an industry that is inclusive that does not discriminate and that includes the diversity of this great country so i have to just say to congresswoman kelly and congressman payne thank you for giving us a chance to talk about so many of the issues that we have been working on when you look at the issue of poverty cutting poverty in half in 10 years we know how to do it we have legislation the half in ten act h r 258 to do that and the pathways out of poverty act h r 2721 we know how to provide opportunities the congressional

health report this report sparked the first serious discussion in washington on addressing the deep racial health disparities that exist in this country this year also marks 50 years since the creation of medicare and medicaidprograms that have kept and continue to keep americans healthy we are also celebrating the fifth year anniversary of the passage of the affordable care actthe most significant legislation to improve the health of all americans in more than a generation these legislative achievements continue moving us closer to health equity for allhowever major health disparities still exist the zip code in which you are born still determines your likely life expectancy gross disparities exist from zip code to zip codeeven within the same city or county so today i rise to join my colleagues in the congressional black caucus to bring to light the state of black health in america and call for more action to address persistent and lingering disparities in health access treatment and care since the passage of the affordable care act access to care has dramatically expanded in communities of color the uninsured rate has declined 7 3 percent in the african american community and more people have access to affordable quality healthcareall thanks to the affordable care act when we were crafting the affordable care act i had the privilege of serving as chair of the congressional black caucus and let me tell you we worked day and night with our colleagues in the congressional hispanic caucus and congressional asian pacific american caucus to push congress and the administration to craft the best possible bill since its passage the affordable care act has improved the american health care system healthcare is now more affordable and accessible than ever women can no longer be discriminated against because they are a woman have a preexisting conditionsuch as hiv aidsor have been the victim of domestic violence young people can stay on their parents health insurance until they are 26 and people with serious conditions like cancer no longer face the real fear of hitting their lifetime cap and being denied lifesaving treatment the aca also expands the capacity of the healthcare delivery system to better serve those at risk for and living with hiv aids these are the facts the affordable care act has dramatically increased access to preventative care for women lowincome communities and people of color despite rabblerousing and grandstanding from the right this law is saving livesevery day in communities across americafrom maine to my district in the east bay during the last enrollment period 16 4 million americans obtained health insurance and more than half a million came from my home state of california make no mistakethe affordable care act is working african americans and latinos historically underinsured or uninsured groups have seen the greatest declines in their uninsured rates this is especially good news for african americans who are living with hiv where the key to halting the epidemic is access to affordable and quality care with this increase in coverage we are beginning to close the gap in racial and ethnic health disparities and access to care however much work remains to truly realize health equity in america right nowin america the richest and most powerful country in the worldafrican americans still suffer from disproportionately high numbers of preventable deaths disparities in access to quality health care and underrepresentation within the medical community african americans have the highest mortality rate of any racial and ethnic group from cancer furthermore africanamericans are 40 more likely to die from a stroke than whites and 30 more likely to die from heart disease than whites and while african americans are only 13 of the unitedstates population they account for nearly half of all new hiv infections african americans also account for the highest hivrelated deaths and hiv death rates madam speakerthis is unacceptable in an age where technology and innovation are paving the way to new medical breakthroughs these persistent disparities in healthcare cannot be

every other corridor across the countrythat you get to keep your profits and improve your infrastructure and actually have greater ridership numbers in the process amtrak has made some great strides in this bill we are cutting our authorizations by 40 percent i think it is a great opportunity to actually highlight some of the successes that they have had but to also demand more this also defunds highspeed rail we want to make sure that what is happening in california does not happen in the rest of the country where you have great rail projects going with higher speedwith highspeed moving into new york and floridawe want to make sure that we dont have the same challenges that are plaguing californias highspeed rail which has tripled in price we also have other conservative issues in here that will get rid of waste that includes the food and beverage losses that we see year after year we want to make sure that amtrak is moving in the right direction to eliminate those losses this builds american infrastructure and creates jobs to fix centuryold infrastructure problems it unlocks the rrif program a program which has billions of dollars in it yet every year when you are going to upgrade your infrastructure when you have a new project this is one of the least areas that you want to work in because rrif is so much of a challenge there are long timelines long approval processes if you are going to invest in something you want to know am i going to win out this loan application or is it something that is going to actually hinder or slow down our project we want to streamline that we want to have those who need the access to capital that are going to improve our infrastructure to actually have the benefits of that program this introduces competition and leverages the private sector to reduce the amtrak subsidies and actually use the stations to be more profitable amtrak has stations in many key cities that can be utilized to increase profits from everything from the restaurants and shopping that they have but to also be able to advertise in those stations and advertise on the rightofway the right of way that amtrak has to be able to use billboards set up cell sites there is so much more profitability that we can have by having amtrak as a partner i just want to touch on a couple of final issues one of the challenges that freight rails have is the red tape they have to go through on the environmental process and on the historical review process in this reform bill we are not saying that you dont have to go through that process we are just saying that we are going to streamline it so you can go through it quickly there ought to be timelines you ought to be able to meet timelines so you can plan your infrastructure and you can plan those jobs so you can actually move america forward and move our rail forward at the same time this also empowers states we have taken this reform bill to the next level we reformed the state routes last priia bill we are doing it again this time to empower states to have more control over their routes if a train is going to come through their district or their state they ought to have some input on not only whether or not it is going to stop but also increasing ridership in that process they ought to have some skin in the game and this allows them to do that one area that i want to mention that i think has created more bipartisanship than anything else in this bill and somebody else that should receive some recognition is actually my dog lilly who will now be able to ride on the train"],

taxpayersupported housing actually exceeded the maximum allowable income to qualify for housing assistance importantly roughly triple that number is on a wait list for housing in fact those on the wait list are economically qualified worse to pay for these overincome tenants american taxpayersyou and iare on the hook for 104 million next year while hundreds of thousands of desperate lowincome american families legitimately in need of taxpayersupported housing today sit on those lists idly waiting for muchneeded help tens of thousands of overincome tenants sit in taxpayersupported housing in one instance a new york family with an income of nearly 500 000 is receiving taxpayersubsidized public housing in nebraska an individual with double the income limit and 1 6 million in assets is living in taxpayersupported housing paying 300 a month in my home state of florida we have many cases as well it is very clear that eliminating this kind of waste fraud and abuse is the reason that we serve today it is critical that we do so a combination of inadequate congressional directives and an indifferent federal bureaucracy has let down the american peoplethe people who trust congress to responsibly and effectively allocate tax dollars it has also let down the lowincome families on the wait list who are hoping for an opportunity to climb out of poverty i am pleased that the house acted responsibly yesterday to pass legislation to stop this failed policy section 103 of the housing opportunity through modernization act sets clear requirements for hud and now for local housing authorities under this section households currently in public housing whose income exceeds 120 percent of the median income level for 2 consecutive years will no longer be permitted to receive taxpayer assistance further public housing authorities will be required to report annually to congress and the american people on tenant incomes so that we might maintain proper oversight of this program these are reasonable reforms that bring accountability to a federal program that desperately needs it ensures a smooth pathway for overincome households to a reasonable transition off of taxpayer assistance and should create new opportunities for those on the wait list i am also pleased to see that hud is finally taking steps to address this matter it is far too late but at least they are just yesterday the agency announced that it will consider a muchneeded new rule to strengthen oversight of overincome tenancy in public housing we should not rest until we can be sure that taxpayer dollars those of the men and women who entrust us to represent them are going to support only those american families most in need of assistance we still have much work remaining but with

required when the federal government is your client recognizing the importance of subcontracts the small business act requires that prime contractors submit subcontracting plans for contracts valued at certain levels and sba to set goals for subcontracting dollars awarded to small businesses yet throughout the course of this congress our committee has heard testimony of countless witnesses indicating that not only are prime contractors not reporting their subcontracting dollars but also that contracting officers are not holding these firms accountable for their subcontracting goals even

appointed nothing is going to happen until 2024 so the question you have to ask yourself is why are we out here well we are out here because some people think that trying to control costs in health care is a bad idea if you go back and read the medicare legislation when it was put in the ama extracted from this congress the right to charge their usual and customary fees they have been driving the costs and we have been trying to control it with all kinds of mechanisms all the way through it only with the incidence of the aca have we seen the curve come down we have actually extended the life of medicare to 2030 right now we are spending 17 percent of our gross domestic product on health care when i came to this congress it was about 12 or 13 percent it has only gone up we have not been able to do it ourselves so the creators of this bill said lets put something in on the outside that can give us some suggestions now when we had simpsonbowlesand i know the chairman of the ways and means committee thought the simpsonbowles idea was a good ideawhat happened after it was brought out in public nothing we ignored it the reason for ipab is to put pressure on the congress to act to control costs i guess republicans dont care about costs because they dont understand that there are 10 000 people signing up for social security every single day that is 3 5 million people the numbers are going up the costs are going to go up people are going to run around here saying we have got to cut benefits we have got to shift the costs to the old people we have got to do all this the ipab was a way to force the congress to face the consequences of their own inaction dr roe is correct we spent 16 years kicking the can down the road on this issue of sgr that was again an attempt to control costs it never worked it was illconceived in the beginning this is an issue where there is some real muscle in it and people are afraid of that they are afraid of it 9 years out because they know how the congress does this is just another way to try to undercut and make medicare and the aca not work mr levin pointed out the other thing that is important and that is the place they look for the money is to go to community health health departments nobody needs health departments why do you need people looking at restaurants to see if they are safe to go into or to look at the water

revenue sources and to report on the strategy and resources needed for success the islamic state is one of the worlds most violent and dangerous terrorist groups its goals to build a caliphate in the

businesses and it is an issue that is always on their minds complicated rules and duplicative requirements can create burdens for small firms across a wide range of industries unchecked regulations can reduce companies profitability causing them to reduce employment and in the worst cases even go out of business it is for these very reasons that president barack obama has taken strong actions he has issued several broadbased executive orders on rulemaking most importantly he instructed agencies to conduct retrospective review of their regulations these reviews have resulted in nearterm cost savings to the unitedstates economy of 10 billion he has always required agencies to estimate the costs and benefits of regulations consider less burdensome alternatives and incorporate those that are affected by regulations into the rulemaking process taken together these efforts are helping to rein in regulatory costs while ensuring that agencies can carry out their mission it is against this backdrop that we are considering the bill before us today too often on the house floor legislation is painted as either being totally perfect or completely awful with this bill neither of these characterizations is appropriate in fact on many fronts h r 527 contains several very positive provisions and will make a real difference for small businesses many of these provisions were contained in legislation that passed out of the small business committee when i was the chair together with current chairman chabot who was then the ranking member we passed a regulatory reform bill unanimously out of our committee for instance the bill makes the agencys reg flex analyses more detailed so that they cannot simply overlook their obligations to small businesses it also gives real teeth to periodic regulatory lookbacks which require agencies to review outdated regulations that remain on the books agencies will also be required to evaluate the entire impact of their regulations something that is long overdue and it cannot go without mention that the bill brings the irs under the purview of the rfa this is a real improvement for small firms who will undoubtedly benefit from greater scrutiny of complex and burdensome tax rules these are all constructive changes that will bring real relief to small businesses with that said there are other items in this legislation that leave you scratching your head adding so many new agencies to the panel process is a recipe for disaster such a dramatic change will require new bureaucratic processes more staff and more paperwork it must be ironic for my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that this bill attempts to reduce federal regulation by dramatically expanding the role and scope of government it also applies reg flex to land management plans something i have never heard small businesses complain about in my 17 years on the committee doing so will enable corporate interests to more readily challenge land use decisions which could have adverse consequences for the environmental stewardship of public lands the reality is that the rfa was just not intended to cover these types of actions and it should not do so going forward another headscratcher is the creation of another office of size standard within the small business administration the sba already has one and does not need two there is simply no reason to create this bureaucratic duplication i think both sides of the aisle would agree that during a time of fiscal constraint we do not need to be wasting money on a new office when it already exists in the very same agency finally it is important to note that the office of advocacys footprint has traditionally been minimal with a budget of 9 million and 46 employees according to cbo its budget would have to potentially double to handle the new responsibilities of h r 527 cbo also notes that the private sector could also face increased costs federal agencies will likely charge the private sector higher fees to carry out the new responsibilities under this bill simply put now is not the time to make costly statutory leaps when smaller steps are more appropriate it is important to remember that tinkering with our regulatory system will not turn the economy around and create jobs that we need in our communities in order to make real inroads we need to instead provide businesses with the capital they need to start up and grow through affordable lending and getting more customers through their doors the best way to achieve that is by increasing the federal minimum wage in the end legislation such as this detracts us from the real task at hand creating real jobs through substantive progrowth policies so in conclusion there are some good and some not so good things in this bill
