taking social security and medicare funds paid from the wages of working people and returning it through tax cuts to the corporations and individuals who are least in need the public deserves an honest longterm budget but congress is not able to provide one when there is such a broad disconnect between what the republican leadership promises and what they deliver the opportunity for an honest

has done we have done work together on immunization and childrens health issues i thank the gentlewoman from the virgin islands who chairs the congressional black caucus task force on health it is important that we are here today but i imagine that all of us would wish that we were not i think as evidenced by our message 20 years of aids is enough it points to the fact that we are only here to be able to highlight the need for greater focus and emphasis and recognition that it is not my problem it is our problem it is not his problem or her problem it is our problem i will try to focus on where do we go from here and some of the things and the efforts that we have made collaboratively together i am very proud to have joined the gentlewoman from california one of the speakers that will come f6rward and those of us on the floor of the house as we worked on issues like debt relief and also the marshall plan but as we have done that we are continuing to work and to talk about questions of prescription drugs or the issue of being able to provide generic drugs in a way that all people can have access to them particularly i want to note that this is a worldwide issue though we have highlighted the continent of africa knowing that 40 million children by 2005 will be orphaned by those who are hiv infected and will have died in subsahara africa i also realize that this disease is spreading to india it is spreading to china some of the largest population centers in the world if we were to take it back home it is particularly devastating to note that women are the highest numbers of hiv infected particularly africanamerican women and latino women it is important to note that states where one would not think or would possibly bdgin to want to isolate states so that is an urban problem versus a rural problem there are over 50 000 reported aids cases in texas alone over half of these are among blacks and hispanics or over 50 percent of those with aids in my district in particular in texas african americans represent a staggering 64 percent reportable hiv infections and 57 percent of the total cases diagnosed in 2000 even more frightening statistics is the fact that 84 percent of the adolescents with reportable hiv infection are african american women represent an estimated 30 percent of new hiv infections in the united states and a growing share of newly reported aids cases each year in 1986 women accounted for 67 percent of the new aids cases by 1999 women accounted for nearly a quarter of al aids cases in this country worldwide women account for 42 percent of all aids cases which is nearly triple the number 10 years ago although african americans and latinos represent less than a fourth of all women in the united states they account for more than a third of all reported aids cases women in the 18th district of texas and throughout texas have not escaped the epidemic the percentage of texas women with aids increased from 14 3 percent to 15 4 percent just between 1997 and 1999 it is important just to lay these particular issues on the table because i hope that as we emphasize 20 years of aids is enough again i say that we focus on where do we go in the future what we have tried to do is to talk about prevention and to break down the barriers that keep people from understanding what aids is and how it can be prevented so in my community let me applaud a number of initiatives by magic 102 a radio station with their general manager we have created a whole series of sessions or fares or programs or efforts throughout the community to focus on testing hiv testing have you been tested therefore we are going around the community focusing on encouraging people to be tested privately of course and we are doing that in conjunction with the city of houston health department i want to thank dr kendricks and marilee p brown for acknowledging and declaring houston as an emergency center an emergency crisis if you will regarding aids about a year ago out of that the consciousness of people in the community have been raised up to begin to talk about it in the religious community as well as throughout the community our churches are engaged in talking about how do we prevent the infection of hiv aids because we are finding that it is being promoted or it is being encouraged by economic cultural legal and religious factors where people have no control of it about a quarter of all women report postponing medical care due to barriers such as sickness or lack of transportation or lack of health care it is tragic to know that research prevention efforts education substance abuse treatment and prevention programs need to be targeted towards women especially africanamerican and hispanic women so we need culturally sensitive programs the same thing in india and china as it moves throughout the world culturally sensitive programs when we went to africa one of the issues that we discussed in zambia and uganda was programs that related to the culture of africans so that they would be eager to come and find out information when i was in botswana just a few weeks ago we found a center where a gentleman living with hiv aids was the chief spokesperson and outreach coordinatqr he was able to speak to his fellow botswanans about the importance of prevention but also testing and removing the shackles and the barriers from that clearly much remains to be done to fight the disease and many look to africanamerican leaders in congress for this guidance a new york times columnist recently demanded that the socalled leaders of the black community the politicians the heads of civil rights organizations the preachers step forward and say in thundering tones that it is time to bring an end to this destructive behavior let me answer that by saying we are all collectively standing up in the fight what we must do is collaborate with government to be able to have the resources and create the research and have the cdc continue to do its work along with the nih on finding a cure for aids our voices have risen and we need to be listened to in this congress as we begin to appropriate dollars as we appropriate the ryan white treatment dollars for all of us we must ensure that those dollars will reach out to culturally sensitive organizations such as the donald watkins organization in houston that responds to the needs of our particular cultural communities along with all of our others let me close by mentioning a gentleman in my community that i pay tribute to as a symbol of someone who has lived with aids and fights it every day david swem in houston who is at 6 feet tall and a mere 122 pounds has been able to fight aids and he has been fighting it since his diagnosis in 1987 by taking 50 pills per day that is overwhelming that that is what has to happen for people who are living with aids that is why it is so very important for prevention and so very important ultimately to find a cure might i also say as noted by the gentlewoman from north carolina as chair of the congressional childrens caucus there is nothing more devastating than an hivinfected child or a child that has fullblown aids nkosi johnson in south africa a young man that we got to know some 2 years or so ago recently died just a week or so ago born with hiv from an hiv mother transmitted through that hiv mother who could not take care of him adopted by a loving south african woman nkosi became the symbol of a precocious child who wanted to stand up and tell the world that he deserved dignity although he lived with fullblown aids children such as nkosi should be enjoying a life filled with joy and laughter and happiness mandela said in a recent statement on a frightening scale hiv aids is replacing that joy laughter and happiness with paralyzing pain nkosi collapsed with brain damage and viral infections but before that in his short life he contested the policies that kept hivinfected children out of public schools in south africa he talked about his infection challenging people to reexamine their fear of those inflicted with aids he spoke at the world aids conference in south africa woke our collective consciouses up and beganto acknowledge that it was important to be able to fight this disease in dignity to nkosi johnson in his loss a south african child but a child of the world i believe that it should be our tribute tonight that 20 years of hiv aids fullblown aids is enough so to the gentleman from texas and the gentlewoman from the virgin islands might i say that tonight as we speak in acknowledgment of 20 years of hiv infection in this country and discovery of the aids virus that we also commit ourselves if we will to continued legislative initiatives that collectively fights this devastating disease i rise today on an occasion that perhaps none of us foresaw in 1981 and certainly none of us welcomes nowthe 20th year of the hiv aids epidemic instead of the eradication of the disease we continue to face 40 000 new infections per year an increase in the disease among women an infection rate at plague proportions in africa and a possible upswing in the disease among gay men it has left behind people such as david swem at houston who at 6 feet and a mere 1221 2 pounds has been able to fight aids since his diagnosis in 1987 by taking 50 pills per day but he has lost about 300 friends to the disease i will continue to cry out about this disease until it no longer exists more people have died from hiv aids over the last twenty years than from any other disease in history21 8 million people in this country we have been able to slow the rate of aids deaths but the disease is at crisis proportions in subsaharan africa where fourfifths of those deaths have occurredan average of one death every eight seconds the houston chronicle reports that 95 5ercent of all aids cases are in the developing world and that this strain of aids could cause a drastic explosion if it jumps to the western world more than 70 percent of all people living with the disease or 25 3 million hivpositive individuals live in africa over 10 percent of the population is infected in sixteen african nations the unitedstates census bureau calculates that by 2010 average life expectancy will be reduced by 40 years in zimbabwe and botswana and in south africa by 30 years the disease destabilizes these nations by decimating its workforce destroying any economic prosperity depleting its military and peacekeeping forces and leaving thousands of orphans the epidemic is not limited to africa indeed the fastest growing front of the epidemic is now in russia where the number of new infections last year exceeded the total from all previous years combined in 2000 the number of russians living with hiv aids skyrocketed from 130 000 to 300 000 the statistics are alarming in this country as well in its june 1 2001 report the cdc noted that aids in the united states remains primarily an epidemic affecting gay men and racial and ethic minorities rates are high among minorities because factors such as high poverty rates unemployment and lack off access to health care form barriers to hiv testing diagnosis and treatment the cdc study also noted the alarming figure of an infection rate of 14 percent of young black gay or bisexual men based on a study in seven cities there are over 50 000 reported aids cases in texas alone and over half of these are among blacks and hispanics are over 50 percent of those with aids in my district in texas african americans represent a staggering 64 percent of reportable hiv infections and 57 percent of the total cases diagnosed in 2000 an even more frightening statistic is the fact that 84 percent of the adolescents with reportable hiv infection are africanamerican women represent an estimated 30 percent of new hiv infections in the united states and a growing share of

latinas represent less than a fourth of all women in the unitedstates they account for more than a third of all reported aids cases women in the 18th district of texas and throughout texas have not escaped this epidemic the percentage of texas women with aids has increased from 14 3 percent to 15 4 percent just between 1997 and 1999 1999 being the last full year for which data is available in my district currently about 27 percent of new hiv infections are among africanamerican women a staggering 82 percent of all hiv infections among women were in the africanamerican community similarly 79 percent of the reported aids cases in women were among africanamerican women despite these steady increases in hiv aids cases among both women and children funding for these groups has decreased in fy1999 women and youth received 2 87 million in funding via title iv of the ryan white care act and 2 72 million in fy2000 many factors exacerbate womens risk of hiv infection many women particularly in areas such as subsaharan africa are especially vulnerable to hiv infection because economic cultural legal or religious factors may limit control over their lives and their ability to protect themselves from infection or to gain access to treatment about a quarter of all women report postponing medical care due to barriers such as sickness or lack of transportation what more needs to be done research prevention efforts and education and substance abuse treatment and prevention programs must be targeted towards women especially in the africanamerican and hispanic communities these programs should include research into femalecontrolled barrier methods prevention efforts targeting young women early comprehensive sex education and substance abuse treatment and prevention programs targeted to women we can also take an example from places such as the thomas street clinic in houston the nations first freestanding hiv aids treatment facility thomas street clinic provides patients with access to a full range of services including medical services counseling housing job placement assistance and child care this clinic is a model for our nation particularly for providers in disadvantaged urban and minority areas clearly much remains to be done to fight the disease and many look to african american leaders in congress for this guidance i am here to say that we are here and we are pleading for an end to behaviors that lead to hiv aids for better health care for more funding for research treatment and prevention and for desperately needed social services for those whose lives have been upended by the infection congress cannot fight this disease alone butwe are firmly committed to the battle i include the following article for the record as follows"],

because it was he who masterminded the plan to restore china to the common people which led to what is called the republic of china today 2045 dr sun yatsen was born on november 12 1866 in hsiangshan county near the city of canton in southern china where he had local schooling in tradi tional chinese texts until he was 13 years old when he then went to join his brother in hawaii in hawaii he studied at the missionary school and graduated from oahu college he then returned to china and began his medical studies at the college of medicine for chinese in hong kong and received his medical degree in 1892 dr sun yatsen practiced medicine briefly in hong kong in 1893 after which he became strongly involved in the political scene of china it was in the midst of the war between the boxer rebellion and europeans that dr sun yatsen started plans for his own revolution in 1894 when he went to beijing and discovered that the government had done little for the good of the people he returned to hawaii where he organized the review china society for his revolutionary purpose a branch was established in hong kong as an agricultural study society when planswere made to seize control of the government unfortunately the plans failed which led to dr suns flight to japan and later to london in 1896 where he was arrested and imprisoned for 12 days by the chinese and later released dr sun did not let this stop him he used his educational knowledge by spending time at the british museum library where he invented the three peoples principles his most important work which later became the fundamental basis for the government in china he also advocated a five power constitution which included the examination of unsorial branches in addition to the executive legislative and judicial branches for purposes of control when he returned to japan from europe in 1905 he formed another revolutionary society called the tong meng hui the chinese revolutionary league which consisted of his former revolutionaries in japan and young chinese intellectuals studying in china at that time dr suns leagues uprising of rebels and encouraging of people to speak out in hunan province led to political unrest in the ching dynasty under the control of the emperor pu yi also in the fall of 1911 his tong meng hui league was involved in the important uprising in the wuchang where rebels seized control of the government which led to that day being called the double ten day and led to the name change of china to the republic of china in january of 1912 dr sun returned to china where he was elected provisional president of the new republic it was during his reign that he transformed his revolutionary organization into a political party called the nationalist party or kuomintang in early 1913 his party won more seats than any rivals since chinas firstever national elections later that year he was forced into exile and married his second wife soong chingling in 1914 in japan nevertheless dr sun never gave up hope for china because he assembled a government made up of his old party when he settled in canton he later allied with the communist international of moscow due to the need for military supplies and advisers to strengthen his political organization so that he would be able to break the hold of individual military leaders in south china and create a new unified government with forces in north china it was on his way to meet with the northern militarists that he fell ill and died in beijing in march of 1925 due to an inoperable liver cancer dr sun yatsens corpse became a complex political symbol with his body being preserved and kept at a temple on the outskirts of beijing where people from all walks of life including generals and political figures came to pay homage to him his kuomintang party after their victory about 20 years later honored him by building a gigantic mausoleum near the capital of nanjig where they buried him which made his burial an event of political enshrinement i commend the community of chineseamericans in chicago for establishing the sun yatsen museum at 2245 south wentworth avenue"], [0.9488868117332458,

to be meaningful participants in the planning process numerous examples have been provided throughout the country of how cooperative efforts have resulted in positive results including valuable and important environmental benefits these are real environmental benefits that would not have been realized if the federal agencies had not consulted with the local gateway community some have made the inaccurate accusation that this bill would provide veto power to gateway communities to prevent federal agencies from taking a particular action this is simply not true there is nothing in this bill that would do that however the premise of the bill is that just as federal agencies formally consider impacts upon wildlife issues of habitat and natural resource and environmental issues before taking a proposed action that they should also consider and include gateway communities in their decisionmaking process congress has repeatedly passed laws based upon the supposition that informed decisionmaking is good decisionmaking this bill would simply ensure that that takes place cooperation and coordination ought to be the standard operating procedure rather than simply anecdotal stories of where federal agencies are doing what they ought to be doing anyway i ultimately the federal lands and their visitors will benefit from these requirements for example transportation plans for federal lands will be vastly improved when federal agencies understand through coordination that has taken place from the earliest stages where that community plans to direct its own resources and its own traffic outside the park it is also interesting to me that some have expressed concern that this bill is flawed because it does not impose new requirements upon a gateway community that would prevent them from going forward with an action unless they have certified that it would not impact a park unit what this amounts to is that they would like to have veto authority over what takes place outside federal lands if it is perceived to have an impact upon those lands but at the same time refuse to allow that simple coordination that must take place with a community as part of the decisionmaking process i believe communities are most likely to take actions that are also in the best interests of the federal lands when their decisionmaking rests upon a foundation of cooperation

africans have already died of aids since the beginning of the pandemic and 25 million africans are living with hiv aids over 6 000 people die from aidsrelated diseases every day in subsaharan africa the pandemic has been especially devastating for children approximately 1 million children are living with hiv aids in subsaharan africa and an estimated 600 000 african infants become infected with hiv each year through mothertochild transmission either at birth or through breast feeding the joint united nations program on hiv aids u n aids projects that at least half of all 15yearolds will eventually die of aids in the worstaffected countries such as zambia botswana and south africa furthermore over 12 million african children have lost their mother to aids and are considered aids

workforce enriched by 450 000 engineers 238 000 teachers 91 000 scientists 67 000 doctors 22 000 dentists and another million collegeeducated men and women it is estimated that another 5 million men and women received other schooling or job training using the gi bill all told approximately 7 8 million men and women were educated or trained by the gi bill helping to create what we know as the modern middle class the original gi bill exceeded all expectations and had enormous benefits beyond the immediate benefits given to our deserving war veterans college enrollment grew dramatically in

rutgers university saw its admissions grow from a prewar high of 7 000 to almost 16 000 a veterans administration study in 1965 showed that due to the increased earning power of gi bill college graduates federal government income tax revenues rose by more than 1 billion annually and in less than 20 years the 14 billion cost of the original program had been recouped there is widespread
