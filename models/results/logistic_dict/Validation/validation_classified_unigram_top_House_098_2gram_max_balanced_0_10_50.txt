and i would like to lead off in putting that in perspective by first of all thanking you for your indulgence during that period of time when words got a little heated and things got a little sticky at times we appreciate the work that the chair did during that period of time and we thank you for putting up with what was sometimes a tough situation but it seems to me that it is important to understand that we opened up this legislative session by trying to point out that there is a problem in this house of representatives the problem is that the majority party the liberals in this body who talk so much about fairness but who are perfectly willing to use rules and laws to trample the minority do not play by the rules when the rules are used in a way which they do not agree with they simply ignore the rules and go on that is not only unfair it is downright dictatorial that was a part of a number of things that were done on this house floor today first of all it was raised by the majority leader that we should dispense with calendar wednesday that request was objected to why was it objected to because calendar wednesday is a means by which we can get around the scheduling that takes place by the majority leadership in the last several weeks of the previous session what we found was that the majority leadership was perfectly willing to use the schedule of the house for its own purposes so one of the things that we have had to decide is that we will not permit that to go on without some sort of counterforce and that counterforce can be the calendar wednesday rule that would at least allow legislation to come to the floor through some other means than the schedule put forth by the majority leadership that may not produce everything that we want but it will assure that a broader base of legislation will come before this house and that the individual members of this house will have more say in what it is that is considered that is the kind of democracy that this house of representatives is supposed to be it is the kind of democracy that we ought to be pursuing not abandoning through unanimous consent requests every week later on a number of us asked unanimous consent to bring to the floor some pieces of legislation that have languished in house committees for literally years i personally asked that we bring to the floor the school prayer amendment why did i do that that is an amendment that has been around for almost 20 years the american people have for that whole period over 20 years supported that amendment by overwhelming numbers the polling data shows 80 percent of the people on an average support the idea of allowing a constitutional amendment that would allow voluntary prayer in the public schools yet in that 20year period we have not been able to get the vote on this house floor for something that the american people are overwhelmingly in favor of why because in the unfair committee structure that we discussed at some length earlier on they do not permit that kind of legislation to come to the floor what happened well the request that we made was a far fairer request than that which brought the equal rights amendment to the floor just the other day the request that i made was for an open rule that would allow for consideration of that amendment an open rule meaning that we would have been allowed to debated amendments and we would have been allowed full debate of the issue the other day when the majority leadership scheduled a constitutional amendment on the floor they did it under a gag rule that allowed no amendments and 30 minutes of debate so what we were proposing was a far fairer procedure than that which the majority party has used within the last few weeks to bring a constitulonal amendment to the floor what happened well the gentleman from texas turned down our ability to consider that issue he singly decided that this house should not consider prayer we have some other requests that we said the house ought to consider first a balanced budget amendment that also was turned down we say now that we ought to consider line item vetoes since the grace commission recently recommended that as a way to get a handle on 200 billionayear deficits that was turned down we said that on this day when there are thousands of americans in washington d c standing up for the rights of the unborn that amendment ought to come out here to at least be voted on that too was turned down all of those amendment were to be brought out here under a procedure much fairer than the procedure that was used for the equal rights amendment just a few weeks ago but they were turned down it is unfair it is dictatorial so what we then said was that we needed to have some time some time over the next several weeks to discuss some of these matters to have some time of our own since we do not get the time from the democrats since they will not allow those issues to come out here on this floor to be discussed then we ought to have some time of our own to discuss those issues and to let the american people know exactly what is going on in this body so i requested time time for each of the days that we are to be in session in this legislative year i requested 4 hours of time to have some debate controlled by the minority and what happened on that well once again the dictatorship of the majority came down hard once again they said flatly no they said even though you are within the rules even though the rules clearly allow you to take that time we are not going to permit it there is no way we are going to allow you to schedule that kind of debate and allow the minority to make its case to the american people this is the party of fairness now we are talking about the party that says they stand up for minority rights the party that says that they believe in open discussion and open debate that is what they say but their actions do not prove it and i would say to the members that rev jesse jackson who was making some comments about what is going on in the democratic convention has a point because they have been practicing exactly those kinds of tactics right here on the house floor for years jesse jackson has found the convention unfair and i am sure it is i am sure the rules there have been stacked for the good old boy i just like the rules around here are stacked for the good old boys to make sure that the candidate selected is not really a free choice but is mandated by the procedures it is appalling what happened when lie took his case to the executive committee the other day well they ran him out they said there is no way they are going to consider changing their rules so much for that minority participation in the democratic convention so much for minority participation here on the house floor i think the amf ican people need to understand and they need to become concerned about the fact that their house has become a virtual dictatorship in which you had better go along or you dont get along in which you had better sit back and accept your fate or they will use their rules to roll over you like a steamroller that is a sad commentary it is not unprecedented however this house has had dictatorships of the majority in the past there have been other times when the rules have become a cover for outright dictatorship and the house has seen fit to move toward reforming itself and changing that status quo it appears to me as though it is time for a change now and i for one and i think a number of my colleagues are committed to trying to bring about some of those changes over the next several weeks i think it is important that the american people once again have a body in congress where they truly have a say where there is fairness where equal voices are heard so that the nations business can be articulated in a way which reflects the peoples will that is not the case here this has become a body of the elite that elitism is trqmpling democracy and

mis sile because no secure basing mode was available we were told then that the mx could not be placed in existing silos because it would be vulnerable we were told that the mx was critical for our defense because only the mx could help close the window of vulnerability we were told and we all agree that the unitedstates nuclear arsenal required a weapon that could survive a first strike because that was necessary to deter war we have now received a report which urges us to base the mx in existing silos which are already targeted by the soviet union under close scrutiny the window of vulnerability has disappeared and deterrence is being promised with a basing mode that would invite a first strike by the other side we have been encouraged by some who suggest that because we will require a reduced number of missiles we are saving 10 billion i contend that if this dangerously destabilizing scheme were free it would still cost too much it would cost too much because we will not use it in a first strike and we cannot use it for measured retaliation its vulnerability requires that we launch it within the 30 minutes when an attack is first detected and the first enemy missiles land when the russians see it coming do we really expect them to leave their missiles in hardened sites awaiting the arrival of the mx i listen to the argument that to build the mx and place it in vulnerable silos is a demonstration of our national will and find it lacking our national will is amply demonstrated by our willingness to spend billions of dollars on submarine based ballistic missiles cruise missiles and conventional weapons our national will is demonstrated by our eagerness to end the madness of another round in the arms race and to seek a reasonable negotiation for the reduction of nuclear weapons surely the russians are as perplexed as our european allies at an expression of national will that would lead us to base mx in vulnerable silos the destabilizing nature of a weapon that can only rationally be used for a first strike does not reflect our national willit reflects another step in the direction of disaster the concept of deterrence requires that our adversaries realize that to start a nuclear war will result in unacceptable losses to them of the 9 000 nuclear warheads that the united states now has deployed fewer than 5 percent need be available to retaliate in order to bring about the devastation of the russian industrial capacity indeed their civilization beyond reasonable hope of recovery if this is insufficient to deter our adversaries then surely the addition of 700 nuclear warheads to our already numerically superior arsenal will not increase its power to deter it is time we take stock of our national defense needs rather than attempt to match the strategy tactics and weapons we ascribe to the other side the arguments against the mx are myriad it serves no deterrent function it is vulnerable it is a highly valued target it is expensive and unproven and it has no value other than to blast hardened targets which will surely be empty by the time it arrives the arguments in favor of placing the mx in existing silos are specious it cannot function as a bargaining chip unless both sides are willing to bargain it is not a demonstration of national will but rather a demonstration of a willingness to build the next generation of missiles without regard for its intended purpose its usefulness or its role in the overall scheme of defending our nation we have given the basing of the mx a hearing and it has come up wanting i call on my fellow members of congress to vote down this illconsidered scheme of placing a threatening weapon in a vulnerable position it is time that we consider carefully tpe overall

probably given the political winds as they are that the majority party is going to stay in power for some time in the future so if in fact the minority party has some grievances that they ought to sit down with the leadership not just the minority leader and the leadership of the minority but some of the gentlemen here who constantly on a daily basis sometimes get up and lambast the majority party

sanctions go together watch that argument folks ok what if in a few years we have another large group of new undocumented aliens identified then do we say well we have got to have a new amnesty or do we repeal the employer sanctions or do we just reject the concept that we are employing today in saying that legalization and employer sanctions go together they do not necessarily go together they are two independent concepts which have been argued together but they will not work in the future together unless we are committing ourselves now to an endless chain of new amnesties no question about
