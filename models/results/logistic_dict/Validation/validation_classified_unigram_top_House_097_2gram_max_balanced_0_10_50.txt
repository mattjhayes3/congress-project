sincerely believe it will improve the cost reporting on major defense programs and encourage improvements in cost management within the department of defense last year i was fortunate to have been selected by mr price chairman of the armed services committee and mr stratton chairman of the procurement and military nuclear systems subcommittee to chair a special panel on defense acquisition procedures this special panel was chartered to review the defense departments acquisition process and to determine those factors which most frequently contribute to the cost growth plaguing many of our major weapon systems the panel conducted 18 days of extensive hearings and heard from over 100 witnesses on the defense acquisition process and weapons systems cost growth the panel concluded that cost growth can be divided into two categoriescontrollable and uncontrollable uncontrollable cost growth is cost growth which is attributed to inflation clearly the defense department cannot be held responsible for inflationary trends which cause the price of major programs to increase we all know that inflation is not unique to the defense acquisition procesgi but in fact inflation touches all of our lives this leaves us with the socalled controllable cost growth factors those factors include poor cost estimating procedures program stretchouts changes in weapon systems specifications and lack of competition to name a few these are the factors which frequently result in unanticipated cost growth affecting many of our high cost defense weapons programs it is my view that the congress should encourage the department of defense to focus increased management attention on controlling this unanticipated cost growth i believe that by insisting on improvements in cost report systems we could help to accomplish this objoctive i might add that the special panel on defense procurement procedures in a 59page report recommended among other things that the current cost reporting system be changed my amendment would change the system currently used to report the status of major defense programs to congress this system is called the selected acquisition reportsarsystem the sar system was initiated by the department of defense in 1967 as an internal management information reporting system since then the sar system has evolved into a comprehensive reporting system on major defense acquisition programs i would suggest that it is perhaps the most comprehensive management information reporting system in all of government a selected acquisition report is a routine quarterly report that reflects the department of defenses acquisition plans for a major weapon system and contains cost scheduling and performance data selected acquisition reports are prepared as of march 31 june 30 and september 30 of each year the congress started receiving limited sars in 1969 however in 1975 congress in recognition of the importance of sar information enacted legislationpublic law 94106which required the department of defense to provide selected acquisition reports on a quarterly basis the legislation also established dollar reporting thresholds in 1979 public law 96107 changed the reporting thresholds from 50 million to 75 million for r d t e and from 200 million to 300 million for procurement although the intent of public law 96107 is absolutely clear there does remain some question as the definition of a major system in fact unless the secretary of defense has designated a system as a major system it may not be reported in sars although it may exceed the dollar thresholds outlined in public law 96107 therefore my amendment will help to clarify the definition of a major ystem specifically what does my amendment do the amendment insures that sars are provided to the congress on all major defense programs which exceed 200 million in r d t e cost or exceed 1 billion in procurement cost this provision is clear and leaves no room for interpretation the provision hiso provides that the secretary of defen e may select any system as a major defense program even though it may fall below the dollar thresholds the amendment changes the requirement of providing comprehensive sars from four times a year to only once a year comprehensive sars will be those with a reporting period ending december 31 and will coincide with the presidents budget submittal the special panel determined that december 31 sars were the most accurate sars provided during the year and they should be the benchmark against which all programmatic changes and cost increases are measured throughout the year the amendment requires that in addition to the december 31 comprehensive sars three additional quarterly sars be provided for the quarters ending these will be abbreviated sars and they will only be required when there is a change in the cost performance or schcdule of a major defense program i understand that the department has estimated that reducing the number of comprehensive sars could potentially save over 330 000 a year the amendment will provide for exception reporting sar programs by exception reporting i mean that reports are only required when the cost growth of a particular program exceeds a specified dollar threshold as many of you know last year the congress passed a 1year provision as part of the defense department authorization act for fiscal year 1982 commonly referred to as the nunn amendment requiring the department to provide exception reports when there is a 15percent increase in program or procurement cost for those systems reported in the sar although i believe that the nunn amendment has been effective my amendment goes one step further by requiring that major defense programs be exmnined by the military service secretary when there is a 15percent increase in contract cost or a 15percent slippage in contract schedule the occurrence of either of these events would require the secretary to examine the specific program concerned and assess the likelihood that the contract cost growth or schedule slippage may result in a 15percent increase in the cost of the program i understand that the gentleman from maine will offer an amendment to this amendment which will provide for waivers to the sar reporting requirement i have reviewed his amendment and i find it perfectly acceptable i am conviced that mr emerys amendment will not weaken my amendment by providing a loophole through which many major programs could slip i will therefore accept his amendment when offered in conclusion it is my belief that this amendment if accepted will improve cost reporting to the congress we do not need more information we need better information and we need it early enough to make changes and at the same time assist in encouraging all levels of management within the defense department to focus increased management attention on cost growth and cost management i therefore encourage my colleagues to support

from foreign competition and aging factories such factors have forced those industries to seek government help now however the semiconductor ind ustry is also appealing to washington for help in competing with the japanese and in investing in new equipment it is mounting a campaign for freer trade and tax incentives semiconductor officials say that measure proposed by president reagan to stimulate the economy are geared to older industries while doing little for hightechnology coinpanies new rules proposed by the administration to speed up depreciation would actually slow depreciation for the semiconductor industry they complain in addition to an alternative depreciation plan the semiconductor industry is asking for tax credits for research and development and for grants made to universities for research as well as a higher investment tax credit wed like to see more emphasis put on the hightechnology growth industries as a national policy said robert n noyce vice chairman of the intel corporation most of the job creation in our country is done by the new industries not by the old industries as a matter of fact in the old stable industries the first thing you try to do is to use electronics to eliminate the labor in it in making their appeal which involves capitol hill testimony and lobbying as well as discussions with the news media the chip makers are trying to separate themselves from auto television and steel producers they characterize these industries as mature and noncompetitive the proposals of the semiconductor executives are opposed by the national assoclation of manufacturers which represents a broad spectrum of united states industry the n a m says tax credits should not be used for special interests such as research and development and it does not agree that the administrations plan is geared toward older industries its not designed to help one sector or another said cliff massa n a m vice president for taxation and fiscal policy referring to the proposed new depreciation plan its an attempt at revamping the entire system some of the older lossplagued industries he said would not benefit immediately from the new depreciation plan because they have no tax liabilities the semiconductor industry which makes the fingernailsized chips containing circuits that are the basic building blocks of computers and other electronic

semiconductor chip and are expected to capture an equally large share of the market for the next generation of memory the 04k ram the japanese have been competing on the basis of price and until recently by confining defective chips to a smaller percentage of total output officials of the semiconductor industry say it would not need support were it not for the fact that the governments of japan and european countries are supporting their own electronics industries why do we have to face a sovereign nations subsidized research and development program and subsidized lending program while at the same the we flood tax money into the united states government where it then goes to subsidize industries that have been demonstrably unsuccessful said w j sanders 3d president arid chairman of

countries meanwhile have been nurturing their electronics industries and providing them with tariff protection and subsidies american executives declare partly as a result of japanese competition prices of memory chips have plummeted contributing to a slump in semiconductor makers earnings intel for instance barely broke even in the first quarter of 1981 while texas instruments inc reported an earnings decline of 32 percent compared with the first quarter of 1980 mr noyce said the agreement by japan to lower its tariffs on semiconductor products to 4 2 percent from 10 1 percent while the united states lowers its tariff to 4 2 percent from 5 6 percent was a very important stepsymbolic as much as anything the electronics officials said that although they wanted to avoid becoming entangled in big government programs they needed more favorable solicies to encourage research and development and capital investment their industry they said is subject to rapid change and is becoming increasingly capital intensive a production facility for a chip can cost 50 million they noted the officials are calling for measures that include the following a plan that would allow some equipment to be depreciated over two years rather than five years as the administration pro poses the industry already depreciates 60 percent of its investment in two years so going to a fiveyear depreciation would slow recovery mr nesheim said a 10 percent tax credit for investment in capital compared with 6 percent in the administration plan the tax credit now varies between 3 3 percent and 10 percent depending on the length of life of the equipment a 25 percent tax credit for research and development expenditures above the average outlay of the previous three years a 25 percent tax credit for research grants to universities for projects related to a companys business the semiconductor industry says it needs to attract more students to study electronics to fill a growing manpower

approximately 20 percent of americas gross national product and provided this nation with a 27 billion agricultural balance of trade surplus last year helping to reduce our overall trade deficit the american farmer is by far the most efficient in the entire world producing ennugh food and fiber for 70 others in the soviet union by contrast each farmer produces enough for seven others over the last 20 years unitedstates farm prodtictivity has tripled while by contrast nonfarm productivity has increased 1 8 times over the same period very sadly however americas farmers have not in recent years benefited from this striking increase in productivity and in fact real farm income has fallen far more steeply than nonfarm income as prices have fallen in the marketplace more rapidly and cost of production had increased more sharply than for other american producers this years worldwide bumper harvest coupled with high interest rates a worldwide recession and the strength of the dollar abroadwith consequently greater export marketing difficultieshave pushed real farm income down to its lowest level since the great depression in the 1930s which as we are painfully aware had its roots in the farm depression of the 1920s in short this is clearly the worst of times for american agriculture unless a dramatic turnaround occurs i would describe the future of american agriculture in one worddisastrous there are many ways in which the plight of the american farmer could be improved first in an effort to reduce overproduction and thereby enhance prices a paid diversion would more effectively restrict acreage than the present voluntary acreage reduction program it is my belief that acreage reduction is the only effective way to get prices up for farmers since a sharp escalation of loan levels would stimulate production abroad and damage our markets and steep increases in target prices would still be subject to payment limitations so that neither one of these devices could actually create the profits needed by farmers for those who say that a return to the allotment system linked with very high parity loan levels would solve the problem i can only say that we tried that system over a period of many years and despite our best efforts the government ended up acquiring massive quantities of surplus commodities at great costs to the taxpayers for these reasons i believe that other acreage reduction methods are more realistic alternatives for enhancing prices given the composition of the congress with almost ninetenths of the members of the house representing urban and suburban districts i see no way that the votes could be found to raise loan levels to a point that would guarantee a profit for farmers accepting the fact that our first goal must be to get prices to a profitable level our second goal must be to find markets for those products and this will increasingly be abroad where more than onehalf of our products are now marketed consequently the administration should take all actions necessary to expand exports such as supporting the export credit revolving fund providing more extensive use of guaranteed export credits and expanding the importexport bank from manufactured products to agriculture although the reagan administration seems to be philosophically opposed to government credit of any kind guaranteed or otherwise in the export field we face a situation in which our competitors do not always play the game by our rules and in fact their governmenta are far more actively involved than ours in promoting the sales of their agricultural products one of the major contributions our administration can make is to avoid using agricultural products as tools of foreign policy through embargoes and threats of embargoes saberrattling about cutoffs of agricultural exports may serve some foreign policy goal but there is no reason american farmers alone should be asked to make the sacrifice of financing economic sanctions against other nations in addition immediate relief can be provided many of our farmers by releasing the fmha economic emergency funds which have already been authorized and appropriated to the administration and the fmha could place a temporary moratorium on foreclosures during this period of agricultural crisis which has been created by adverse weather and market conditions present legislation already on the statute books gives the administration all the authority it needs to moderate the downward pressure on prices as well as to provide both shortterm and longterm assistance to our farmers unfortunately the administration has so far shown little willingness to utilize the authority provided by the congress the farmers of our nation do not want to be supported by the taxpayers of america they only want to make a living in the marketplece and i believe that if this administration commits itself to achieving a level of prices which will produce an adequate income

cultural sites and assist others to conserve energy as a strong supporter of the youth conservation corps and the young adult conservation corpsthe predecessor programs to the american conservation corpsi can attest to the fact that government programs aimed at youth unemployment and conservation of our national urban and wilderness resources can and do work in fact this year the interior appropriations subcommittee on which i serve heard testimony from administration spokesmen that the youth conservation corpsa program similar to the accreturns over 1 05 in value to the government for every 1 the government spends in my view the acc will prove a worthy successor to the ycc and yacc and like them it will prove to be cost effective and beneficial both to the young people it employs and to the american taxpayer who will receive the benefit of their labor for these reasons i agree with my colleagues that h r 4861 needs to be enacted into law so that young americans will have the chance to work and to contribute positively to this country as a cosponsor of this legislation i am convinced that both they and the rest of us will ultimately benefit from this investment in our
