consistently failed to demonstrate restraint when it comes to escalating the occupation of iraq it has coldheartedly insisted on denying the children of struggling working families with health insurance in the name of fiscal discipline once again the values of the administration are glaringly out of step with the values of the american people the administration will not stand for accountability transparency or dissent when it comes to ending the occupation of iraq they will however support another blank check resulting in more lives lost and more of our priorities left unfunded earlier today the house voted on overriding the presidents veto of the childrens health insurance reauthorization or schip when the president vetoed schip he argued that the appearance of fiscal responsibility was more important than the health of 10 million of our children in this nation but when we learned that insuring 10 million children in america for 1 year costs the same as 40 days in iraq it is clear that the administration does not have its priorities straight supporting our service men and women is certainly our absolute responsibility our nation has an obligation to those who sacrifice and defend us during times of war however our servicemembers in iraq were sent into combat without adequate training without stateoftheart body armor and equipment and without assurances that their tours of duty will not be overextended the glaring failures in iraq show that not only is the bush administration defunding our nations priorities to continue the occupation but that it is allowing much of that money to be wasted the inspector general has reported that 8 8 billion appropriated for iraqs reconstruction cannot be accounted for media sources have recently reported that the administration is constructing a 600 million american embassy located in the green zone in iraq this embassy which is the largest in the world in fact it is larger than the vatican this embassy will include grocery stores a movie theater tennis courts and a social club it will require 1 billion a year to keep it up and to be maintained instead of our childrens health care the priorities of the bush administration seem to be waste fraud and abuse when the administration vetoes a bipartisan investment in health insurance for our nations children it rejects the priorities of the american people when the administration spends billions on constructing and maintaining an embassy in iraq while iraqs infrastructure collapses around them it compromises the safety of our troops abroad and when the administration refuses to end the occupation in iraq it assures that countless generations will suffer for their mistakes the priorities of the american people are clear they want to provide health care for children they want to promote peace and protect our troops they want us to fully fund the efforts to bring our troops home they want us to do it now"],

issues your voice is extremely important your work has been important and it continues to bq quite amazing in your coming from new york and in my coming from california we have very similar issues that we have to deal with in terms of this horrific energy crisis and so thank you for giving us the opportunity to talk about it one more time also just as i was listening to my colleague mr johnson from gcorgia thank you for that very brilliant presentation and for that historical context you know sometimes we forget the past in the ghanaiah language in the akan language theres a term called sankofa in order to move forward we must look back at our mistakes and i think awhat you talked about tonight really makes it very clear that we have to understand how we got to where we are so that we dont make those mistakes again such as you talked about which was the drilling in the pristine area in alaskain anwrand all of the proposals that this administration wants to embark upon so thank you very much for that to my colleague from texas ms jacksonlee you have been on this for many many years you come from oil country and you understand very clearly the oil industry and what we need to do to dig ourselves out of this hole and so your voice continues to be important in coming from texas in understanding that the american people deserve not to have to pay 5 a gallon for gas the courage that youve displayed has been amazing thank you for your voice and for your leadership as we work to reduce skyrocketing prices at the pump we continue to face opposition from the bush administration and our colleagues on the other side of the aisle seem to be content to subsidize the big oil companies record profits that mr towns talked about and that you talked about mr johnson and ms jacksonlee they reach record profits quarter after quarter rather than adopb a real solution to meet the energy needs across our nation more specifically we have proposed legislation that would invest in true clean and renewable energy sources our proposals would also bring much needed accountability which we need desperately to the energy markets in order to eliminate the price gougingdo you hear me thats taking place and the market manipulation and the speculation that have inflated energy prices to record levels this week we will also take up legislation to expand the use of public transit systems to save eilergy and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in light of this growing energy crisis i cannot help but to reflect upon the bush administrations determination to squander our resources on the immoral occupation of iraq that has directly contributed to the current economic downturn of the high gas prices that the american people are seeing at the pump make no mistake we are in the middle of the bushiraq recession the economic hardships that americans face today are the direct result of this administrations failed and flawed policies at home and abroad when president bush took office in january of 2001 the price of oil was 23 a barrel and gasoline cost as little as i think it was 1 35 per gallon now after more than 5 years of bombing and bloodshed in iraq since the iraq invasion oil has topped 130 a barrel and gasoline is averaging more than 4 a gallon as congressman johnson said it probably will hit the unfortunate cost of 5 per gallon by some estimates the war and continued occupation of iraq could cost the united states more than 3 trillion thats a 3 trillion bill for this administrations failed policies in iraq that our children and grandchildren will be paying for years to come the american people recognize the toll this immoral occupation has taken on our economy theyre in dire need of assistance many face the impossible choice of buying food for their families or of purchasing the gasoline they need to go to work if we want to see prices at the gas pump go down one of the first and most essential steps we must take is to end the war and occupation in iraq we must also focus on transitioning our economy away from fossil fuels to the greener alternative fuels of the future this will be a longterm process that will affect communities throughout our nations in different ways its very important to note that as we continue to forge these new frontiers to achieve energy independence and to safeguard the environment communities will face many complex environmental and public health challenges the drastic acceleration of greenhouse gas emissions has often been concentrated in lowincome and minority communities putting these vulnerable populations on the front lines of the fight against environmental degradation and global climate change the communities in my district like in mr johnsons district and in mr towns district and in ms jacksonlees district all face the severe consequences of pollution of urban sprawl and of environmental injustice which harshly affect people of color and lowincome communities sadly this epidemic is hitting our children the hardest for example back at home in my own district when children grow up in the area of west oakland theyre seven times more likely to be hospitalized for asthma than is the average child in california none of us can afford to take this lightly the health of our community and neighbors affects all of us i would also like to just take a moment and recognize the rolethat californias east bay is playing at the forefront of the green jobs and green industry movement which is really a critical part in terms of addressing the energy crisis one of the most exciting and inclusive solutions to the many issues facing environmental health and our energy crisis is the possibility afforded to us by promoting green jobs training and the growth of the green economy in america a true green economy one that is sincere in its mission and that is deeply rooted in local communities and businesses can provide innovative answers to many of the problems that our environment faces green jobs provide pathways out of poverty for those most affected by environmental injustice nanely people of color and our urban youth we have been working closely in my district with the ella baker center and with the apollo alliance mayor ron dellumsmy predecessor here and our colleaguehas been working very hard on a new initiative to support the development of green model cities and to focus on economic development through green job training academies and to create a national green institute to serve as a clearinghouse for the green movement so there are many many initiatives to which we need to look forward in terms of providing for an alternative to our dependence on foreign oil let me just conclude by saying and by reminding the country that most recently the bush administration has threatened to veto the housepassed h r 5351 which is the renewable energy and energy conservation tax act of 2008 this legislation makes critical investments in clean and renewable energy and energy efficiency that will create hundreds of thousands of new jobs and that will help to maintain the united states position as a leader in innovation as we move toward true energy independence so i have to thank my colleagues again especially the congressional black caucus and congressman towns for allowing us to come down for an hour to talk about the basic components and reasons for this energy crisis and also for allowing us to provide what we see as some real and practical solutions that we can embrace right nownot next year but todayif in fact the bush administration and his oil industry administration would accept the fact that theyre responsible for this energy crisis the american people deserve a way out thank you"], [0.00023347139358520508,

iraq a war we never should have fought a war that has lasted longer than world war i world war ii the civil war and the war continues you might remember america last spring they were all saying wait until september we sent a bill with benchmarks to the senate to the house passed the house went to the senate the president vetoed it we sent him another one they say okay we wont do another one we will wait until september well now general petraeus is saying not september 2007 lets now give them until march 2008 no new plan they are going to ask for 200 billion in the next several weeks already have spent 565 4 trillion of your tax dollars on a war we never should have fought america wants a change we want a new direction mr president we want to bring our troops home in the most orderly possible plan that we can put together and i hope and the american people hope this administration as well as our military leaders will come up with a plan it is your responsibility to do that we

do not know there will be significant needs for mental health services this supplemental has very little money that is coming through and this is a supplemental that we spent this year 2007 and 2008

caucus we will say it over and over again set a plan in motion change direction for our country benchmarks you heard also benchmarks what about these benchmarks that congress the president and president maliki put together earlier this year it is really between president bushs administration and the administration in iraq 18 benchmarks that they said they would meet by september the general accounting office reported to this congress last week they have met three of them they are not sustaining their own government they go on vacation and they want us to fight their war our people tell us to bring our soldiers home we hear it across the country republicans and democrats as weli as independents bring our troops home it is unconscionable that this congress would consider as an appropriator and as a member of this body as well as a citizen of this country 200 billion new dollars for this illadvised war in the next several months rise up america thank you for protesting over this lastweek keep the protests up if you cant come to washington have them in your own state in your own city let us hear your voices it is too silent out there this is a better country than that so

our seniors who built this country need more there is no reason why we cant have topquality education good health centers good environment good infrastructure bridges that dont collapse but you see

a just america so my brothers and sisters american citizens rise up change course fight to end this war today so that your grandchildren will have a better america tomorrow mr speaker one of the costs of the war in iraq that is often overlooked is the waste of tax dollars that could be used to fund programs and facilities that would improve our quality of life americas families want access to wellpaying jobs affordable health care and quality education the war in iraq presents a threat to our military readiness and the development of communities across our country we must reinvest in

truth on some of the messages that we have heard just now and maybe previously here in washington this is another edition of the official truth squad the official truth squad is a group of republicans who desire to make certain that some sense of factual information is provided as we talk about the issues that are dealt with on the floor of this house we have a favorite a number of favorite quotes one of them is from daniel patrick moynihan senator moynihan said everyone is entitled to their own opinion but not to their own facts it is curious to hear my friends on the other side of the aisle and their righteous indignation the righteous indignation that they have about so many various things particularly tonight when they talked about spending and funding the troops well it is curious because the bill that this house passed under the leadership on the other side the majority party leadership just 2 weeks ago i know you will find this amazing but that is a bill that could have been passed the first or second week of january of this year to appropriately fund the troops who are standing in harms way who are defending our liberty and our freedom and attempting to carry out what they believe we believe to be a role that will result in a more safe and secure middle east and a more safe and secure united states of america that bill was held up literally for 5 months because of political posturing and gamesmanship and all sorts of things that frankly americans are tired of they are tired of it we all got back in washington from a week at home most of us went home to our districts it is good to go home and hear what people are really thinking the folks in my district on the northern side of atlanta they are mad as can be about the partisan games that are played here in washington i am here to bring a little truth and light and fact to many different areas buf i think it is important for everybody to appreciate especially in this body that the bill that was passed to appropriately fund the troops 2 weeks ago we passed that bill that is a bill that could have been passed by virtually every single positive vote in this house the first or second week of january had our good friends the blue dogs and others not participated in the kind of gamesmanship that the american people are frankly tired of i want to talk a little bit about the fiscal house being put back in order our good friends on the other side of the aisle talked about putting the quote fiscal house back in order which is why the blue dogs felt that they increased their numbers and assisted the election of the majority i think it is curious when they talk about putting the fiscal house of this nation back in order because if you look at the truth if you look at facts if you listen to facts and not just opinion you will appreciate i know that what has happened over the first a little over 5 months of this new congress under new leadership is that we have seen an increased authorization for over 50 billion in new spending so are they putting the fiscal house back in order by decreasing spending no over 50 billion in new spending authorized by this new majority with the blue dogs supporting virtually every one of those bills so they must be then decreasing taxes right in order to put the fiscal house back in order well no they are not doing that either because the budget that they adopted this democrat majority with i think the unanimous support of the blue dogs on the other side of the aisle the budget that they adopted over 400 billion in new taxes for the american people it is the largest tax increase in the history of the nation i guess that they would argue that is putting this fiscal house back in order well i will tell you it has many folks at home asking me if the blue dogs are not just lap dogs and if they are not just kowtowing to the democratic leadership and doing what they are told to do as opposed to being fiscally responsible which is what so many of us on our side of the aisle are working so hard to do so things are a little curious which is why i think it is important to bring some truth and facts to the debate and the discussion we had some curious things happen on the floor of the house today i know that you were as puzzled as i at some of the events that occurred yesterday there was an indictment that was passed down in a court that indicted a member of congress a member of the house of representatives they indicted him i think on 16 counts so the new majority party came to the floor of the house today having known about the problem that this individual has had for years literally they came to the floor of the house today and they were stumbling over themselves to get to the microphone and to the floor as fast as they could to address this issue that could have been addressed long ago and passed a resolution that said that anybody who had any criminal charge against them as a member of congress a member of the house or any indictment would be referred to the ethics committee fl 2245 that may be appropriate it passed by a wide margin i was pleased to support it i think the process was flawed it didnt go through the regular committee process and consequently was a pretty poorly written bill but it moves us in a little bit of the right direction in that whole process of talking about it on the floor of the house this afternoon and evening the majority leader said something to the effect of anyone accused of wrongdoing needs to be investigated any member of the house who is accused of wrongdoing needs to be investigated which brings up the whole issue of earmarks of special projects thats what id like to spend a little time talking about this evening the whole issue of pork projects special projects earmarks things that have inflated our budget to a huge degree and things that frankly ought not be included in the vast majority of bills and if they are they ought to have the greatest amount of scrutiny by both sides of the aisle members from both sides and certainly greatest amount of scrutiny from our constituents from people all across this nation and a great amount of scrutiny from the press thats what we call sunshine thats what i call sunshine for earmarks and its an important thing and the majority party made a huge deal as they ran for office last fall about the importance of spending restraint and getting the fiscal house in order as it were although we havent seen a whole lot of that since they took over but they made a huge point about controlling earmarks and putting a lid on earmarks and special projects and this past week weve heard a lot about it but what has happened is that things have actually gotten worse i know its hard to believe but they have actually gotten worse and there are a number of people who believe that and a number of objective individuals again facts will back up this case there was a letter written by the minority leader to the speaker recently in which he said we now have reached the point at which the congressional earmark process has become less transparent and less accountable than it was during the 109th congress directly violating pledges made last year by democratic leaders that goes a long way i tell you thats a major statement less transparent meaning not the kind of sunshine and less accountable so that who knows where these projects are coming from how are the people how are the american citizens supposed to hold their member accountable if in fact theyre doing what they dont believe they ought to do it has gotten so bad that a member of even the democrat majority has said a lot of democrats believe its our turn at the trough quite a statement a lot of democrats believe its our turn at the trough thats a fact that that was indeed said and in fact its distressing because it appears to be that thats the fact of action on the part of this new majority now what did they do in fact i have coined it orwellian democracy because so often what has happened with this new majority is that they have said the right thing they said they were going to do something and then in fact either done exactly the opposite or ignored what they said they were going to do well what do i mean by that mr speaker i have in my hand here the book of rules of the house of representatives its a pretty dry read but its got some important points in it and these are the rules by which the house operates and by which we supposedly make certain that individual members of this house are held accountable for their actions one part of the rules talks about congressional earmarks whats an earmark how do you determine what an earmark is how do you determine what a special project is its important to know that so you can say yeah that ought to be subject to a certain amount of scrutiny hopefully more scrutiny a certain amount of sunshine that the individual member of congress ought to have to stand up and say thats my project i support thatproject im interested in having us spend federal taxpayer money on that project so whats the definition of a congressional earmark well in house rule xxi subclause 9 d it says congressional earmark means a provision or report language included primarily at the request of a member providing authorizing or recommending a specific amount of discretionary budget authority credit authority or other spending authority or other expenditure targeted to a specific state locality or congressional district other than through a statutory or administrative formuladriven or competitive award process now what does that mean that means that if an individual member of congress says i believe that certain federal tax dollars hardearned taxpayer dollars ought to go for a specific project in my district for a specific purpose and its not part of any other authorization that the federal government has for another role or another aspect of its responsibility its something that a specific member requests thats a congressional earmark now how do you make certain that theres appropriate accountability for that well another portion of the rules it says that a list of those earmarks have to be in any bill that has an earmark and the list has to include the members name who requested it thats an important point because that allows for the sunshine that makes it so that all members of this body know whos requested that it makes it so that the press know whos requested it and they can follow up on it and do investigations if they deem it to be appropriate its necessary so that constituents people out across america can know whos requesting these things and it goes on to say that if a list isnt included the way that you can follow the rules as well is that a statement that the proposition contains no congressional earmarks may suffice so if the bill actually contained no earmarks then all that it took was the chairman of the committee to write a statement to the speaker and to the rules committee that in fact the bill contained no earmarks no special projects now one of the reasons that ive dubbed this the new orwellian majority and orwellian democracy is that what weve seen is that multiple bills multiple bills have come to the floor of the house with special project after special project after special project millions and sometimes billions of dollars and yet what is included in the report language from the committee is the sentence from the chairman that no congressional earmarks are in the bill in spite of the fact that theyre in the bill thats why i call it orwellian denocracy because it just simply takes the chairman an individual to say well there arent any earmarks in there and so it satisfies the rule now i went to the parliamentarian on this because i couldnt believe it i said do you mean to tell me that if the chairman of the committee just says regardless of its truth just says there are no earmarks in this bill that that satisfies that means there are no earmarks even if there are and the parliamentarian said absolutely correct absolutely and so the only option that we have is to come to the floor and say look what theyve said just isnt the truth remember its an opinion its not a fact and the fact of the matter is that time after time this new majority has brought bill after bill to the floor with earmarks and special project after special project after special project and simply gotten around the ules because they say oh no theres noearmarks here let me give you a couple of examples because i know people would be interested in looking at that members of the house if theyre interested h r 1100 was a bill that we voted on just a couple of weeks ago the whole legislation really was one big earmark with a 7 million estimate cost by cbo over a number of years and it specifically dealt with one congressional district one specific project and it did not have any other statutory or administrative formuladriven or competitive award process the whole thing was an earmark but it had in the language of the report from the committee no earmarks here no earmarks here that emperor has no clothes i promise you h j res 20 was the continuing resolution to make certain that there was the money in place to continue the federal governments responsible activities what did that have multiple earmarks multiple millions and millions of dollars of earmarks and in fact got around the rule by just saying oh there are no earmarks here there are no earmarks here orwellian democracy and then most recently the emergency supplemental appropriations bill had billions billions of dollars in special projects and in fact all that was done in order to comply with the rules of the house was to have one of the chairmen of the committee say oh no there are no earmarks here it reminds one of the wizard of oz you know where the wizard says oh dont pay any attention to that man behind that curtain well thats kind of what the majority party is asking dont pay attention to these earmarks even though we say there are none so whats the solution now they have taken a lot of heat this majority party has taken a lot of heat for trying to put these special projects pork projects into bills and so whats their solution well they have come up with a solution before we talk about that solution its important to remember what they promised what did this new majority promise and what they said was were going to adopt rules that make the system of legislation transparent so that we dont legislate in the dark of night and the public and other members can see whats being done we need to have earmarks subject to more debate thats what debate and public awareness is all about democracy works if people know whats going on that was majority leader hoyer last fall after the election thats what he said about the earmark process and the nowspeaker said about a year ago its the special interest earmarks that are ones that go in there in the dark of night they dont want anybody to see and that nobody does see and then theyre voted upon so transparency yes by all means lets subject them all to the scrutiny that they deserve and let them compete for the dollar thats nowspeaker pelosi thats the statement that she made just a little over a year ago whats happened whits the reality mr speaker whats the facts not the opinion not the orwellian democracy of oh there arent any earmarks in that bill dont bother looking because there arent any earmarks in that bill but whats the facts the fact is that after promising this unprecedented openness regarding congress pork barrel practices what the majority party the house democrats have done theyve moved in exactly the opposite direction as they draw up spending bills the new appropriations bills are coming on line for this new budget year theyre sidestepping the rules approved on the very first day that they took power in january where they said we need to identify earmarks remember those rules where you had to have a list of earmarks you had to have the individual that requested them had to make certain that there was sunshine rather than including specific pet projects or grants or contracts in the legislation as its written this is whats new democrats are following an order by house appropriations committee chairman to keep the bills free of such earmarks until its too late in the process to challenge them too late in the process to challenge them phenomenal absolutely phenomenal associated press writer andrew taylor said just 2 days ago after promising unprecedented openness regarding congress pork barrel practices house democrats are moving in the opposite direction from an article by andrew taylor the associated press of january 3 representative david obey who is the chairman of the appropriations committee says that those requests for dams community grants and research contracts for favored universities or hospitals will be added spending measures in the fall thats when the house and the senate negotiators assemble their final bill so as a result most lawmakers will not get the chance to oppose or even identify specific projects as wasteful or questionable when the spending bills for various agencies get their first vote in the full house thfs month so whats going to happen is that instead of this wonderful transparency instead of the sunshine all the accountability that this new majority talked about in fact what theyre doing is going way back way back to an old time long long ago when these special projects were put in late at night with nobody watching no ability to gain accountability for it no ability to see whats happening no opportunity for average members of this house of representatives to see and appreciate whats happening in terms of spending in the appropriations bills as they go forward the housesenate compromise bills due for final action in september cannot be amended and its extremely pivotal because you cant say well this is a project that we ought to have more discussion on more debate on so it cant be amended and theyre only subject to 1 hour of debate its not just those of us who believe in sunshine for earmarks something that i have fought for a number of years its not just those of us in the house of representatives who are concerned tom shatz the president of citizens against government waste says who appointed him judge and jury of earmarks what that does is leave out the publics input the article from mr taylor goes on to say what mr obey is doing runs counter to new rules the democrats promised they would make such spending decisions more open those rules made it clear that projects earmarked for federal dollars and their sponsors were to be made available to public scrutiny when appropriations bills are debated the rules also require lawmakers requesting such projects to provide a written explanation describing their request in a letter certifying that they or their spouse wouldnt make any financial gain from them so its important to appreciate what is happening with this new orwellian democracy orwellian majority is that what we are seeing is them saying one thing and then doing something exactly the opposite again its not just those of us on this side of the aisle who believe that and have documented that this is an article from the st petersburg times that explains in an editorial the new game that house appropriations chairman david obey intends to play with budget earmarks this year is worse than the usual hideandseek hes taken the whole thing underground as though he is to be trusted as a oneman auditor for congressional pork if this is to be the new ethic the democrats promised voters might want to get their ballots back something that i have talked about the american people are paying attention they are watching and they are disappointed with what they see this new majority talked about taking the nation in a new direction they have taken it in a new direction and it has been exactly backwards backwards to a time as documented or given the opinion by the st petersburg times its worse than what has happened in the past the las vegas review journal notes that it didnt take long for democrats to break their promise on earmark reform when democrats took control of congress 4 months back incoming house speaker nancy pelosi bragged that it would take her party less than 100 hours to curb wasteful pork spending by requiring members to attach their names to their earmarks exposing such waste to the harsh light of public scrutiny she failed to mention this reform would remain in effect for little more than the 100 days didnt even last that long because as we have documented already what has taken place is this process of bypassing or skirting the rules by saying oh no there is no earmarks there when in fact there is a laundry list as long as your arm in there thats the fact thats the fact of the matter so while democrats plot to hide their wasteful spending from the american people our side house republicans will continue to work to make the earmark process much more transparent and more accountable and we will work to root out that wasteful spending and balance the budget without raising taxes without raising taxes which is so remarkably important i mentioned that i was home last week many of us were home in our districts last week thats what i heard that individuals all across my district that i talked to have been concerned about spending over and over and over they said we know that you can balance that budget without increasing spending and without increasing taxes so when our friends on the other side of the aisle talk about getting the fiscal house in order yet they authorize more spending and they increase in their budget taxes by over 400 billion the largest tax increase in the history of our nation my folks the folks in my district at home say well that just doesnt wash thats not the kind of leadership we want so that new direction those ballots that that editorial talked about folks getting back may in fact need to occur and its a wonderful thing to be able to have accountability for members of congress every 2 years i believe firmly that the american people are indeed watching and they are already tired of what they see on the part of this new majority especially in the area of earmark reform i have been joined by a very good friend from arizona who truly is the champion of earmark

today i wish i could report to my colleagues that this legislation was improved since the last time the house considered it in march unfortunately the massive and irresponsible tax increase included in the house version of this budget would still be the largest tax increase in american history weighing in at a shocking 392 5 billion over the next 5 years this democrat budget which is balanced on the backs of everyday taxpayers would be used to finance bloated new government spending that will grow well above the rate of inflation through 2012 while also ignoring the brewing entitlement crisis around 77 million baby boomers will be retiring in the very near future and will begin collecting social security medicare and medicaid funding this new spending represents the greatest economic challenge of our era and it is a challenge that the democrat budget has chosen to completely ignore while going on its own spending spree elsewhere in the 32nd congressional district of texas which i have the honor to represent the heritage foundation estimates that the passage of this budget will cost every single taxpayer an additional 2 920 in 2012 it will also mean a per capita loss of 474 in personal income as well as 2 389 lost jobs as a result of a loss of 328 million to the local economy of the 32nd congressional district of texas i will insert into the record this entire document which details the severe negative impact on the passage that this budget will have on every single taxpayer from every single district across the country if fiscal discipline is what the democrats promised voters this past fall then by my account it took only 3 months for the democrat candidates to abandon their campaign promises and an additional 2 months for democrats to reiterate their really true support for taxandspend policies again here on the house floor today this deeply flawed budget would increase taxes on almost 8 million taxpayers just in my home state of texas alone it would collect these taxes by allowing the 2001 and 2003 tax relief provided by the republican congress to expire in real terms for every american taxpayer this means reducing the child tax credit for working families so that the government can collect 27 billion more to finance yes youve got it brandnew spending it means reinstating the marriage penalty and the death tax to collect an additional 104 billion so that the new majority democrats can kick the can further down the road rather than reforming and strengthening our nations entitlement programs and it means completely ignoring the alternative minimum tax crisis which is projected to hit 23 million middleclass families if not dealt with in a responsible manner i believe the voters watching this debate on cspan understand what these tax increases mean for them the economy and for our ability to compete globally but they may not realize what they mean for the average family of four with 60 000 in earnings it will mean a tax increase of 61 percent it means that a single parent with two children and 30 000 in earnings would see a tax increase of 67 percent and it means that an elderly couple with 40 000 of income would see their taxes increase by a whopping 156 percent you can see the advantages of the republican tax cut and what it means to every single middleclass american now one would think that a hike of almost 400 billion impacting every american taxpayer would be enough to finance the democrats appetite for big government but trust me its just the start this budget also contains 12 reserve funds or pet initiative ious which set the stage for more than 115 billion in higher future spending which would have to be financed by you guessed it even higher taxes for the last 4 years responsible budgets passed by the republican party kept discretionary spending at or below inflation for all nondefense nonhomeland security spending this budget plan brought forward by the democrats brings this fiscally disciplined tradition to a screeching halt by allowing about 25 billion more in discretionary spending than president bush or even the spendthrift senate for that matter which asked for about 7 billion less than the house thankfully its not too late to stop this fiscal train wreck by voting against this rule every member of this body can demonstrate their opposition to the federal largesse included in this budget as well as their opposition to the largest tax increase in american history without the meaningful tax relief passed by this recent republican congress our economy would not have seen the massive job growth with 7 6 million new jobs created for american workers and tremendous economic growth of 3 5 percent per year that has our economy growing at the highest rate and has done so over the last 15 quarters i encourage all of my colleagues to stand up for fiscal discipline economic growth and responsible budgeting by opposing this rule and the underlying tax increase i

to a bill pending and have it debated and voted upon this is more closed rules than any congress in the history of our country which is exactly the opposite of the promise that the democrat leaders made to the american people when they promised to run the most open and honest house ever the house is not open when no amendments are allowed to be offered and when a republican alternative is blocked from even a minute of debate and denied a vote on the house floor and it is not in the most honest house when the rules committee democrats block the republican plan to prevent tax increases from being considered using the excuse that it doesnt meet house paygo rules especially when it was just one week ago that the same democrats were blatantly violating paygo rules by billions of dollars in the farm bill under this liberal congress it is only okay to break the house rules apparently when you are increasing spending by billions of dollars but not by preventing tax increases on the american people the republican plan that was denied that the democrats refused to allow the house to vote upon would provide the following 1 year of relief from the alternative minimum tax or the amt a 2year extension of the state and local sales tax deduction for those states that do not have a state income tax 2 more years for the research and development tax credit 2 years for the tuition tax credit and extensions for more expiring tax provisions this democrat7 bill for example does absolutely nothing nothing at all to fix the amt tax for 2008 twentyone million middle class individuals will pay an additional 61 5 billion in higher taxes next april if the amt is not fixed and addressed that is an average of over 2 800 per affected taxpayer the republican plan fully fixes it but today that fix is not even allowed to be considered on the house floor instead the house is given one choice and that is a fools choice bargain to raise taxes by 54 billion in order to simply extend existing tax policies that are due to expire current provisions in tax law are expiring and congress needs to act to keep these taxes from going up but we all know that is no excuse to raise other taxes by billions of dollars i and many of my republican colleagues support a great number of the tax relief extensions included in this bill including the state and local sales tax deduction the research and development tax credit education and tuition tax credits tax credits for teachers and several renewable income tax credits these low tax policies have been law for many years and they have been extended multiple times multiple times and always without raising taxes my democrat colleagues will try to defend their taxraising ways by invoking the paygo rules they ignored just last week they will claim that this is just being responsible and it is not about increasing the national debt that it is about government living within its means if only that were true but it is not all you have to do is to reacl the final budget plan for next year that this house will vote on later today their budget reveals this congress as what they truly are and what they truly are is old time taxandspend liberals in their budget spending increases by 250 billion over the next 5 years they increase the debt limit in 2008 by 654 billion which is the largest increase in history and they raise taxes by 683 billion which is the largest amount in american history more spending higher debt record tax increases that is obviously the plan of this liberal congress now my democrat colleagues will also try to claim the tax increases that are in this bill arent really that bad but the facts are the facts and the facts are that this bill unnecessarily increases taxes by over 50 billion and that is just the beginning remember that their budget would increase taxes by over twothirds of a trillion dollars if they arent raising your taxes this time in this bill i can assure you your time is coming they will get you the next time when this liberal congress imposes the largest tax increase in american history to pay for more government spending dont think that you can escape permanently their taxandspend ways their tax increase plans include cutting the child tax credit cutting that in half reinstating the marriage penalty and the death tax and a tax increase for every single american taxpayer it would even levy taxes on lowincome workers who currently pay none but if there is a ray of sunshine and there always is a ray of sunshine in bills there is a newly created tax break one that will put a big smile on the faces of some in this country and it is worth over 1 5 billion 0 1100 the only problem is that this new tax break is only for trial lawyers so the only people who will be smiling are the trial lawyers and presumably the democrats that they give tens of millions of dollars in campaign contributions to each year under this bill the american taxpayers will be subsidizing speculative lawsuits by trial lawyers to the tune of 1 5 billion this special interest tax break will allow trial lawyers to make special arrangements that essentially allow them to gamble on lawsuits where they get paid on contingency fees if they win meanwhile taxpayers will be footing the bill for trial lawyers writing off the expenses of conducting these sue them and see what we can win lawsuits count me among those who believe we already have too many lawsuits in this country and that we shouldnt be inventing new special tax breaks that may and probably will encourage more lawsuits our justice system can operate fairly as it has done so for many years without having to give special tax treatment to trial lawyers finally i want to specifically mention the extension of the state and local sales tax deduction that is included in this bill for nearly 20 years americans who paid state income taxes could deduct those taxes from their federal tax bill while americans who paid state sales taxes but had no state income tax were not allowed to do so in 2006 the republican congress restored the sales tax deduction after years of bipartisan effort from the congressional delegations of the affected states including my home state of washington the initial reinstatement of the deduction was for 2 years 2004 and 2005 in 2006 the republican congress extended the sales tax deduction for 2 more years 2006 and 2007 that deduction has now expired and this deduction does not exist for this year efforts last year to extend this deduction and ensure it didnt expire were unfortunately blocked by the democrat leaders i regret that the extension provided for the sales tax deduction in this bill is for 1 year only this is a step backwards this deduction has been extended 2 years each time in the past and it should be extended 2 years now otherwise we face expiring in about 6 months from now because as i mentioned there is no sales tax deduction for the calendar year 2008 so if we are to pass this and it were to be signed into law we would have 6 months on it from right now the bipartisan senate bill introduced last month by the chairman and ranking member of the finance committee includes a 2year extensionof this sales tax deduction the republican plan that house leaders and the rules committee last night blocked from being considered and debated on the floor today provided for a 2year extension an amendment was filed with the rules committee by mr brady of texas which also would have extended the deduction for 2 years but that too was blocked by the rules committee from being debated on this floor it is very unfortunate that this bill moves sales tax deduction fairness backwards not forwards taxpayers in income tax states have a permanent tax deduction and taxpayers in sales tax states that have no state income tax deserve in my view equal treatment the sales tax deduction should be made into permanent law even though i think a 2year extension is better than 1 it should be madepermanent at the very least they deserve at least a 2year extension what really is more upsetting is that this bill could have provided very easily under existing paygo rules a 2year dxtension the over 1 5 billion cost of the tax deduction given to trial lawyers could instead have been used to give a 1year extension of the sales tax deduction for those states so this bill chooses to create a new billionplusdollar tax cut for trial lawyers over tax fairness for the millions of residents in the state of washington my state the state of florida the states of texas tennessee nevada south dakota and wyoming i have supported every bill that has passed this house to reinstate and extend the state sales tax deduction but none of these bills none of these bills that extended that was being held hostage for another tax cut for another special interest restoring and continuing the state sales tax deduction is a matter of fairness the residents of sales tax states shouldnt have their fair treatment conditioned upon passing huge tax increases the rule that is currently before the house and the underlying bill reveal this congress for what it really is the rule is totally closed and does not allow debate or a vote on any amendments or an alternative republican plan it violates speaker pelosis promise to the american people to run an open and honest house the bill itself is just the opening act of a move to impose the largest tax increase in history on the american people under this liberal congress the only tax bill allowed on the floor of the house is one that will raise taxes under this liberal congress tax relief is a myth and tax increases are a certainty under this liberal congress americans will be sending more and more of their hardearned dollars to washington dc so this congress can increase spending and the size of the federal government my colleagues should oppose this closed rule and this tax increase bill we should demand a clean tax relief extension bill that doesnt include new tax breaks for trial lawyers and over 50 billion in tax increases this bill we know will never pass the senate and it will never be signed into law if on the slim chance that it should pass both houses and be sent to the president raising taxes right now on the american economy is simply the wrong thing to do i reserve the

pending from earlier this year the president told reporters that the funding was simply for daytoday military operations in afghanistan and iraq he said that the bill provides for basic needs like bullets and body armor protection against ieds and miheresistant ambushprotected vehicles the president would lead us to believe that there are only two options in iraq congress must either continue to fund the war indefinitely or we must choose to pull the rug out from under the troops and strand them in the field without body armor and bullets this of course is a ridiculous characterization of our position we feel that continuing to referee a civil war in iraq runs counter to our national security interests there is no military solution to the war in iraq no matter how many soldiers weapons and dollars you dump into the country bombs and bullets have not and will not bring us peace in iraq i believe there is only one answer to the war in iraq a fully funded redeployment of our troops and military contractors i think a reasonable mcmber of congross would welcome a plan from the president on how were going to safely leave iraq and we would be happy to fund it but asking us to continue funding providing funds for the occupation of iraq until president bush decides to change course is tantamount to asking us to just continue to support the war the choice is clear it is time to face the facts we either provide funds to continue the war or we provide funds to end the war mr speaker and members im bothered by this request im bothered by it because the president is playing politics with the issue the president of the united states is saying i want this 46 billion and i want it now and i want to use it for very necessary armor and equipment because he knows that the members of congress do not like to be seen in a bad light having folks believe that somehow theyre not providing support for the soldiers and he keeps testing the will of this congress with these kinds of antics we know that the american public wants us out of iraq we also know the american public wants to indicate its support for the soldiers who are not there because theyve decided that we would go to war but rather they answered the presidents call because they are patriotic many of them needed jobs they needed resources they needed money so theyre there everybody supports the soldiers but the president is trying to set us up he is trying to set us up so that if we dont immediately vote on this 46 billion it will look as if we are not giving the soldiers the necessary equipment in order to wage the war this is absolutely ridiculous and i dont know how long this president thinks he can get along with mismanaging this war in the way that hes doing we have 101 questions we ought to be forcing on him first of all where are the 190 000 weapons that have been lost where is the money we were supposed to have been getting from the oil wells in iraq where are the billions of dollars that they sent over in cash in the beginning of this war what happened to all of that money we can go on and on and on with questions about blackwater and the contractors and the mercenaries we can go on and on about this government that they put together that does not function and will not function we can ask them whose side are you on the sunnis the shias and now youre trying to manage what turkey does with the kurds the kurds killed turkish soldiers the turks threatened to go over and invade the kurdish territory and now were over there trying to manage that it is complicated we have no

example with the office to monitor and combat trafficking in persons as created by p l 108193 my legislation the trafficking victims protection act similarly i know that the establishment of an office on global climate change at the ambassadorial level within the state department as provided for in h r 3221 will demonstrate to the world that the united states is targeting needed resources to address this challenge and is completely engaged in the worldwide fight against global warming title ii of h r 3221 also creates an international clean energy foundation to serve the longterm foreign

and beyond their usefulness you see in most sectors of american life the free market simply dictates that old products as great as they may have at one time been are replaced by newer better products unfortunately in the government that process of creative destruction stops after we create the first version the old outofdate programs or agencies dont really get replaced it stays around performing maybe not performing duplicative functions and sucking up tax dollars at the same time several years ago the comptroller pavid walker pointed out that the usda the fda and 10 other federal agencies administer 35 different food safety laws the department of homeland security justice and hhs administer 16 different grant programs for first responders and usda and hud b th provide assistance for rural housing and i wont even go into the department of education that would be too easy why do we have such a hard time getting rid of old programs it simply has to do with publicchoice theory every government agency and program no matter how outdated has a core constituency who benefit from its existence those who are employed at the agency or program and those who receive benefits have a huge incentive to fight for its continued existence i understand this attitude i basically did the same thing as a teacher i was not content as many of the oldguard teachers were to simply teach the same lesson year after year so i and other innovative staff members started new programs like the historical society the renaissance festival a scholarship program an oral history program and closeup an internship program at our state capitol now fortunately most of these program enhancements cost the school very little money except my time but i did it because i always wanted to have a bigger role at the school the status quo was never sufficient i wanted to do more and herein lies the problem for both government programs and for me as a teacher in our mindset if a program is not growing something is wrong to self justify government agencies and offices always think of new ways to expand their services the goal is always bigger and more which ends up costing the taxpayers the desire to grow is the natural instinct of any government agency and it is the natural instinct of us but it means to control government a legislative body has to continually fight that which naturally occurs its always an uphill battle we continue the old and introduce the new simply what we do is when we introduce a new program and there is still an old one in place it puts us in the silly position of using a computer and a typewriter at the same time comptroller walker before he retired in the same report that i just quoted said a fundamental reassessment of government programs policies and activities can help weed out programs that are outdated ineffective unsustainable or simply a lower priority than they used to be in most federal mission areas from lowincome housing to food safety to higher education assistance national goals are achieved through the use of a variety of tools and increasingly through participation of many organizations such as state and local governments that are beyond the direct control of the federal government government cannot accept as given all of the existing major programs policies and operations a fundamental review of what the federal government does how it does it and in some cases who does the governments business will be required particularly given the demographic tidal wave that is starting to show on our fiscal horizon a fundamental reassessment its a novel idea make agencies and programs continually prove their value that brings us to mr bradys bill the federal sunset act of 2008 sunset commissions arent a new idea states as are often the case are ahead of us here im told that there are 24 states currently that have some form of a sunset review and have saved millions of dollars through this process and it is simply about time the federal government follows their lead p j orourke once said the mystery of government is not how washington works but how to make it stop mr bradys bill helps solve that mystery its a practical solution that will make it easier to get rid of outdated or lowperforming or duplicative or wasteful government agencies and programs and i commend him for reintroducing this bill it is something this government has to have to put some balance and rationality and logic back into the delivery of services by the federal government and with that i would be happy to yield back to the

amendment to add a total of 40 million to the funding recommended by the committee for the domestic nuclear detection office i have concerns first of all about two of the proposed offsets first the amendment proposes to reduce funding for the office of the under secretary for management by 35 million the amendments adopted earlier this week already cut the office of the under secretary for management by 17 percent this amendment if adopted would reduce the office by another 18 percent this means that dhs will be unable to consolidate its 60 locations in the d c metro area into a new headquarters facility at st elizabeths secondly the amendment would reduce 5 million from the coast guards research development testing and evaluation program this decrease would eliminate priority research to resolve how the coast guard can best operate unmanned aerial vehicles at sea after recent failures in the deepwater program as well as find ways to better manage invasive species such as zebra muscles and ballast water at this time i dont believe that funding for the domestic nuclear detection office needs to be increased by 40 million the committee has alreadyincreased the total funding for the office above last years level by 35 million excluding the supplemental funding the bill before you did make some reductions within this office a reduction of 20 million for the securing the cities program and a reduction of 20 million for procuring radiation portal monitors let me briefly explain those items the securing the cities program is a proposed pilot program that assumes a radioactive device is heading to the heart of new york city and in order to detect this device an elaborate network of radiation detection devices will be installed in a ring around the city congress provided 10 million in 2007 to begin this effort yet to the best of my knowledge very little of this funding has been spent because the department of homeland security has not reached agreement with new york and new jersey officials on the architecture for this initiative or developed a mutually acceptable deployment plan dhs testified that this would not occur until at least the summer of 2007 the amendment being offered by the gentleman from new york would restore funding that we reduced from the presidentsbudget request for this program for 2008 in total we appropriate 19 7 million instead of the 39 7 million requested because of the delays in beginning the pilot program it is premature to quadruple this program in 1 year without a clear architecture and deployment plan that has beeil agreed to by all the parties in place the bill before you also reduced funding to procure radiation portal monitors for two reasons first the domestic nuclear detection office provided information after the submission of their budget request that reduced the number of radiation portal monitors it planned to procure from 149 to 127 systems in 2008 we fully fund this revised figure not a higher level that dndo no longer plans to procure secondly the recently enacted supplemental provided 100 million for the procurement of radiation portal monitors this funding coupled with the house level for 2008 means we are actually 80 million above the funding level requested in 2008 so more is not needed i urge members to oppose this amendment"], [0.0003540515899658203,

an historian explorer a hunter a frontiersman a conservationist an author a soldier a political reformer a governor and he was our nations youngest president after graduating from harvard in 1880 he was elected to the new york assembly where he was a prolific republican activist in 1884 after the tragic loss of his first wife and his mother he struck out for the western frontier in the dakotas roosevelt became an avid hunter and rancher as a deputy sheriff he chased down horse thieves and criminals the tough cowboy persona roosevelt developed on the frontier would stay with him for the rest of his life roosevelt made his mark as a political reformer when he became president of the new york city police commissioners and took on the corrupt practices of the time when the spanish american war broke out in 1898 roosevelt resigned his position as assistant secretary of the navy to organize and lead a volunteer cavalry brigade known as the rough riders roosevelt andthe rough riders became famous for their assault on san juan hill after roosevelts success on the battlefield he was elected the governor of new york as a republican roosevelts reputation as a political reformer grew as he

the gentleman from new york one of the earliest republican sponsors of this measure which i have drafted soon we will celebrate st patricks day that is a day when we will commemorate the enduring contributions of irish americans to the founding and development of this nation in fact if you read a book by tom cahill called how the irish saved civilization you would know that not only have the irish made an enduring contribution tothe founding and development of our country but that their contribution transcends our country when the world was a dark place when the roman empire fell when barbarians ruled they tore down libraries they destroyed all literature but it was the irish who built monasteries it was the irish who brought scribes in who literally copied all of the great works of civilization they preserved it they handed it down from one generation to the next so that we would have it today in fact it was irish who did save civilization and similarly it is the fighting irish the 69th infantry that has saved america time after time after time and always answered their countrys call tonight we put aside whatever political differences many of us have had in the past with respect to whether we should go to war in iraq or not have gone to war in iraq thats not what this is about because together every member of this house democrats and republicans support those who are fighting for our country and have answered the countrys call we support men and women when they are in battle we support them when they come home i have always said thank god we live in a country that gives us the right to agree with the decision to go to war the right to disagree with that decision the right to remain silent but no one has any right at all to forget the contributions that servicemembers make when they are called into duty that is what this resolution is about tonight there are k group of men who are in my friend from north carolinas district who are at fort bragg they are waiting to deploy to afghanistan with the fighting 69th they are continuing the proudest traditions of being deployed to some of the most dangerous places around the world in the french campaigns of world war i the islandhopping battles of world war ii in iraq that has been the history of the fighting 69th since in fact it is safe to say that it was the 69th that saved the union during the civil war and i would say with apologies to my friend from north carolina the fact of the matter is that those of us on the north side of the masondixon line recognize the fact that had it not been for the fighting 69th that we might have lost why is that because in 1861 there was a rumor that the british were going to assist and aid the confederacy because the british needed cotton and textiles had they done that that would have tilted the balance that would have ended the cause for those of us north of the masondixon line but you know what president lincoln did something very very smart knowing that we could not afford for that to happen he rallied the irish boys he went into new york city and he mobilized many brandnew irish american citizens in new york city and asked them to fight for freedom and to fight for the union and they fought they fought at malvern hill in virginia not very far away from here they fought against the dreaded and omnipotent louisiana tigers and they won that battle it was one of the first battles that the union won we were getting beaten in many of the early battles and when robert e lee asked his staff who beat us who did we just fight his staff said general it was the 69th new york to which robert e lee said ah the fighting 69th and that is how they got their name and they have carried that tradition with them ever since through four wars and a fight to come in afghanistan 19 campaigns six medals of honor on 9 11 many of them went to the lexington avenue armory i was there just a few weeks ago and then they went to ground zero one lost his life firefighter gerard batpees a first lieutenant in the 69th and then they went to iraq men like chris daniels from centerport lou delapizi from bay shore and col charles t crosby the commander of the 69th in new york city i want to wrap up by telling my colleagues that a few weeks ago i visited with men of the fighting 69th at the bay shore armory on long island and we had some good old new york pizza together and i plan to visit with them in afghanistan this july many of us marched in st patricks day parades last week many of us will march again in st patricks day parades this weekend

before our subcommittee and the financial services committee about the current home foreclosure spike according to data released by the mortgage bankers association while our country will continue to enjoy record homeownership rates foreclosures are on the rise and we should expect another 1 million americans to lose their homes this year these mortgage foreclosure rates raise eyebrows and call into question what actions can be taken to help homeowners keep their homes i would like to emphasize the word action almost 2 weeks ago this body passed by a vote of 4117 house resolution 526 sponsored by the gentleman from maryland this resolution called on this body to take action to support home ownership and responsible lending the resolution directed us to increase opportunities for loan counseling so what can congress do to meet this directive today what is it we should be doing right now to ensure that 650 000 homeowners and those who may follow can keep their homes one step in the right direction is to support the turner amendment to increase funding and therefore opportunities for housing counseling it is crucial to promote financial literacy and educate our youth and adults this is the most direct way of ensuring that consumers understand the terms of their loans go that they may avoid predatory loans and foreclosure altogether im pleased that on june 25
