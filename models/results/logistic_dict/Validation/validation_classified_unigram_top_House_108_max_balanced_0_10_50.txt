ability to meet crdtical domestic needs and foreign responsibilities i stand united with the president and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in our commitment to win the war against iraq and take all necessary steps to defeat terrorism and preserve national security both at home and abroad however despite the many new security and economic challenges confronting us the war and our homeland protection efforts shouid not and need not shortchange our domestic priorities we can win the war against iraq and terrorism without raiding social security and medicare and without increasing the national debt yet this republican budget resolution would accomplish just the opposite two years ago the administration and congress were looking covetously at a staggering 5 6 trillion cumulative surplus through 2010 at the time congress was continually reassured by the administration that we could afford an enormous tax cut ensure the solvency of social security and medicare pay down the national debt fund our domestic priorities and still have a large reserve fund for unanticipated emergencies like many of my colleagues i cautioned the administration at the time that its budget and enormous tax cut were based on unrealistic surplus projections that would never materialize earlier this year the congressional budget office cbo confirmed that in less than 2 years the 10year projected surplus has been erased while portions of this decline are a result of our efforts to defeat terrorism and preserve national security both at home and abroad the depletion of the surplus to date was largely caused by the fiscally irresponsible policies o1 2001 the additional 1 3 trillion in tax cuts much of which are due to excluding dividends from taxation that the administration and the republican leadership propose would only worsen our current situation and lead us further down the path bf mounting deficits and escalating public debt to pay for the additional lax cuts the republicans budget resolution would raid the entire 2 2 trillrn social security trust fund to cover deficit in the rest of the federal budget over the next 10 years moreover the projections used to frame this budget are overly optimistic they do not include the cost of the administrations plan to permanently extend several expiring lax cuts which would add 100 billion to the deficit between 2004 and 2013 in addition this budget omits the cost of extending relief from the selling individual alternative minimum tax amt beyond 2005 without amt relief the number of taxpayers subject to it will soar from 2 million today to over 43 million by 2013 the projections also leave out an assessment of the enormous cost of the current war and the subsequent costs of occupation which could last for a number of years the disappearance of the 10year surplus compels us to consider not just a 1year but also a longterm budget plan congress and the american people have the right to know how the republican leadership proposes to restore fiscal discipline while enacting additional multiyear tax cuts boosting spending for the military and meeting commitments to a growing number of retirees furthermore i find it incredibly irresponsible that the majority continues to pursue large fax cuts while shortchanging important domestic priorities congress should devise budgetary rules that make tax cuts contingent on the realization of specified targets for the budget surplus and the federal debt unfortunately this budget fails on all those accounts moreover this budget would cut domestic appropriations by 244 billion over 10 years below the amount needed to maintain services at the 2003 level remarkably the funding levels in this budget are 115 3 billion lower than the level in the presidents budget which many members on both sides of the aislethought was too low further it would require cuts of 265 billion over 10 years in programs such as medicaid veterans benefits student loans housing assistance and pensions and benefits for federal employee this budget also fails to provide funds for necessary infrastructure improvements or help hardpressed states and localities meanwhile it provides an inadequate prescription drug benefit and underfunds other key priorities without reaching balance until 2012 instead i plan to support the democratic alternative that would eliminate the unfair costly tax cuts for the rich and would provide targeted tax rebates to working families as well as additional funding for expanded unemployment benefits for laid off workers assistance for states and localities and necessary infrastructure projects it would also provide greater funding for medicare prescription drugs education housing homeland security and other vital domestic programs this alternative would provide an immediate boost to the economy and crate thousands of jobs without aggiavating our longterm deficits the need to respond to new shortterm needs is no excuse for ignoring the longterm problems we already have ultimately deficits do matter it is time that we all take the deleriorating budget outlook seriously we need to ensure that the burden of todays fiscal policies is not placed on the shoulders of our children and grandchildren this is a matter el fiscal stewardship and generational responsibility and we must address it without delay i urge my colleagues to reject this misguiddd budget and to develop one that will ensure security at home and abroad without dramatically increasing our debt borrowing against social security

and blacks latinos and other people of color are suffering and dying because of toxins in the environment dr martin luther king jr laid the groundwork when he declared that we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream the metaphors of nature are the metaphors of life and that is fundamentally where environmental justice begins and ends

the republican leadership and the bush administration this is no time for business as usual this is a time to reverse the damage done by the disgusting choices made by our colleagues on the other side of the aisle there are those who may tell us that the decision to leave 12 million children in lowincome working families on the cutting room floor was just a mistake but that would be a lie as the washington post editorialized yesterday stiffing these children was not a lastminute oversight or the unfortunate result of an unreasonably tight 350 billion ceiling in fact this was a deliberate meanspirited action committed in the name of protecting special interests instead of our nations children in fact a house republican ways and means committee spokesperson confessed that well adjustments had to be made let us be clear about what happened behind closed doors republican leaders got together with the administration and decided who was going to be thrown overboard and who would be brought to shore there were no democratic members in that room there were certainly no children or working families in the room and the decision was made to throw children and working families including military families overboard and to save the dividend tax cuts for millionaires while restoring the ability of corporations to unpatriotically stash their profits in bermuda

speak and i look at the very subject that we are talking about tonight i am very much concerned that they will not inherit a better country as a matter of fact the kinds of things that we are talking about tonight where words of this administration are inaccurate should give the entire american public chills because they are the things that lead to the chipping away of this wonderful institution that we call a democracy so i thank the gentleman for standing up and i thank all of my colleagues for coming out tonight certainly the gentleman from new jersey the gentlewoman from california and the gentlewoman from illinois i want to just for a moment talk about some of the misconceptions that we have seen and heard here as members of this great body first of all as members of the congress our constituents have vested a unique trust in us to represent their interests to the fullest degree and to make decisions that have a tremendous impact on their daily lives every day we are required to consider legislative proposals policy solutions and programmatic activities that shape the future of our nation in order to carry out our task for this greatest benefit of the american people it is absolutely essential that the most accurate and current information be at our disposal anything less would force us to abdicate our duties and perform an extreme disservice to the american people so i am growing increasingly disturbed and angered by the bush administrations penchant for being less than truthful with the peoples representatives one striking example of this tendency towards strategically bending the truth is the rationale provided for the iraq war what disturbs me most about the faulty reasoning provided by our rush to war is the fact that not only was our nations credibility at stake but most importantly human lives were at stake recent remarks by the spanish prime minister in which he called the united states occupation of iraq a fiasco and those are his words make it increasingly evident that international goodwill is beginning to turn against the united states it is clear that one of the very first casualties of this war was international respect for the united states of america although terrorists may be jailed or killed on the battlefield the war against terrorism will be fought and won in the hearts and minds by advancing unilateralist policies that isolate the rest of the world without concrete proof of imminent threat we have endangered not only our national security but also our national identity the bible says therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops several revelations have come to light as of late that seem to indicate that the administrations reasoning for war was flawed and the information provided to the public as justification for the war was misleading first we had secretary paul oneill a former member of president bushs cabinet saying that invading iraq was a top priority of this administration only 10 days after the inauguration of this administration that is in january of 2001 long before september 11 the administration had already had its sights on iraq then to add insult to injury former unitedstates weapons inspector david kay testified before the senate armed services committee that we were almost all wrong as it relates to our prewar intelligence and richard clarke the presidents former counterterrorism adviser is asserting that even though all credible evidence pointed to al qaeda as being responsible for september 11 the administration still insisted on finding a link to iraq and now we have this report entitled iraq on the record the bush administrations public statements on iraq issued by the special investigations division of the committee on government reform approximately 2 weeks ago and which was referred to by the gentlewoman from california just a moment ago this startling report which i submit for the record chronicles over 200 misleading statements about the threat posed by iraq that were made by this administration this chart which was included within the report graphs the occurrence and timing of these misleading statements the members may notice this sharp spike between august 2002 and october 2002 i am sure the members will recall that this happens to be around the same time congress was considering the resolution authorizing the use of force in iraq i am sure that it is far more than a coincidence that just as congress was debating whether or not force was necessary in iraq president bush vice president cheney secretary rumsfeld secretary powell and national security adviser condoleezza rice the administration made 64 misleading statements in 16 public appearances that amounts to more than two misleading statements per day during the 30day period between september 8 2002 and october 8 2002 i am sure that some of my colleagues across the aisle will find objection with this information but in advance let me assure my critics that this report only contains statements that were misleading at the time that they were made i am not referencing statements that the administration thought to be true at the time but were proven false in hindsight i am talking about statements that were not accurate reflections of the views of intelligence officials at the time they were made as a member of congress i am outraged by this purposeful twisting of the truth and every american who believes in truth and justice should be outraged also unfortunately the argument made for war in iraq was not the only case wherein the administration has knowingly misled the congress and the american public in december of 2003 the administration sent congress its national healthcare disparities report as i am sure the members are aware the law requires the department of health and human services to report to congress on national healthcare quality and national healthcare disparities these reports enable us as legislators to assess the status of the health care crisis in our nation and propose new solutions to eliminating those barriers to ensuring quality and affordable health care to every single american eliminating disparities in treatment and access to health care is a major priority of the congressional black caucus oftentimes people speak of health care disparities as an abstract issue that only exists in the realm of policy and political discussions under the leadership of the gentlewoman from the virgin islands chair of the congressional black caucus health braintrust we have tried to make the issue of health disparities one that people understand and that we are working diligently to improve through our health care disparities legislation apparently instead of joining the members of the congressional black caucus and other concerned members of congress in our effort to eradicate health disparities the bush administration has chosen to delude members of congress as to the extent and nature of the problem the report that the department of health and human services provided congress was absolutely shameful the special investigations unit of the committee on government reform has found that the department of health and human services altered conclusions of its scientists on health care disparities in order to gloss over the appearance of a national problem which is literally costing human lives a congressional investigation released in january entitled a case study in politics and science changes to the national healthcare disparities report which i will submit for the record made some startling findings which i want to share with the american people tonight the investigation revealed that the department of health and human services scientists found significant inequality in health care in the united states called health care disparities national problems emphasized that these disparities are pervasive in our health care system and found that the disparities carry a significant personal and societal price in its initial report however the final version of the disparities report that is the version the administration submitted to congress contained none none of these conclusions and instead minimized the importance and scope of the disparities in health care not only did the administration mislead all 535 members of congress by rewriting a scientific report required by law but the administration officials were dishonest with me personally when i asked about the changes made to the report dr carolyn clancy director of the department of health and human services agency for healthcare research and quality wrote a letter to me that began i am writing in partial response to your letter to secretary thompson expressing your concern that these changes were made to scientific facts and findings in the national healthcare disparities report she goes on to say as we will see on this chart the very next sentence of the letter read at the outset i want to make it clear that no data or statistics in the report were altered in any way whatsoever this is a letter that she sent to me however madamj speaker if one were to visit the agency for healthcare research and qualitys web site right now they would find another letter from dr clancy which reads over the course of the summer and fall changes with which i concurred meaning she concurred were made to the report by a broad array of staff including agency for healthcare research and quality the question becomes which one is the truth is this the truth or is this the truth no matter what there is an inconsistency that goes to the heart of a major issue on health care disparities finally i ask how is it that dr clancy can in good conscience tell me that no changes were made to the disparities report but a month later after public pressure admit that changes were indeed made this is about more than my feeling personally insulted by dr clancy this is an insult to african american women who are more than twice as likely to die of cervical cancer than are white women and are more likely to die of breast cancer than women of any other racial or ethnic group this is an insult to african americans who are having more strokes at earlier ages who are more likely to die from them and who experience worse levels of recovery than other racial groups this is about the prevalence of high blood pressure within the african american community that ranks among the highest in the world this is about the administration knowing that all of these problems exist and choosing to do absolutely nothing about it and furthermore masking the truth about its existence so i could go on and on but it is so interesting too that on dr martin luther kings birthday president bush visited an african american church and said today would have been his 75th birthday and this is president bush speaking as i conclude its important for our country to honor his life and what he stood for later in the day the president visited dr kings memorial in atlanta georgia and held a moment of silence at his tomb all of this was very moving and touching yet the very next day the president appointed judge charles pickering over the objection of united states senators the congressional black caucus and all of these civil rights organizations i find it rather ironic that 1 day after the photoop with dr kings widow coretta scott king and after saying that the nation should honor what dr king stood for that president bush would have appointed a judicial nominee that was vigorously opposed by nearly every single civil rights group in the entire nation so i would say to the gentleman from new jersey i thank him for yielding to me again we all have come out we could be at home resting but we cannot rest when we see the deceptions that are taking place for we

to pay for the war we have chosen to put it on the backs of not only those that are our young people out there defending our country but on the backs of their children we now also find that in addition to favoring the wealthiest of this country the administrations tax plan excludes those who need the assistance the most low and moderateincome families families making between 10 500 and 26

eligible for the tax break are now no longer going to qualify the child tax credit has long been crucial for hispanic families working families who are deeply affected by the tax burden while 85 percent of latino males are in the workforce the largest percentage for any ethnic group in the country many hispanics work in seasonal lowwage jobs and the majority of hispanics do not participate in

every five eligible preschool children instead of expanding thelibraries in head start classrooms this bill will take books out of the hands of our most atrisk children rather than providing teachers additional resources we are jamming even more students into the crowded classrooms this legislation jeopardizes funding slashes critical health services weakens educational standards and repeals civil rights protections i am outraged by the republican bill but i am not surprised the republican leadership constantly extols family values yet its legislative agenda so clearly fails to value american families"]], "top_incorrect": [[0.9966592788696289, 0.9966592788696289, 0, "i yield myself such time as i may consume as has been mentioned in different forms earlier in this debate this is serious business it is serious business and i believe knowing that we are engaged in this war on terrorism which we have been now for over 2 years we have to respond in a timely manner to those americans that we put at risk and i would remind my colleagues that threefourths of this bill or slightly more goes to support our troops and we have focused on other parts probably that is good for the debate but we should not lose sight of the fact that threefourths of this goes directly to our troops now we have some difference of opinion between the other house with their supplemental budget the quicker we can get this into conference the quicker we can get a bill passed and the quicker we can get the president to sign it to support our troops frankly the better off we are i would just make one observation that i found rather interesting because we spent a great deal of time debating before i was here on the gulf war resolution i was not here but i understand that was a debate that was inspiring for the congress that really when we look at that from a historical standpoint is why we are here today because of whatever reasons and agreements were made following the gulf war saddam remained in power now we are in a situation where we have to complete that we had a long debate when we decided to go to war in iraq this year properly the right thing to do and now we have debated this supplemental to support our troops for into the third day from a historical standpoint i would just like to remind members that sometimes this body moves extremely fast on important issues right after december 7 1941 when we declared war on japan and germany the unitedstates house of representatives allocated 40 minutes for each of those resolutions i think it is important for us to get this done as quickly as we possibly can so i urge my colleagues to vote for the previous question i oppose this new rule to recklessly cease debate and eliminate all opportunity for amendments on behalf of the american people i now will speak to h r 3289 before us the task of stabilizing and reconstructing iraq may end up being one of the greatest challenges of our generation although we are getting rosy reports of progress in iraq from the administration the fact that we have 130 000 troops in the area and are now being handed an 87 billion tab paints a fully different picture it is now obvious that the administration grossly underestimated the cost and difficulty of stabilizing iraq almost to the same extent that they overestimated the threat posed to the american people by saddam hussein even the socalled soft costs of the war and its aftermath are enough to cripple some nations this is not revisionist history at least a hundred of us in congress millions of citizens who took to the streets and even a handful of brave souls in the administration itself tried to warn the administration of what it was getting into with its preemptive strike on iraq we were ignored and those in the administrationthe shinsekis and the lindseys have been encouraged to move on but the problems in iraq have not gone away so gracefully we are now at an important crossroads we can continue to beat this dead horse with the same policies of isolation from our allies around the worid and partisanship here in the united states or we can start working together employing the collective wisdom of all of us here and around the nation with the experience and expertise to be of service in this endeavorand who are committed to our troops and to fulfilling the promise the president made to the people of iraq and afghanistan and to the world as this debate comes to the halls of congress the people who marched us into this war will try to paint this vote as a vote for or against our troops this is absolutely a false picture for one thing our military is extremely well funded as i just described including the iraq supplementals the defense budget will be approaching 500 billion furthermore iraq is not an indigent nation if they wanted to they could take better care of our troops secretary rumsfeld wants to spend billions of dollars on a star wars defense system while we are getting reports that our soldiers risking their lives in iraq dont have adequate body armor or clean water supplies or basic human necessities like feminine hygiene products for our women soldiers six months after this battle started we still have soldiers without kevlar body armor and water purifiers what did they do with the first 79 billion war supplemental we now have a new request for money but we still have not heard details of how they spent the first money what progress has been made and what challenges remain i visited the assayllyah central command base in doha qatar last weekend and heard the concerns of the troops from their own mouths i heard testimony about how a ground soldier watched his partner and the operator of a military vehicle get tossed out as the vehicle was thrown airborne by a land mine why did you hit this mine i asked it was just one of those mines that was missed in the sweep said the soldier because there isnt enough personnel or specialists to assign to technical tasks unskilled or untrained technicians frequently get asked to do jobs that they have not mastered enough to guarantee the lives of those who must traverse the sands of baghdad the soldier misses his wife and newborn baby dearly because there hasnt been a change in the personnel on the front lines in several months many reservists and active duty servicemen and women have spent a longer time in iraq than was promised by the administration may 1 2003 was supposed to have been a day of hope and homecoming instead it was a sham some of these troops feel like sitting ducks out in the foreign terrain they dont speak arabic they dont know tikrit like they know their hometowns when i asked them if they have seen any troops of other coalition nations they responded what coalition troops they need support and they need continuous relief the president and his friends in leadership in congress did not listen to the warnings of the congressional black caucus or our international allies or hundreds of thousands of likeminded citizens who took to the streets some of my democratic colleagues voted for this war because they believed in the institution of the presidency and thought they had to give this administration the benefit of the doubt i did not regardless now the president has cut open this patient and the patient is laying on the surgical table the president has made a promise to the people of iraq and to the world that we will leave the patient better than we found itand it is up to our american soldiers and the american taxpayers to fulfill that promise much of the toughest burden will fall on the shoulders of the families of our troops overseas therefore i have submitted amendments that speak to alleviation of this burden 1 i firmly believe that before any further funds are sent to iraq to rebuild that country we need to ensure that our men and women in the armed forcesreservists as well as active servicemen and women are receiving the money and services that they deserve and in a timely fashion dr jones who works under lt col corbett shared this concern with me during my visit 2 i also believe that the pentagon needs to develop a plan to ensure that none of our troops or government employees must remain stationed in iraq for more than 6 months at a time 3 furthermore the administration must announce a definite and clear exit plan for the troops to give them real hope and a notion that an end to the fighting is truly near 4 there should also be more trained military policemen and women stationed in iraq to mitigate the vulnerabilities experienced by these men and women 5 similarly they need proper job allocation so that lives are not lost due to erroneous assignment of duties 6 moreover as to the national guard servicepersons the scheduled end of deployment should be honored rather than making them continue fighting until their respective units are released despite their frustrations i encouraged them with the following phrase you are as much defenders as you are peacekeepers to let them know that their work truly matters the most for the people of iraq as well as the people at home in the united states i sincerely wish the president had not put us in this situation but he and his administration did and now we have to deal with it if we are going to deal with it i feel at this point it is critical to take some of the control away from the people who have made horrible misjudgments at every step of the way who misled the american people and the congress about the need for war and who ignored warnings from inside and outside the administration either they knew the truth chose to mislead us or they did not take the time to adequately assess and plan for the true situation either way senior members of this administration were not doing their jobs that is why before any appropriations are sent to rebuild iraq the congress and the american people need to see an independent inestigation in progress looking deeply into several questions whether unitedstates intelligence reports were manipulated in order to misrepresent the threat saddam hussein posed to american interests whether the costs and dangers of invading and occupying iraq were deliberately understated whether american officials who offered differing views of iraq became the victims of inappropriate or illegal retaliation and whether one or more individuals within the administration is or are responsible for the leak of classified information regarding intelligence reports and the veracity of accounts as to the purchase of yellowcake for nuclear weapons production if any of these allegations are proved true those responsible must be held accountable i am concerned that there has been a methodical and undemocratic effort to mislead and intimidate the american people and the world in order to march us into this war and now we are being given an 87 billion bill to pay for that effort as we move forward in iraq unfortunately we have severely limited options because people like secretary rumsfeld have used reckless speech that has angered and exasperated our allies many of our most staunch allies are now reluctant to get involved in stabilizing and reconstructing iraq while our stale department has been reaching out around the world with a hand of cooperation and partnership mr rumsfeld has proudly displayed his arrogance and disdain for anyone not walking lockstep with him too much is at stake to distance ourselves from those whose help we need people from democracies around the world are now being asked to trust this administration with the lives of their sons and daughters in the military by sending them to fight under a unitedstates command whose leaders show them blatant disrespect they are being encouraged to send their hardearned money to reconstruct iraq under the authority of this administration that gives the largest contracts to its political supporters that seems to have no credible plan for the future and that ignores the advice of even the most trusted experts on the world stage it is not surprising that they are not stepping up with money and troops i think the problem is basically a lack of trust i cant blame them i do not trust this administration to do the right thing in iraq either i do not intend to vote to send another dime to iraq until the president takes some dramatic steps to restore credibility to his administration first i want to see new faces in top positions starting with donald rumsfeld we need people who choose integrity over politics end respect over arrogance second i want to see a full accounting of how they spent the first 79 billion and exactly how they came up with this 87 billion figure our sources say that the armed services were barely consulted on those numbersthat some critical needs were totally left out and others grossly exaggerated we need honest accounting and third once we have a true picture of what funds are necessary to support our troops congress should be able to vote on that funding aloneseparate from the money needed for reconstruction of iraq that bifurcated vote will allow us to quickly get money to protect our brave soldiers but will also give us the time we need to thoughtfully craft a plan for reconstructiona plan that will include our allies and the world bank nongovernment organizations ngos and oil and natural resources from iraq itself those are the three things i want to see before i can consider giving any more money to this administration for the united states effort in iraq this does not mean that i do not want to support our troops and this does not mean that i want to break the presidents promise to the iraqi people and to the world that he would make things better in iraq instead it is a call for action i want to get the appropriate amount of money to the people who deserve itbut right now i am not confident that 87 billion is the right amount or that it would be spent in a way that would help our troops help the iraqi people stabilize the region or prevent terrorism there are just too many questions and not enough answers why do we need 950 million for recruiting and training of police forces in iraq when we need more money for police and firefighters in houston new york washington dc and philadelphia why do we need 209 million for prison and detention facilities and 100 million for construction of a new prison in iraq when our federal prisons are overcrowded and severely underfunded too many questions and not enough answers do we really need 100 million for a witness protection program and 5 65 billion to repairand rehabilitate the infrastructure in iraq when a few months ago the whole eastern seaboard was without power are we really serious finally are we really serious about supplying iraq with 793 million for health care programs when we still have children without health insurance elderly without health insurance and our poor citizens without health insurance there are just too many questions and not enough answers there will be many thoughtful amendments offered that could ensure that the funds that we do not bankrupt our treasury while failing our troops and the people who need our help i urge all of my colleagues to put politics and pride aside and consider them so that together we can get our efforts in the middle east back on track i have several amendments that i think will help get our policies back on track my first amendment states that none of the funds made available in this act may be obligated or expended until government personnel policies have been implemented to ensure that no members of the armed forces or government employees are being required to be stationed in iraq continuously for a period greater than 6 months the president has stated that the war on terror will be a long and involved one therefore we must pace ourselves and we must ensure that our armed services can continue to recruit good people in the future this amendment will help ensure that our troops and their families remain mentally fit and rested and that military tours will remain a reasonable commitment in service to this nation the second states that of the funds made available in this act may be obligated or expended until all reserve and national guard personnel are paid in full the third amendment requires that none of the funds made available in this act may be obligated or expended until the president has submitted to congress a report setting forth in detail the strategy and projected timetable for withdrawing unitedstates forces in iraq without goals i am concerned that our efforts in iraq could drift indefinitely congress and the american people must know what lies ahead so that we can plan appropriately the fourth is a sense of the house of representatives that before any appropriation under this act is obligated a special counsel should be appointed to investigate the propriety and legality of actions by the administration in connection with the unauthorized release of classified information we have a complex mission ahead of us in the middle east to succeed we will need to take advantage of every single national security asset at our disposal recently one of our top cia operatives was outed by white house employees thus compromising her work and even the lives of her sources and acquaintances overseas if we do not show the appropriate immediate vigorous response we could undermine our efforts in the middle east by discouraging people to come to american officials with assistance or information finally i have two amendments that will help refocus some of our energy and resources on afghanistan the supplemental continues to shortchange afghanistans reconstruction and security and it does this at the peril of jeopardizing the rights of afghan women and girls and hopes for a peaceful democratic afghanistan the proposed funding levels neither adequately make up for the small amounts of reconstruction funding thus far nor do they meet the countrys needs in the last 2 years only 1 percent of afghanistans reconstruction needs have been met the country remains in shambles from two decades of war and lack of development most people in the country do not have access to electricity health care schools and sanitation not only is the lack of reconstruction depriving people of very basic services but it is contributing to instability in the country and a lack of confidence in the central government the transitional government in afghanistan estimates that between 20 to 30 billion is needed over the next five years in other postconflict settings an average of 250 per person was spent per year in aid but in afghanistan donors spent only 64 per person in the proposed 800 million afghanistan reconstruction supplemental spending request represents less than 1 percent of the total 87 billion iraq and afghanistan package the 20 billion request for iraq reconstruction funding is 25 times as large as the afghanistan request yet afghanistan has approximately the same population size as iraq and suffered more destruction over 23 years of war house chairman youngs mark to increase reconstruction funding for afghanistan by 400 million is a step in the right direction but still more must be done my first afghanistan amendment will shift 20 million from the iraq budget toward afghanistan to be used for developing electricitygeneration and transmission infrastructure if afghanistan is ever going to thrive and progress it will need consistent sources of energy to power its factories hospitals and homes these funds will help the other amendment will improve the plight of afghan women and girls women and girls continue to face severe hardship and violations of their rights in afghanistan yet the afghanistan request does not specify funds for programs to improve the status of women and to remedy the tremendous injustices they faced under the taliban regime my amendment proposes designating 300 million for womens programs in the area of political rights and human rights health care education and training and security protection and shelters i also propose earmarks of 10 million of the afghan independent human rights commission and 24 million for the ministry of womens affairs we must provide direct support to help strengthen those womenled permanent afghan institutions whose mission it is to promote womens rights and human rights these are funds already authorized in the afghan freedom support act of 2002 but which still for the most part have not been appropriated some girls have gone back to school in afghanistan but the majority have not because there are not enough schools and those that do exist are in very bad shape the asian development bank estimates that an additional 13 851 primary schools need to be constructed but the administration request is only for 275 schools some 40 percent of schools in afghanistan were completely destroyed during the war another 15 percent were heavily damaged and in many areas of the country there were no schools for girls whats more the advances in girls education that have been made are under attack in the past year fundamentalist extremists have burned down bombed and otherwise violently attacked more than 30 girls schools at most of the sites of these attacks leaflets have been distributed threatening the families of girls who attend school or the teachers who teach them flyers distributed at the site of one of the first attacks read stop sending your women to offices and daughters to schools it spreads indecency and vulgarity stand ready for the consequences if you do not heed the advice some families are now afraid to send their daughters to school our nation promised to help free afghan women we cannot allow the extremists to take back these newly won freedoms i hope my colleagues will support these amendments we must look toward a brighter future in iraq and work together to make that vision happen"], [0.9841301441192627, 0.9841301441192627, 0, "i yield myself such time as i may

i noted in my comments on the resolution commemorating the 50th anniversary of brown on the house floor last month the quest for civil rights has been and must continue to be a bipartisan effort this was particularly true in the passage ofthe 1964 civil rights act recognizing that segregationists in the democratic party could forestall the passage of any civil rights legislation the kennedy administration actively sought to build a bipartisan consensus in favor of the bill from the moment of its introduction in that spirit republican ranking member william m mcculloch joined with democratic chairman emanuel celler to guide the bill through the house committee on the judiciary their efforts ultimately led 138 republicans to join 152 mostly northern democrats to overwhelmingly pass a compromise measure in the full house on february 10 1964 in the senate bipartisanship was even more important for passage of the act due to the rules of that body a minority of senators mostly southern democrats were able to prevent a vote on the act for 52 days against this backdrop republican minority leader everett mckinley dirksen succeeded in drafting an alternative clean bill with majority leader mike mansfield that kept most of the substantive provisions of the house bill while tweaking it sufficiently to gain the support of a few swing republican senators the dirksenmansfield

with 45 democrats to pass the civil rights act by a 73 to 27 margin when the senatepassed measure returned to the house for final action a bipartisan coalition succeeded in ensuring that the bill would go to the floor without an amendment on july 2 1964 the house passed the civil rights act with yet another bipartisan vote of 289 to 126 the bill went to the white house where president johnson signed it into law before a live televisionaudience the same day the legislative history of the civil rights act demonstrates what can happen when republicans and democrats work together neither side

because it is taken from the american people presumably to be put in trust for the american people to make available to them such things as civil service retirement as medicare benefits and as social security retirement in later years so there was a surplus but it was not a surplus that resulted in paying down the debt now a debt was paid down the debt that was paid down was the public debt and i am sure the average citizen had no idea that there were two debts a public debt and the national debt while we paid down the public debt the national debt kept going up as i mentioned earlier i checked with the cbo and there was not a moment in time during those 4 or 5 years when washington was telling the american people that we were paying down the debt when in fact the debt that really mattered the debt that we are passing on our children and grandchildren there never was a moment in time when that debt went down it went up that debt is projected to go up faster and faster over the next several years looking at the curve in the next 2 years this jumps up just about half a trillion dollars the advertised deficit ii only 245 billion but the real deficit is going to be roughly twice that because we have to add to whatever washington tells us the deficit is we have to add to that the monies that are taken from the trust fund now this whole trust fund charade started during the johnson years those who are older remember his guns and butter he was running deficits that were embarrassingly high so what his administration did to hide those deficits was to move those trust

weapons of mass destruction we know that our forces in afghanistan uncovered plans by al qaeda to engage in bloterrorism we know from recent arrests in europe that terrorist groups have the means and the will to carry out such attacks it is wrthout question that bioterrorism is a clear and present danger to the american people perhaps one of our greatest threats in response to this threat the administration is proposing this legislation commonly known as project bloshield this bill is a first step toward ensuring that we protect americans from the horror of bioterrorism the purpose of the bloshield legislation is to provide incentives to private companies to produce the medicines the vaccines the antidotes we need to counter a biological attack quite frankly this concept is an experiment a grand experiment but no less an experiment we do not know if the incentives will drive our pharmaceutical industry to invest the resources needed to truly prepare our country for the full range of possible biological attacks if we do we will have been successful and our country will be better off if they do not our country will remain dangerously vulnerable i support project bloshield because i believe this is an experiment worth conducting but from the beginning of this process i have been working to build mechanisms into the legislation that would monitor whether the legislation is truly making our nation safer for example the select committee on homeland security added a requirement that the secretary of health and human services report annually if the president has identified biological agents that are threats to the united states but no private company has contracted to produce a countermeasure thus if there is a bioterrorist threat to the american people and private industry will notrise to the challenge of searching for a cure we have the right to know about it these concerns were shared by the gentleman from california mr cox chairman of the select committee on homeland security they were also shared by the gentleman from louisiana chairman tauzin of the committee on energy and commerce and the ranking member the gentleman from michigan if bioshield does not work as we hope it will we will need plan b thus i am very pleased that the legislation contains clear authority that allows the government to operate an emergency program to develop and produce vaccines in my view this is so very important because protecting our population is our first responsibility if the private sector is not producing the medicines we need and we find ourselves under the threat of biological attack then the government needs to have the authority to do the job directly the language that has been inserted in the legislation gives the president the secretary of health and human services the secretary of homeland security the necessary authority to take action in the event that this experiment with the private sector fails to produce the results we all hope it will produce my final concern is that project bioshield despite its creative name is really a fairly modest proposal if we are lucky at the end of 10 years we will have some vaccines to address a few of the possible pathogens that terrorists could use during a bioterror at tack but the potential problems are much more expansive terrorists may soon be able to genetically manipulate biological agents so they are resistant to our current stockpile of antibodies and perhaps to the vaccines we develop this possibility presents a daunting threat to our nation that is why i would like to see a much more robust proposal than the one before us today an approach that moves us faster and stronger toward creating a comprehensive defense to the full range of threats we face from bioterrorism based on the information that we all know about we clearly need a manhattan project to prepare this country to deal with the vast array and the diverse types of biological threats that we may face in the years ahead time and time again when faced with such a great challenge the government has played a central role in organizing a massive response when war threatened to consume the world we put an end to it through the success of the original manhattan project when we raced the russians to the stars the apollo project put a man on the moon it will take these kinds of bold actions this kind of bold leadership and deep resolve to prevail in the war on terror i wholeheartedly support this current legislation but i also believe that our nation must take even stronger steps much sooner in order to protect us and to secure us in the days ahead i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.0005166232585906982, 0.4994833767414093, 0, "i thank the chairman for yielding me this time

tothank the gentleman from texas the chairman of the committee on energy and commerce and the gentleman from michigan ranking democrat on that committee in the same way that this was a collaboration between the committee on energy and commerce and the select committee on homeland security in the congress and the committee on government reform in the house of representatives chaired by the gentleman from virginia who will speak shortly likewise it was a collaborative effort in the senate including their government affairs committee it is a collaborative effort within the administration that we are setting up the department of homeland security and the department of health and human services will partner in this first responder effort of un precedented magnitude and i should say that this is the largest first responder program ever enacted in american history the purpose of course is to protect americans to protect americans in the event of an attack that puts this squarely in the orbit of what we consider to be first response but we need to make sure that our first responders have the tools that they need to arrest the spread of a biological attack and to protect americans before it is too late every second every moment really does count in the event of a terror attack as the senate majority leader dr frist has so ably pointed out in his book on this topic it was 18 months ago that president bush called on congress to enact a bill to speed the development of antidotes vaccines against biological warfare and against chemical weapons we need to have drugs vaccines and antidotes to combat these weapons if they are used against us as we now expect they might be we know for example that mr zarqawi when he was in afghanistan was working on biological and chemical weapons development he is now attacking americans and leading the terrorist attacks on americans in iraq we know that osama bin laden at various times expressed interest in and may have acquired precursors of these same kinds of weapons we cannot take these kinds of threats lightly and we are not the bill that we are passing today reflects a model for future legislation because it is so collaborative homeland security requires us to knit together different responsibilities different authorities the responsibilities of different agencies of government of law enforcement different levels of government federal state and local as never before that is going to happen under this bill as well in the first instance it will be the responsibility of the department of homeland security to assess the global threat to tell us what are the most likely and most threatening agents that could be used against us then we will hand off to the department of health and human services which will help after the priorities are set for this research jointly with dhs implement this program the research priorities will be implemented based on the information that has been provided by the department of homeland security by properly understanding the threats that confront us based on our countrys best intelligence we can allocate our resources and focus our efforts where they are most needed on the biological chemical and radiological agents for which the risks and potential consequences of attacks are greatest another genius of this program is that it is not a governmentrun program the government is putting significant resources at the ready to provide an incentive and a market to purchase any successful products that are developed as a result of our call to action but we are unleashing the creative genius of the private sector under the presidents new national biodefense directive issued on april 28 2004 all bioterrorism projects and programs will fall under a coordinated and focused strategic plan this will help maximize these resources that we are putting to work here and it will ensure a unified effort across all the federal agencies bioshield is an integral part of this strategic plan it will draw upon the expertise and resources of the private sector as almost no other government program that is part of the strategic plan in order to produce more quickly those countermeasures necessary to make our nation safer it is important to recognize the visionary leadership of the president in this regard it is without exaggeration or embellishment that i can say that this president president bush and his administration and in particular vice president cheney have devoted more attention and more resources to the fight against bioterror than any administration in history prior to 2001 our investmentsin research and development and other public health preparedness activities were minimal they are now profound the president and this congress are allocating annually billions of dollars to this fight and under project bioshield alone we will spend 5 6 billion over the next 10 years the president is clearly leading the way project bioshield was not dreamed uphere in the halls of congress but with big obstacles to addressing that need we have acted so it is with both bipartisan pride i think and also with collaboration in mind between the executive branch and the legislative branch that we can say that we have enacted into law we very shortly will be able to do this next week we will be able to say this the most significant first responder program in our nations history the select committee looks forward to working with president bush secretary ridge secretary7thompson and the other committees in the house and senate to make sure we leverage the resources provided by project bioshield to build a sustained countermeasure capacity to protect our nation and our citizens from the everevolving threat of weapons of mass

institution which provides professional expertise and services and resources to parties that are involved in environmental disputes it assists in resolving those environmental and natural resources issues public lands conflicts that involve the federal government and other governmental agencies and it deals with conflicts on a nationwide basis in 5 years of operation the institute has been

than that it does as we have already heard authorize 4 million 1 million of which would be for a participation fund which would assist the stakeholders communities agricultural interests resources users tribes that are involved in environmental disputes with the federal government and it would help them participate in alternative conflict resolution processes the finds are intended to continue general services and provide assistance to the federal and state agencies and tribal governments this institute has already more than paid for itself literally countless numbers of disputes have been resolved in a way that have saved taxpayers millions of dollars by resolving them quickly and resolving them in a way that avoided litigation the institute does work and the reason it can do the work
