ceos continued to receive milliondollar payouts while too many middle class americans are still out looking for work this congress is voting again to give over 160 000 a year in tax breaks to the richest 2 percent of americans while the average american will be lucky to get about one100th or maybe two100ths of that can anyone in this chamber blame the middle class for thinking the system is rigged against them we all admire financial success but when we give away trillions in tax cuts that we cannot afford to those who need them the least its the middle class who has to make up the difference to pay for these tax cuts our republican colleagues have voted to end medicare and would force seniors to pay 6 400 more for their own care on top of that republicans propose changing social security slashing its budget by over 800 million its an ideological agenda that chooses millionaires over the middle class regular folks pay more so that folks like donald trump and mitt romney can get yet another tax break einstein is credited with saying that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results eleven years after the bush

know it rather than protecting the promise of medicare for seniors now and into the future the republicans break that promise rather than reducing costs through payment and delivery system reforms the republicans do nothing to contain costs and they simply shift the cost burden onto our seniors rather than guaranteed benefits the republicans leave seniors on their own to buy what benefits they can afford with a voucher of limited value this means seniors are subjected to the uncertainty of the insurance industry meaning possible discrimination based on age illness and income their budget even

have the opportunity to participate in this reform as we have heard many times over the past couple of weeks to govern is to choose last year as the nation well knows the choice by our friends across the aisle was to do no budget at all the democrats failed in perhaps their most basic responsibility now continuing in this line of inaction the president gave a speech yesterday with much preceding hype but again the defining aspect of the speech was no plan our rudderless president decided to take the two biggest drivers of our national debt medicare and social security and take them off the table his solution to addressing health care costs is further empowering the independent payment advisory board to ration health care instead of dealing with structural reforms what this all means is that we have a stark choice a choice of two futures one future is the presidents plan the one in red here the plan by the house democrats thats a path to national bankruptcy the other choice is a path to prosperity the green that gets us on a path to a balanced budget its time to address the american people in an honest and a factual manner lets face it the american people are sick and tired of washingtons gimmicks and empty promises and the path to prosperity is a bold vision for the future which relies upon facts not dishonesty as a physician i could tell you that obamacare is a threat to the affordability and accessibility and quality of health care all the principles that we hold dear in american medicine the facts are that obamacare is a violation of these principles and it takes away choices from patients and doctors while saddling workers and job creators and taxpayers with trillions of dollars in costs so we completely repeal and defund obamacare further we will save and preserve medicare for future generations by providing commonsense solutions so that folks have essentially the same kinds of health care choices that members of congress have its imperative that people recognize that no changes are made that would affect those in or near retirement now many folks on the other side of the aisle would rather bury their heads in the sand and ignore the reforms that need to be made to medicare the president has even decided to take it off the table but the facts are that the current medicare spending is growing at a rate twice as fast as the nations economy ten thousand baby boomers are reaching retirement age every single day as a physician when i talk to medicare patients in my district back home they tell me that they cant even find a doctor who is taking new medicare patients the system is broken and unsustainable the status quo is unacceptable by completely repealing and defunding obamacare and by saving medicare we advance this nation in a

congress has not spent every single day of the last year and a half fighting to put people back to work is unconscionable and now instead of fighting for goodpaying american jobs republicans are launching their 31st attempt to repeal the affordable care act first the republicans said the law was unconstitutional the supreme court said they were wrong next republicans said the law was too expensive the congressional budget office said they were wrong now republicans say the law will raise taxes on millions of middle class families the urban institute says they are wrong estimating that a mere 3 percent of americans under 65 will face the choice between purchasing insurance and paying a penalty lets review what the affordable care act actually does we know it extends health insurance to 32 million uninsured americans which will prevent the unnecessary deaths of 45 000 people who die each year because they lack health insurance we know it will enable millions of americans with preexisting medical conditions to get insurance this has gotten publicity also every middle class family today is one cancer diagnosis away from bankruptcy fiftyfive percent of all personal bankruptcies are caused by health care emergencies and 75 percent of these bankruptcies are of people who had health insurance but health insurance that proved inadequate to cover an expensive disease like cancer by preventing insurance companies from denying coverage for preexisting conditions and by eliminating the annual and lifetime caps on coverage found in most current policies the affordable care act will guarantee that middle class families will no longer have to fear going broke because of an expensive illness despite all of the benefits of this law republicans have decided the whole law must go fine they want to repeal and replace replace it with what what is the republican plan to stem the everrising cost of health care in this country and to reduce outofpocket health costs what is the republican plan to help millions more americans gain access to health insurance what is the republican plan to end discrimination in the insurance market for women for those with preexisting conditions for those who are sick and going broke with medical bills and those who die because of lack of care there is none the simple truth is that the republicans have no plan i urge my republican

the problem and hope it goes away lets not be indifferent to 45 000 unnecessary deaths of americans every single year i urge my colleagues to vote no on this repeal bill so that we can move on to

concern that this bill destroysdestroysamerican jobs and he said so be it well i guess that he meant so be it if there are 1 300 fewer cops on the beat because this bill terminates the cops hiring program so be it if there are 2 400 fewer firefighters on the job protecting their communities because this bill eliminates funding for safer grants so be it if there are 20 000 fewer researchers at

find it more convenient and politically expedient to make targets of energy companies these are companies who invest their own capital and resources to increase our countrys energy supply and the security of our nation they want nothing more than to operate in a free market environment without excessive government regulations however in a move to deflect the spotlight from this administrations own failings and the democrat partys own failings and their incompetent policies this administration and many in congress find it easier to attack the success of the energy companies than to actually confront the challenges that we face often espousing policies to increase government interference in the marketplace that do more harm than good recently companies like koch industries which employs more than 10 000 people in my home state of georgia contributing more than 700 million to our states economy along with tens of millions in community and environmental philanthropic efforts have come under attack by several democrats in this body and this administration just because kochs work provides for an easy red meat target to throw to their radical environmental friends its also a sad state of affairs when other energy companies actually post a positive profit report even though most of these profits go back into more energy exploration as well as clean energy development im also sure that you wont hear many attacks on how those profits help boost the retirement accounts of millions of americans and put more into our struggling economy than any government stimulus program has or could according to the new washington post abc news survey out today more than seven in 10 americans are suffering financial hardship from the skyrocketing gas prices in fact weve got a chart here tonight the first one in a series this is the gas price the average retail price in america when barack obama took office the average price at that time was 1 84 per gallon just as recently as january of 2009 a little over 2 years ago look whats happened as of april 25 of this year the average price per gallon was 3 88 the average price 2 years ago was 1 84 now it is 3 88 2 higher over twice its over double in just a 2year period of time gas prices dont just affect the price at the pump i was talking to a member just a few minutes ago she was telling me that she just fueled her pickup truck and it cost her over 100 to fill the gas tank of her pickup truck she and her husband own a ranch they are active ranchers out west never before has she had to pay 100 to fill the tank of her vehicle and i filled the tank of mine and it was almost 90 in my gmc yukon that ive used to make house calls as a medical doctor this is unsustainable our gas prices impact our grocery bills job opportunities travel plans and thousands of other decisions that businesses and families make in fact according to an analyst from cameron hanover every penny increase in the price of gas costs consumers american citizens consumers more than 4 million per day a onepenny increase costs consumers over 4 million per day and folks who are hurt the most by this the people who are hurt the most are poor people and people who are on limited incomes our senior citizens as the cost of fuel and gas and oil go up because of the misplaced policies of this administration this winter fuel prices are going to be out of the roof in fact the president said while we were talking about his capandtrade bill not long ago he said that energy prices to use the presidents words would necessarily skyrocket for his policies necessarily skyrocket under president obama the cost of energy has skyrocketed thats what he has said in a national speech the national average price of gasoline as i just mentioned was 1 84 when president obama took office today it is 3 96 rising gasoline prices are hurting families and small businesses they are costing jobs in fact i just talked to a manager of a restaurant in my hometown of athens georgia just this last weekend he was telling me that when he orders food for his restaurant his suppliers are adding a fuel surcharge a fuel surcharge onto the cost of groceries food for his restaurant thats happening in all the grocery stores and thats happening all across this country its threatening our economy and our economic recovery while the new house majority is taking steps to address gas prices and help create jobs with the american energy initiative the obama administrations antienergy policies are driving up prices and they are threatening our economy by blocking american energy production we have had a 16 percent decrease in american energy production under this administration it is 16 percent lower than it was projected to be future projections show continued decreases in domestic production and more and more reliance upon foreign imports for our energy sources particularly for gas and oil were getting those energy resources from countries that hate us that hate our american free enterprise system that hate the liberty we have here in this country more than a 200 000barrelperday decrease in gulf coast energy production this is according to the energy information administrations march 2011 shortterm energy outlook production from the gulf of mexico is expected to fall by 240 000 barrels per day in 2011 and a further 200 000 barrels per day in 2012 a reduction and 27 billion barrels of oil are under lock and key in alaska according to a recent fox news report the epas refusal to grant permits for energy production in alaskas outer continental shelf has limited access to an estimated 27 billion barrels of oil with alaskan oil production already decreasing by 7 percent annually continued delays could force the transalaska pipeline to shut down whats that going to do to our cost of gasoline heating oil natural gas and all of our other energy sources whats that going to do to the cost of food its all going to skyrocket more than 40 american energy projects have been stalled by this administration as the house natural resources committee notes 10 months after the obama administrations official moratorium on american energy ended over 40 projects remain stalled and people are left without work this administrations energy policy is killing jobs in the gulf coast as well as all over this country were sending american jobs overseas twelve rigs have already left the gulf before we change let me go to this quote here from michael bromwich the chief regulator of unitedstates offshore drilling even if we permitted the hell out of everything tomorrow every pending permit some permits that havent even been filed yet it would not have a material effect on gas prices bromwich said thats the simple clear reality the simple clear truth the simple truth is michael bromwich is absolutely wrong and in fact as soon as the first drill bit starts hitting dirt or ocean floor you will see oil prices plummet in this country in my opinion why because opec will get a message that were going to produce our own energy resources here in america i submit any country that is not energy independent if it cannot produce its own energy resources if it cannot produce its own food and its own clothing is not a secure nation and the american people need to know that we are not a secure nation today and its because of policies of this administration that are making us less secure we need to go in the opposite direction of the direction were going today that this administrations taking us according to james w noe executive director of the shallow water energy security coalition at least 12 offshore rigs have already departed the gulf of mexico resulting in a significant and precipitous reduction in domestic employment and energy production in january the moratorium forced seven oil rigs to abandon the gulf and head overseas costing american jobs and forcing the unitedstates to import more foreign oil these rigs have left you see where theyve gone nigeria egypt the congo brazil french guyana they wont be coming back thousands of american jobs left with them in fact as many as 12 000 american jobs have been lost and more than 36 000 jobs are at risk i hear my democrat colleagues talking about its jobs jobs jobs in fact we heard that just today in the science committee one of my democratic colleagues talked about jobs are the number one issue well shes absolutely right but its her partys policies that are running jobs overseas its this administrations policies that are making these rigs leave the gulf of mexico and go to nigeria and egypt and congo and brazil french guyana according to the study at louisiana state university monetary economist dr joseph mason the obama administrations de facto ban and it is a ban he says hes lifted the moratorium but theyre not putting out the permits its a de facto ban on american energy production could cost as many as 24 532 jobs in the gulf coast and 36 137 jobs nationwide by the administrations own admission the first 6 months of the official moratorium alone has resulted in as many as 12 000 american jobs have been lost theyre gone theyve left the gulf coast theyve gone to other areas theyve gone to produce energy if you look at this chart in the middle east in africa south america and brazil in fact the president just sent billions of dollars to brazil for them to produce their energy and create brazilian jobs at the cost of american energy and american jobs it makes no sense absolutely no sense recently in a trip to brazil in march president obama pledged to help with technology and support to develop the brazilian oil reserves so that america could become one of brazils quoting barack obama himself brazils best customers he wants us to become brazils best customer how about those american jobs that he is killing and his administration is killing his energy secretary dr chu a couple of years ago said we have to find some way to make gasoline prices in america the same as they are in europe well talk about that in a bit and remind the american people that the president himself said that energy prices under his policies that hes promoting would necessarily skyrocket he wants americans energy prices to skyrocket putting people out of jobs costing all these thousands of jobs costing our economy millions and millions and trillions of dollars in all probability eventually certainly billions he just gave a loan to brazil 2 billion to produce jobs and produce oil in brazil instead of producing oil in the gulf coast and off alaska and his epa just denied any production off alaska it makes no sense according to stories from the gulf coast residents shared at a recent natural resources committee hearing the presidents policies already are helping make good on his pledge with one offshore boat company employee reporting that his employer is sending 100 vessels overseas to brazil to keep them working brazilians working with those transfers go many american jobs this administrations policies are destroying jobs the democrat party policies under the former speaker ms pelosi the majority leader in the senate harry reid are destroying jobs destroying our economy and they want more of the same they want more stimulus more government less american jobs in the private sector less american energy production the american people need to know very clearly they need to know the simple truth they deserve the truth that the policies created by this administration the policies created under the leadership of nancy pelosi and harry reid are building a bigger government but destroying our energy theyre building a bigger government even higher prices for housing in washington d c to destroy jobs in the private sector all across the country and their energy policies are going to harm the most vulnerable americans poor people people on limited incomes our senior citizens recently president obama and washington democrats trotted out two blameshifting strategies that democrats have tried unsuccessfully to use in the past to deflect blame for their failed antienergy policies just last month democrats recycled their socalled use it or lose it argument that has already been debunked as nothing more than a hoax it is political fodder that they are utilizing and i have heard it in our natural resources committee i have heard it on the floor of the house american people are sick and tired of this kind of political dialogue americans are demanding all over this country not only in the 10th district in georgia my district not only in the state of georgia but americans all over the country deserve for this nation to be energy independent they are crying out for energy independence the carter administration established the energy department to make us energy independent as a nation the department of energy has failed miserably failed miserably in that task and has failed miserably in that task under both democrat as well as republican administrations now president obama is trying to shift blame to oil speculators just as he did back in 2008 and this is in spite of the fact that as washington posts jennifer rubin notes it is the administrations own policies that are contributing to yet another drain on the wallets of average americans the washington post has not been a particularly conservative newspaper that has promoted conservative policies that is what jennifer rubin said the administrations own policies are contributing to yet another drain on the wallets of average americans and she is absolutely correct in that assessment and i commend her for saying so earlier this month the house passed the energy tax prevention act h r 910 to stop the obama administration from imposing a backdoor national energy tax that will further drive up gas prices president obama says he is going to veto that legislation proving that he wont let skyrocketing gas prices get in the way of his administrations jobcrushing antienergy agenda regardless of the cost to american families and small businesses i have got a small business in the timber industry in lincoln county georgia and the owner of that business recently told me he parked all of his trucks because he cannot afford to put fuel in those trucks and that has cost several jobs in lincoln county lincoln county has an unemployment rate that is way way higher than the national average in fact the state of georgias unemployment rate i think just recently was reported to be over 10 percent this administrations antienergy policies are crushing jobs crushing small businesses crushing family budgets and it is antiamerican house republicans are making strong efforts to create jobs and lower fuel prices in this country recently cnn did a poll they found that seven in ten americans support increased offshore drilling for oil and gasseven in ten i wonder about the other three in those ten fortyfive percent strongly favor here is the question they asked how americans feel about increased drilling for oil and natural gas offshore unitedstates borders and here is how they responded 45 percent said that they strongly favor us doing increased drilling for our own oil and gas in the gulf coast offshore 24 percent mildly favor 16 percent strongly oppose and 15 percent mildly oppose now that 15 percent and 16 percent i wonder if they have looked at their checkbook i wonder if they have looked at the cost of bread and milk cabbage and potatoes in their grocery store because the prices of those goods that we all depend upon when we go to the grocery store are markedly affected by the cost of gas and oil in this country increasing american energy production will help create new jobs and it addresses the rising gas prices and americans know it the house is prepared to vote on legislation to boost offshore energy production as i said seven in ten americans support offshore drilling for our oil and natural gas it belongs to us it belongs to the american people and we are being prohibited from tapping into that by this administration and the democratic party policy implementing a comprehensive plan to build a more stable supply of petroleum from our own north american resources along with reforms that end litigation the endless litigation and reveal policies that artificially inflate cost will provide immediate relief to the price of gasoline the market knows that more energy means lower prices when president bush removed the executive moratorium on offshore drilling in 2008 as a good example crude oil futures by the speculators fell more than 9 almost immediately it is not the speculators that are causing the rising cost of oil it is not the speculators who are causing the rising cost to americans when they go to fill their cars and pickup trucks it is failed policies by the obama administration failed policies by nancy pelosi and harry reid and their cronies here in the house and in the senate we can create good jobs we can insulate the economy from energy price shocks by actively producing our own energy resources here in this country and we can do that we must do that while we are good stewards of our environment repealing federal mandates and the prohibitions that artificially drive up the cost of gasoline and stopping the epas backdoor energy tax they are trying to implement what i call taxandtrade by epa edict in a dictatorial manner when they could not pass that bill through congress in the last congress and by halting the presidents drilling permatorium as some of us call it it has been described and unlocking our own energy resources that god has given us here in america both on and offshore all these will help alleviate the pain at the pump the pain at the grocery store the pain for every good and service even the pain in the doctors office and the pain of all the higher energy costs and the pain of all the increased costs of every good and service in this country through the american energy initiative house republicans are actively working to increase american energy production in order to do a number of things to lower the cost of gasoline to create american jobs to generate revenue to help reduce the debt and this deficit thats unsustainable and to strengthen our national security by decreasing our dependence on foreign energy particularly on foreign oil as i mentioned just a few minutes ago i believe very firmly that if a country is not energy independent it is not a secure nation we are not secure today we must make america energy independent and we do that by developing our own energy resourcesall of our energy resources not only oil and gas but coal we need to develop clean coal technology we need to look at alternative energy resources such as wind and solar and waves and all of those things we need to have research and development on nuclear energy and on all of the things that are critical for us to be energy independent as a nation republican bills would create 250 000 jobs short term and 1 2 million jobs long term according to louisiana state universitys joseph mason weve got to create jobs but the energy policies that this administration and our democratic colleagues are promoting are killing jobs not creating them republican policies want to create jobs under the republican bills that we have introduced one of which is h r 1230 the restarting american offshore leasing now act we would expand american energy production and create jobs by requiring the secretary of the interior to conduct oil and natural gas lease sales in the gulf of mexico as well as offshore of virginia that have been delayed and cancelled by the obama administration h r 1229 putting the gulf of mexico back to work act will end the obama administrations de facto drilling moratorium in a safe responsible and transparent manner and it will put thousands of americans back to work increasing american energy production to help address the rise in gasoline prices that americans are facing every single day every single day we see gas prices jump h r 1231 reversing president obamas offshore moratorium act will lift the presidents ban on new offshore drilling by requiring the administration to move forward on american energy production in areas

most in need and have been most devastated by this difficult economy yet we see again this week another attack by the republican majority in the house on working families while they continue to fight to protect subsidies for big oil and to protect tax breaks for the outsourcing of jobs overseas first they come after seniors by trying to end medicare and now they are coming after women children and infants who rely on food assistance we should not be destroying programs upon which citizens rely for their most basic needs in order to fund tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires or big subsidies for the big oil companies if we got rid of tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires for one week we could pay for the entire wic program for an entire year i urge my colleagues to reject this proposal to ensure instead that families most in need who have been hardest hit by this recession have access to food and nourishment we have the ability to provide nourishment to families and

always been a nation of diverse cultures but when faced with disasters we come together in recognition of our shared values from world war ii to 9 11 to hurricane katrina americans came together when needed thats why its so sad to see house republicans draft a budget reconciliation bill that carries dangerous implications for millions of americans and will fundamentally erode our shared values of course this is nothing more than political theater because authorization for budget reconciliation has to pass both the house and senate which it hasnt but that hasnt stopped the house republican majority from trying to deem it to be so therefore the republican majority has directed six house committees to use this reconciliation ruse to find drastic and damaging investment cuts not to reduce the deficit mind you but to prevent any cut in military spending which they originally agreed to and to give the richest 1 percent yet another big tax cut last year congress agreed in a bipartisan fashion after the majority brought us to the brink of default to cut 2 1 trillion from federal deficits establishing automatic cuts designed to be universally painful to encourage us to reach an agreement on a longterm deficit reduction proposal that more equitably spreads the burden a bipartisan majority of the supercommittee including every senate republican did come up with just such a plan to put everything on the tablespending cuts revenue increases entitlement reformbut it needed a supermajority and sadly every republican house member on that committee voted no which leaves us where we are today facing damaging automatic cuts to defense and nondefense spending but republican reconciliation ruses wont stop the automatic cuts to the nations seniors and disadvantaged it doubles down on the pain the republican reconciliation ruse literally takes food out of the mouths of needy children and senior citizens it eliminates social services block grants providing assistance to states and localities across the nation to serve millions of disadvantaged americans it ends the meals on wheels program for 1 7 million seniors it guts the supplemental nutrition assistance program formerly known as food stamps that serves 46 million of our fellow americans every month under their plan 1 8 million people would lose the most basic of assistance in addition 300 000 lowincome children lose their free and reduced lunches at school this reconciliation ruse once again singles out federal employees for ever more sacrifices federal workers already have contributed 60 billion to deficit reduction through a 2year pay freeze theyve contributed another 15 billion through recent changes to their retirement system the ryan budget demands an additional 3year pay freeze the new proposal goes further and cuts paychecks by 5 percent to shift more of the burden to employees this draconian measure would add another 79 8 billion in the sacrifice put on the backs of federal workers more than double the 75 billion theyve already made the reconciliation ruse actually will increase health care costs for millions of american families it eliminates tax credits that help lowerincome families maintain affordable health insurance premiums in fact 350 000 people will actually lose their health insurance with their plan of course the one glaring omission in the republican reconciliation ruse is not surprisingly revenue while millions of lower and middleincome families are being forced to sacrifice what do republicans ask of the wealthiest 1 percent nothing over the last 4 years oil and gas companies made a profit of 290 billion private companies should make profits and its a good thing but in that same time frame they lobbied to keep their 16 billion in tax breaks representing less than 6 percent of their profits but it sure would make sure a lot of hungry kids go to bed with full bellies at night the ryan budget actually seeks to cut the top income tax bracket from 35 percent to 25 percent who pays the current top tax bracket those making more than 388 000 each year not only are they not asked to join in any of the shared sacrifice but theyre actually offered a new christmas present early just for them its time to call the republican budget plan what it is an outright attack on american values how else do you explain shifting the burden from partisan priorities entirely to the middle class and those who are less fortunate thats never been an american value i urge my colleagues to reject this ruse to reject the reconciliation process

democratswho had been on the bowlessimpson commission who said we should do something about this they were in the press they had press conferences and this was going down the road and doing all kinds of great things while that was going on there was a decision made and a law was passed to create a supercommittee to which i appointed senator patty murray of washington to run no one in the senate democrat or republican has more respect than patty murray she worked so hard with the other 11 members of congress to come up with something a few days before they were to arrive at a decisionand the gang of 6 members are out here doing all this stuff all the timei get a letter signed by virtually every republican senator saying we are not going to raise revenue for anything the supercommittee didnt work there the gang of 6 is gone so we passed this last august to fund government for 2 years and to say if we dont arrive at another 1 2 trillion in deficit reduction during this year it automatically kicks in at the end of this year or the beginning of next year so that is where we are and the republicans in the house are trying to change that so that is what this little history lesson has been all about i dont like to sequester i wish we didnt have to do it it was a hard pill to swallow but it was the right thing to do if we are ever going to reduce the staggering deficit we are going to have to make some hard decisions so that is what this is all about but that is the point it is hard to do therefore we have to do it to sequesterwhich in effect would take almost 500 billion from domestic programs and almost 500 billion from defense programs they were designed to be tough enough to force two sides to reach a balanced deal it hasnt happened yet as i said earlier with general eisenhowers statement i didnt make that up that is what he said my complaint about the republicans being so unreasonable about everything is something where i am not a lone wolf crying in the wilderness we have two longtime nonpartisan watchers of congress one from the american enterprise institute which is a conservative think tank another from brookings institute that wrote an article saying it is the republicans cant you see what they are doing here is one thing they said we have been studying washington politics in congress for more than 40 years and never have we seen them this dysfunctional in our past writings we have criticized both parties when we believed it was warranted today however we have no choice but to acknowledge that the core of the problem lies with the republican party they further said the gop has become an insurgent outlier in american politics it is ideologically extreme of scornful compromise unmoved by conventional understanding of facts evidence and science and dismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition what brave men to do that to write these commentswhich are true i have been saying that i dont want to fight about everything republicans insist on balancing the budget on the backs of the middle class seniors students single mothers and those who could least afford it that is what they are doing over there today it is their refusal to compromise that leaves us facing the threat of sequester and it is difficult but it is balanced going back to the august budget agreement now in order to protect wealthy special interests is no solution neither is refighting the battles of last year democrats agree we must reduce our deficits and make hard choices but we believe in a balanced approach that shares the pain as well as the responsibility is the sequester the best way to achieve that balance no but republicans refuse to consider a more reasonable approachone for example that asks every american to pay his fair share while making difficult choices to reduce spending democrats will not agree to a onesided solution that lets the superwealthy off the hook while forcing the middle class and those in greatest need to bear all the hardship democrats believe we can protect americans access to health care create jobs while investing in the future and protect the poor and elderly but we cant do it alone it will take work and compromise and so far republicans have been unwilling to make a serious effort to achieve that result republicans have rejected our balanced approach their onesided solution to acrosstheboard cuts would take away from the many to give to the few here is what the plan would donot all of it but here is what their plan would do remember they are taking it up over there in the house today it would cut medicaid benefits increasing the number of uninsured children parents seniorsand that is in addition to people with disabilitiesby hundreds of thousands just eliminate them it would also put seniors in nursing homes at risk some of them would have to move out of the nursing home i guess it would punish americans who receive tax credits to purchase health insurance when their financial circumstances change causing 350 000 americans to have no coverage this would add to the tens of millions who already exist that way it would weaken wall street reforms protecting big banks at the expense of consumers their legislation would once again target middleclass workers food inspectors air traffic controllers border patrol agents drug enforcement and fbi agents they would have to be laid off it would cut funding for preventive health care programs that fight chronic illnessessuch as heart disease cancer strokes and diabetesthat cause 70 percent of the deaths in america preventive care would be reined in it would slash block grant funding in the united states to help 23 million children seniors and disabled americans live independently and out of poverty no segment of the population is immune from this painful absurd republican planexcept maybe millionaires billionaires and wealthy corporations the republican proposal cuts meals on wheels and reduces food assistance for almost 2 million needy people one of the republican candidates running for president said president obama is the food stamp president there are more poor people our economy has been in bad shape people are struggling the millionaires are doing fine and in addition to what i have already mentioned this thing that they are taking up in the house today cuts off almost 300 000 children from free school lunches at a time when one in five children lives in poverty the unitedstates conference of catholic bishops said the republican plan fails a basic moral test this budget sets very clear priorities the problem is what they are taking up in the house sets up the wrong priorities president franklin roosevelt said human kindness has never weakened the stamina or softened

my staff down there to see the way it is in arizona but here is a map of arizona and the portions of arizona where i was were in the southeastern portion of arizona over here everybody has heard of tombstone but i was a little further south than tombstone all the way to the border and douglas arizona which is in the corner the southwestern corner of arizona and next to new mexico and along that portion of the southern border of the united states visiting primarily with the people that were in charge of border security the border patrol and the ranchers who live along the border let me talk about the ranchers first one of those ranchers mr krentz a year ago was murdered on his ranch apparently by illegals coming into the united states he was gunned down and killed the culprits that committed that crime by the way have not been brought to justice i met with other ranchers in the entire region and just asked them the question tell me what its like to live on the border of the united states and mexico as a ranch owner and they went on forever and forever and told me things that i was just really somewhat surprised about how they feel like the border is wide open that people cross across their ranches people come in they destroy their property they destroy their water lines all of this costs money to the ranchers and of course they have to be the ones that pick up the bill for the destruction on their property and they dont feel safe about the people that cross into the united states across their land they feel like the federal government has really not protected them and their rights and seems to neglect them even though the border patrol who i also met with i believe is doing as good a job as they possibly can do i want to make that clear the border patrol is doing as good a job as they can do as we will let them do as a nation and they are trying to protect the border the best that they possibly can and so i talked to both groups but in reality the people who live there are very concerned about their own safety and the consequences they have to pay for people illegally coming into the united states i heard something that was kind of surprising to me when illegals not all but when some come into the united states and they are captured by border patrol some of them ask the question are they in the 9th court or the 10th court and i said what are they talking about the 9th court or the 10th court well what theyre talking about is the 9th circuit court of appeals or the 10th circuit court of appeals you see the ninth circuit court of appeals that is a federal appellate court has jurisdiction that includes arizona but goes up to the new mexico border and so when illegals cross into the united states near new mexico or arizona some of them ask the question am i in the 9th court which would be in arizona or the 10th circuit court of which the jurisdiction is new mexico and the reason for that in my opinion those two courts have different reputations about enforcing the rule of law on the border and of course those that cross into the united states hope if they are caught the 9th circuit court of appeals would eventually have jurisdiction over their case when in their perception its a much more friendly court to folks who cross in illegally than the 10th circuit so i thought that was somewhat interesting they are also given when they come into the united states if captured their property some of them you will find a whole list of things and places they can go the churches that give them sanctuary places that they can go for medical help and they are given in a very organized way what they can do when they come into the united states that is provided in some cases by the coyotes that make money off those immigrants who come into the united states because immigrants have to pay the coyote money and sometimes the coyotes and the drug cartels all work together because you see drugs and people are going north and money and guns are going south because you see mexico doesnt protect its border any better than the united states does but in any event while i was down there in the corner of arizona i learned firsthand about the seriousness to the ranchers the people who live on the land their concerns about the fact that they believe that the border is not secure in reality they have to worry about their own safety on a daily basis after visiting a corner of the southeastern corner of arizona we moved and traveled across interstate 10 to interstate 8 over here to san luis arizona so that travels goes up to san luis across interstate 10 interstate 10 turns into interstate 8 comes all the way across arizona into california goes into yuma arizona and i went down here into the southwestern corner of the state of new mexico to also see what that border was like now coming across interstate 8 right here interstate 8 we pulled off the side of the road to the sonora national reserve and that is a national reserve that the federal government controls because i wanted to see the sonora national reserve interestingly enough you get about a quarter of a mile almost a halfmile off of interstate 8 right up here by the sonora desert and you come across this sign this sign is facing toward mexico so interstate 8 would be to this direction and mexico would be behind the sign how far behind the sign its 80 miles to the mexican border and here is a big sign that says traveling caution smuggling and illegal immigration may be encountered in this area so it seems to me that the federal governments answer to border security is to warn people that it is a smuggling and illegal immigration area once again this sign is not on the border this sign is 80 miles this side of the border so what is the government saying are they just ceding that entire portion of arizona to the drug cartels saying its a smuggling area and that you need to take care of yourself because we cant protect you i dont know but i was somewhat surprised to see that our federal governments answer to border security was to erect this sign and other signs that are similar to it i dont believe of course thats the answer to border security you wouldnt need these signs if the border were secure in reality not in just political statements that seem to be made by different individuals the texas department of public safety has issued some statistics regarding crossborder crime i have already mentioned about how the 34 5 percent of the people in local county jails on the border are foreign nationals but just since 2010 january 2010 the texas department of public safety has identified 22 murders 24 assaults 15 shootings and 5 kidnappings among other crimes directly related to spillover violence from mexico now sometimes we hear this comment well the violence in mexico isnt coming to the united states the question is is the crime from mexico coming into the united states we have already shown that that is occurring because 34 percent of the people in those local jails are committing crimes and theyre foreign nationals but also the violence is coming into the united states because of the statistics that i just gave you and now we learn of another phenomenon that is taking place you dont hear much about it because the victims of these crimes dont say much about it people who live in border towns the populous border towns in the united states periodically would get somebody who would come to their front door or they would get an email or a text from someone who says we know your cousin who lives in mexico and unless you pay us so much protection money your cousin in mexico is going to disappear something to that effect so we hear reports of that extortion on the american side of the border this is primarily among hispanic americans and what do they do well they may or may not report it what they i think generally do is pay the extortion because they want their relative in mexico on the other side of the border to be safe so we have that extortion racket taking place if the border were secure that certainly would not have occurred so it concerns me that we have that crime on the american side going back to the southern border of arizona i was asking the border patrol which was very gracious and explained a lot of their operations to me how do they bring drugs into the united states and they said every way they can bring them into the united states one of the ways that they are using now is the concept of ultralights an ultralight for lack of a better description is a kite that has a motor on it one person can fly that at very low altitude and they bring in 200 or 300 pounds of drugs into the united states they never land the ultralight into the unitedstates they just fly across from mexico into arizona and they drop their load 200 300 pounds of drugs and then they fly back to mexico then there is someone at a rendezvous point who picks up those drugs i say that because the drug cartels are using every means necessary to exploit the open borders and do everything they can to make sure that they bring in those drugs and they will continue to do so the border patrol is the agency that we have to protect the border of the united states like i said i think they are doing as good a job as we will let them do but primarily the border patrol patrols the border up to 2535 miles inside the united states that is their duty that is their jurisdiction the place that they are supposed to protect the unitedstates past that 35 miles or so they dont patrol that that is somebody elses responsibility now of course the bad guys know that is the duty of the border patrol to patrol that section of the border so when people are smuggled into the united states when drugs are smuggled into the united states the goal is to get past the border patrol demarcation line because once you do that you are pretty much in my opinion home free to get into the united states with people or drugs so that is the area of their primary concern and it is certainly the area of the jurisdiction that they are trying to patrol the best they can i have asked the border patrol tell me how you do this and i think they use as many different means as they can to patrol the border they will have vehicles go up and down the border they will have border patrol agents behind the border they will have some use of the national guard behind the border with the use of electronic equipment to view what takes place on the border so they use the equipment that they can but they obviously dont have enough border patrol agents to be directly on the border so they have some on the border and some behind the border monitoring the activity of the people coming into the united states and then they try to catch those that they can when i was visiting with one of the border patrol agents this is a photograph of one of their vehicles it is a typical border patrol vehicle that patrols near the border of the united states and mexico now you notice that this vehicle has steel mesh on the windshield and on the side windows it has steel mesh even above the lights the red lights on top so i asked the border patrol agent that drives this vehicle explain to me the steel enclosure you have on your vehicle he said here is what happens we will drive close to the border as we drive close to the border there are people on the other side of the border who when they see us start throwing rocks at us they throw them over the fence if we dont have this protectionand they are not little bitty pebbles these are rocksthey throw them over the fence and break the windshield the border patrol agents are injured they do that for various reasons one of those reasons is a diversion they will try to divert the attention of a border patrol agent at one location so that other folks illegally can sneak into the united states now we dont hear much about assaults on border patrol agents unless somebody is murdered which has occurred but in the last couple of years assaults on border patrol agents by people illegally coming into the united states is about 1 000 a year a thousand assaults on border patrol agents a year in the last couple of years and they are by every means necessary including the rock throwers who try to injure border patrol agents so you can see the relentlessness of some people who want to come into the united states they violate the law of course by coming here illegally and they will continue to violate the law and take on our border patrol agents even by assaulting them so they can sneak into the united states so it seems to me maybe we need to refocus on the primary mission of the federal government and its responsibility the federal government does have the responsibility under the constitution to protect the american people and the united states government should do that now the united states protects the borders of other nations we protect the border of afghanistan with pakistan we are protecting the korean border between the two koreas we protect the borders of other nations and we use our military to do it why dont we have the same resolve to protect the american border both borders the southern border and the northern border because in my opinion we dont have the moral will to do so we should make sure that we understand that people and other people should understand you dont come to the united states without permission it is the rule of law you dont come to the united states without permission now we have to solve that immigration issue that is a different issue but you cant solve that issue until you solve the issue of people illegally coming into the united states you know we are getting everybody we are getting the good the bad and the ugly and right now were getting a lot of bad and ugly crossing into the united states so the rule of law must be enforced by the federal government that is their duty now many of us do not believe the federal government has secured the border obviously people in arizona feel that way because they have passed legislation to try to protect their own state using state law enforcement of course the federal governments answer to that was rather than help arizona sue arizona take them to court you know its kind of like this sign their answer to border security is erect a few signs and sue states that try to protect themselves why dont we deal in reality and make sure that the border is secure and make sure that it is an area that is safe on both sides by securing our side we can protect the mexican side as well of course we need to work with the mexican government to do so they are our neighbors to the south while the united states now has decided to go into libya and spend 100 million or 200 million a week i dont know by bombing that country maybe we should come back home and focus on national security in the united states and spend that money on border security and securing the united states at the border because it is not secure in spite of what the secretary of homeland security has said border patrol it seems to me should have the mission to secure the border i will say again they are doing as good a job as we will let them do but they cannot stop people from coming into the united states although they are trying to when they had those vehicles going up and down in front of the border that keeps people from coming across we have fences in some appropriate areas we dont have fences everywhere but we have some fencing also the border patrol knows they cannot stop people from crossing so they try to catch them if you can that is the phrase that i think is our policy catch them if you can in other words they cross into the united states we see them we try to catch them but once we catch them they become our problem and then we have to send them through the entire legal process as we should but they are our problem they become our medical problem they become our prison problem if they go to prison if they have committed a felony then we have to deal with them and we have to try to get them back to the country they belong to in spite of those countries that refuse to take back criminal aliens so it is catch them if you can why dont we rethink that and prevent people from crossing into the united states if our policy was border security not behind the border security but have security on the border then people coming up to the border cant get across why because there are more boots on the ground and i think we should use whatever we have available we certainly should use the border patrol but also maybe we should use the national guard we have a few national guard troops that are down on the border although they are being relieved and their primary purpose is not to be on the border but behind the border looking at cameras watching folks cross now that is great to watch people cross but when they cross and they come into the united states once again they become our problem once they have crossed and we catch them if you can and send them back home if we can so it would seem to me to be a better use of the national guard to put them on the border i have introduced legislation to put 10 000 national guard troops on the 1 957mile border between the united states and mexico and put them on the border to not allow people to cross into the united states it is the federal governments responsibility of national security to protect the people so the federal government should pay for that and get the money out of the department of defense or somewhere reappropriate money to have the national guard paid for but put them under the supervision of the four state governors so that the governors can control their own border and protect them from entering the united states unlawfully no matter who it is i do not believe that we can say our border is secure when the government accountability office by their own statistics say that only 15 percent of the border is airtight that doesnt seem like a winning percentage to me and when they say under the best circumstances 44 percent partially secure what does that mean well it is sort of secure but sort of not but when you have 56 percent of the border is wide open spaces for anybody that wants to come back and forth that is not protecting the dignity and the sovereignty of the united states so it is long past time we quit talking about border security and actually secure the border from people coming into the united states without permission everyone and to say that the crime doesnt occur in the united states well it does not just to mention the border county jails that i mentioned the 27 percent that are in federal penitentiaries that are foreign nationals that are illegally in the united states but all of the drugs that are sold throughout the united states those are all criminal gangs primarily that are working with the drug cartels in mexico and colombia selling those drugs so the crime affects the united states the insecurity of the border is something that all of us pay for we pay for it in every way possible whether its with health care whether its with education we pay for it in the criminal justice system americans pay and legal immigrants pay the united states has the greatest the most liberal immigration policy in the world we let more people into our country legally every year than does any other country on its own so we have to fix that immigration issue but we have to secure the border first because when all is said and done so far more has been said and less has been done i urge my fellow members of the house of representatives that we come back home that we come back to the united states that we think about the security or insecurity of our borders and that we make sure that the federal government under the constitution fulfills its first

unitedstates to diversify our energy sources by exploring this area and this bill is the first step in that process i strongly encourage my colleagues to support the bill"], [0.9692200962454081,

responsibility with the placement of monuments and how arlington national cemetery and our national cemeteries work it is very clear in the prohibition of the reservation of grave sites at arlington national it also makes clear that only one grave site per family is permitted for burial again i am proud of serving on this committee and am proud of the chairman and the subcommittee chairmans work there was a little bit of controversy as we talked through this issue of arlington monuments but i am very pleased the way this worked out i think the compromise working with the senate and making sure that happens is in the right interest of the veterans groups it is in the right interest of those families who have their loved ones interred at arlington i think once we develop that commission it keeps congress in the loop strikes that proper balance of the original bill we are going to have a really great piece of legislation and that is exactly the way it is supposed to work this piece of legislation does honor the memory of those jewish chaplains at arlington by establishing a memorial marker on chaplains hill and rightly so to honor those who died while on active duty and pays tribute to all of our servicemembers serving in operation enduring freedom operation iraqi freedom and operation new dawn i think it is again absolutely appropriate that this piece of legislation is

wrong thing to do because we are a country that has always moved forward i want to mention two ways this bill moves forward which we should not repeal one is that we have finally addressed this horrific geographic disparity where physicians and hospitals get treated differently unfairly around the country we finally are fixing that long long overdue and second this bill really helps us move forward to reduce waste in our medical industry a dartmouth study suggested as much as 30 percent of all the things we do have been wasted in health care because we havent had the right incentives where i come from in washington state were doing things that we need to export around the country to stop waste in medicine at virginia mason they just won the national leapfrog to the top award where theyve saved over 1 million a year just by bringing efficiencies in how you provide supplies at grouphealth theyve reduced the readmission rate by about onethird by bringing efficiencies to the system at the providenceeverett hospital i was so impressed when i met a dr brevig a cardiac physician who brought some efficiencies in how they handle cardiac patients so instead of moving the patient all around they bring the physicians to the patient do you know what theyve knocked almost a full day off the time you have to be in a hospital and theyve reduced the infection rate by almost onehalf improving quality at childrens hospital they are building a hospital which uses 30 percent less square footage than the average hospital these are the types of efficiencies that we need to reduce the

the patriot act today because last year he called up a senate bill that provided for a years extension of these three provisions and managed the time and voted for it and after hearing his comments im wondering why he has changed his mind in 19 days three national security laws will expire unless congress votes to reauthorize them h r 514 temporarily extends these lawsfisa business records roving wiretaps and the lone wolf definitionuntil december 8 of this year as chairman of the house judiciary committee in the last decade i oversaw the enactment of the usa patriot act in response to the 9 11 terrorist attacks title ii of the act addressed enhanced foreign intelligence and law enforcement surveillance authority sixteen sections of that title were originally set to expire on december 31 2005 also set to expire on that date was section 6001 of the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 which is the lone wolf definition in 2005 i again spearheaded the effort to reauthorize the patriot act recognizing the significance of the act to americas counterterrorism operations and the need for thorough oversight the house judiciary committee held 9 subcommittee hearings 3 days of full committee hearings then a robust full committee markup reauthorizing legislation the usa patriot improvement and reauthorization act of 2005 made permanent 14 of the 16 intelligence provisions the act extended the sunset on section 206 fisa roving wiretaps section 215 fisa business records and the lone wolf definition until the end of but the three remaining temporary provisions were not reauthorized before that deadline instead the thendemocratic majority chose twice to extend the provisions first for 2 months and then for a year without ever bringing a reauthorization bill to the floor this congress things will be different we must approve a temporary extension today to keep these critical national security tools in place this extension will afford congress sufficient time to hold hearings and markups then adopt a permanent reauthorization of these provisions this year which i intend to introduce soon the time for multiple temporary extensions is over the terrorist threat has not subsided and will not expire and neither should our national security laws it is equally important that congress make permanent the lone wolf definition this provision closes the gap in the fisa act and if allowed to expire could permit an individual terrorist to slip through the cracks and carry out his plot undetected when fisa was originally enacted in 1978 terrorists were believed to be members of an identified group thats not the case today today more than ever we are confronted with threats from loosely organized terrorist groups or individuals who may subscribe to a movement or certain beliefs but do not belong to or identify themselves with a specific terrorist group without the lone wolf definition our surveillance tools will be powerless to act against this growing threat to americas security section 206 of the patriot act authorizes the use of roving or multipoint wiretaps for national security and intelligence investigations this allows the government to use a single wiretap order to cover any communications device that the target uses or may use without roving wiretap authority investigators would be forced to seek a new court order each time they need to change the location phone or computer that needs to be monitored section 215 of the act allows the fisa court to issue orders granting the government access to business records in foreign intelligence international terrorism and clandestine intelligence cases the 2005 act expanded the safeguards against potential abuse of section 215 authority and included additional congressional oversight procedural protections application requirements and judicial review each of these provisions are integral to defending americas national security and must be kept intact i urge my colleagues to join me in passing h r 514"]]}
