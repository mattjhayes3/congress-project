here on the floor a display of bickering and backbitingmore often than not aimed at the previous administration of ronald reagan the contempt which many in the majority continue to feel for our former president has fueled a very political attack on the right of any future president to execute his national security duties as commander in chief they have pushed hard for a 48hour reporting requirement in order to force the presidentany presidentto tell congress within 48 hours about the special operations that this country may be conducting wisely this bill avoids that debateand thereby avoids the certain veto that it would elicit from virtually any white house i commend all the members of the committee for sparing us the acrimony that such a provision would have brought in fact wth that provision left out the bill really is as the ranking member described it in his testimony before the rules committee a bare bones authorization there are differences between the majority and the minority regarding the proposed reorganization of the defense departments science and technology the majority would rush to make changes rather than study the proposed reorganization a bit more thoroughly it strikes me as the antithesis of the flybeforeyoubuy mentality that so many of us in the house have endorsed for other defenserelated programs additionally many of us remain confused as to why it is better to construct a new portion of our embassy in moscow to sit atop the floors we know are laced through and through with bugging devices putting a cone of silence on top of a huge electronic bug strikes many of us as penny wise and extraordinarily pound foolish beyond those two issues there really is only one essential element missing in my judgment what is missing is a requirement for a secrecy oath to be administered to the members and staff of the intelligence committee such an oath would not serve in any way to draw into question the patriotism of any member nor of any staff member rather it would serve as a sobering reminder of the very solemn duty charged to this particular committee my understanding is that the ranking member mr shuster will be offering such an amendment later during consideration of the bill i will wholeheartedly support it and take this opportunity to encourage my colleagues of the house to do likewise the reason that an oath is necessary is to remind members and staff that quite literally lives are on the line and those lives depend in part upon committee members and staff keeping their lips sealed an oath would serve to underscore that vital fact indeed this issue is all the more important in light of operation desert storm based upon that experience the committee is renewing its call for greater reliance on human intelligence that is in my judgment a wise and good decision however it means that human livesnot mere machineswill hang in the balance will rely on secrets being kept will rely on people not leaking stories to the press as the committees report stated more eloquently than i there will always be secrets worth knowing if what is truly important requires significant personal and political risk then our country must be willing to pay the pricea price which may include compromised operations and the arrest of unitedstates citizens or their agents i agree 100 percent allow me to simply paraphrase there will always be secrets worth protecting if what is truly important requires significant personal and political risk then our countrys elected representatives must be willing to pay the pricea price which includes doing everything possible to avoid compromising operations or the arrest of unitedstates citizens or our agents it is so little to ask of members and starf of this committee that they reaffirm their commitment to protecting the secretsand therefore the livesof those who risk their lives on a daily basis so that we might enjoy the sweet fruits of freedom all they need say is this i do solemnly swear that i will not directly or indirectly disclose to any unauthorized person any classified information received in the course of my duties on the permanent select committee on intelligence except with the formal approval of the committee or the house i submit that such an oath is not too much to ask so i look forward to supporting the shuster amendment and respectfully request that my colleagues do the same recognizing that it is the very least that can be done to show our support and solidarity with those brave men and women who collect sensitive information on behalf of the american people i hope and trust that we will have that opportunity under this open rule i urge all members to support the rule over this past weekend our nations capital witnessed a tremendous demonstration of the military strength that led to our recent victory in the persian gulf the investment that our former president ronald reagan made in our conventional weapons and in the morale and training of our troops was on display for all to clearly see and just as our victory over iraqi aggression was due in large part to president reagans commitment to military preparedness we also must give him credit for much of our recent progress in negotiating new arms reduction treaties with the soviet union not only did he modernize our strategic forces compelling the soviets to go back to the table and negotiate in earnest he also adhered to basic commonsense principles of arms control how many times have we all heard him say trust but verity i raise this point today because i am pleased not just that we have before us an open rule but also the report on the fiscal year 1992 intelligence authorization bill a document that is equally frank and open in its admonition to our arms control negotiators allow me to quote from the report the monitoring of new arms control agreements will present a considerable challenge to unitedstates intelligence the intelligence community cannot afford major new systems or expeditures because of unitedstates oversights or misjudgments during treaty negotiations today we stand on the threshold of a new era in arms control with agreements on reductions in strategic arms conventional forces in europe and chemical munitions stockpiles all close at hand if this new era is to serve our national security interests and the interests of peaceand if it is to set the stage for global arms control agreementsit is absolutely vital that our negotiators ensure that inspection and verification procedures under such agreements are stringent and thorough now more than ever there is little room for error in these important areas during treaty negotiations and i am hopeful that our arms negotiators in the state department and

chairman mr dmoell are to be commended for shepherding this complicated proposal through the house and through conference this long overdue strategy contains some ery important new initiatives the vast majority of our imported oil is used in vehicles and it was critical that any comprehensive strategy include programs to address that problem to that end this bill includes a good alternative fuels program with a series of incentives and mandates for the switch to alternative fuels by unitedstates cars and trucks these alternative fuels include compressed nau gas methanol ethanol hydrogen propane and electricity and the program applies to fleets in metopolitan areas of 250 000 people or more it includes programs to implement mandates for federal fleets beginning in 193 which gradually will increase to require 75 percent of federal fleets to be alternativelyfueled by 1999 it includes a mandatory program for state fleets beginning in 1995 increasing gradually to 75 percent of those fleets by the year 2000 notably current state conversion programssuch as the one underway in my own state of oklahomacould be substituted for the state program required under the bill private fleets would at first be limited to companies which produce transport store or sell alternative fuels beginning in 1996 requirements for private fleets other than those of fuel providers will be determined by the outcome of a rulemaking by the secretary of energy with a goal of new fleet purchase requirements beginning in 1999 the legislation includes important new strategies for improving our nations energy efficiency especially for equipment and housing the bill contains new federal efficiency programs including a requirement that federal agencies will have to incorporate energy conservation improvements which pay for themselves in 10 years moreover the bill includes language facilitating the use of energy performance contracting under which private industry would finance the installation of energy efficiency improvements in federal buildings this is a key program that can save the government almost 1 billion a year in taxpayer dollars and make a big contribution to environmental quality h r 776 makes significant changes in the 1935 public utility holding company act to allow much greater entry into the electricity market by independent power producers to provide a new diversity of supply for wholesale electricity importantly for my own state this change should allow for more use of natural gas since it is the predominant choice of fuel for those power producers the bill also provides for ways for these new wholesale power producers to market their power through access to power lines of existing utility companies in the area of natural gas pipelines unfortunately many new procedural efficiencies included in our original bill were dropped as a result of substantial controversy over certain other provisions in the natural gas title however i am delighted the conferees deleted the housepassed prorationing language which i vigorously fought against and also dropped certain provisions which could have had serious implications for implementation of fercs recent order 636 concerning interstate natural gas pipeline regulation those provisions should have been dropped and they were i am pleased the conference report still contains provisions adopted by the full house which require muchneeded reform in fercs oil pipeline ratemaking methodology and regulatory procedures i have worked many years to achieve this kind of reform and while the provisions are not as strong as i personally would have liked even these lesser reforms are critically needed and i am delighted they were approved i am also pleased the bill contains provisions similar in thrust to a proposal i sponsored with congressman jim cooper of tennessee to initiate an important new program to account for voluntary reductions by industry of gases that contribute to greenhouse warming this program will allow for credit to be given to those farsighted companies that made early reductions at such time as the unitedstates implements a mandatory program the bill also provides important new authority for establishing inventories of greenhouse gases and establishing the data base needed for any future program in the hydro area the conferees did address certain longstanding problems with fercs regulation in this respect notably providing protection for flshways and state and national parks i am disappointed we could not reach agreement on house provisions to protect statedesignated wild and scenic rivers against ferc encroachment in this area but i remain hopeful congress can address that issue sensibly at some point in the future the bill also gives muchneeded structure and accountability to the unitedstates department of energys multibillion dollar clean coal technology program including consideration of environmental benefits and cost effectiveness

producers which is absolutely essential if we are to maintain a viable independent producing industry i have been a strong and vocal supporter of changes in the treatment of amt for independents and hope we are finally successful in attaining that goal obviously the bill includes many many other provisionssome good and some which i personally think are not so good but we have worked long and hard

attempts of congress to preserve the social security trust fund many older americans feel that they have been cheated therefore we can no longer be content to leave the notch issue unresolved the notch fairness investigatory commission will provide the information to finally answer the controversial questions associated with this serious issue and i invite all members to join me in this effort"], [0.00025922060012817383, 0.4997407793998718, 1, "mr cooper mr skagos mr pmoii mr slat~ray mr huohe mr visclwsu and mr moran"], [0.00026670098304748535, 0.4997332990169525, 1, "we are entering a week that i would call the balanced budget follies week whichseems to happen every election year it began in 1986 and then in 1990 and now in 1992 it happens each election year when members are running afraid from the constituencies that they have to face in order to really balance the budget it happens when they are afraid to make the tough choices that in fact get us to a balanced budget and it happens when we have a vacuum of leadership in the country about taking on these issues particularly when the president himself will not confront these issues so we are always in search now of the easy answer the argument goes something like this we are all sinners we cannot possibly make the tough choices but we know that we can seek forgiveness we know that we can see the light if there just is some sign from heaven if there is just some miracle if there is just some constitutional amendment to give us the strength we need to do the right thing there is no law there is no amendment that is going to give the membership of this body the guts and the courage to make the right decisions have we not learned that lesson before the lesson comes down to whether or not members are prepared to make the tough choices do not look for another excuse do not kid the american people about what has to be done here do what is right we ought to be debating the policies to get us to a balanced budget not talking about an amendment not talking about a change in procedures we ought to be debating the policies to do it let me make clear my belief that no law no amendment is ever going to provide tie leadership we need to do what we should be doing now which is to be debating the policies to get us to a balanced budget the dangers of an amendment are clear the dangers of an amendmen are that we are saying to the american people because of a failed policy we have to go amend the constitution are we going to go amend the constitution because of innercity problems that we failed on or are we going to amend the constitution on education that we failed are we going to amend the constitution because of health care problems that we are not facing my god do we always have to seek some excuse for not doing the right thing i guess if anything is necessary i prefer a statutory approach i voted for this before because in the very least it says to the president you submit a balanced budget let us vote on it at the very least it does not offend the most sacred document that we have in this country but make no mistake about it whatever members vote for the bottom line is that we have to be truthful with the american people about the decisions that have to be made and those decisions involve entitlement savings they involve further defense savings further nondefense savings and revenues that is the bottom line members can run everywhere they want to hide whether it is a constitutional amendment or a statute or anyplace else but ultimately we will have to confront those issues be truthful with the american people because ultimately that is the only way we are going to balance the budget"], [0.00033214688301086426, 0.49966785311698914, 0, "if the gentleman will
