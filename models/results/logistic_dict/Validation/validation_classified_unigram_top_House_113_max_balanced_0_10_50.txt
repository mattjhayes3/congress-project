so many fronts especially in organizing the congressional black caucus special order along with congressman hakeem jeffries i really want to thank you for making sure that the theme this evening of this special order the 60th anniversary of brown v the board of education did not go unremarked you are both really doing a fantastic job representing and working hard on behalf of your constituents i also have to say that congresswoman marcia fudge our fearless congressional black caucus chair really serves as an excellent steward of the conscience of the congress let me just say i was just a child congressman horsford in el paso texas when the supreme court issued its landmark decision in brown v the board of education on may 17 1954 schools were segregated when i started school so that was in the notsodistant past i remember it very well my good friend congressman beto orourke so ably represents el paso today i have to tell you that the results and the impact of the supreme courts decision striking down the separate but equal doctrine is visible throughout the city i am proud to say also that in 1955 el paso became the first city in the state of texas to integrate its public schools my mother mildred parish massey was one of the seven african american students to boldly integrate the university of texas at el paso in 1957 el paso elected raymond telles the first mexican american mayor of a major united states city on june 7 1962 the el paso city council under the leadership of alderman bert williams passed the first city ordinance of any major city in the former confederacy outlawing segregation in hotels motels restaurants and theaters these were public places that were previously barred to african americans and in some cases in el paso earlier to mexican americans this history has been recounted by congressman orourke during black history month i thank him for that because i just have to say i lived this my family lived this my friends lived this just as so many millions of people throughout our country lived this shameful time in our history this is just a bit of my personal background we know that despite the landmark decision it would take decades in many cities and states for that first mandate of the supreme court to be carried out but because of brown we have the civil rights act of 1964 the voting rights act of 1965 and the civil rights act of 1986 of course we have come a long way since the 1950s and 1960s but the fact remains that the fight to end inequality in public education continues the end of the legal doctrine argued then by the brilliant great thurgood marshall who was the attorney and later supreme court justice and the naacp legal defense fund did not necessarily mean the end of racial segregation by neighborhood and community resulting in schools that continued to see stark segregation by race and income in fact many schools have reversed the desegregation gains of the 1970s and 1980s while many other schools remain as segregated as they ever were as a new ucla report mentioned last week which i have to cite congressman horsford called brown at 60 great progress a long retreat and an uncertain future black and latino students tend to be in schools with a substantial majority of poor children while white and asian students typically attend middle class schools my home state of california along with new york and illinois is among the top three worst states for isolating black students latino students are the most segregated in california and now with the attacks on affirmative action in states including my own state unfortunately including proposition 209 many years ago in the state of california many minority students are being systematically shut out of public higher education but lets be clear even in schools that are well integrated minority students often are treated differently as the results from the civil rights data collection survey showed which was recently released by the department of education and supported by the cbc despite making up only 18 percent of enrollees african american students represented 42 percent of preschool students suspended once can you believe that fortytwo percent of preschool students suspended once these are 4 and 5yearolds and nearly half of the students suspended more than once african american girls were suspended at rates 12 percent higher than girls of any other race or ethnicity black boys were suspended at higher rates20 percentthan girls or boys of any other race or ethnicity these are kids who are 4 and 5 years old this is simply unacceptable as chair of the cbcs taskforce on poverty and the economy and the democratic whips task force on poverty income inequality and opportunity we as task force members recognize that equal access to a quality public school education is key to lifting children out of poverty and true equality could not be achieved if systematic institutional barriers to opportunity are allowed to persist it was the thurgood marshalls of the world the medgar everses the rosa parkses the fannie lou hamers the martin luther king jr s the malcolm xs and all those unsung heroes and sheroes in our communities at the local level that ensured that this nation would live up to its own promise and the guarantee that was laid out in brown and so on the 60th anniversary of this tremendous supreme court victory i hope that members of this body recognize that while legal segregation is endedyes the laws of the land will not allow itde facto segregation and institutional and structural racism is alive and well our public policy agenda must take that fact into account we must complete the unfinished business of brown v the board of education by supporting legislation public policies and funding priorities that bring true equality and equity in education to all children thank you again congressman horsford for allowing us to talk this evening on this historic and momentous 60year anniversary of brown v the board of education"], [3.6954879760742188e-06, 0.9999963045120239, 1, "mr chair i rise today to ask my colleagues to reject the budget put forth by chairman

the members for a thoughtful and important debate that is what this is all about it is about grippingtaking holdof the heart and soul of america as i said in the rules committee the budget is actually a moral document a moral compass of where we want to take this country i think what needs to be explained to the american public is that in actuality we have been making progress the deficit has gone down from 1 trillion from the past administration from the bush administration to now 680 billion we are making progress from losing 800 000 jobs a month to gaining close to 200 000 yet the document that is on the floor today the ryan budgetthe republican budgetchooses not to have the morality and the affection for the american people that is desired when you look at their budget you will see that 3 3 trillion of their budget69 percentis cut from programs for people with low or moderate incomes from the very people who need a stairstep of opportunity and they give 200 000 in tax cuts to the top 1 percent none of us have any challenge to prosperity and opportunity but how can you have a budget that hits lowincome programs or programs that give opportunity how many have gone to school because of pell grants 175 million in cuts how many people have gotten their health care from medicaid and still do like children how many people have needed to have the snap program i believe that we should have budgets that work for all people i intend to vote for the cbc budget and for the democratic budget and no on this underlying republican budget we need to have a standard that respects all people in this country and this budget does not mr chair i rise in strong opposition to h con res 96 the house republicans budget resolution for fiscal year 2015 i oppose this irresponsible budget resolution because it continues the reckless approach to fiscal policy that the house majority has championed for years with disastrous results mr chair the budgeteers on the majority side have a very poor track record when it comes to economic forecasts and projections for years they have based their entire legislative agenda and strategy on their belief that the affordable care act or obamacare would be a failure the wish was father to the thought but they were wrong because of obamacare more than 10 million americans now know the peace of mind that comes from affordable quality health insurance that is there when you need it 7 million through the exchange and 3 million through medicaid house republicans oppose increasing the minimum wage claiming that it costs jobs wrong again every increase in the minimum wage has been accompanied by an expanding economy especially during the clinton administration house republicans opposing comprehensive immigration reform claim that it will lead to lower incomes and lost jobs wrong again studies conducted by groups as far apart as the chamber of commerce and the aflcio consistently show that comprehensive immigration reform will grow the gross domestic product by 1 5 trillion over 10 years given this sorry track record of economic forecasting i strongly oppose the republican budget because it favors the wealthy over middle class families and those struggling to enter or remain in the middle class i oppose this republican budget because it asks major sacrifices of seniors who can barely make ends meet and fundamentally alters the social contract by turning medicaid and snap programs into a block grant and medicare into a voucher i cannot and will not support a resolution that attempts to balance the budget on the backs of working families seniors children the poor or mortgages the future by failing to make the investments needed to sustain economic growth and opportunity for all americans mr chair we democrats have a better way we understand that we are all in this together and that our current economic situation calls for a balanced approach between increased revenues and responsible reduction in expenditures our plan will protect and strengthen our recovering economy reduce the deficit in a responsible way while continuing to invest in the things that make our country strong like education health care innovation and clean energy mr chair this republican budget is bad for america but it is disastrous for the people from my home state of texas who sent me here to advocate for their interests let me highlight a few examples 1 if the republican budget resolution were to become the basis of federal fiscal policy 3 435 336 texas seniors would be forced out of traditional medicare and into a voucher program under the republican plan to end medicare as we know it texas seniors will receive a voucher instead of guaranteed benefits under traditional medicare 2 for the 3 435 336 texans aged 4554 the value of their vouchers would be capped at growth levels that are lower than the projected increases in health care costs previous analyses showed that this type of plan would cut future spending by 5 900 per senior forcing them to spend more out of pocket and diminishing their access to quality care 3 additionally private insurance plans will aggressively pursue the healthiest least expensive enrollees thereby allowing medicarecurrently the lifeline for 3 187 332 texas seniorsto wither on the vine 4 if the republican budget resolution were to be adopted by congress 206 304 texas seniors would pay more for prescription drugs next year 5 the republican plan would reopen the donut hole forcing seniors to pay the full cost of their prescription drugs if their yearly drug expenses are more than 2 970 for the year 6 seniors reaching the prescription drug donut hole would pay an average of 828 more in prescription drug costs in 2014 and approximately 13 000 more from now through 7 under the republican budget the 2 445 462 texas seniors who utilized free preventive services currently covered by medicare in 2012 will face increased costs in the form of higher deductibles coinsurance and copayments for certain services including even cancer screenings and annual wellness visits 8 the republican budget slashes 31 71 billion in nursing home care and other health care services for 754 500 texas seniors and disabled who currently rely on medicaid for their longterm care needs 9 the draconian cuts included in the republican budget would have a devastating impact on the 1 191 certified nursing homes in texas that serve 91 717 seniors with more than half relying on medicaid as their primary payer as a result nursing homes would be forced to slash services turn away seniors or close their doors mr chair this budget could have invested in programs that help strengthen the middle class reduce poverty and strengthen our economic recovery instead the republican budget makes deep cuts to the area of the budget helping lowincome families put food on the table and make ends meet these are families who are already struggling with unemployment lower wages and just simply trying to make ends meet the house republican budget will push millions more americans into poverty and put a large number of lowincome children seniors and people with disabilities at risk it guts medicare and medicaid and calls for massive cuts to food assistance all in order to protect tax breaks for special interests and for multimillionaires who are not even asking for them the republican budget may be characterized in many wayscruel irresponsible shortsighted recklessbut fair and balanced is not one of them in contrast the alternative budgets proposed by the democratic caucus congressional black caucus and congressional progressive caucus which were made in order by the rules committee are each worthy of support because they fairly balance the need for increased revenues and responsible reductions in expenditures with the imperative of making the necessary investments in human capital required to move our country forward specifically the alternative budgets proposed by the democratic caucus cbc and cpc help create more jobs now replace the sequester make key education investments invest in research and development and clean energy invest in longterm infrastructure preserve medicare as we know it protect health reforms benefits for seniors protect medicaid for seniors in nursing homes preserve supplemental nutrition assistance snap reduce the deficit through a smart targeted and steady approach provides tax relief for working families and ends tax breaks for the wealthy take a balanced approach to reducing the longterm deficits and debt and put the budget on a sustainable path mr chair under the democratic budget the deficit would fall from 7 percent of gdp in 2014 to 2 3 percent of gdp in 2024 the democratic budget alternative will generate at least a million more jobs this year compared to the republicans austerity first plan by making the investments needed to create jobs strengthen the middle class create greater upward mobility and ensure opportunity for our children and future generations the democratic alternative budgets extend emergency unemployment compensation for the longterm unemployed which provides a lifeline to the 2 37 million jobless workers who have already lost their benefits and the 72 000 persons who stand to lose there benefits each week if congress does not act additionally the democratic budget immediately ends the sequester which would otherwise cost the economy 750 000 jobs by the end of the year and replaces it with deficit reduction resulting from a balanced approach combining responsible spending cuts with increased revenues by cutting tax breaks for special interests and wealthy individuals without increasing the tax burden on middleincome americans mr chair the democratic alternative budget maintains our commitment to medicare medicaid and social security expands the eitc for childless workers extends the tax credits from the american taxpayer relief act due to expire at the end of 2017 and provides 7 6 billion annually for early childhood education it is said often mr chair but is no less true that the federal budget is more than a financial document it is an expression of the nations most cherished values as the late and great former senator and vicepresident hubert humphrey said the moral test of government is how that government treats those who are in the dawn of life the children those who are in the twilight of life the elderly and those who are in shadows of life the sick the needy and the handicapped for that reason that in evaluating the merits of a budget resolution it is not enough to subject it only to the test of fiscal responsibility to keep faith with the nations past to be fair to the nations present and to safeguard the nations future the budget must also pass a moral test the republican budget resolution fails both of these standards the democratic alternatives do not for these compelling reasons i stand in strong opposition to h con res 96 and urge my colleagues to join me in voting against this illconceived and unwise measure"], [7.987022399902344e-06, 0.9999920129776001, 1, "i thank the gentlelady for

seniors bad for young people and bad for americas economic future it may be a path to prosperity for the investor class in our society but it is a path to permanent struggle for americas working families the republican budget is a disaster for our senior citizens it brings back the doughnut hole for medicare prescription drugs we eliminated the doughnut hole with the affordable care act but this republican budget brings it back the republican budget ends the medicare guarantee of earned benefits and replaces it with a risky voucher scheme american workers deserve the guarantee of earned benefits this republican budget slashes 732 billion from medicaid twothirds of medicaids funds serve seniors and disabled americans the republican budget is a disaster for our children and young people it guts head start and cuts school lunches and pell grants this budget repeals the affordable care act provision that allows young people to stay on their parents health plans until their 26th birthday it allows discrimination against people with preexisting conditions like diabetes heart disease and asthma this republican budget rigs the system so that only the children of the welloff and wellconnected can get ahead while the children of the less welloff are consigned to a life of permanent struggle this budget rejects the one measure that could immediately unleash more economic activity and grow our economy comprehensive immigration reform in contrast the cbc budget continues our long history of fiscal soundness and moral responsibility we make tough choices to secure our

really helping to put together not only this special order tonight on behalf of the congressional black caucus but for your leadership on so many fronts thank you let me first say i serve as a member of the budget committee and i have seen closehand the republican vision for our countrys future and believe you me it is not a vision of shared prosperity or economic growth having a sound and balanced alternative like the congressional black caucus budget exposes the republican budget for the disaster that it really is the republican budget shortchanges 99 percent of the american people so it can give even more tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires and to protect tax loopholes for special interests and big oil at a time when we need job creation the most the republican budget would kill more than 2 million american jobs in 2014 alone thats unconscionable cutting infrastructure development would also kill jobs that are important to our communities communities of color jobs in the construction sector and in the public transit sector these sectors employ many people that other sectors do not employ the republican budget would take away food from hungry children and families kick thousands of children off of head start and close the door to college for thousands of graduates next year twothirds of all of the republican budget cuts target programs for people who are poor or low income and communities of color would be the hardest hit communities of color still bear the brunt of the last economic recession unemployment remains high as of january 9 7 percent of latinos and 13 8 percent of african americans were unemployed compared to the national average of 9 percent and income inequality continues to grow federal unemployment benefits already under sequestration would face greater cuts under this ryan budget as he proposes an additional 900 billion in cuts to nondiscretionary spending the republican budgets vision for america is very clear their budget would shred the social safety net it would shatter our economic recovery and would push millions of struggling families over the edge in stark contrast the congressional black caucus budget shows that we can choose a different way forward it is a document that shows our nations priorities and values for after all a budget is a moral document the cbc budget protects and enhances social security medicare medicaid tanf snap all of our vital safety net programs that save millions of people from poverty we believe strongly that any savings derived from changes to social security medicare and medicaid should be used to extend their solvency not to pay for tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires and we do not support a cut in benefits for four decades many of these programs have received support as the first line of defense against hunger and alleviating poverty helping to ensure vulnerable families in our nation that they have a stable life while protecting important antipoverty programs the cbc budget would also make sound invests in critical areas like infrastructure education innovation and poverty reduction to strengthen the economy for all im very proud of the fact that the cbc budget includes supporting language for developing a national strategy to eliminate poverty with the goal of cutting poverty in half in 10 years fifty million people in the wealthiest and most powerful country in the world are living in poverty 16 million are children weve also included in our budget a formula that leader clyburn continues to champion thats our 102030 formula which targets resources 10 percent of federal funds into certain accounts where there has been a poverty rate of 20 percent for the last 30 years that is extremely important as we begin to cut poverty in half in 10 years the republican budget of course is a pathway to poverty with cuts to social safety net programs jobs as well as programs that serve as a bridge over troubled water for millions of lowincome and vulnerable families the fact of the matter is when the economy grows through sound policies and investments that lift up struggling families everyone benefits also let me just mention the section with regard to national defense congressman horsford thank you very much for reminding us about these two wars quite frankly that have been off budget and that are responsible for the deficits and for the lack of jobs and the unemployment rates that we see throughout our country our congressional black caucus budget brings our defense spending in line with our legitimate security needs and we also have a budget that measures our growth in terms of our economic footing as it relates to investing in our national economic security here at home whatever savings can be achieved we put into mental health veterans health and also support and research treatment for traumatic brain injury also let me just remind you that the pentagon is the only federal agency thats not subject to an audit the pentagon has lost tens of billions of dollars to waste fraud and abuse there have been reports of suitcases full of dollars unitedstates taxpayer dollars being stolen or lost as it relates to iraq and afghanistan weve got to be able to audit the pentagon and so our budget uses the 300 billion of the savings from cuts also to the ballistic missile defense program for implementing the remaining gao recommendations i think we have now 1 682 of them which would save about 89 billion and so our budgeting insists that we begin to audit the pentagon that is a very important function that the congressional black caucus understands very clearly finally let me just say we restore harmful cuts to the military tuition assistance program i cant believe that the republicans would cancel military tuition assistance for veterans who have fought so hard in these wars dont they deserve better the congressional black caucus believes they deserve better and so we restore those harmful cuts the congressional black caucus knows we can do better we know that a shared prosperity is the most important key to sound growth and sound fiscal policy first let me just urge everyone to reject the ruinous republican budget and to support the cbc alternative budget i have to thank congressman bobby scott and the budget task force and all the staff for their tremendous work and their support in putting forth and writing a budget really that speaks to the aspirations and to reigniting the american dream for all americans i thank you again representative horsford for

america for most of us who went to law school we were taught that for an adversarial system of justice of law to work there has to be active participation on both sides of an issue of a person charged with a crime on defense or litigation over a law itself so chairman goodlatte from just across the river in virginia called a hearing in the judiciary committee this week we had another hearing about the constitutionality or lack thereof of actions by this administration and it is very alarming professor jonathan turley with whom i have disagreed on many policy issues has a wonderful grasp of the constitution and he recognizes the dangers when an administration decides to pick and choose which laws will be enforced and goes further and issues executive orders not like prior administrations that simply explain on most occasions or illuminate some law as to how they think it is to be interpreted but to actually make law and executive orders that is just unconscionable for somebody that took an oath to defend the constitution i cant recall times that i have agreed with the la times before but they had an editorial that indicates even the la times understands the danger of what is going on right now in this country with this administration we have an attorney general who has been requested to produce documents lawfully informally refused to do so been subpoenaed to produce information documents has refused to do so unlawfully to the point that the committee had a hearing and ultimately found the attorney general of the united states in contempt of congress which came to this floor and in a very unusual action found the attorney general the highest law enforcement officer in this country in contempt of congress basically in contempt of the constitution this has far wider implications than most in america seem to grasp because when the highest law enforcement officer in america refuses to comply with the law holds himself out as being above any law creates laws that he wants to defendat least the administration creating laws that they want to defend or followand actually saying in this roomi just had the president of the united states say in this room i am going to go around the congressif you dont do what i want i am going to go around the congress the ramifications for that are so staggering to anyone who has contemplated the founding of this country that it is beyond words the founders set up these checks and balances believing that surely there would be people in the judiciaryalthough they saw that as the least powerful branch though it has now become the most powerfulthey saw congress as always being willing to defend its own laws even to the point of defunding anything in the administration that did not protect and defend the law they saw a president as standing up and refusing to follow things that were not the law they felt like each branch would judiciously protect their own powers under the constitution and that balance would allow this nation to go forward as the freest nation in the history of the world but today we are living in a time where all of that is in jeopardy when one branch can act to the total disregard of another branch or other branches we have seen that with executive orders that just completely change the law as written and completely intentionally disregards the law of the land it is staggering the la times had an editorial on february 27 that talked about the attorney generals posture on just picking and choosing which laws he would provide a defense for i stand here as someoneas a prosecutor as a lawyer as a judge as a chief justicewho at times absolutely did not like lawsparticular lawsbut knew if this nation were to remain for years to come we had to either change the law legally or as lawyers as officers of the court as judges as chief justices we had to follow the law back in the 80s i was ordered by a state district judge to file an appealto represent a man on appeal after having been convicted of capital murder i was then as now a very conservative person i went to the judge after i got the call that i was going to be appointed and begged the judge not to appoint me that i was doing civil trial work i wasnt doing criminal work please dont appoint me to appeal a criminal conviction because i will have to go back to school to do a proper job of representing a man on appeal of the death penalty i knew if he appointed mebecause i took an oath to support and defend the constitution of the united states i would spend incredible hours to make sure i properly represented the man on appeal even though i didnt know any more about the facts of the case than i had read in the papers from the papers i got the impression that he had probably gotten what he deserved but the judge appointed me to appeal a capital murder conviction in which the defendant was sentenced to death i didnt want the case didnt ask for it begged not to have it but i knew that if our system was to work i had to do everything ethically and legally i could to present my clients side of the case as i got into it and i read the entire long long transcriptevery word of iti realized the man had not gotten a fair trial and unknown to the district attorney an assistant district attorney had acted inappropriately and it caused great harm and jeopardy to the case for the defense i did the very best i could for my client legally and ethically and the case was reversed at the highest criminal court in texas even when as attornies we would disagree with the lawand as we have heard from this attorney general and people in this justice department over and overeven when someone is absolutely convicted clearly is a criminal they deserve a proper defense so how this administration and this attorney general and this justice department can justify picking and choosing which laws they will defend and which laws they will let fall without a defense is unimaginable for people who have learned anything about our constitution we have to zealously represent the clients the laws that are put before us to represent this administration has now repeatedly chosen not to defend some laws when the highest law enforcement in the land we know actually was willing to help convicted absolutelyknown criminals to get pardoned to get lighter sentences we bring people in who have foughtor at least one individual who fought to get a convicted murderer of a police officerwho the evidence indicated stood over him after he shot him and shot him repeatedlya police officerand yet the attorney general can justify bringing someone in the president justified bringing someone in by saying oh no but everybody is entitled to a defense that is how our system works then when he has a constitutional obligation to produce documents to congress and just says i am going to ignore that requirement of the law i dont care and not only am i going to ignore that requirement of the law even after the extraordinary event of having the united states house of representatives declare the highest ranking law enforcement officer in the country to be in contempt of congresswhich is really in contempt of the constitutionstill has the nerve to come in here during the state of the union which is really thumbing the nose at the constitutionat congressthat i will ignore the law i wont follow the laws i dont like i wont defend the laws i dont like and then this week actually go out and tell state law enforcement officershighest ranking state law enforcement officers that in essence if they dont like a law then just dont defend it so this editorial just in part from the la times points out that the six state attorneys general who have declined to defend their states bans on samesex marriage in court got some encouragement this week from unitedstates attorney general eric h holder jr in a speech to the national association of attorneys general holder said that it was sometimes appropriate for attorneys general to abandon their usual obligation to defend the constitutionality of state laws this page supports samesex marriage unreservedly but even so we worry that holders comments will embolden additional state attorneys general republicans and democrats liberals and conservatives to pick and choose which of their states laws they will defend in court it also says further down yet when attorneys general are elected as in 43 states the temptation will be to transmute a popular political stand into a constitutional objection even if holder is right that attorneys general should refuse to defend state laws in exceedingly rare circumstances those laws ought to be defended by someone further down they point out that they probably would react differently however if a future attorney general refused to defend the constitutionality of statutes that treat attacks on gays and lesbians as hate crimes i would imagine this attorney general would find that unconscionable but once we began to ignore the law and become a nation of menand that is generic including men and women whoever is in authorityinstead of a nation of laws then we become like the nations that so many people try to flee to come to america because there is graft there is corruption because the rule of law is not followed it is whatever the dictator the drug group whatever the people in power think should be the law will be the law and it becomes an unbearable place to live there is a reason that fences end up being built around a country not to keep people in as in the soviet union days but because people want to come flooding in which would overwhelm our country overwhelm our ability to provide government services and end the ability to be a nation where people want to come there is a reason it is because we have been a nation of laws that has applied the law fairly across the board clearly because the government is composed of human beings there will be mistakes and there will be abuses but in abuses even presidents have been held to account that keeps us being a nation of laws yet when the highestranking law enforcement officer in the country refuses to provide information to congress that he lawfully is required to produce this country is in grave jeopardy i am pleased that even the la times has gotten a glimpse of the potential problems here in a couple of different hearings i have asked the highestranking law enforcement officer in our country for the production of documents provided to the defendants to the defendants who were convicted of supporting terrorism making them terrorists i have asked for the copies of the documents that were provided in discovery to convicted terrorists i have been told there could be classification problems and as i have pointed out if you gave them to the terrorists you can give them to members of congress after yet another request last june in writingmonths and months lateri finally get a response that in essence says here is a web site where you can go look at some of these documents we have got 500 documents that were introduced at trial and so that should take care of it no it doesnt the justice department gave terrorists thousands and thousands of pages of documents and even in the unitedstates circuit court of appeals opinion the fifth circuit they point out that there were 9 600 or so transcripts of recorded conversations those were given to the people convicted of terrorism and yet this justice department refuses to allow members of congress to see those the founders had the idea that there would be oversight and that congress would supervise what happened in the executive branch that provided that balance of power to keep us from moving in the direction of a monarchy or of a totalitarian government yet when this body finally gets around to some oversight it is dismissed what do we do we vote to hold the attorney general in contempt and then allow him to remain in contempt without consequences perhaps the proper remedy under the thinking of the founders is if an attorney general refuses to enforce the laws that congress passes and other presidents sign into law then you defund the particular individuals in the department of justice until such time as they start doing their jobs you dont defund the people who are out enforcing the law protecting the country but you defund those people who are thumbing their noses at the constitution and at proper legal constitutional oversight we havent done that so the american public the laws and the constitution remain at risk because people who have defended terrorists and who have worked to get even terrorists lighter sentences and pardons and things like that dont think laws duly passed by congress signed into law by the president and upheld by the supreme court are worth defending then dont stop there not only actually start telling the highest law enforcement officers in the country that they should start ignoring laws in rare cases but to ignore the laws when you dont think they are appropriate we also know we have a justice department that in their efforts to avoid making radical islamist terrorists think that we might not like them started outreach programs under the prior administration i asked the prior fbi director since you say that this muslim community is like every other community in the nation how are the other outreach programs going with the baptists the catholics the jews the buddhists there is no other outreach program to any other religious group so that would seem to indicate there is something special here there are violent people in every religion but as thomas jefferson was so shocked to find out there is one religion that has a small component of it that believes that a sure way to paradise is to kill innocent men women and children because they dont believe religiously like those radicals do that is the reason thomas jefferson got his own copy of the koran that the library of congress still has he wanted to see for himself he was so well read he couldnt believe there was a religion that had a holy book for a basis that would allow anyone to interpret it in such a way as to kill innocent men women and children there have been to be sure purported christians over the ages who thought it was their duty to go about brutalizing people who were not christians but anyone who studies the teachings of christ about how we are to individually act knows those would not have been christians doing the kind of violence that they did it is not supported by the bible what is supported in the bible is that if you do evil be afraid because god does not give the government the sword in vain individually we are not supposed to judge and be vigilantes but there is in an orderly society a need to have a government that will punish evil and encourage good conduct this little experiment in a democracy in a republic and representative form of government is so fragile it bothers me when i read and hear those words from ronald reagan that freedom is never more than one generation from being gone and even more troubling that a generation that loses liberty does not get it back in that same generation i have hoped that i would find a time and place where reagan was wrong about that but i have not yet so when we see liberties being lost privacy rights being violated right and left by our federal government all kinds of snooping on american citizens without probable cause not only by the nsaand certainly they have the highest cause for which they are working which is for our protection but yet when our privacy is completely eroded is our safety worth losing all of our privacy completely we lost a dramatic amount of our privacy when without a single vote from the republican side of the aisle the democrats in the house and senate passed what they called the affordable care act which has become so unaffordable because the federal government will get everyones medical records i was a bit staggered and maybe too naive after i had heard people speak so emotionally from the heart about the protection of privacy and what happens in the bedroom i was a little staggered over these years to see people on the democratic side of the aislemy friends over herewho were so thrilled to be giving every bit of private information about their most private body parts about their most private activities to the government in whole and bulk and even said that is not violation enough lets do a contract with general electric and let them keep these records for us it is not like the government and private industry cant be hacked talk about loss of privacy i dont really have anything to hide in any of my medical records but it is nobody elses business yet wholeheartedly people rushed and applauded the giving of all of that most private information to the federal government this week i have been so proud of my friend jeb hensarling as chairman of financial services who has been trying to rein in this consumer financial protection bureauwow what a misnomerthat is gathering information about our credit cards our debit card activity our loans when these were supposed to be private between us and our lenders as long as there was proper oversight to make sure they were not violating the constitution yet the federal government as they are starts getting all of our debit card and credit card information they now have all of our medical records that they are getting they are now watching and have the ability to check every email to check web sites you visit they have the ability to examine every log of every call that you make people who once said i was crazy for giving this example some years back may begin to realize i wasnt so crazy the example was this when the federal government has the obligation to supervise every aspect of your health carewhen you force governmentrun health care on the people of this nationand when you have that same federal government that can monitor every credit and debit card purchase you make and when they know where you go online and when they can go into your emails is it so hard to believe that at some point some american citizen would not get a letter from the federal government saying we noticed that you purchased bacon and butter at the grocery store this last weekend and we also noticed that your cholesterol level is over 200 what were you thinking we cant let you do something like that so we are going to have to punish you we are going to have to start charging you more money we are going to have to start supervising your activity you are going to have to start going and working out we saw that you let your membership at the gym lapse and you are not going anymore we can tell by where your car goes by following the gps on your car that you are not going to the gym like you used to you need to start going back to the gym you need to quit buying butter and bacon and then we wont punish you financially like we are now is that so hard to believe that that would start happening could start happening when you give the government this much private information then liberty is sure to go shortly thereafter in quoting benjamin franklin it has been written different ways over the yearssome say he didnt say itbut basically he certainly advocated that those who are willing to give up liberty for their safety deserve neither how much of our privacy and our liberty are the american people willing to give up just so that we can feel a little safer because when you do that you will not be safe from your own government your own government then becomes the biggest threat to your liberty to your freedom things that brilliant colleagues on the democratic side of the aisle have said over the years about our liberty and about our privacy are really becoming an issue now and i am not hearing my friends across the aisle that raised those important points now talking about them and i know when you have someone in the white house that is from your own party it is kind of tough to stand up and say this is a mistake this is wrong but it is time that friends across the aislesenators who are democratsstart standing up in numbers and saying enough you have usurped too much power that the constitution gave to congress just because you dont like the fact that we take a long time and it is not pretty to see laws being made doesnt mean you get to skip the whole process the founders wanted gridlock they wanted it tough to pass laws they didnt want us meeting year round like we do i am sure if the founders were around today they would be appalled that we meet as much as we do and when some people back in east texas say gee why arent you in washington im saying youre safer when were here because it means were not passing another law that takes your liberty away the founders wanted some gridlock they didnt want it too easy to pass laws because they knew when that happened every little emotional issue that came up would cause congress to come in and pass something even though the moment was fleeting and we should not be doing things quickly and emotionally thomas jefferson was not part of the constitutional convention in philadelphia in 1787 he was amazed at how good the document was but he is reported to have indicated that if he could change one thing he would make it a requirement that before we could pass a law it had to be on file for a year to make sure people have plenty of time to discuss it we see how good an idea that would be if we didnt just run in here and do things out of emotion and we would never ever pass another bill so we could find out what was in it my party has not done anything as blatant as ramming through bills my copy of obamacare was right around 2 500 pages but we have had some bills that we have not been given time to read and to properly go through we were going to take up a flood insurance bill yesterday and i am grateful that it got moved off because we havent had enough time to know what the bill has actually got in it word for word summaries are not enough on many occasions sometimes if it is not a big deal a summary may do it but somebody besides some staffer needs to be looking at every word that is one of the benefits of going through what we call regular order the subcommittee gets to have a markup where they discuss every part of the bill and anyone can offer an amendment to any part of the bill and then it goes to the full committee and anyone at the markup can offer an amendment to any part of the bill and it gets debate and discussion that is a good process i believe that when we took the majority we would do even better than we have we have done a lot better than the 4 years from january of 2007 to when we got the gavel back in january of 2011 i was appalled at the completely closed rules and how it was just staggering we had no input nearly half of the country basically had no representation at all on all of the important bills because they just rammed them through without any input from republicanswho represented democrats and republicans they didnt get represented in those districts it is important no matter who is in charge that if it is really a critical issue that needs immediate laws passed changes made that we fully vet every law that we pass we had an overcriminalization hearing today one of the huge mistakesand it has been a very bipartisan mistakeis that over all these years when members of congress on both sides of the aisle want to show how strongly we feel about something and how tough we are we slap a prison sentence on things and one of the greatest injustices that congress has done is to pass laws that say any violations of the regulations under this law will carry a term of imprisonment in our hearing today there was an estimate that there are probably 300 000 regulations the violation of which carries a prison sentence congress has never seen them never debated them and knows nothing about them we have heard testimony from people who have been sent to prison who did some act and had no idea there was a law against what they did they did time in prison as a result there was a man from houston who was doing business during retirement by raising orchids he ordered some orchids from south america they were sent to him but the proper forms were not filled out by the people that sent them to him and under the law any violation of those postal regulations requires time in prison so what happened he was arrested in his home in houston and since the law gives choice of venue and it had been mailed through miami they took him to miami where he didnt even know anybody didnt have the money for bail and ends up doing 18 months in prison during which time he had a stroke he couldnt testify his wife had to there was a poor guy from washington state that was trying to create a better battery he had every chemical properly stored one day driving home the epa swat team had black suburbans come up behind him the side in front and forced him off the road yanked him out of his car threw him to the ground handcuffed him threw him in jail and then drug him to alaska his heinous crime was that when he mailed a chemical to alaska legally properly he didnt know that it was not enough to check the box that it had to go by ground it couldnt go by air he didnt know that you needed a little sticker that had a picture of an airplane with a red line through it that sticker with the plane with the red line through it had to be on there and since he didnt do that that caused him to deserve to be run off the road by the epa swat team thrown to the ground handcuffed hauled up to alaska and put in prison when he got acquitted of that the justice department wasnt happy with it so they looked around and realized when they ransacked his home he had every chemical properly stored but there was a law that says if you ever abandon these certain chemicals for over a certain number of days then you committed a federal felony and even though it was the federal government that forced him to abandon those and even though they were properly stored he was in jail in alaska and away from the chemicals beyond the time that the law allowed so he went to prison for abandoning chemicals because the government drug him away from them these are the kind of laws that are out there we ought to pass a law in this body that says no criminal penalty may attach to a violation of any regulation unless this congress has passed a specific law putting a criminal penalty on that specific regulation we should not be able to leave it to bureaucrats to decide what becomes an offense punishable by imprisonment so when you take the violations of privacy that have now been passed into lawall of our medical records now our credit card and debit card records our emails all of our phone logs all being usurped and grabbed by the federal governmentand couple that with abuses that we have seen over the years by the federal government of peoples rights under color of law and understanding that when this federal government violates your rights your privacy your freedoms you have nowhere else to go and there is no appeal to anyone else it is time this body and the senate took action to make sure the justice department follows the law and doesnt just pick and choose and also that we make sure the white house doesnt just make up law out of whole cloth and decide which laws they liked and which ones they didnt there are oaths involved here and there should be consequences for not following them then we need to investigate further these executive departments who think they are above the law and when members of congress duly request documents that were provided to people convicted as terrorists and we are told that terrorists can have them but you members of congress cannot then it is time to defund people that will not abide by the law and will not participate in proper oversight it is also time we had a select committee that properly investigated benghazi it is time we had a special prosecutor not some big donor to the president to investigate this horrendous scandal in the irs that not only has smidgeons of evidence it has overwhelming evidence of peoples rights being violated it is time that we started making sure as a congress that people who enforce the law actually enforce the law we have seen the desire by this administration to embrace islam as closely as possible and i know the attitude is that if we bring people close from islam into the administration that will help us get across that we mean no ill will the trouble has been we have brought foxes into the henhouse to give advice to the chickens we have a report from the last couple of weeks the clarion project had been making freedom of information act requests they finally got some documentation that showsand this article is from the clarion project the clarion project investigation has discovered a jihadist enclave in texas where a deadly shooting took place in 2002 declassified fbi documents obtained by clarion confirmed the find and show the unitedstates governments concern about its links to terrorism the investigation was completed with the help of act for america houston the enclave belongs to the network of muslims of the americas a radical group linked to a pakistani militant group called jamaat ulfuqra its members are devoted followers of sheikh ali mubarak gilani an extremist cleric in pakistan the organization says it has a network of 22 villages around the unitedstates with islamberg as its main headquarters in new york the clarion project obtained secret moa muslim of america footage showing female members receiving paramilitary training at islamberg it was featured on the kelly file of fox news channel in october a second moa tape released by clarion shows its spokesman declaring the unitedstates to be a muslimmajority country a 2007 fbi record states that moa muslim of america members have been involved in at least 10 murders one disappearance three firebombings one attempted firebombing two explosive bombings and one attempted bombing it states the documented propensity for violence by this organization supports the belief the leadership of the moa extols membership to pursue a policy of jihad or holy war against individuals or groups it considers enemies of islam which includes the unitedstates government members of the moa are encouraged to travel to pakistan to receive religious and military terrorist training from sheikh gilani the document also says that the moa is now an autonomous organization which possesses an infrastructure capable of planning and mounting terrorist campaigns overseas other fbi reports describe the moa in similar ways with a 2003 file stating investigation of the muslims of the americas is based on specific and articulate facts given justification to believe they are engaged in international terrorism moa members believe the holiest islamic site in the country is located at the islamville commune in south carolina other moa entities include the international quranic open university united muslim christian forum islamic post muslim veterans of america and american muslim medical relief team on further down it says the moa referred to its texas commune as mahmoudberg in online instructions for a parade in new york in 2010 a posting on an islamic message board in 2005 advertised a speaking engagement in houston by someone from mahmoudberg according to the reports the commune is 7 to 10 acres large is in an extremely wooded area and two or three trailer homes moved there in december of 2001 however act members visited the area as part of clarions project or investigation and interviewed one nearby local who confidently said it is closer to 25 acres in size and spoke of a presence dating back to the late 1980s further down the fbi reported in 2007 that one commune resident used to be a leader at the moa commune in badger california that site was called baladullah in march 2001 one of the baladullah members was arrested for transporting guns between new york and south carolina another was charged with murdering a police deputy that caught him breaking and entering a home interviewed residents all agreed that moa members are private yet when the act members were spotted in the area they were immediately and repeatedly approached at one point a commune resident gave them a final warning to leave despite the fact they werent even trespassing or harassing moa members it was definitely very threatening and menacing an act member told me multiple sources confirmed that one resident of the commune is a police officer according to a nearby neighbor one of the moa members used to drive trucks for the unitedstates army in kuwait further down it says police were denied this was after a shooting in 2002 out at the site police were denied access to the trailer homes and were not allowed to directly interview the women who covered their faces in their presence communication with the women had to be done by passing notes through a male intermediary anyway this was the subject of an email from one of my college friends and one of my other college friends sent an email in response saying this could not possibly be true because the mainstream media would have been all over this if this were really true well the report of these 22 villages is true and the mainstream media has not does not probably will not cover it because the administration doesnt want to make anyone uncomfortable who might be radical islamists another article from fox news insider february 20 talked about a 2007 fbi record stated that moa members have been involved in at least 10 murders talked about these things other fbi reports describe moa in similar ways with the 2003 file stating based on the facts this appears to be factual information it was obtained from fbi records it seems to be consistent with the prior administration though they brought muslims in to give advice on dealing with radical islam they pursued terrorists like in the holy land foundation trial there were around 200 or so named coconspirators in the holy land foundation trial the goal as one of the prosecutors told me was to get those convictions if they could and they knew it would be the most important biggest terrorist convictions in american judicial history and if they got those then they would go forward and start prosecuting others of the named coconspirators who were not indicted but were named we know there is plenty of evidence out there regarding coconspirators because there were some coconspirators that filed a motion with the court to have their names struck from the pleadings the federal district court that examined the evidence in dallas said no there is plenty of evidence here to support that cair council of american islamic relations isna islamic society north america are large front groups for muslim brotherhood went up to the fifth circuit and the fifth circuit confirmed that there was plenty of evidence to support their names being part of it yet this administration continues to coddle and get information and instruction from cair isna the president of isna imam magid continues to be a highly praised adviser to this administration so when people across the country say this couldnt possibly be true because the mainstream media would have been all over it i cant believe our federal government will allow this kind of thing to go on well the reason it has is because even though fbi reports continued to say over the years that these appear to be violent and associated with violent activities the state department under this administration continues to refuse to list the muslims of the americas as a terrorist organization which means they get to continue to build villages to train in paramilitary fashion around the country from texas south carolina new york california across the country until such time as this administration gets serious about what is going on had the information from an article this week this article from national review online convicted terrorist worked as an obamacare navigator in illinois it shouldnt be a surprise this kind of thing has happened because we found out that these socalled navigators under obamacare what might be more appropriately entitled the unaffordable care act these navigators are being allowed to gather peoples most personal and private identification information but they are not being vetted we have known from the beginning when the law kicked in that the navigators were not vetted for prior criminal activity so we shouldnt be surprised that there was a convicted terrorist that worked as an obamacare navigator in illinois then we have people enrollees finding it impossible to cancel their plans more than 6 weeks later weekly standard reports after spending 50 to 60 hours on the phone this mans policy is still not canceled so much for freedom when it comes to health care in this country under obamacare another report published by foxnews com obamacare may increase premiums for 11 million workers anyway it should be clear that even though we heard a staggering statement by the democrat majority leader in the senate that people who were reporting the horror stories about obamacare pointing out how the affordable care act really isnt it was devastating that these were lies they were not true well proper investigation reveals they are true there may be some that have made stories up when we get stories we try to look into are these really legitimate but what we find is most of them are easily documented and easily legitimate obamacare is doing massive damage across the country to peoples employment to their health insurance to their ability to see the doctor that they want and in some cases the doctor that has been keeping them alive another report obamacare may increase premiums for 11 million workers well i know it has increased them a lot i cant afford the new policy that would be required i liked my old one i wasnt crazy about it aetna had some problems we never got worked out but still i had more freedom of choice before the bottom line is when the federal government has become so big and so intrusive that it gathers everyones phone logs in the united states can check into any phone calls made by anyone in the country any time when the federal government gathers everyones most personal and private medical information when the federal government gathers peoples debit and credit card purchases to protect them when the federal government can use drones to monitor can monitor email activity web sites visited and then that same government can say we are not going to follow these laws if we dont like them dont think they are proper and we are going to change the law over here because congress didnt and we prefer to have a law that says this so we will follow that then it is no wonder that a constitutional professor like jonathan turley liberal as he is would express dire concerns about how long we can maintain this country we owe the american people an obligation to proper oversight force them to follow the law i yield back the balance of my time"], [8.927524322643876e-05,

mechanics even as the fire season is still upon us and throughout the state of california eighth graders like my constituents from oakland who wrote to me yesterday are cancelling field trips to national parks and monuments which are closed to visitors what are they going to do now to add insult to injury republicans have shut down the government because they are obsessed with destroying the affordable care act which is the law of the land and which the supreme court upheld most americans continue to see how senseless and wrong it is to shut down the government because you want to deny health care to millions two wrongs dont make a right despite the republican government shutdown health care exchanges established under the affordable care act have successfully opened for enrollment

nation of israel and we should be the best friend israel has in the world because they believe in the things we do in the same values where else in the middle east do people get to vote whether you are muslim jewish christian except in israel if you are a woman where are you respected and given the full rights that men have except for in israel where in the middle east are homosexuals not persecuted and even killed we ought to be israels best friend in the world and i am very concerned that at times it feels like we may not be so i join my friend in wanting to do everything we can to shore up that relationship with israel and i thank her for her dedication i also believe firmly that it is true that those who bless israel seem to end up being blessed go figure so i am grateful for that presentation i did want to answer or attempt to answer a question that i have been asked many times about media reporting and presentations and why some stories get covered by the mainstream media particularly by the three main networks for broadcast television and cnn and msnbc as well i saw a chart that was put together by a group called the minority report but i wasnt as interested in the group as i was in finding out if the relationships set forth in the chart were actually accurate so i had my staff help me lets find out is this chart really accurate i was really staggered by what was in the chart this is not the entire chart but it is most of it their chart was entitled keeping it in the family and it was very interesting as you see the chart here at cnn the vice president and deputy bureau chief in washington is virginia moseley who is married to tom nides who is the former deputy secretary of state under hillary clinton the former secretary of state you have bianna golodryga married to peter orszag who was the former director of the office of management and budget under the obama administration you have ben sherwood and he is the brother of dr elizabeth sherwoodrandall who is the former adviser to joe biden and also an adviser to the president at abc news you have ian cameron who is the former executive producer of this week and he is married to someone named susan rice who obviously was the national security advisor to the president before she went to the u n you have claire shipman who is married to someone named jay carney claire shipman is a correspondent with abc news then you have matthew jaffe who is married to katie hogan katie hogan was the deputy press secretary for president obamas 2012 reelection campaign and she is the spokesperson for organizing for action ofa which is working hard apparently to turn texas blue as they say anyway matthew jaffe is a reporter with abc news then not to leave out nbc news you have robert gibbs the former white house press secretary for president obama you have him as a contributor to nbc news you have the former senior adviser to the president david axelrod who is known for the massive and important advice he has given to president obama as a senior political analyst for msnbc oh we dont want to forget over here cbs news you have the president of cbs news who is david rhodes david rhodes is akin tois the brother ofben rhodes who is the person who coined the phrase kinetic military action instead of using the word war he coordinated the edits apparently of the benghazi talking points and of course he had a great deal to do with what was done in libya by this administration and the way that was discussed with the media so it is not necessarily surprising that sharyl attkisson ran into the buzz saw she did at cbs news when the president of cbs news is the brother of someone who was helping pull the strings at the white house in fact some of the articles that were pulled to point out some of these relationshipsan article by ed morrissey on april 29 of 2014 talked about the newly released white house email which shows that the rice talking points on benghazi were politically motivated it says in part in the article the youtube story was designed to distract from policy failures according to barack obamas aide ben rhodesor the brother to the president of cbs news then it goes on to set out part of mr ben rhodes email and he says in the email ben rhodes doesthe brother of david rhodes the president of cbs news to convey that the united states is doing everything that we can to protect our people and facilities abroad to underscore that these protests are rooted in an internet video and not a broader failure of policy to show that we will be resolute in bringing people who harm americans to justice and standing steadfast through these protests to reinforce the president and administrations strength and steadiness in dealing with difficult challenges on the toplines he says since we began to see protests in response to this internet video the president has directed the administration to take a number of steps his top priority has been the safety and security of all americans serving abroad indeed that was exactly what people in the administration were saying that was what the people at cbs news were parroting since that came from the brother of the cbs news president that seems to have worked pretty effectively there is another article here worldly at 35 and shaping obamas voice it was an article in the new york times in march of 2013 by mark landler it says as president obama prepares to visit israel next week he is turning as he often does to benjamin j rhodes a 35yearold deputy national security advisor with a soft voice strong opinions and a reputation around the white house as the man who channels mr obama on foreign policy mr rhodes is drafting the address to the israeli people the president plans to give in jerusalem but his influence extends beyond what either his title or speechwriting duties suggest drawing on personal ties and a philosophical kinship with mr obama that go back to the 2008 campaign mr rhodes helped prod his boss to take a more activist policy toward egypt and libya when those countries erupted in 2011 on further in the article it points out two years ago when protesters thronged tahrir square in cairo mr rhodes urged mr obama to withdraw three decades of american support for president hosni mubarak of egypt a few months later mr rhodes was among those agitating for the president to back a nato military intervention in libya to head off a slaughter by colonel muammar qaddafi further down in the article it says at the white house mr rhodes first came to prominence after he wrote mr obamas landmark address to the muslim world in cairo in june 2009 the speech was notable for mr obamas assertion that governments should reflect the will of the people prefiguring his policy in dealing with mr mubarak and colonel qaddafi another article from march of 2011 by rick moran it starts out with a reference to alice in wonderland when rick moran says a war is a war is a war right not if you live in the rabbit hole and have to answer to alice talking about alice in wonderlandas commander in chief but byron york is quotedand i take it this was an article by byron york inserted in mr morans pieceand says in the last few days obama administration officials have frequently faced the question is the fighting in libya a war for military officers to white house spokesmen up to the president himself the answer is no but that leaves the question what is it in a briefing onboard air force one wednesday deputy national security advisor ben rhodesagain this is 2011took a crack at an answer i think what we are doing is enforcing a resolution that has a very clear set of goals which is protecting the libyan people averting a humanitarian crisis and setting up a nofly zone rhodes said obviously that involves kinetic military action particularly on the front end that came from ben rhodes and then mr morans article says what we are doing in libya is making war whether the obama administration admits it or not people arent getting killed by kinetic anything they are dying the oldfashioned way they are getting blown up this gives a whole new meaning to kia another article from patrick howley from may 11 2013 entitled top obama officials brother is president of cbs news may drop reporter over benghazi coverage it says the brother of a top obama administration official is also the president of cbs news and the network may be days away from dropping one of its top investigative reporters for covering the administrations scandals too aggressively down further it says that reporting revealed that president obamas deputy national security advisor ben rhodesbrother of cbs news president david rhodes was instrumental in changing the talking points in september 2012 the article further down says more about mr rhodes being a 35yearold new york native david rhodes president of cbs news since 2011 so it is rather amazing but it should be more clear to people people wonder why the mainstream gives such favorable coverage to the obama administration well blood is thicker than water is one saying in the case of our mainstream media they totally dropped the ball on benghazi and continue to report on anything else they can besides benghazi i am very grateful that the mainstream media on the left and right back in the seventies did not drop the watergate investigation they stayed on it until the truth came out back in those days the mainstream media was so important to protecting our freedom and protecting americans from a president who had an enemies list and protecting america from a president that seemed a bit paranoid at times a man a fellow christian and an amazing man of faith after his conversion during the watergate investigation chuck colson talked in his book born again about how after the kent state debacle and students were killed it turned basically into a bunker at the white house it was we against they and if you were critical at all you didnt deserve to be in the bunker you were an enemy we are very fortunate that when a president begins to have that kind of mentality and so afraid of anybody who is critical we are fortunate he did not understand just how far a president how far an administration could push the irs into going after political enemies as we have now seen that it has whether or not the irss weaponization was before the 2012 election the president had a call to arms right here in front of the house and the senate and the cabinet members joint chiefs of staff and supreme court sitting right here when he mistakenly asserted what he believed were facts about the citizens united ruling by the supreme court and it was so wrong to the point that justice alito sat right here just feet away from where i am standing shaking his head and saying not true not true not true nonetheless people at the irs heard the call they paid attention and they came to understand that maybe the supreme court says conservatives can run ads and get involved in political issues like union groups do but maybe we can stop them and they effectively did that by putting their investigations into their tax status on hold and refusing to give them any kind of decision until well after the 2012 election thereby silencing those voices i have had reporters who obviously dont understand the tax code and the power of the irs say well what difference does it make those groups probably shouldnt have been applying for tax status like they were anyway obviously showing the ignorance of the reporters when they ask such questions because the way the internal revenue code is set up if someone in the general population just decides i want to get a bunch of friends together who have political beliefs like i do and we are going to pool our money together and then we are going to start spending it on issues to educate the american public and somebody has got to account for all that money you dont want the irs coming after you as you accumulate money to spend on political education of america so you have to go begging to the irs for the proper designation so that you can go about gathering money without them coming against you as being a single individual raising money to spend on political issues that also is one of the reasons why we need to throw out the internal revenue code just pass a bill that says as of a certain date the internal revenue code will be totally void and that gives us a deadline to shoot for i like the idea of a flat tax there are people that i love and respect that think a fair tax is a better way to go but by scrapping the internal revenue code throwing it out on a date certain then we would only have so long to get a new tax code figured out we would be serving notice to people that that is when it would change i have heard our president say so many times that people need to pay their fair share well it doesnt look like that is ever going to happen until we have a flat tax where if you make more you pay more you make less you pay less that is what we ought to be doing anyway as a result we have an irs that became weaponized on behalf of one political party and one administration and we do need a special prosecutor i have been pointing that out for quite some time there are criminals laws that may have been violated that is why we need a special prosecutor not the justice department we have seen their kind of just us rather than justice we need a special prosecutor that is not appointed by eric holder we need to get to the bottom of who violated the law because it appears laws were broken but some wonder why the mainstream media doesnt get into the irs weaponization more we see the familial relationships between the mainstream medianot that i am saying cnn and msnbc on the extreme left are mainstream media but they are part of the media who avoids reporting anything negative about this president well you hate to report things negative on your own family so that is understandable so it explains a lot once you begin to see all of the marriages and all of the sibling relationships between this administration and people in the mediasiblings in the mediapeople calling the shots and giving the advice in our major news media we also sometimes are a little surprised as the mainstream media tries to desperately change the subject from the false reports and statements that were made about benghazi and the coverup that we are now finding out about benghazi they are constantly trying to change the subject in their desperation to protect their familial relationships in the administration i had a call today wanting me to come on the news tomorrow and talk about climate change it used to be called global warming until people realized wow it is not really warming anything very serious so we better start calling it climate change and as any real scientists know when you come up with a scientific theory then there are certain facts that will prove your theory or your assertion but when we talk about climate change people are not doing that whatever happens if there are a lot of tornados they say see it is climate change if there are very few tornados they say see it is climate change if we have numerous hurricanes they say see it is climate change if there are not many hurricanes they say see it is climate change no matter what happens in the weather we are told it is climate change the truth is i believe in climate change i not only believe in climate change i know it is happening usually most places four times a year they are called seasons then we have climate changingi will never forget back in the midseventies there was a cover of one of the main american magazines about how we were approachingheading into a new ice age i thought well that doesnt make sense i do believe the bible and i dont believe the world is going to end in ice that just doesnt seem right yet we heard scientists telling us oh no we are at the beginning of a new ice age in the mid1970s we are at the beginning of a new ice age they were wanting to change everything we were doing oh we have got to change everything we are doing about power about fossil fuels everything because we are at the beginning of a new ice age about 10 years later people saw well we may be slightly warming so we had better quit talking about global cooling and now we are talking about global warming there is an interesting article that came out today from mario lewis entitled national climate assessment report alarmists offer untrue unrelenting doom and gloom this article today says tuesday the unitedstates governments global change research program released its latest national assessment report on climate change impacts in the united states as with previous editions the new report is an alarmist document designed to scare people and build political support for unpopular policies such as carbon taxes capandtrade and epa regulatory mandates also in keeping with past practice the latest report confuses climate risk with climate change risk droughts storms floods and heat waves are all part of the natural climate our risk of exposure to such extremes has much more to do with where we happen to live than with any gradual climate changes associated with the 1 3 degree fahrenheit to 1 9 degree fahrenheit increase in average unitedstates temperature since the 1880s since even immediate and total shutdown of all carbon dioxide emitting vehicles power plants and factories in the unitedstates would decrease global warming by only a hypothetical and undetectable twotenths of a degree celsius by 2100 eightyfive years even if they got everything they wanted for 85 years the article says it is misleading to imply as the report does that the obama administrations climate policies can provide any measurable protection from extreme weather events the assessment is flatout wrong that climate change is increasing our vulnerability to heat stress as hot weather has become more frequent people and communities have adapted to it and heatrelated mortality in the unitedstates has declined cities with the most frequent hot weather such as tampa florida and phoenix arizona have practically zero heatrelated mortality that is the most probable future for most unitedstates cities if global warming continues the report also foolishly predicts that climate change intensify air pollution as epas own data show despite allegedly unprecedented warming the unitedstates air quality has improved decade by decade since 1970 as emissions declined the report blames climate change for the midwest drought of 2012 but the governments own analysis concluded otherwise neither ocean states nor humaninduced climate change factors that can provide longlead predictability appeared to play significant roles in causing severe rainfall deficits over the major cornproducing regions of central great plains this assessment ignores substantial data and research finding no longterm increase in the strength and frequency of tropical cyclones and no trend in extreme weatherrelated damages once losses are normalized or adjusted for changes in population wealth and consumer price index for example the report says trends in the frequency and intensity of tornadoes are uncertain whereas in fact there is no trend and a new study by university of colorado professor roger pielke jr finds with some certainty that the number of years with very large tornado losses has actually decreased during 1993 2013 compared to 19501970 similarly the unitedstates is currently in the longest period on record with no major category 3 5 hurricane landfalls this good news is not included in the report the assessment gives short shrift to the warming pause which it calls shortterm in the assessment the pause is depicted as running from 1998 through 2012 that is 15 years in fact the pause is now 17 years and 8 months long more tellingly the assessment does not discuss the growing divergence between climate model predictions and observations the divergence now in its 34th year and accelerating due to the pause raises questions about the climate sensitivity assumptions on which dire climate change scenarios depend climate sensitivity is an estimate of how much warming will eventually result from a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations relative to preindustrial levels in its discussion of sensitivity the assessment basically endorses the u n intergovernmental panel on climate changes 2007 likely sensitivity range of 3 6 to 8 1 degrees fahrenheit and best estimate of 5 4 degrees fahrenheit it neglects to mention that partly due to the pause and model overshoot of observed temperatures the ipccs 2013 report lowered the bottom end of the likely range and declined to offer a best estimate more importantly the assessment presents the debate over climate sensitivity as a he said she said as if a single paper by john fasullo and kevin trenberth balances out some 16 recent papers indicating that the ipcc climate sensitivity estimates are too hot in other words they are just wrong the article says so despite an occasional fig leaf to hide the nakedness of its alarm message the report does acknowledge that climate change has lengthened growing seasons helping to make food more abundant and affordable the assessment is unrelenting gloom and doom its only hopeful message is that its not too late to implement kyotostyle climate policies sorry thats not good enough even for government work mario lewis is a ph d a senior fellow at competitive enterprise institute and it really is important to real realize what is at stake here it is something that shocked me back when we were trying in my freshman term to amend and reform the endangered species act that has wreaked such havoc with our economy and continues to cause people to lose jobs there was reported decline in the unemployment rate from 6 7 to 6 3 and you heard all of the mainstream media in helping their family members in this administration just all abuzz and aglow with how wonderful that fourtenths of a percent drop was failing completely to mention that that was only a fraction of the 800 000 who got so tired of not finding work800 000 people gave up and quit looking for work and are now considered under statistics to no longer be unemployed even though they are unemployed it doesnt account for all the people that are underemployed that are out of college and cant find jobs the historic high unemployment rate of our veterans coming back and looking for jobs even as this administration not only wants to cut the military back to a fraction of its former self back to preworld war ii levels when we were not a superpower and hatred and genocide began to reign supreme that doesnt explain why the administration and some people here in the house friends of mine here in the house that are saying you know what lets give the few jobs left in our military to people that are not lawfully in this country if they will do that even though it will displace one of the few military jobs left after we cut the military back so far and even though it will push them into an evengrowing high unemployment rate for veterans lets go ahead and give those few jobs left to people who are not lawfully in the country it is not a good idea after pushing for over a year and a half for a select committee to get to the bottom of what happened at benghazi and after we still havent gotten to the bottom of the department of justices role in forcing guns which we know they did forced guns to be sold to criminals and people that should not have had guns that ended up with drug cartels in mexico with reports of hundreds of mexicans killed by the weapons we forced into improper and illegal criminal hands webeing the justice department of this administrationwe havent gotten answers to that that is why even today as i stand here the highestranking law enforcement officer in the land stands in contempt of congress although i was gratified to hear him say in answer to a question of mine that i am not supposed to ever presume that it wasnt a big deal to him unfortunately he said a year ago to abc news that it wasnt any kind of big deal at all because to be a big deal he would have had to have respect for the people that voted for the contempt and since he had no respect for the people that voted for the contempt it wasnt a big deal to him so a year ago it wasnt a big deal and this year apparently it is still a big deal but i am not supposed to think that it is not a big deal to him even though that is what he said and the familial relationships in the mainstream media continue to give cover as i have continued to complain about the inadequate investigation into the tsarnaevsthe failure of this administration to properly investigate the tsarnaevs even after the russians who are not our friends gave us twice a heads up look out the older tsarnaev has been radicalized now you have got people in the mainstream media parroting what the obama administration is saying well those darned old russians they should have given us more information they did us a favor giving us a heads up we are not their friends they gave us a heads up anyway they dont eventhey purged the fbi training material so our agents dont know the proper questions to ask to find out if someone has been radicalized they wont allow people that have spent their adult lives studying radical islampeople like that like steve coughlinthey are not allowed to even go give a briefing to people to explain what radical islam is and then we hear people like the department of homeland security secretary at the time janet napolitano who seemed to take the position that gee you know we are just not able to connect the dots but yet it appears that under her watch not only did she promote what egyptian muslim brother publications said were top muslim brother people into top homeland security and obama administration positions but she gave a secret clearanceand there is no way it could have been given after proper vetting because proper vetting would have showed that he was a main speaker giving tribute to the man of vision the ayatollah khomeini who has a foundation called the freedom and justice foundation which is the same name as the muslim brother political party in egypt who defended the convicted terrorist supporter of the head of the holy land foundation said there was nothing wrong with what he was doing i am very proud of the senator from iowa i want to do a shoutout down the hall and read a letter from senator grassley i was just there in iowa a few days ago senator grassleys territory the senior senator from iowa charles e grassley wrote a letter to the new secretary of homeland security jeh johnson and he said my office recently received copies of disturbing internal department of homeland security dhs emails regarding the admittance of individuals into the united states with potential ties to terrorism the may 2012 email chain between unitedstates immigration and customs enforcement ice and unitedstates customs and border protection cbp surrounds the question of whether to admit someone who had scheduled an upcoming flight into the unitedstates allegedly the individual was a member of the muslim brotherhood and a close associate of a supporter of hamas hezbollah and palestinian islamic jihad according to the same email the individual had been in secondary inspection several dozen times of the past several years but had not had a secondary inspection since 2010 one of the responses to the initial email states the cbp national targeting center ntc watch commander advised that the subject has sued cbp twice in the past and that hes one of the several handsoff passengers nationwide apparently his records were removed in december 2010 and the dhs secretary was involved in the matter the email continues im puzzled how someone could be a member of the muslim brotherhood and unindicted coconspirator in the holy land foundation trial which parenthetically was a trial in which people were convicted of supporting terrorism providing financial support for terrorism convicted and this individual mentioned was a named coconspirator in the pleadings the message and the email goes on be an associate of redacted say that the unitedstates is staging car bombings in iraq and that it is okay for men to beat their wives question who was behind the 9 11 attacks and be afforded the luxury of a visitor visa and dewatchlisted it doesnt appear that well be successful with denying him entry tomorrow but maybe we could reevaluate the matter in the future since the decision to dewatchlist him was made 17 months ago senator grassleys message to secretary johnson of dhs said in order to understand the events described in these emails please provide the committee with answers to the following questions one why was this individual removed from the watchlist in december 2010 two please describe the nature extent and reasons for the involvement of the dhs secretary or her staff in the removal of the individual from the watchlist three what is the current watchlist status of this individual four how many people are on the handsoff list mentioned in the email five what qualifies someone to receive the handsoff designation six does filing a lawsuit result in being designated handsoff and thus avoiding secondary security screenings seven who makes the determination that an individual should be considered handsoff senator grassley says i would appreciate receiving answers to these questions by march 3 2014 should you have any questions regarding the letterand he goes on and he signs it charles e grassley ranking member then there is an attachment to his letter and there is so much that is redacted here that there are a lot of gaps but even so it is easy to see how serious this is this was from thursday may 10 2012 not quite a year before the boston bombing but as was pointed out in the letter this email was from a unitedstates immigration and customs enforcement officer to the unitedstates customs and border patrol protection the body says the ntc watch commander advised that the subject has sued cbp twice in the past and that hes one of several handsoff passengers nationwide he said he checked if there was a copy of the lawsuits filed against cbp in the historical logs can you pass the lawsuits if they are at ntc i assume the lawsuits were against the heads of dhs and presume it was a civil proceeding but who knows where it was filed since the subject lives outside the unitedstates i didnt know that a canadian citizen who lives in blank could sue dhs also not sure if the lawsuits were regarding him being stopped frequently or his admissibility inadmissibility or both if the lawsuits werent about his admissibility inadmissibility we should proceed forward regarding that once the lawsuits are reviewed if the lawsuits arent readily accessible at cbp ntc i can check with someone at cbp headquarters to get them apparently his records were removed in december 2010 and the dhs secretary was involved in the matter im puzzled how someone could be a member of the muslim brotherhood and unindicted coconspirator in the holy land foundation trial be an associate of blank say that the unitedstates is staging car bombings in iraq and that is okay for men to beat their wives question who was behind the 9 11 attacks and be afforded the luxury of a visitor visa and dewatchlisted it doesnt appear that well be successful with denying him entry tomorrow but maybe we could reevaluate the matter in the future since the decision to dewatchlist him was made 17 months ago thanks and then the name is blotted out anyway other messages one in response down the email chain i spoke with cbp blank who is obviously very familiar with this traveler i am of the opinion that blank meets the parameters for refusal based on the three ina 212 a 3 terrorism charges and that when he enters the unitedstates on a bi b2 for lectures speeches for organizations or for events where a registration fee is required or admission needs to be paid he should probably be seeking an r 1 or an 0 1 visa instead perhaps one of the reasons he has not applied for an 0 1 visa or r i visa is because of the terroristrelated questions these forms ask that he would then be forced to answer does ntc have any background information or guidance it can share on the logs or former records this subject has had or if he has applied for any waivers of inadmissibility does ntc have any objections if cbp denies admission to blank under either terrorism grounds or improper nonimmigrant visa based on a review of the statements of the subject i think it is clear that he meets the definition of endorsing and inciting if hed like to enter the unitedstates in the future he can seek a waiver to overcome those inadmissibility grounds but none has been sought to my knowledge and the email prior to that said yesterday afternoon we hsi blank office received a lead regarding blank aka blank an egyptianborn canadian citizen who is a member of the muslim brotherhood and close associate of blank an individual residing in blank who supports hamas hezbollah and palestinian islamic jihad blank has been looked at in secondary inspections several dozen times over the past several years however he has not been secondaried since blank 2010 blank has a reservation to depart blank canada at blank on this friday morning for a flight to blank that stops in blank first he is scheduled to speak at some conference in some city on some nightit is all blacked out i am passing this right up to blank at hsi to forward to cbp regarding possible inadmissibility grounds related to ina 2012 a 3 terrorism charges because blank s potential inciting endorsing and association with terrorists blank has been looked at in the past but hopefully this collection of 20 supporting open source articles will assist with making an informed inadmissibility determination but anyway apparently despite all of those open inadmissibility issues according to the later email the secretary of the department of homeland security herself at the time janet napolitano had a handsoff list apparently including people like this member of the muslim brotherhood when it comes to the boston bombing i have met some of the boston police i was impressed and i would bet if the city of boston police department had been given a headsup by either the fbi or cia that the russians say this tsarnaev guy has been radicalized is capable of murder then it would have entirely changed the investigation by the boston police department into people that were killed that were known to tsarnaev and i would bet you since i am not aware of the boston police department having had their training materials purged to exclude anything that might offend a radical islamist they may have been able to go out to the mosque and ask about tsarnaev if they had known the allegation that he had been radicalized and they may have been able to answer better questions about the type of islamic leaders that the older tsarnaev liked that he read that he endorsed and they could have made a better decision than our own justice department did on whether or not he had been radicalized that should have been shared with the boston police if they had had that information without having had their training materials purged they may have done a better job of protecting those people at the boston marathon then you read emails going back and forth among our ice agents customs and border patrol people who were shocked that a guy who is a muslim brother who has incited people to hatred against the united states who was a named coconspirator with people who were convicted of supporting terrorism how it is the secretary of homeland security could give him a pass just as she did to a reported member of the muslim brotherhoodreported by an egyptian magazine supportive of the muslim brotherhoodhow she could just give him a secret security clearance and even after i tell her about his downloading two documents from a classified source that she gave him access to and pointed out to her about a reporter saying he had tried to shop the two documents she said she investigated but i know they didnt because they never even talked to that one reporter that knew about the documents being shopped they never checked as far as i know he is still giving advice at the top level of homeland security as a muslim brother according to the egyptians he is given access to our classified documents and then we see that same homeland security secretary that gave him access to classified documents that he reportedlyand according to somebody i trusthe had shopped them and tried to get a national news media to publish them they didnt even look into it they didnt even investigate that properly how safe can america be when homeland security is creating handsoff lists that put us at risk with that i yield back my time"],

chairman of our t i committee mr shuster from pennsylvania for his tireless efforts in this regard and as well our subcommittee chairman mr gibbs and our ranking member on the full committee mr tim bishop one of the first acts of our federal government was to improve navigation on august 7 1789 the first congress federalized the lighthouses built by the colonies and appropriated funds for their operation and maintenance today in the 113th congress we keep faith with that fundamental premise of government by advancing legislation that authorizes the unitedstates army corps of engineers to improve navigation on our inland waterways and our ports this is an effort which has languished these past 7 years and the results of that inactivity are evident in 1989 a book by the author john mcphee described the corps as follows in addition to all the things the corps actually does and does not do there are infinite actions it is imagined not to do and infinite actions it is imaginable to be capable of doing because the corps has conceded the almighty role of god indeed the history of the corps of engineers is one of constructing incredible feats of engineering to assist navigation and to combat the ravages of flooding yet in recent times we have fallen into deficit when it comes to this infrastructure aging locks and dams hinder the efficient movement of waterborne commerce and many of our coastal ports are illprepared to take advantage of the expansion of the panama canal because their harbors need to be dredged and in some cases deepened the pending legislation will revitalize our inland waterway system so that bulk commodities such as coal can be transported more efficiently and it provides a path forward to spending down the funds currently being held hostage in the harbor maintenance trust fund further it wrests back control to the congress to elected officials decisionmaking authority over future corps endeavors rather than ceding this responsibility to the administration as is currently the case one aspect of this legislation which i am especially pleased to see is the application of the buy american provisions for steel and iron that exist in the federal surface transportation program to projects constructed by the corps of engineers that provision further defines this legislation as my good chairman has said as being about jobsjobs to construct flood control projects jobs to expand our harbors jobs to make improvements to our waterways and american jobs in the production of iron and steel which goes into these works i again commend

express support for strong buy american provisions within the department of defense procurement policy i would like to thank chairman mckeon ranking member smith and ranking member swalwell for engaging in this colloquy to discuss our shared goal to promote increased procurement of domestically manufactured solar devices for use by the department of defense the buy american act is especially important when it comes to supporting nascent american industries and strong buy american policies can assist development of domestic manufacturing capability with regard to renewable energy currently the department of defense is required to comply with buy american act provisions for procurement of energy produced from solar panels if those panels are located on government property and the electricity produced by the panels is reserved exclusively for use by the department recently we have witnessed the development of largescale solar installations that are not located on government property though the electricity produced is still exclusively used by the department of defense i support a minor language change that would require dods procurement process to comply with the buy american act for electricity that is exclusively used by the department of defense or is generated from solar devices located on government property this small change is worthy of support the congressional budget office has scored this proposal as costing 2 million over a 10year budget window and my amendment was not made in order because of this score i understand cbo rules but i strongly

way from the beginning of this bill to todays passage it means a lot to me and to the people of omaha and boys town this bill will honor the significant contributions of boys town and how in my district it has impacted our community and our country with a fitting tribute to the legacy of father flanagan who founded boys town a priest and an immigrant from ireland father flanagan was of modest means but in 1917about 5 years after becoming a priesthe borrowed 90 from bnai brith member henry monsky to open a boarding house because they both shared a love for the homeless boys who had been abandoned or orphaned living on the streets of our city they created this boarding house went out and recruited boys from the streets to come in where he not only housed them and fed them but where he educated them and taught them a trade he really felt that the education and the trade were necessary parts of making them into men who would be part of the community and be successful father flanagan did not differentiate between race or religion and by the spring of the next year 100 boys found refuge in father flanagans home it is great seeing the pictures from that era of boys of all races who were eating together and playing together in 1921 father flanagan opened his doors further he was able to purchase the overlook farm way on the outskirts now i have to drive about 50 blocks east to get to it as it is surrounded by omaha that is the property that is now known iconically as boys town it became an official village with its own post office in 1936 today boys town serves more than 2 million children and families across our country each year it provides parental counseling the boys town national hotline provides counseling to more than 150 000 children and families each year the boys town national research hospital is a national leader in the field of hearing care and research of usher syndrome and all of this is thanks to the vision of father flanagan when he borrowed 90 to start a boys home now also i should mention that it was probably around the seventiesi cant remember the datewhen womenyoung girls were allowed in there in fact a couple of times i have had the pleasure of being invited to dinner at one of the houses there where they have a host family and there were eight girls in this house who were then ordered by the court or placed there by a family to help them with a variety of issues mostly disciplinary some health care in fact boys town is now becoming the leader in research for pharmaceuticals for young children for children teenagers most of them have come to boys town with about four or five different prescriptions and boys town because of their way of counseling and dealing with it can get most of them off of the prescription drugs this is what boys town stands for as father flanagan once said i know when the idea of a boys home grew in my mind i never thought of anything remarkable about taking in all of the races and all of the creeds to me they are all gods children they are my brothers they are children of god i must protect them to the best of my ability 97 years later inspired by father flanagan here we are and that vision stands as true today as it did in 1917 it is the inscription of the iconic statue of the two boys one on the shoulder of the other that stood as the centerpiece of the village for more than 70 years now he aint heavy hes my brother that is the boys town way to be full of compassion and to help our fellow man i encourage all of my colleagues to support this legislation"],

drive innovation and regional collaboration the america competes reauthorization act of 2010 established a regional innovation program within the economic development administration this program is intended to encourage and support the development of regional innovation strategies including regional innovation clusters and science and research parks for the past few years the president has consistently requested 25 million to fund the regional innovation strategies program the program was provided 10 million in funding in the fiscal year 2014 omnibus appropriations bill passed by this chamber a few months ago funding for the regional innovation program supports the economic development agencys interagency effort to build regional innovation clusters including the jobs and innovation accelerator challenge and the make it in america challenge this program helps to ensure we build a cohesive competitive economy by aggregating existing investments and technical assistance from multiple federal agencies to develop a network of interconnected firms and institutions together this network and other regional stakeholders can use this funding to accelerate job growth spur business formation and expansion encourage innovation invest in workforce training and support small business development for example the i6 challenge grants funded within the regional innovation program have already helped universities and research centers across the country invest in efforts to scale up groundbreaking ideas this means providing these innovators with the necessary resources to accelerate commercialization and to attract venture capital for the most promising technologies to compete in the 21st century and win america must invest in scaling up promising technology and innovative ideas in the longterm these ideas will help ensure our nation remains at the cutting edge importantly investing now will help jumpstart our competitive advantage in terms of producing emerging technologies and supporting advanced manufacturing through the regional innovation program local leaders are empowered to maximize existing assets and are provided resources to ensure that historically underrepresented communities including those hardest hit by unemployment and economic decline are able to participate in and benefit from a growth in a regional cluster the regional innovation program has traditionally garnered support from both republicans and democrats it is a truly bipartisan evidencebased method for creating jobs my amendment is simple and straightforward it would not create a new program or new authorization it does not increase or decrease funding for a single account in the appropriations bill instead this amendment simply serves to include the regional innovation program within the bill and to bring focus to this vitally important jobcreating initiative as this appropriations process moves forward in addition the regional innovation program has consistently been specifically supported and cited with a separate line item in previous senate cjs appropriations committee reports to close i strongly believe we must recognize that innovation is critically important to americas ability to compete in the 21st century global economy supporting the development of regional innovation clusters strengthens our capacity to create and retain new
