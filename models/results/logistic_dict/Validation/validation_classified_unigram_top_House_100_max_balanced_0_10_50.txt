building up the forthrightly against building up the military power of the british empire even though they knew that hitler was violating the treaty of versailles which was signed in 1918 they came up with this policy under the liberal government when the treaty of versailles was signed it said very clearly that the germans could not build up beyond a 100 000man army and yet what they did was they took the military and built a 100j000man elite corps that was to train millions of other people the liberal party and the british parliament would not ever believe whatwas actually going on before their very eyes the problem is that once a groupof people like the liberals in this body or the liberals in the british parliament get their head set in a certain direction it is almost impossible for them to turnit into another direction the liberal party in england did not change their approach even though hitler started violating the treaty ofversailles and becoming very aggressive with the surrounding countries infact when lord chamberlain flew to munich in 1938 and signed that infamous agreement and came back saying we have peace in our time he had just sown the seeds of world war ii they still were committed to fighting for a disarmament policy and fighting for a paper peace that is what we see on the liberal side of this congress the liberals are committed to a disarmament program for central america they do not want to help the freedom fighters down there and if they do not profit from history and start seeing what tyrant communists and fascists have done in the past

the contras indeed i have opposed providing covert military goods of any kind whatever to the contras but i must also oppose the boland amendment i do so principally for two reasons first on its face it eliminates the ability of the president of the united states to protect unitedstates citizens and diplomats in nicaragua in the event of a hostage situation or rapid destabilization in the area and to honor our solemn treaty obligations to our allies if that becomes necessary in the future second it is an amendment to the wrong legislative vehicle since the michelmccurdymcdade amendment does not provide any of the money that the new boland amendment restricts the michel amendment only provides humanitarian aid and allows sharing of information with the nicaragua democratic resistance the boland amendment would gut the michel amendment it goes so far as to prohibit the united states from exchanging information with the groups opposing communism in nicaragua it makes no sense to say we will give humanitarian aid to groups fighting commission on our doorstep but we cannot talk to them if the unitedstates government cannot talk to them how are we supposed to deliver humanitarian aid to them how are we supposed to monitor and encourage their observance of human rights the first point i mentioned about protecting americans concerns me greatly the boland amendment makes clear that no matter what happenseven if the sandinistas seize our embassy or round up all americans in nicaraguathe president of the united states is not allowed to use the unitedstates armed forces to protect american citizens listen closely to what the boland amendment saysand i am quoting the relevant portions no funds available during any fiscal year to the department of defense 0 may be obligated or expended for the purposes or which would have the effect of supporting military or paramilitary operations in nicaragua by any nation the plain result of that language is that no department of defense

were soft on deve now fail to oppose the communism in this hemi d we are once more pere soft on defense and comhen we could be shut out in the next election our record on the replacement of rightwing military dictators over the past several years has not been a good one in cuba we supported castro over batista in iran we pulled the rug out from under the shah in favor of khomeini and then we collaborated in the process of replacing the oppressive somoza regime with communism i do not mean to imply that these rightwing dictatorships were acceptable forms of governing they are not however they did not with one exception attempt to impose their repressive forms of government on others yet castro has used his island base to export revolution in latin america and has supplied the manpower for communist mischief in africa khomeini has poisoned the entire middle east with his fanaticism and has collaborated with russian clientstates where it suited his purposes and communist managua has arnouncedand demonstratedthat its revolution is without borders why should we be concerned there are many reasons first there are humanitarian concerns when communist regime take hold the people fleethey vote with their feet they fled eastern europe after the second world war they fled north vietnam after the partition they fled cuba when castro came to power and where will they go no other central american state can support its own populace let alone an influx from first one fallen country then another they will move slowly but in great numbers across the landbridge which is mexico and what will we do then the burden on our southwest and southeast will be insupportable our unemployment rate will rise dramatically our capacity for providing services will be exhausted we must care what happens to these people who do not want to leave their homelands but have no choice and we must care what happens to our own land in the face of such a crisis and there are concerns of the economy and trade we are a maritime nation the sealanes of the caribbean must remain open and available to us if we are to continue to function to the modem world two of the most revered democratic presidents of the 20th century have been forced by circumstance to confront communism in 1947 president truman recognized the peril to world peace inherent in the communist attempt to take over greece he set forth our national goal in that regard and the truman doctrine was born just 15 years later president kennedy was also forced to look in the face of the communist threat when with great courage he called the russian bluff and ordered the missiles out of cuba in the first case we possessed the strength of the victor in the second we were favored with a lot of luck in both cases open warfare was averted now if the soviets decide to put missiles in place in the outskirts of managua who among us can say with confidence that two dozen russian submarines will not rise in the pacific and the

luxury of temporizing or compromising with marxism in this hemisphere there must be no appeasement the cost will be too steep we need do nothing more nor less than to impose the truman doctrine in

speech he spoke eloquently and forcefully about his legislative agenda and our nations future the speech was characteristic of this president and what he reminds us is characteristic of this nation optimistic upbeat and full of promise for the future what can you say about a man who at 75 after extensive surgery can keep the weight of the world on his shoulders and still deliver a speech that touches all americans young and old ronald reagan clearly dispelled any notion that his last 2 years was to be that of a caretaker president i salute him for his remarks on iran he was acknowledged that mistakes were made assumed full responsibility for the affair and pledged to the american people to get to the bottom and take whatever action is called for his promise to tackle the welfare system and provide elderly citizens a way out of the catastrophic illness nightmare is timely and recognizes his administrations commitment to the poor and the elderly i also salute his pledge to work with congress in a bipartisan manner on the budget and in drafting trade legislation the two top economic priorities in this congress the state of the union however is not the place for an extensive

permanently manned presence in space and contribute to the development and utilization of diverse scientific capabilities the united states must remain competitive in space and cannot afford to fail in ottaining the tc chnology and knowledge derived from a strong civilian space program it seems to me that this amendment simply tys to exploit the strong sympathy in this chamber for the poor and homeless in an effort to undercut our nations space program the amendment would increase funding for homeless programs by 83 4 million at a time when current funds are so poorly spent new york city spends an average of 1 900 a month to put up a family of four in a welfare hotel and half of that money comes from the federal government many of these welfare hotels are nothing more than havens for drug dealers dope addicts and alcoholics the amendment would also restore 150 million for udag grants the udag program is by far and away the worst pork barrel program ever conceived by congress it does nothing to help the poor rather it is a wasteful giveaway program that simply provides free money to wealthy developers of hotels and shopping centers who would not be considered needy the appropriations committee was right to zero out funding for the program and it is ludicrous to consider taking funds away from our economic future and wasting it on giveaway programs such as udag the schumer amendment would do nothing to address the plight of the poor and homeless problem in this country rather it 4ild only contribute to the demise of our civilian space program and inhibit sci
