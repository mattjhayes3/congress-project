of the congressional black caucus during the 113th congress thanks to her dedication and tireless work this caucus is better positioned to address the diverse challenges of the african american community i also want to thank the new cbc chair the honorable congressman g k butterfield of north carolina i am confident that he will do a great job leading this caucus with steadfast commitment to justice and to building an america that works for everyone let me also thank my counterpart the honorable congresswoman robin kelly for joining me in leading the cbc special orders this year i am truly honored to take on this new role and i look forward to working with her as we help carry out the critical mission of this caucus 50 years ago in the midst of the civil rights movement hundreds of brave men and women gathered in selma alabama to begin a long arduous march to montgomery in support of the fundamental truth that every american regardless of what they look like has the right to vote on march 7 1965 600 men and women set out from selma following the death of 26yearold jimmie lee jackson a deacon from marion alabama who died from gunshot wounds inflicted by a state trooper at a nonviolent demonstration theirs was a peaceful nonviolent march but it was met with fierce brutality it would take the marchers two more attempts to arrive at montgomery but on march 25 after a 12day journey they did arrive since that day our country has made significant strides in achieving equality and justice for all but significant challenges remain unmet tonight we will examine where we have come from where we are and where we would like to go as a society we must be ready to go in 1965 selma became the focal point of voter registration efforts in the south at the time only 2 percent of the citys eligible african american voters had been able to register the impact of selma to the montgomery march was profound as dr king said selma produced the voting rights legislation of 1965 the voting rights act of 1965 banned discriminatory voting requirements that disenfranchised african american voters throughout this country yet today the dream of full equality is still something many african americans can only dream of where we are nearly 6 years after the end of the recession people still struggle to find work and the gap between the rich and poor continues to grow for african americans this situation is severe given the disproportionate effect of unemployment on our communities at the same time there remains widespread poverty a defining challenge of our time this persistent economic inequality threatens to undercut the gains that african american communities have made and it undermines the idea of economic mobility the idea that if you work hard in this country and have ambition you can get ahead the economic crisis is not only facing african american communities where we are in education education is the most important economic investment we can make now and for future generations yet across the country we still have seen cuts to education at all levels and attacks on critical programs like head start and pell grants these attacks undermine the ability of african americans to get aheadthat is why i strongly support president obamas new bold initiative for free access to community collegesso too do efforts to dismantle social safety net programs which our communities depend on those efforts are irresponsible unjust and contrary to who we are as americans the congressional black caucus will make criminal justice reform a centerpiece of our agenda we will work to reduce the epidemic of poverty in this country we will work to create educational opportunities for african american children and we will support efforts to strengthen our 105 historically black colleges and universities the cbc also remains committed to fighting against efforts to dismantle the social safety net we are determined to restore section 5 of the voting rights act and to make sure everyone regardless of what they look like or where they come from has equal access to the polls and we resolve to ensure that increasing diversity in this nation is reflected in american corporations together these policies will bring us closer as a nation where we are empowering the communities of african americans and they will benefit from the full equality and live the american dream there is no doubt that we are in difficult times in this nation injustices are widespread and threaten some of our most fundamental rights but we will find no answers in

judiciary committee it is there that we deal with the problems particularly on the crime subcommittee at the end of someones detour in life do you know what mr chairman those detours in life that wind up with 75 000 persons in the federal prison system on mandatory minimums has been because people cannot read do not have opportunities and do not have jobs i want to invest in a budget that lifts the boats of all people if you work hard you get a home if you work hard you can send your kids to school if you work hard you can retire that is the budget i want to support not this nosuccess budget that is being proposed by our republican friends i ask my colleagues to support the alternative budget along with the cpc and the cbc budget mr chair i rise in strong opposition to h con res 27 the house republicans budget resolution for fiscal year 2016 because it continues the reckless and irresponsible approach to fiscal policy that the house majority has championed for years with disastrous results mr chair the budgeteers on the majority side have a very poor track record when it comes to economic forecasts and projections for years they have based their entire legislative agenda and strategy on their belief that the affordable care act or obamacare would be a failure the wish was father to the thought but they were wrong because of obamacare more than 16 4 million americans now know the peace of mind that comes from affordable quality health insurance that is there when you need it house republicans oppose increasing the minimum wage claiming that it costs jobs wrong again every increase in the minimum wage has been accompanied by an expanding economy especially during the clinton administration house republicans opposing comprehensive immigration reform claim that it will lead to lower incomes and lost jobs wrong again studies conducted by groups as far apart as the chamber of commerce and the aflcio consistently show that comprehensive immigration reform will grow the gross domestic product by 1 5 trillion over 10 years given this sorry track record of economic forecasting i strongly oppose the republican budget because it favors the wealthy over middle class families and those struggling to enter or remain in the middle class i oppose this republican budget because it asks major sacrifices of seniors who can barely make ends meet and fundamentally alters the social contract by turning medicaid and snap programs into a block grant and medicare into a voucher i cannot and will not support a resolution that attempts to balance the budget on the backs of working families seniors children the poor or mortgages the future by failing to make the investments needed to sustain economic growth and opportunity for all americans mr chair the gop work harder get less budget squeezes hardworking americans by making it 1 harder to buy a home by keeping their paychecks stagnant 2 harder to send your kids to college by cutting student loans and 3 harder to enjoy a secure retirement by privatizing medicare if the house republicans work harder to get less budget were adopted here is a sample of the pain and misery that will be visited on middleclass and working families 1 an end to higher education tax credits 2 an end to needed increases in the child tax credit 3 the loss of access to tax credits for affordable health care for millions of americans and 4 a reduction in tax rates for the wealthy yielding an average tax cut of 200 000 for millionaires financed by a 2 000 tax increase on the typical middle class family mr chair this price is not right budget will make it harder to middle and working class parents to send their kids to college by 1 ending higher education tax credits and 2 cutting student loan programs and pell grants making college less affordable and adding to the already huge levels of student debt the damage caused by the republican budget is not limited to working families and students there are also lumps of coal for seniors who have earned and deserve a secure retirement 1 the medicare guarantee is turned into a voucher program with increased costs for seniors 2 seniors who have worked hard for a financially secure retirement will immediately have to pay new copays for preventive care and much higher costs for prescription drugs the republican budget also disinvests in americas future 1 slashes the part of the budget we use to invest in our childrens education and 2 devastates our investments in scientific research and innovation mr chair the republican budget exacerbates the drag on the economy resulting from a crumbling infrastructure by cutting 187 billion or more than 19 percent from transportation funding over the coming decade and provides no solution to address the current shortfall in the federal transportation fund which means we can expect construction slowdowns beginning this summer mr chair compared to the presidents budget the republican budget would result this fiscal year in 35 000 fewer children in head start and up to 6 000 fewer special education teachers paraprofessionals and other related staff the republican budget also shortchanges americas future by cutting investments in scientific research and innovation in real terms by failing to lift the draconian sequester on domestic priorities as a result under the republican budget there would be 1 300 fewer medical research grants at national institutes h and 950 fewer competitive science research awards at the nsf affecting 11 600 researchers technicians and students finally mr chair the republican budget mistreats the poorest and most vulnerable persons in our country the republican work harder get less budget takes aim at millions of families with children struggling to make ends meet and put food on the table by converting the supplemental nutrition assistance program snap into a block grant beginning in 2021 and cutting funding steeplyby 125 billion 34 percent between 2021 and by 2025 these dramatic cuts could mean in 2021 through 2025 either cutting off assistance to 11 to 12 million eligible people each year or cutting benefits by almost 55 per person per month in contrast the democratic budget works for american families by giving them the tools to buy a home send their kids to college and enjoy a secure retirement mr chair the democratic budget represents a better way we democrats understand that we are all in this together and that our current economic situation calls for a balanced approach between increased revenues and responsible reduction in expenditures our plan will protect and strengthen our recovering economy reduce the deficit in a responsible way while continuing to invest in the things that make our country strong like education health care innovation and clean energy mr chair this republican budget is bad for america but it is disastrous for the people from my home state of texas who sent me here to advocate for their interests let me highlight a few examples 1 if the republican budget resolution were to become the basis of federal fiscal policy 3 435 336 texas seniors would be forced out of traditional medicare and into a voucher program under the republican plan to end medicare as we know it texas seniors will receive a voucher instead of guaranteed benefits under traditional medicare 2 for the 3 435 336 texans aged 4554 the value of their vouchers would be capped at growth levels that are lower than the projected increases in health care costs previous analyses showed that this type of plan would cut future spending by 5 900 per senior forcing them to spend more out of pocket and diminishing their access to quality care 3 additionally private insurance plans will aggressively pursue the healthiest least expensive enrollees thereby allowing medicarecurrently the lifeline for 3 187 332 texas seniorsto wither on the vine 4 if the republican budget resolution were to be adopted by

congress it has been an honor and a privilege to work closely with her she has done such a phenomenal job not just on behalf of the people she represents in the great city of columbus ohio but all throughout the nation in her various roles and certainly in her leadership in the congressional black caucus it is with a heavy heart that i stand on the floor of the house of representatives today and with great sadness acknowledge the pain and the suffering and extend my condolences to those who have suffered this great tragedy in orlando florida the worst mass shooting in the history of the united states of america it is a complicated shooting we understand that it most likely is an act of terror a hate crime of unspeakable proportions there are indications that the shooter may have some degree of mental illness and a history of domestic abuse the shooter appeared to have been in some measure on the fbis radar but you can add all those things up and there is still something that is missing that we here in congress have the capacity to deal with and that is the fact that one individual was able to purchase a weapon of mass destructionwhich should be reserved for war not the hunting of human beings in this great democratic republicand inflict death on 49 individuals and maim in ways that are inhumane to more than 50 others martin luther king jr once said in the end we will remember not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends during the 114th congress there have been more than 100 mass shootings we often come to the floor of the house of representatives and the speaker or one of his designees stands at the rostrum and asks us as members of the house to stand in a moment of silence and then we go on with business as usual having done nothing about the tremendous gun violence problem that we have in america the rest of the world is looking around and saying what are they doing in the united states of america five percent of the worlds population 50 percent of the worlds guns it is estimated that there are more than 300 million guns circulating throughout this great land the fbi and local law enforcement cant tell you where the overwhelming majority of them are because of legislative silence and malpractice this is an issue of course that has great impact on the african american community homicides are the leading cause of death through guns of younger african american men so we in the cbc view it as a public health crisis certainly for our community i think it is one that all americans should view as a health crisis for the entire country but the thing that is also troublingand we will have time to deal with this tragedyis hopefully we will be able to take some commonsense steps in the right direction including making sure that individuals who are on the terrorist watch list cant purchase weapons of mass destruction how complicated is that to do but the thing that is striking for many of us in the african american community is that when you look at some of the leading causes of deathheart disease being number one and then of course diabetes and childhood obesity being problematic certain forms of cancer hiv aids infectionmany of these illnesses these ailments that plague the neighborhoods that i represent in central brooklyn in bedfordstuyvesant in east new york in ocean hillbrownsville in canarsie and in the west end of coney island are preventable preventable by better exercise preventable by dealing with some of the environmental racism that many lowincome communities of color have been subjected to resulting in incredibly high rates of asthma and other forms of respiratory illness preventable by better diet senator booker recently said to many of usand this has stuck with methat more african americans in the united states of america die as a result of drivethroughs not drivebys that is because the diet the access to healthy food is limited the food deserts within which many african americans particularly at the lowest socioeconomic level are forced to reside in are scandalous so we in the congressional black caucus believe that we have to deal with these issues in a more meaningful comprehensive fashion i am thankful that back at home in the west end of coney island coney island cathedral one of the most important religious institutions in brooklyn is actively engaged in a public health campaign to deal with diabetes and heart disease and many of the other ailments that result from a poor diet that exists a lack of access to healthy food in the black community it is a campaign that we want to take across the nation we are thankful for the work that has been done by the congressional black caucus and by president obama through his leadership of the affordable care act we now know that over 20 million previously uninsured americans now have access to quality affordable health caredisproportionately african american that is a positive step in the right direction but instead of trying to dismantle this monumental step forward as house republicans have attempted to do more than 60 times over the last few years they have a clinical obsession with a law that has been declared constitutionalnot once but twiceby the united states supreme court lets figure out ways to come together as a nation despite our racial religious and ethnic differences to deal with the disparities that exist in the african american community and beyond and let us come together as a congress and as a nation to deal with the scourge of hate in its most recent form directed at the lgbt community down in orlando in such a horrific and invidious fashion we are better than this we can do much better here in the united states congress the congressional black caucus is here to lead the way on issues worked in partnership hand in hand with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle if they are just willing to meet us some of the way to deal with the issues of

majority are latinos some have immigrant parents and most will soon be eligible to vote all of them have one question for me it starts every q and a at every high school i visit the questions are about donald trump is he going to be our next president is it true that he wants to revoke our citizenship and deport us to the countries our parents came from is it true he wants to round us up mr gutirrez and deport us all it is very sad when the questions a congressman gets from american high school students are about how much they should fear their own government whether their own government is going to break up their families whether their own government is going to treat them not as citizens and as equal partners but as outsiders and pariahs in their own country when they hear that trump is leading in the polls they think that means there is a pretty good chance that he will be the next president when they see him on tv shows like jimmy fallon not to mention cnn and fox news they get the feeling that he is a celebrity that all of us in america admire when they hear that trump is hosting saturday night live not just being a guest but actually hosting even after saying mexican are mostly rapists criminals and drug dealersthey get the impression that calling whole groups of people rapists criminals and drug dealers based on their ethnicity or national origin is basically okay with us in america the real question these chicagoarea high school students have is hey gutierrez what are you going to do to defend us from donald trump what are you going to do to stand up for us this leads to an intense discussion about american politics and i ask the students right back what are you going to do to stand up for yourselves for your community look motivating 17 and 18yearolds to do something is not always easy including motivating them to register to vote when they are old enough and to actually go out and vote but when i ask these young americans whether they plan to get registered and vote every hand goes up in the classroom donald trump is spurring youth voter mobilization like i have never seen before nationally we know that 93 percent of latinos under the age of 18 are citizens of the united states and that every 30 seconds a latino citizen turns 18 that is about a million a year for the next decade or so if they are half as motivated as the young people i am talking to in chicago donald trump could have a tremendous impact on the youth vote in the coming election but lets be honest do we really want to motivate civic participation through fear of deportation racial profiling and families being broken up these are american teenagers growing up to distrust their government trump wants to take us back to the good old days of race relations which apparently means the 1950s when president eisenhower evicted millions of immigrants and unitedstates citizens from the united states dr carson who believes that human history is only about 5 000 years oldthat is what he says we have only been around 5 000 yearssays of mass deportation schemes i think its worth discussing here in the house we have considered measures to deport children more quickly to make groups more distrustful of the police and to delay homeland security funding testifying on one of these bills before the rules committee last year i made the unfortunate but real suggestion that republicans were gravitating toward mass deportation policies which provoked a response from the chairman mr sessions he said gutierrez there is no one in responsible republican leadership that has said we should deport 13 or 11 million people and i find it extremely distasteful that people would come here and suggest things that we have not suggested well now that people are suggesting mass deportation openly and are gaining in the public opinion polls in the republican party i wonder why there is so much silence from the republican members of this body but it is not just young latino voters in chicago that are being motivated by republican attacks when republicans attack planned parenthood and block laws to guarantee equal pay for women that motivates women to register and vote when republicans celebrate people who will not issue marriage licenses to two men or two women a lot of people in the lgbt community get motivated to register and vote when republicans rail against unions and block increases in the minimum wage while of course they earn 174 000 a year and block environmental standards and block sensible gun laws a lot of working class

to think about that bureaucrats hammering otherwise lawabiding americans with criminal penalties for regulatory violations at a time when the same administration is giving a free pass to millions of illegal aliens for breaking immigration laws giving early release to tens of thousands of prisonersviolent criminalsand turning loose radical islamic terrorists from guantanamo it is little wonder that my constituents are outraged and if it were up to this administration the problem would get worse not better to underscore that point we need only look at the federal register where agencies

to demand to know what we are doing here in congress to stop them from being crushed by this snowball of regulations part of the answer should be that current law requires an update twice a year on federal regulations being developed by federal agencies but guess what under this administration these updates have either been late or not issued at all and until now there hasnt been a way to hold these unelected bureaucrats accountable my bill does just that this bill forces the executive branch to make the american people aware of regulations that are coming down the track and it prohibits any regulations from going into effect unless and until detailed information on the cost of that regulationits impact on jobs and the legal bases for itis made available to the public for at least 6

predation to undermining financial stability first and perhaps most importantly both the base bill and many of the amendments we are considering today stab at the heart of the consumer financial protection bureau the sole regulator tasked with protecting students servicemembers seniors and other borrowers in the consumer lending marketplace to name just a few of the provisions that would harm the cfpb this bill would end the bureaus independent funding bog the cfpb down in gridlock by replacing its efficient director structure with a partisan bureaucratic commission halt the bureaus efforts to end forced arbitration clauses in credit card contracts and give consumers their day in court rescind the cfpbs guidance that helps to prevent racial and ethnic discrimination in automobile lending markets defund the bureaus efforts to stop predatory lending to borrowers looking to purchase a manufactured home and make it harder for the cfpb to bring enforcement actions against bad

tribute to a great stellar woman from northern california this cant be done in a 1minute speech so a little extra time is very very fitting in recognition of her work and her life in rising today i join with many northstate residents in honoring the life and legacy of isaac lowe an incredible woman and a prominent civil rights leader who passed away just a few weeks ago in redding california she was born in 1921 in wharton texas isaac was the second youngest of nine children learning early the importance of hard work she attended tillotson business college in austin texas and prairie view a m in prairie view it was during a visit to check up on a sick friend in california when she met her future husband vernon lowe whom she married soon after and started her family in redding california being an african american woman in the 1940s unfortunately racism was no stranger to isaac despite holding a business degree she was denied jobs because employers chose to judge her skin color rather than her impressive credentials isaac did not give up she started a catering business in redding and she eventually became the first black woman to be hired by the county of shasta working in social services for 17 years and helping others however isaacs most noble work was through her plight to advance racial equality in her own neighborhood upon first moving to redding all but one of the black families lived on the same street and were segregated from the community this was a status quo that she didnt accept isaac joined her husband in founding the redding chapter of the naacp and began her 65year journey of advocating for civil rights and worked very hard in order to hold onto that charter of the naacp when times got a little leaner back in the seventies she lobbied city and county lawmakers for safe and affordable housing for black families she worked with local school officials for the equal treatment of black children in the communitys mainly white schools she fought for fairness and justice under the law for all citizens in the judicial system she raised funds and successfully sought approval from city hall for the construction of the only martin luther king jr community center between sacramento and oregon at that time it was her compassionate advocacy and her resiliency that helped change shasta county for the better some of her most notable accomplishments included being the first black woman to serve on shasta countys grand jury where she served as a founding member of the shasta county citizens against racism and was awarded the redding citizen of the year in 1992 her proudest moment was in getting the redding city council members to recognize martin luther king day as a holiday her legacy speaks volumes of the person she was and of the impact she had on so many lives one of the anecdotes i know about her informally is that she was fairly commonly referred to as the rosa parks of redding california she was a deeply caring friend a loving wife and mother and a selfless advocate i had the chance to meet isaac personally on different occasionssome positive and one actually a very negative occasion but it was made positive by how the community responded to a very ugly racial incident that took place against a black family in their home many of us in the community joined together in a march in solidarity protesting that we were not going to tolerate this in our community in northern california isaac was there being strong but also being that smiling positive voice you could see her strength you could also see the light shining from within her as she advocated for what was right for everybody really at the end of the day if we had more people like her and if we had more harmony instead of the divisiveness that we see so badly affecting this country today we would be much better off northern california has lost a gem but her legacy will live on and we all recognize that i am honored to be able to note that here today on the unitedstates house floor and to properly show that her legacy even lives on in the papers she published and that are right over here in the library of congress which note some of her work in the past for the naacp indeed it is a rich legacy that reaches all the way to washington d c i appreciate my colleague from texas"], [0.9428286366164684, 0.05717136338353157, 1, "i rise in

the department of homeland security on the path to achieving agencywide interoperable communications almost 15 years ago courageous first responders raced to lower manhattan to an area that came to be known as ground zero in the days that followed first responders from neighboring jurisdictions including jersey city responded to help with response and recovery efforts not long after these devastating attacks concerns were raised about the interoperability gaps that existed between responders on that deadly september day the 9111 commission identified improving interoperable communications at all levels of government as a pressing recommendation they emphasized that both technology and governance are critical components of interoperable solutions and recognized dhs as the federal agency responsible for spearheading such an effort though nationwide over 13 billion has been invested in achieving interoperable communications at the state and local level we are still not there at dhs over 430 million has been invested into communication capabilities for its 123 000 radio users since 2003 however in 2012 the departments own top watchdog the office of inspector general found that dhs personnel do not have reliable interoperable communications for daily operations planned events and emergencies in may of 2014 the inspector general testified before the homeland security subcommittee that out of 479 field radios that attempted to communicate on a specific channel only one user could do so that is a 99 8 percent failure rate too often communication failures are attributed to technology or a lack of resources but here technology is not the culprit it is the scapegoat indeed the inspector general found that dhs had not established protocols to ensure that practices are in place to achieve interoperability throughout the department h r 615 the dhs interoperable communications act which i introduced with the gentlewoman from indiana congresswoman susan brooks the former chair of the emergency preparedness subcommittee would direct the under secretary for management to issue policies and directives related to interoperability develop a strategy to

undermines nearly two decades of progress making unitedstates fisheries profitable and sustainable a few weeks ago noaa reported that overfishing has hit an alltime low and the number of rebuilt

natural resources committee hearings on fisheries policies we heard from members and witnesses who were irate over the fact that the interior department was allowing offshore oil platforms and drilling rigs in the gulf of mexico to be decommissioned in a way that was killing red snapper and destroying important snapper habitat after intense questioning it became clear that in the current process for decommission rigs noaa which is part of the department of commerce is not regularly consulted by interior agencies as a result noaa does not even conduct surveys to determine if the department of the interior is about to dismantle a productive artificial reef teeming with red snapper and other fish mr chair i agree with my colleagues from the gulf states who feel this is
