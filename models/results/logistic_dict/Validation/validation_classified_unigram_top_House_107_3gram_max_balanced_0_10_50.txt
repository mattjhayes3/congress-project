i am going to have to go to the other side on this one and i want to explain why because i have great respect for him and the ability he has i noticed when i read his statement this morning he talked about the crown jewels that we were going to protect under this amendment i would agree with that if they were the crown jewels if we go back to the 1906 antiquities law and carry it out and find out where we are going those original ones truly did fit that category the grand canyon the zion the bryce and the others they are the crown jewels and we compliment teddy roosevelt for taking the time the initiative and having the enlightenment to come up with the idea of taking care of those crown jewels but now we find ourselves in an entirely different situation today what do we have on these crown jewels let me point out that we have a whole group of energy problems i do not think there is any intelligent person in america that does not realize we are going to have a tremendous energy problem it is going to be coal it is going to be natural gas we are talking about alternative sources and we get 2 percent that huge amount of 2 percent of alternative sources that everybody is talking about and then we have got coal at 52 percent now let me talk about one of these crown jewels my good friend from west virginia talked about on september 16 1996 standing safely on the south rim of the grand canyon president clinton got up and he declared that he was going to put 1 7 million acres into one of these crown jewels the interesting thing about it is that president clinton had never been there when he was asked where it was he put it in nevada though that is immaterial that is a little different than someone like teddy roosevelt who had lived on the ground who had been to the grand canyon who had hunted in the grand canyon had floated in the river had hiked those canyons he knew it from one inch to the other now do my colleagues know what the law says i thought we were bound by thelaw i thought it was necessary we follow the law we are a nation of laws yet this president comes along and he talks about the three things we are supposed to name in the 1906 antiquities law 1430 what are they one is a scientific site another is an archeological site like rainbow bridge obviously one another one is an historic site where the two trains came together that is obviously an historic site this is the first president and i have sat on this committee and chaired the subcommittee on parks and lands and now i am the chairman of the committeeon resources i cannot find a president who has violated that up to this point this president did not state any one of the three not one what is the next thing that the law says the law that we put our hand to the square and said we will uphold this law and the next part says this it says and he shall use the smallest acreage available to protect that site in the first place my colleagues president clinton did not name the site in the second place he gives us 1 7 million acres let me go back to the idea of energy what is in this area i asked john leshy the solicitor for the department of interior explain this beautiful area that president clinton is taking care of he did not know what he was talking about and i say that respectfully because he said where there is 1 trillion tons get that word trillion 1 trillion tons of low sulfur coal the best in the world right in the kaiparowits plateau have any of my colleagues been there it amazes me we are so good about talking about places but often my colleagues have never been there well i have been there my dad had mines on it as a private pilot i put airplanes down in the craziest places i repent for doingthat but all through that area and i can tell my colleagues without any equivocation if my colleagues like rolling hills of sagebrush and nothing else but hot dry land with bugs flying around that is twothirds of the grand staircase escalante twothirds of it is nothing but sagebrush but there is a trillion tons of low sulfur coal now we are talking about president carter who says our ace in the hole is coal and yet we say we cannot do that

subpoenaed the papers and we wrote a pamphlet called behind closed doors i do not have the quotes here i was at another meeting and just ran over and so i quote from memory these grounds do not deserve protection kathleen mcginty working for president clinton and al gore these grounds do not deserve protection yet we say they are crown jewels give me a break why are we doing this anyway

companies participating in the federal employees health benefit program in todays environment the federal government should be setting an example by holding its own contractors to accounting standards in a consistent manner not granting legislative waivers at the behest of insurance companies the accounting standards involved here are important they ensure that the government is not overcharged for labor and materials and not charged at all for certain unallowable costs like travel and entertainment they also ensure that the government pays only its fair share of things like depreciation of equipment and pension costs some insurers like blue cross blue shield argue that these cost accounting standards are burdensome and will cost them too much money to adopt that is really a very strange

today in strong support of my bipartisan legislation h r 163 the mortgage servicing clarification act this carefully written legislation addresses a specific problem for consumers and businesses involved in the mortgage servicing industry by simply clarifying the existing law governing mortgage servicing this uncontroversial bill enjoys the support of 12 cosponsors eight democrats and four republicans and has been approved for consideration under the suspension of the rules by both the chairman and the ranking member of the committee on financial services i introduced this bill to fix a problem in the mortgage servicing industry which has hampered the ability of this industry to serve its clients effectively and to conduct its business efficiently for too long currently when a mortgage servicing company acquires the rights to service a portfolio of home loans it is exempt from the unnecessary strictures of the fair debt collection practices act under the creditor exemption that was also extended to the originator of the mortgage the new mortgage servicer is extended this exemption because its relationship to the borrower is more like the relationship between a borrower and a lender than it is like the relationship between a borrower and a true collections agency the law already recognizes this reality however in the typical loan servicing portfolio transfer a small percentage of the loans acquired by a new servicer will inevitably be delinquent or technically in default at the time of transfer these loans are currently treated by the law as being subject to the fair debt collection practices act and subsequently the new servicers of these loans are required to provide certain form notices known as miranda warnings to the borrower the law also currently requires that in every subsequent contact both written and oral whether initiated by the servicer or the borrower the servicer is required to provide a shorter minimiranda notice disclosing that the communication is an attempt to collect a debt and that any information provided by the borrower will be used toward that end the purpose of these cookiecutter warnings is to prevent unscrupulous debt collectors from using false or misleading tactics such as a phony winning sweepstakes claim to trick consumers into divulging private financial information or personal details like their home address or their home phone number the fair debt collection practices act has worked extremely well in preventing bad actors in the debt collection business from using lies and deceit to harm consumers and this legislation would in no way prevent it from continuing to protect american consumers however as i have already mentioned mortgage servicers are not like debt collectors their role to consumers is much more like that of a mortgage originator and in the context of a mortgage servicing transfer these miranda notices are both detrimental to consumers and unnecessary and inefficient for mortgage servicers operations first the notice misleads the borrower about the nature of the relationship between him or her and the new servicer unlike true debt collectors mortgage servicers have a longterm relationship with their client and these harshly worded notices often have the effect of discouraging a borrower who is slightly late on a mortgage payment from contacting their new servicer for fear that the servicer is a true thirdparty debt collector this ends up frustrating the servicers efforts to work with delinquent borrowers on developing strategies to bring their loans current and keep their credit ratings intact a mortgage servicers biggest hurdle in helping delinquent borrowers to help themselves is getting them on the phone and these threatening miranda notices only contribute to that unnecessary fear without doing anything to help the borrower additionally the information protected by the miranda notice is information already in the servicers possession so nothing new is truly protected by requiring these additional legalistic and threatening notices be provided finally these warnings simply make consumers feel unnecessarily defensive and antagonistic toward their new servicer during the first step of their new association which can have a chilling effect on the rest of their relationship mortgage servicers typically send these miranda notices along with a new customers welcome letter as required by the real estate settlement procedures act and this letter also includes important consumer information about the new servicer and the borrowers monthly payment arrangements this preliminary contact is the first opportunity that a servicer has to create a positive relationship with a new client and the harsh language used in the miranda warning can create animosity between the servicer and the borrower where none need exist additionally because the minimiranda is required in all subsequent contacts they can continue for decades even after customers bring their loans current and keep them that way for years h r 163 resolves this problem by creating a narrow exemption from miranda notices for the servicers of federally related first lien mortgages whose primary function is servicing current loans not collecting thirdparty debts it exempts these servicers only from the miranda notices leaving all other borrower protections required by the fair debt collection practices act in place this legislation is consistent with a longstanding recommendation from the federal trade commission to improve the mortgage servicing process i urge my

simply will not go along and then we will leave this place with nothing done the physicians uniquely suffered a 5 percent cut last year and if there is anything we can do to enable the administration to follow ordinary administrative procedures to prevent an additional cut we should do it we do not know this will work but we do know because we have been trying that the senate will not agree to a package and we have not been able to negotiate that package so if we follow the gentlemans proposal that we come back with his package to recommit they will just not accept it and we will be nowhere
