ability to meet crdtical domestic needs and foreign responsibilities i stand united with the president and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in our commitment to win the war against iraq and take all necessary steps to defeat terrorism and preserve national security both at home and abroad however despite the many new security and economic challenges confronting us the war and our homeland protection efforts shouid not and need not shortchange our domestic priorities we can win the war against iraq and terrorism without raiding social security and medicare and without increasing the national debt yet this republican budget resolution would accomplish just the opposite two years ago the administration and congress were looking covetously at a staggering 5 6 trillion cumulative surplus through 2010 at the time congress was continually reassured by the administration that we could afford an enormous tax cut ensure the solvency of social security and medicare pay down the national debt fund our domestic priorities and still have a large reserve fund for unanticipated emergencies like many of my colleagues i cautioned the administration at the time that its budget and enormous tax cut were based on unrealistic surplus projections that would never materialize earlier this year the congressional budget office cbo confirmed that in less than 2 years the 10year projected surplus has been erased while portions of this decline are a result of our efforts to defeat terrorism and preserve national security both at home and abroad the depletion of the surplus to date was largely caused by the fiscally irresponsible policies o1 2001 the additional 1 3 trillion in tax cuts much of which are due to excluding dividends from taxation that the administration and the republican leadership propose would only worsen our current situation and lead us further down the path bf mounting deficits and escalating public debt to pay for the additional lax cuts the republicans budget resolution would raid the entire 2 2 trillrn social security trust fund to cover deficit in the rest of the federal budget over the next 10 years moreover the projections used to frame this budget are overly optimistic they do not include the cost of the administrations plan to permanently extend several expiring lax cuts which would add 100 billion to the deficit between 2004 and 2013 in addition this budget omits the cost of extending relief from the selling individual alternative minimum tax amt beyond 2005 without amt relief the number of taxpayers subject to it will soar from 2 million today to over 43 million by 2013 the projections also leave out an assessment of the enormous cost of the current war and the subsequent costs of occupation which could last for a number of years the disappearance of the 10year surplus compels us to consider not just a 1year but also a longterm budget plan congress and the american people have the right to know how the republican leadership proposes to restore fiscal discipline while enacting additional multiyear tax cuts boosting spending for the military and meeting commitments to a growing number of retirees furthermore i find it incredibly irresponsible that the majority continues to pursue large fax cuts while shortchanging important domestic priorities congress should devise budgetary rules that make tax cuts contingent on the realization of specified targets for the budget surplus and the federal debt unfortunately this budget fails on all those accounts moreover this budget would cut domestic appropriations by 244 billion over 10 years below the amount needed to maintain services at the 2003 level remarkably the funding levels in this budget are 115 3 billion lower than the level in the presidents budget which many members on both sides of the aislethought was too low further it would require cuts of 265 billion over 10 years in programs such as medicaid veterans benefits student loans housing assistance and pensions and benefits for federal employee this budget also fails to provide funds for necessary infrastructure improvements or help hardpressed states and localities meanwhile it provides an inadequate prescription drug benefit and underfunds other key priorities without reaching balance until 2012 instead i plan to support the democratic alternative that would eliminate the unfair costly tax cuts for the rich and would provide targeted tax rebates to working families as well as additional funding for expanded unemployment benefits for laid off workers assistance for states and localities and necessary infrastructure projects it would also provide greater funding for medicare prescription drugs education housing homeland security and other vital domestic programs this alternative would provide an immediate boost to the economy and crate thousands of jobs without aggiavating our longterm deficits the need to respond to new shortterm needs is no excuse for ignoring the longterm problems we already have ultimately deficits do matter it is time that we all take the deleriorating budget outlook seriously we need to ensure that the burden of todays fiscal policies is not placed on the shoulders of our children and grandchildren this is a matter el fiscal stewardship and generational responsibility and we must address it without delay i urge my colleagues to reject this misguiddd budget and to develop one that will ensure security at home and abroad without dramatically increasing our debt borrowing against social security and medicare or abandoning our commitments to children workers senior citizens and all americans"], [5.91278076171875e-05, 0.9999408721923828, 1, "i thank the gentlewoman for yielding me this time i

manufacturing jobs this country is facing incredible confusion with the new medicare bill and seniors are sorting through 50 medicare cards to get a 10 or 15 percent discount while drug prices go up 15 or 20 percent a year yet we are here today to debate issues which have already passed in the house and bills that clbarly will not make a dent in the problem of the uninsured the 40 some million uninsured instead of debating proven solutions solutions that we know will work but solutions that just might they just might hurt the drug industry and the insurance industry they might be bills the insurance companies do not like instead of working onbills that expand access to health insurance the republican leadership haschoseir topat itself on the back they are frittering away the cover the uninsured week by reconsidering bills which have already passed this house bills that cater to the insurance industry some of the biggest contributors to president bush and the republican party bills that give away the federal treasury to the drug industry industries that give tens of millions of dollars to republican leadership and to president bush and bills that help the hmo industry by sheltering them from liability these bills will not necessarily reduce the number of uninsured but we know they will undermine hardfought state insurance laws they will cover some small number of employers at the expense of others they will provide tax shelters to people who already have coverage and they will perpetuate the type of highdeductible coverage that actually discourages people from seeking preventive care republican leadership will spend this week cover the uninsured week trying to cull out the uninsured issue so they can hand out more tax breaks to their hmo and insurance companies and prescription drug company contributors and butter up more of their campaign contributors the presidents budget does not spend a dime on the uninsured but it will cut 24 million from the medicaid program clearly a program that works and which has helped millions of americas elderly and poor families the presidents plan will increase the number of uninsured my republican colleagues would also cut the medicaid program by billions stripping health insurance coverage from the most vulnerable among us so let me see the republican bills protect the drug companies and the hmos from harm they cause their patients they destabilize the entire small group insurance market to buck state insurance laws and they give tax breaks to the already insured i am sure none of this has anything to do with the fact this is an election year president bush is out raising 200 million republican leadership istrying to equal that amount of money and so much of it comes from the drug industry the insurance industry and the hmos now this is my republican friends response to the fact that 43 million people in this country are uninsured it is outrageous that we are voting for a second time on these issues it is not just futile frankly it is shameful the other side of the aisle were talking about the malpractice crisis for physicians which is very real in many places the gentlewoman from

from one of my constituents it says dear janice schakowsky our government should stand for basic fairness and justice thats why i do not understand why families earning between 10 000 and 26 000 per year would be excluded from receiving the 400 per child tax refund that wealthier families will receive this summer just so millionalres can get bigger tax cuts as a constituent i ask you to please amend president bushs unfair tax cut plan to include these poor families and their 12 million kids to leave the tax cut as it is brings too much shame upon this great nation sincerely my constituent is correct this is a shameful moment in our great nation and we should not rest until we undo the tremendous wrong committed by the republican leadership and the bush administration this is no time for business as usual this is a time to reverse the damage done by the disgusting choices made by our colleagues on the other side of the aisle there are those who may tell us that the decision to leave 12 million children in lowincome working families on the cutting room floor was just a mistake but that would be a lie as the washington post editorialized yesterday stiffing these children was not a lastminute oversight or the unfortunate result of an unreasonably tight 350 billion ceiling in fact this was a deliberate meanspirited action committed in the name of protecting special interests instead of our nations children in fact a house republican ways and means committee spokesperson confessed that well adjustments had to be made let us be clear about what happened behind closed doors republican leaders got together with the administration and decided who was going to be thrown overboard and who would be brought to shore there were no democratic members in that room there were certainly no children or working families in the room and the decision was made to throw children and working families including military families overboard and to save the dividend tax cuts for millionaires while restoring the ability of corporations to unpatriotically stash their profits in bermuda compassion for millionaires and corporate traders contempt for lowincome children and their parents as warren buffett has said if this is class warfare then my class is winning there are other winnersbesides warren buffett not surprisingly the bush cabinet members who worked so hard to sell this tax cut jobkilling bill are also winners according to a report just completed by the committee on government reform minority staff vice president dick cheney the presidents key tax negotiator will reap 116 002 a year from the dividend capital gains provisions in this bill john snow secretary of the treasury will get over 332 000 a year donald rumsfeld who gave vice president cheneys former company halliburton a multimilliondollar sweetheart contract wins big too as much as 604 000 a year no wonder they all worked so hard tosell such a defective product we know who the winners are and now we know at least some of the losers 12 million children and working families in my state of illinois nearly one in four children 674 000 children in 378 000 families were tossed aside so that cabinet secretaries billionaires and corporations like enron could be protected we were not given time to read the republican tax cut jobkilling bill before the vote and i do not blame my colleagues for trying to push their bill through before we and the american public could learn what it included i would be ashamed too if i decided to give cabinet members wealthy members of congress and rich campaign contributors life jackets rather than women and children and no wonder the members on my side of the aisle were not given an opportunity to offer even one single amendment what if we had learned the truth and tried to correct it now we have learned the truth and ft is time to right an incredible wrong bob herbert labeled this as a quintessential example of what the bush administration and its legislative cronies are about the fat cats will get their tax cuts but in the new american plutocracy there wont even be crumbs left over for the working folks at the bottom of the pyramid to scramble after now the actions of the bush administration and republican tax decisionmakers are out in the open and now it is our responsibility to act by passing the rangeldelauro bill

would be no reason for us to address this issue tonight had the republicans not deliberately ignored the wellbeing of 12 million children in its latest tax law the omission of a provision that would have extended a 400 child tax credit to working families making 10 000 to 26 000 a year was neither an accident nor an oversight the provision which had not been included in president bushs initial 726 billion proposal or the house republicans 550 billion version was added in the other body by democratic senator blanche lincoln now why did this considerably small provision 3 5 billion out of a giant 350 billion tax bill make the republicans chopping block well anyone who has followed things around the house over the last couple of years unfortunately knows the answer to that question this house the peoples house under the republican majority has been turned over to the powerful and the privileged week in and week out the republican leadership neglects middle and lowerincome americans republicans have a chance tonight to begin to rectify that image first my motion instructs the house conferees to include in the conference report a provision in the senate bill that provides immediate pay ments to the 6 5 million working and military families who were initially left out of the republicans 2003 tax bill house democrats are fighting to immediately enact the bipartisan senatepassed bill so we can help the 12 million children that republicans left behind now i think it is outrageous that it has been more than 3 months since the senate overwhelmingly passed a measure 94 to 2 to immediately give an increased child tax credit to the millions of children previously left out if the house republicans truly wanted to fix this injustice they would have immediately approved the senate measure my motion simply instructs them to do just that so that we can be fair to these working families and provide them the same benefits that many other americans received this summer the second part of my motion instructs the conferees to include in the conference report a provision included in the senate bill that provides families of military personnel serving in iraq afghanistan and other combat zones a child credit based on the earnings of the individual serving in the combat zone the house republican bill contains bad news for the children of the 200 000 men and women serving in iraq or other combat zones the republican bill leaves in place current law under which families will face tax increases because combat pay is not counted for purposes of the child tax credit now let me give an example of what i mean here let us take an e5 sergeant with 6 years of service and two children who is paid 29 000 a year generally both of his children would be entitled to the full 1 000 tax credit but if he is over in iraq for 6 months his credit would drop to 450 under the house bill now how can we take a critical benefit away from the family of a soldier who is now over in iraq risking his life third the motion instructs the house to include in the conference report all of the other provisions of the senate bill and not report back a conference report that includes additional tax benefits not offset by other provisions if my colleagues have noticed in the senate bill the 3 5 million for the child tax credit addition is fully offset house republicans i believe are exploiting the child tax credit provision passed and even more tax cuts that will saddle our children with mountains of debt the house republican bill costs more than 80 billion while only 3 5 billion is needed to make sure that these children and their families are treated fairly and that is fully offset as i said in the senate bill i think it is based on a customs duty or a customs tax in other words it does not add any money at all to the federal deficit now the house action is particularly reckless and irresponsible considering the republicans tax policies have already produced a record 400 billion deficit that continues to climb r think it is almost 500 billion at this point fourth to the maximum extent possible within this bill in the conference the house conferees are instructed to include in the conference report other tax benefits for military personnel as well as the families of the astronauts who died in the columbia disaster and the fifth section of the motion instructs conferees to as soon as practicable after the adoption of this motion meet in open session with the senate conferees and the house conferees should then file a conference report consistent with this motion no later than 2 legislative days from today this is the 21st motion to instruct that my democratic colleagues and i have brought to this house attempting to bring right this wrong i have personally been here many times to argue this same or a similar motion how many nights will we democrats have to come to this floor to fight for the 12 million children of lowincome parents who were neglected by the republicans in their latest tax bill i have to say i am the father of three children and i received a 1 200 check 400 for each of the three children it pains me to think based on my income as a congressman that many of my constituents who have one three or more children were not able to get that 400 per child because they certainly need it a lot more than me this neglect on the part of the republicans has to come to an end this evening it is simply a question of fairness how can republicans say it is fair to give a millionaire a tax break or a congressman a tax break while giving nothing to millions of working families it 1 i time for the republican majority tu join us in passing this motion to instruct conferees so we can finally resolve

hispanic community has been hit the hardest with a rising unemployment rate of 7 5 percent compared to 6 percent for the general population people want to work but the jobs are simply not there instead of pursuing policies to stimulate the economy and create jobs the administration and the congressional majority have pushed through a plan that includes a tax cut that does nothing to address any of these financial problems and worries that are facing millions in this country while making false promises to create jobs and stimulate our economy these tax cuts are targeted primarily at large corporations and the wealthiest of americans those that are earning 1 million a year will see a tax cut of over 100 000 half of all latinos in this country report having an annual household income of under 30 000 under the bush tax plan some of these wealthy 4ndividuals will see a tax break that equals three times what these families make a year we understand that people who pay taxes deserve a break but we have gone from record surpluses to skyrocketing deficits we cannot meet our obligations to support critical health and education programs and a tax cut this size does not make any sense whatsoever we have chosen also not to pay for the war we have chosen to put it on the backs of not only those that are our young people out there defending our country but on the backs of their children we now also find that in addition to favoring the wealthiest of this country the administrations tax plan excludes those who need the assistance the most low and moderateincome families families making between 10 500 and 26 625 a year are now under law excluded from collecting the 400 child tax credit those who could benefit the most from the tax credit will in fact get nothing 1

affected by the tax burden while 85 percent of latino males are in the workforce the largest percentage for any ethnic group in the country many hispanics work in seasonal lowwage jobs and the majority of hispanics do not participate in the employersponsored retirement plans nor do they own stock how can the administration argue that this plan helps working men and women when working

priorities include education health care housing child care transportation worker safety and protection and business development it would immediately repeal tax cuts for the upperincome brackets and

that are facing not only our economy but our childrens future i guess i would have to start since this is budget time and as we are here on the floor simultaneously the committee on the budget is meeting to try to work out this 2 4 trillion budget that the president has sent here to the hill i must say to my colleagues that it is important on behalf of americans on behalf of working americans and on behalf of individuals that are unemployed in our country that we make the right decisions not only for the future but for today i can tell you that i am very very concerned about the direction we are going in right now of members just following this white house with what they send us we are trying to do the same thing with what they send us as we just rubber stamp it and send it through we cannot allow that to happen under this budget the reason we are in trouble today is it relates to just under 3 million jobs that have been lost and americans out of work as we speak today it is important for us to remember that we still have a health care plan that we have to put forth not only for americans but also to allow small businesses to be able to provide a health care plan for americans who do not have it i will tell you right now for those that do have it in many cases their contribution is so high and it is continuing to grow it is just really getting out of hand but being a creature of the state legislature where i used to be for some 8 years in the state of florida i cannot help but stand here on behalf of state legislators throughout the country democrats and republicans independents and nonparty members of the legislatures throughout this country need representation here in the unitedstates house of representatives and also local government nonpartisan local government members partisan local government members need a voice here in the capital and not only a voice but they need action i will tell you i came to the floor this afternoon just to share a few things with my colleagues so that they do not think that this is just a kendrickmeek report and there are a few meeks out there that are a little disgruntled as it relates to the presidents budget that falls short of a good vision for our country let me just make a case in point i could not help this morning when i knocked the dew off the paper here in the capital city i could not help but find that the national association of state legislatures that i was a member of for 8 years is a bipartisan group that is legislators come together to make sure that states are not left behind and that they are able to put forth the best government possible for their particular state and i could not help but see this article that is on the federal page of the washington post today and it says presidents unfunded mandates criticized group says that states face huge bills now i want to make sure that the american people understand what i am talking about when the president says that he wants to make his tax cuts permanent he speaks very passionately about making tax cuts permanent on behalf of the most wealthy americans now i think we can all be under the umbrella as it relates to middleclass tax cuts as it relates to child credit as it relates to tax cuts that are helping small businesses but when you start looking at the big tax cut for the wealthiest americans i do mean the individuals who are not knocking on the doors saying i need a tax cut we are giving it to them and we are giving it to them at the detriment of our education system this points out leaving no child behind as an unfunded mandate to states i think it is very very important for us to remember that it is okay to talk about standards because that is free we can hand standards down to state governments and they can hand standards down to local school boards that will then impose them on children nothing wrong with that under a plan that is going to work but that makes that very problematic for hardworking teachers and for students that are trying to achieve this goal and for legislators that are trying to put together a budget because states that do not have the luxury that we have here in washington d c where we will just put it on the charge card we will forestall it off to another generation or this generation to pay it later because we want to be the ice cream and cake congress or ice cream and cake administration at a time of war and at a time that we are looking at the deficit that is i must say 520 billion in change that is going to continue to happen or continue to roll out unless we stop this president now as it relates to his budget and do not make these tax cuts permanent let me take an excerpt from this article today in the washington post the presidents budget next year will increase the burdens to states 34 billion according to the report made public in a news conference at the national council of state legislators in their winter leadership meeting in washington d c accusing the federal government of cost shifting that is not just something that they are saying it is for real accusing the federal government of cost shifting utah house peaker stevens who is a republican i must add president of the national council of state legislators said we have seen increases in practice of these recent years and we are concerned that this is going to get worse let me tell you ladies and gentlemen there is no way in the world that state governments that are facing a 78 billion deficit across the country are going to close that gap if we are thinking about the wealthiest americans we cannot shore up the social security trust fund and making sure that we are able to provide social security the promise that we made to so many americans if we make these tax cuts permanent now the president is saying that the tax cuts are going to help the economy well i beg to differ because right now we are looking at a job loss of 3 million jobs just under 3 million jobs and he would have to go north of that number to even be able to show an increase so since the great depression no president like this one under his watch has actually seen this kind of job loss and i think it is important that we take very close note to what this situation is not only to us as americans adult americans but to our children people talk about our childrens children i think it is also important that this article talks about we like to pass things that sound good li 1630 we want to pass clearer skies i doubt if there will be funding we have already passed the leave no child behind which states are now saying that the federal government as it recommends the federal commitments we have done just that we have left children behind we like to talk about the war on terror i must say the effort on terror because wars are very costly and i think it is very very important that we remember and especially as it relates to my colleagues who were just on the floor commending the president and the justification on behalf of the whole iraq experience let me just say this it is important that we support our troops our troops are going to do what they are told to do rightfully so the commanderinchief is the leader but i will tell you that as americans we have to pay very close attention to what one may do to take the attention off of the real agenda and i will tell you time after time again if you watch the president as he moves throughout the country and has press conferences and things of that nature we talk about standards he talks about standards he talks about the fact that he is compassionate towards seniors and veterans and all of the soft music that may be in thebackground as it relates to his speeches but i will tell you in the real world that is not the case we are leaving the troopss children and their parents and their loved ones that are over there with sand in their teeth in iraq or afghanistan or in haiti behind it is important that we have remember and we look at the fine print here we have veterans that are waiting 3 months to get a prescription filled through the va now i do not fault the good people who are trying to work with what they have at the va but i wish that the president and i wish that this congress would move forth in this budget to make sure that the va can cut that in half concurrent receipt i am so glad that my colleagues on the democratic side had enough gumption to be able to pull a bill up to this floor to allow a veteran that is disabled so they do not have a veterans t x of taxing them while they are disabled and a veteran at the same time this leadership is important i want to make sure that the american people do not feel that this is some sort of partisan argument against the president i will tell you individuals will have their opportunity to stand in judgment of this administration in the coming months but i will tell you this as members of congress it is very important that articles like this where you have republican members of the state legislature saying that we are shifting the cost to them and when we cut the federal commitment which when we give this huge tax cut that has already been given to the most wealthy americans that there will be no money to respond to the states now how this works in the real world when you have 78 billion in deficit throughout the country then what do the states do do they raise taxes nine times out of ten they do not they increase fees your drivers license costs a little bit more for individuals that are in coastal states registration for your boat may go up a little bit more for individuals that buy hunting licenses throughout this country sportsmen they pay more for their hunting license because the wildlife officers or the wildlife commission their budget is going to be cut so when that happens what happens to the counties our counties they were just up here well the cities were up here and i am going to get to them in a minute our counties were just up here recently and they were so very very concerned they are thinking that help is on the way and that they are going to get some sort of relief they look to the states for relief the states are not going to give them the dollars that they used to give them rightfully so what they should do so they can put forth the function to be able to make sure their residents taxpaying americans are able to have some level of government services or some level of police services or fire services or homeland preparedness that is not going to happen you make these tax cuts permanent for the most wealthy americans this country is going to continue to see what this speaker said the president of the senate of utah said that we are concerned it is going to get worse so basically if we do not listen to the chairman of the national conference of state legislators make his arguments it is almost like this congress taking out a carton of milk and taking a smell of it and saying wow it is spoiled let me put it back in the refrigerator maybe it will be fresh tomorrow we do know that is not going to happen i feel so bad for my colleagues that are deficit hawks it must be very difficult to come up with an argument of where we can kind of cut this deficit in half how can you do it when you have got a president that is willing to say let us make sure that we make the tax cuts permanent and the more taxes you pay the more money you should get that may sound good in a speech but in reality you have americans receiving on average somewhere maybe 50 300 in rebate and then you have millionaires receiving thousands hindreds of thousands of dollars so that they can go on and do the things that they do and it does not help the economy whatsoever job growth let us just talk about that for a minute because it is important since we have themed this special order totalk about states talk about counties talk about local governments talk about school boards about how the devolution of taxes will end up affecting every americans life let us talk about that for a minute the president said hang in there he was talking to some workers the other day just hang in there a little longer it will be okay it is going to work itself out i must beg to differ with the president because i feel this is the sour milk scenario once again let us put it back in the refrigerator maybe it will be fresh tomorrow we know it will not be the evidence is not there to justify the economic backing of what the president may feel as it relates to giving more tax cuts my colleague the gentleman from texas on the other side of the aisle the republican leader last year he said there is nothing better the government can do i am paraphrasing than at a time of war than to give tax cuts cake and ice cream we can not do that we are supposed to be the responsible ones members of congress who know better should do better and unless we stop marching in lockstep i must say on the democratic side that is not the case but on the republican side there seems to be a sense of pride that we need to just kind of hide behind this administration saying that it is okay but it is not okay for us to get to the top of where we were i must adjust 32 years ago looking at surpluses now we have the largest deficit in the history of the country how did we get here in such a short time let us just give the tax cuts to the most wealthy individuals just put it this way 56 percent of the tax cuts under the bush plan is to the most wealthy americans now i am not standing here saying i do not like individuals who are able to do the things they do but these are the wealthiest of the wealthy and it is very very important for those of us that are here and have the power to do so bring about the kinds of change that this countrydeserves now let me just say as it relates to the jobs the 3 million jobs lost the administration has changed the forecast 3 times well we are going to be here by this day no i am soriy we will be here by this day no we will be here by this day just to try to get some sort of goal that could be met and it is just not adding up and i will tell you that it is very very important that we remember that as members of congress that we stand on behalf of what is right for the country not just because administration and the vice president comes here and he gets over here in the side room and the next thing you know you havemembers on the other aisle walking back in feeling very beat down and well i guess i got to go here and be with the home team well the home team has gotten us into a 3 million job deficit the largest deficit in the history of the country and climbing we have state legislators that are saying oh my goodness they are shifting the burden over to us and this budget alone the next year increased burdens will be on the states on top of what i am telling you right now will be 34 billion that is not change that is real money what is going to happen to you american people that are working every day that are taking care of your family every day that are doing all the things that this country has asked you to do to make us strong your children they go to school every day they are trying to make their lives better every day they have hopes of going to college one day but what we are doing here and what this administration what the bush administration is putting on this country right now is very very unfortunate and i am sorry to say it dangerous economically and our democracy depends on a strong economy now i will tell you that when the states make their budgets obviously they have to look at cuts their commitment is going to cut to local government that means that the feeding program in your local community is going to probably end up reaching the ax here in the federal in this budget we cut the cops program putting community police officers in communities to what prevent crime not respond to it but prevent it that is cut you think the states are going to be able to pick up that burden of course not then you look at programs as it relates to your quality of life parks and recreations that builds character in our communities throughout america what has going to happen there maybe the summer program may not be there for your child it does not matter what community you live in i am not talking about chicago even though that would be an issue i am not talking about los angeles even though that would be an issue i am not talking about just miami and just my district because the state commitment has been cut because the federal commitment has been cut to be able to allow tax breaks permanent on behalf of the most wealthy americans i am not just talking about those cities i am talking about youngstown ohio i am talking about small cities like ocala florida i am talking about towns and villages that count on state dollars to be able to help make and provide the good services on behalf of their constituents let us talk about cities well cities they count on counties they counts on state governments they count on the federal government the cities were up here last week which was quite interesting and i took the time to listen to their arguments and i will tell you right now the cities are very concerned about the direction that we have continued to head in they want homeland dollars we talk about homeland security here in washington yes it is a good thing i am on the select committee on homeland security yes that is a very important committee we have an appropriations subcommittee on homeland security but let me tell you where the front line security takes place that is in our cities and that is in our counties and that is in our small towns and i will tell you right now they are hurting and they are feeling the pinch now you may in a speech made by the president or by some members on the other side defending the presidents policies of 3 years of not really a job growth and then when you see a job growth it is about that big and then we start talking about trying to get mcdonalds and burger king to recategorize to make it manufacturing jobs to try to add on to say okay we have a nice little stack there now of jobs look what i have done this is so very very important that we remember that we cannot allow this to happen what the president has put forth in this budget of making these tax cuts permanent now i think it is important as we look at homeland security or homefront security we have police departments right now that need equipment we have already taken the cops program and snatched that rug out from under them the most positive and aggressive program of preventing crime in this country in a very long time and because we have taken those dollars away police chiefs and sheriffs are hurting right now they are responding to crime in many cases they are not preventing it i will tell you right now i guarantee you i do not even have to take a poll i do not have to call cnn or msnbc or any of the networks or the talking heads that are on 24 hours and i guarantee you walk up to any american and you can ask them this question one do you want to prevent crime or do you want crime to happen and be reported and as we start looking at this bad trend of the bush administration of fighting on behalf of the wealthiest americans that is going to continue to happen crime will go up police chiefs are going to have to work with what they have on behalf of providing the very safety that americans deserve in big and large cities so when we talk about tax cuts and act like it is really not anything that affects americans it does let us talk about what is happening as relates to property taxes because of our efforts here or lack thereof to stop the bush administration on this tax cut for the wealthiest americans we have a bad situation as it relates to being able to stop property taxes from going up when we talk about local commitment what is happening as this devolution of taxation as we continue to move down and putting these unfunded mandates on that the state legislatures are saying that we are local communities have to raise taxes property taxes of homeowning americans let me just share this with you for me to stand here as a member of congress i have never raised taxes on the american people when i was in the state legislature i never raised taxes on floridians for us to be able to say in the county well we do not want to raise taxes but i shared it with you earlier in my presentation that they come in the form of fees of increasing fees need a new tag or hunting license or fishing license things of that nature this is kind of invisible what happens in local governments you all of the sudden see the rate of your property taxes go up because they have no choice this is the last area to pass the buck city and county governments and it is very unfortunate very unfortunate that we put those local governments in that position as we are up here in washington speaking here on this floor there are local governments right now scratching their heads wondering how they are going to meet a budget how are they going to be able to provide the services to americans so while we are putting 50 200 300 in a tax cut they are taking 500 600 1 000 out of everyday americans pockets as it relates to property taxes because they do not have what we have i am going to tell you i am very disappointed as it relates to this it is really bad to be a member of the congrdss and say you are a member of the 108th congress that oversaw the largest deficit in the history not in recent years in the history of this democracy of the republic i am so happy because i am glad that there is some sort of difference here as it relates to the budget and how members feel we have a republican and a democratic side and i will tell you my colleagues on the republican side i feel for them because for them to try to figure out how they are going to make an argument and not offend the administration i know that job is getting more difficult every day and it is so very very important we let the american people know how their local property taxes are being increase4 how their local police services are being decreased not because local government is saying we want to cut community policing we are saying it because we want to stand up on behalf of the wealthiest americans i will tell you this i am very proud of the democratic side of this congress that believes in middleclass tax cuts but as it relates to these wealthiest floridians wealthiest americans that are celebrating an administration that stands up on behalf of giving them big tax cuts towards the detriment of local government and americans that are trying to work every day so it is not adding up i continue to see article after article of failed attempts by this administration to try to get this economy moving in the right direction that is creating jobs that is not a jobless economy i will tell you this one member of congress along with several other members on the democratic side we are very concerned not only concerned we are willing to take action if given the opportunity to put this country in the right direction let us look at this this deficit fn trade new york times today it is not just me a kendrik meek report this is a report a reputable newspaper here in this country deficit in trade tops 43 billion let me just say this we give the administration too much credit we give them too much credit and i will tell you i think on the republican side it is time to start asking the tough questions it is time to start taking some action or the american people will stand in judgment of all of us and those that are willing to stand on behalf of the american people everyday working americans not just the wealthiest americans that are celebrating this tax cut and the president speaks so passionately about you would assume he would talk about he would go and say well on behalf of no child left behind we have to fully fund that you would assume that this president would knock down the door to try to fight on behalf of dollars to be able to go to local governments and provide teachers with the things that they need to educate our children better yet we speak passionately about making sure that we make the tax cuts permanent outsourcing jobs like i said we cannot give the administration the credit or this congress as some members of this congress as though they are the authority and they have a good track record there is no good track record if there was one i would not be able to stand here on this house floor speaking to my colleagues speaking to the american people in the way that i am speaking right now i can speak with great evidence and great backing of how states are concerned about the direction that we are going in how we are cutting the federal i keep saying it the federal commitment to local governments and cutting the federal commitment to the american people i will tell you as we define in the coming months with this being an election year yes people will do things that they ordinarily would not do but i will tell you one thing that has been consistent the fact that the president has said that these tax cuts to the wealthiest americans will help the economy has not happened three million jobs lost that is a long way to go to say that you created something and i will tell you this it is very very important very very important in this budget time that this congress not just my friends on the democratic side but my friends on the republican side it is time for some members of this congress to go see the wizard and get some courage on behalf of the american people who allowed us to be a part of this congress remember members of the 108th congress here in this unitedstates house and in the other body history will reflect on the fact that we oversaw and the republicancontrolled congress i must add oversaw the largest deficit in the history of this country that children will have to pay that living americans will have to pay for a very very very long time i cannot help but get off of this wealthiest americans getting this tax cut that the president wants to make permanent it just does not add up with all the needs that we have efforts against terrorism efforts to be able to make sure that we provide or we talk about the terrorism we talk about our troops being able to have a good national defense but how about those individuals that have served how about those veterans how about those individuals that wore the uniform how about those members of the american legion how about those individuals that are out doing community service like the shriners and others that are veterans in this country and they are being stepped upon they are being stepped upon because they are being devalued as it relates to the commitment that they should have from this white house yes there are some members of congress that have now said okay mr president i am sorry i know you want to fight on behalf of the wealthiest americans but we have these veterans and they are in my district and we are going to have to do something about it republicans came together with some very courageous democrats that put forth a bill a member from florida put forth a bill but could not get it up under a republicancontrolled congress democrats came together to be able to provide that opportunity so that hopefully we can do some things about concurrent receipt which is the tax on veterans remember i said earlier about how we pass it on in fees and different things that may take place like delays on being able to see an ophthalmologist at a va center having backlogs at va centers continue to increase instead of decrease if we are really honoring and standing towards the commitment of americans that have allowed us to be able to celebrate the very freedom that we live under and breathe under today police officers i cannot help but have a level of compassion towards police officers that are out there making 30somethingthousand a year carrying a weapon protecting our communities protecting our highways i used to be a state trooper i was a state trooper in florida for 5 years i know what it means not to have what you need to have to be able to provide the protection that you raised your right hand and said that you would do and put the other one on the bible i will tell you that it is important that we do not leave them behind so when we look at these efforts of this white house to send a 2 4 trillion budget to this congress that is making tax cuts permanent on behalf of the wealthiest floridians i mean wealthiest americans and floridians i must add the wealthiest not folks that are just kind of you have a good job you are making a family income of about 80 000 a year we are not talking about that group we are not talking about the individuals that are making a little bit over 100 000 we are not talking about those individuals we are not talking about those individuals that are making under 20 000 or 35 000 a year as a joint household income we are talking about individuals that are making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year and who are celebrating a great representative in the white house right now and that is the president of the united states but do not take my word just look at how it is presented when the president starts talking about tax cuts of course he does not say we need to make sure the wealthiest americans receive the tax cuts but it is somewhere in the message when you look at how it is playing out the majority of the money in his tax cuts go to the wealthiest americans so it is not like he is fighting on behalf of everyday working people and saying that we want to provide that tax cut for you i talked earlier about the legislatures and how they are feeling the pinch and how they are passing that pinch on to local government but police officers need equipment and not only for homeland security but they need equipment to be able to provide safety in our local communities now let us talk for a minute about health care i mentioned that at the top of my presentation here today before this congress there is no health care plan and there will not be any money for a health care plan if we make tax cuts permanent on behalf of the wealthiest americans do not think it will fall out of the sky it will not happen we cannot have cake and ice cream and meet a commitment that we should make to the american people yet we are able to provide a health care plan that we here in this congress celebrate we have a health care plan that is just really something else but i do not think my constituents sent me up here saying to me well we are so delighted and we love you so much that we want to give you health care that we cannot even have or afford i do not think that was their message what i am saying to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle is that this is important and to those who are either listening to me right now in their offices or have even made it back home since we have finished business this week think about it over the weekend about what you have to do on behalf of those individuals at the airport when you get off that plane think about that ticket agent that is there think about that individual that is sitting there in that airport who is a development representative on behalf of a small shoe company who needs health care and cannot afford it think about those individuals when we start standing in judgment of this budget if we allow the wealthiest americans to receive a tax cut over good health care on behalf of every day working americans some that are traveling by car some that are traveling by plane some that are trying to make ends meet it is really a travesty and a shame we cannot give this bush administration the rubber stamp and continue to allow them to move forth on failed economic policies that are going to drive this country down not up much more has happened to the american worker than for the american worker and we have to pay very close attention to that let us not just watch the show let us be a part of the show and make it better on behalf of the american worker i would say now that the decisions that are coming out of this white house on the economic front are a shame and individuals should be embarrassed people should be fired we should be able to bring in a new team of strategists and advisers but i do take comfort in the fact that this is 2004 and in a few months americans will be able to make the kind of decision they need to make i guarantee that when you do not have health care and you have to go to an emergency room for that health care or when you are a veteran and you have to go to a veterans hospital to get some sort of assistance and you are waiting 3 months to see the ophthalmologist or the cardiologist or whatever the case may be that is not a partisan issue that is an issue of leadership so whether you are a democrat an independent or a republican whatever the case may be there is a lot of blame to go around we will not be blamed on the democratic side i guarantee you we will not be jumping up and down on making these tax cuts permanent on behalf of the wealthiest americans i am just so glad that god has allowed me to have enough breath in my body to come here and put this on the record and to let americans know that we should not allow the wealthiest americans these tax cuts and i am not hating on them i am hating on the leadership of this country as it relates to the president of the united states that keeps selling to the american people that this is a good thing i just do not know how it is and i will say this right now we need to stand up on behalf of those individuals working every day and that have to stay healthy to be able to provide health care and some sort of way of life on behalf of their families men and women some twoparent households some oneparent households and with their price of health care continuing to rise and the price of health care continuing to rise for small businesses then we are standing up with the president for the wealthiest americans i am sorry if someone is disappointed because i am here speaking on behalf of everyday americans the people that work in the federal government do not have the kind of health care they need to have and we need to fight on their behalf we need to say no to the president as relates to providing tax cuts to the wealthiest americans i am going to keep saying it and i think that members of this congress should keep saying it i am trying to make the job easier on behalf of my friends on the republican side that want to say it but cannot say it and the reason why they cannot say it is that they will fall out of step with the administration i have seen it it has been all over the papers the kind of pressure that this administration put on good members of congress who are trying to make good decisions on behalf of their constituents it is well documented this is not the kendrickmeek report this is the report of the reality of what is going on in this capital city we should not stand by and allow this to happen and i do mean those of us who are carrying 108th congress voting cards we should not allow this president to continue to make decisions and give him credit where credit is not deserved based on the report of this administration and the fact they have not been able to create positive job creation since the president has been president just short of 3 million jobs some say we are on our way up well three million is a long way to go try to tell that to an individual whose unemployment has ran out and they cannot find a job meanwhile we have a president who thinks and who is talking about oh it is good to send jobs overseas so while we are here fighting and the majority i must add i am hoping that we can get them to really think the way they want to think and act the way they want to act and saying no to the president of the united states that we will not allow this to happen because the social security trust fund will never be resolved and it will be going down into deficits we believe in community policing we believe in providing health care for those that have worn the uniform and who are entitled to the respect they should receive many of whom have lost limbs and have diseases that they cannot shake because they fought on behalf of this country they should not be waiting 3 to 6 months to try to see a doctor or to try to get some sort of specialty treatment at a va hospital the va hospitals should not be closing but they are closing because we are about to take away their money it is already happening only we are going to make it permanent so where is the money going to come from the president is going to walk around and say we have cut taxes we have made them permanent well that sounds good taxes have been cut but the reality of it is that the majority of americans are not the ones that are receiving this 54 percent of the dollars in that tax cut and it is little increments as relates to every day working americans but huge tax cuts in the hundreds and tens of thousands to the wealthiest americans who will receive and continue to receive as far as the eye can see but we are here talking about where are we going to be able to provide affordable health care talking about why we cannot stop property taxes going up if there is a local school or bond question on the ballot in your states primary or a question on the ballot as relates to a local election it is not because the school board failed you it is not because the county government failed you it is not because of the school boards that are operated by the city it is not because the city has failed you it is not because the state has failed you it is because the president of the united states thought it was important to make sure that we provide a tax cut and to make it permanent i must add on behalf of the wealthiest americans as i close i just want to say that and this is important that these tax cuts for the wealthiest americans have nothing to do with the effort against terrorism it has nothing to do with it nothing patriotic about giving tax cuts to the wealthiest americans i did not see a millionaire or a billionaire coming to my office saying congressman i sure need you to fight on my behalf i want you to make these tax cuts permanent you know the reason why they are not coming to my office saying that because they cannot look at me straight in the eye nor can they look at the american people straight in the eye and say that but this president and you need to check it for yourself this president goes flying around burning all kinds of federal jet fuel talking about it is important that we make it permanent he leans on the podium carrying on and looking and winking and all that kind of stuff and that is good for the television but in reality he is telling us to forget about a health care plan because there is not one we can forget about a good medicare prescription drug plan because there will not be one there is not enough money to be able to do it and i do not even want to start about what this congress was told and about what happened afterwards millions of dollars underforecast as relates to the plan that was passed i do not even want to get into that that is another entire special order but as far as community policing we can begin to look to our local communities not preventing crime but reporting crime we had those days we want to get away from those days but i think those day will come back veterans veterans oh my goodness i am so glad this is an election year and that they are getting some level or maybe a small response that is just starting fron this bush administration because of the pressure and the reality of what they have to live under not being able to receive the kind of health care that they need and waiting in lines i close by saying this i go back to the washington post today state government leaders the utah speaker of the house mr stevens said that we have seen an increase in that practice in recent years and we are concerned this is going to get worse that is what the evidence shows that is what will continue to happen if this house allows this president to make these tax cuts permanent on behalf of the wealthiest americans state governments brace yourself local communities brace yourself property owners brace yourself hunters and sportsmen alike and sportswomen brace yourself brace yourself because you will be paying the price because we want to fight on behalf of the few we want to make sure individuals that live in gated communities and who burn a full tank of gas getting to their front door get their tax cut on behalf of the democratic side and on behalf of some republicans that are thinking in their mind that they want to be able to say something not only say something but want to vote against some of this stuff that the president is putting down i am asking this congress does not continue to follow this president down a track of continulng not only to outsource jobs but continuing to put this country in economic jeopardy i have a problem with us knocking on the bank of china saying we need money to pay down money on the largest deficit under our watch something is fundamentally wrong with that and you can talk about democratrepublican but the reality is there was a surplus until president bush took the white house then all of a sudden we have record deficits we have red lines that are running deep you can lose consciousness i think it is important my colleagues as we take this recess over the weekend that we come clean with the american people about what is to come i hope and pray on behalf of veterans that we do better by them i pray on behalf of children who are trying to rise up to the standards that have been set by this administration without the resources in this budget that will be able to respond to the needs of every day teachers and administrators that are working to be able to make sure that they can provide an environment and also be able to put forth an education system that is going to help our children learn outside of just having test centers and having rhetoric out there these oneliners talking about how we have raised standards i hope and i pray that members of congress stand on behalf and especially on the majority party because on the democratic side i know where we stand but i am hoping and praying that someone some member stands up and gets other members on the republican side to say no to the president of the united states i do not care if it is an election year or not mr president you will not make tax cuts permanent on behalf of the wealthiest americans and not just because we do not want you to but because the republic depends on the very resources you are willing to give away to individuals who do not even need it and which will provide for health care for social security for a prescription drug plan that actually is a plan on behalf of the american people and that will drive costs down and which will also make sure that we have police officers in our communities that are going to prevent crime and not report it"], [0.0001537799835205078, 0.9998462200164795, 1, "later this week the house is on the verge of passing a 2 3 trillion budget with a 500 billion deficit showing that it is impossible to finance three wars with three tax cuts this budget repeats the same mistakes that have resulted in a jobless economy and a wage recession here in america with the lowest growth in wages in a period of economic growth ever in american history this budget continues the status quo economy an administration that refuses to budge and change its failed policies that have led to nearly 3 million americans unemployed since it has taken office 43 million americans who are working without health care 4 additional million since they have taken office 2 million americans who moved from the middle class to poverty nearly 1 trillion worth of corporate individual bankruptcies and stagnant wages during the 2000 presidential campaign president bush declared that he opposed nationbuilding who knew it was america he was talking about you would think if your results of your economic policies led to 3 or more million americans without work 43 million americans without health insurance 1 trillion dollars worth of foreclosed corporate assets poverty rolls increasing you would change direction what are we about to do with this budget put our foot on the accelerator and do the same old thing that will result in the same policies in 3 years we have added 3 trillion to the nations deficit and nearly 3 million americans have lost their jobs three wars three tax cuts 500 billion in deficits that has been the result of the economic policies of this administration and this budget that we are going to vote on will continue the policies that have given america woefully inadequate services on health care college education jobs retirement security and also economic security this budget and the presidents economic vision is really the tale of two budgets one for america one for iraq we have spent well over 100 billion on iraqs occupation but without promising the same future that we are promising the iraqi children and families let us just go through it when we talk about universal health care in iraq and free job training to iraqis 44 million americans go without health insurance and 8 2 million americans are without jobs in the area of health care 2 200 iraqi health officials are being trained by the united states and 8 000 volunteers in iraq are receiving free training in america under the budget being proposed we have cut health training funds by 64 percent here at home one hundred fifty clinics and hospitals in iraq have been rebuilt serving 3 million iraqis one hundred percent prenatal and infant coverage in iraq in america community health clinics cut by 91 percent maternal and child health care healthy start family planning all frozen resulting from cuts in those budgets in the area of jobs in iraq 60 million is being spent to train iraqi veterans for past wars and yet in this budget we gut veterans and veteran health care resulting in every veterans organization opposing the budget we are going to vote on in the area of education in iraq we have built 2 300 schools for the iraqi children but have underfunded leave no child behind by 8 billion here at home iraqi universities are getting 20 million for higher ed partnerships in america we have cut 91 million from the perkins loans and frozen pell grants for college education in the area of police and security 470 billion is being spent 500 billion is being spent for iraqi police yet the cops community police program 659 million in this budget is cut from the police that we put on our streets here at home in the area of housing 470 million is being spent for iraq public housing yet we have cut in this budget that the president proposes and the republicans are going to vote on 791 million from section 8 public housing vouchers in the area of environment in iraq 3 6 billion in waters and sewer improvement in america a 500 million cut from the clean water state revolving fund that provides drinking water for every american in the area of ports the port of umm qasar in iraq was completely rebuilt for economic development the army corps of engineers here in the united states a 63 percent cut for port security upgrades roads we spent 240 million on roads and bridges for the iraqi infrastructure and yet mass transit here in the united states in the budget will be frozen as the president seeks reelection he will be running on a pledge that he kept he was opposed to nationbuilding and he has kept his pledge the problem is he is opposed to

time as i may consume as has been mentioned in different forms earlier in this debate this is serious business it is serious business and i believe knowing that we are engaged in this war on terrorism which we have been now for over 2 years we have to respond in a timely manner to those americans that we put at risk and i would remind my colleagues that threefourths of this bill or slightly more goes to support our troops and we have focused on other parts probably that is good for the debate but we should not lose sight of the fact that threefourths of this goes directly to our troops now we have some difference of opinion between the other house with their supplemental budget the quicker we can get this into conference the quicker we can get a bill passed and the quicker we can get the president to sign it to support our troops frankly the better off we are i would just make one observation that i found rather interesting because we spent a great deal of time debating before i was here on the gulf war resolution i was not here but i understand that was a debate that was inspiring for the congress that really when we look at that from a historical standpoint is why we are here today because of whatever reasons and agreements were made following the gulf war saddam remained in power now we are in a situation where we have to complete that we had a long debate when we decided to go to war in iraq this year properly the right thing to do and now we have debated this supplemental to support our troops for into the third day from a historical standpoint i would just like to remind members that sometimes this body moves extremely fast on important issues right after december 7 1941 when we declared war on japan and germany the unitedstates house of representatives allocated 40 minutes for each of those resolutions i think it is important for us to get this done as quickly as we possibly can so i urge my colleagues to vote for the previous question i oppose this new rule to recklessly cease debate and eliminate all opportunity for amendments on behalf of the american people i now will speak to h r 3289 before us the task of stabilizing and reconstructing iraq may end up being one of the greatest challenges of our generation although we are getting rosy reports of progress in iraq from the administration the fact that we have 130 000 troops in the area and are now being handed an 87 billion tab paints a fully different picture it is now obvious that the administration grossly underestimated the cost and difficulty of stabilizing iraq almost to the same extent that they overestimated the threat posed to the american people by saddam hussein even the socalled soft costs of the war and its aftermath are enough to cripple some nations this is not revisionist history at least a hundred of us in congress millions of citizens who took to the streets and even a handful of brave souls in the administration itself tried to warn the administration of what it was getting into with its preemptive strike on iraq we were ignored and those in the administrationthe shinsekis and the lindseys have been encouraged to move on but the problems in iraq have not gone away so gracefully we are now at an important crossroads we can continue to beat this dead horse with the same policies of isolation from our allies around the worid and partisanship here in the united states or we can start working together employing the collective wisdom of all of us here and around the nation with the experience and expertise to be of service in this endeavorand who are committed to our troops and to fulfilling the promise the president made to the people of iraq and afghanistan and to the world as this debate comes to the halls of congress the people who marched us into this war will try to paint this vote as a vote for or against our troops this is absolutely a false picture for one thing our military is extremely well funded as i just described including the iraq supplementals the defense budget will be approaching 500 billion furthermore iraq is not an indigent nation if they wanted to they could take better care of our troops secretary rumsfeld wants to spend billions of dollars on a star wars defense system while we are getting reports that our soldiers risking their lives in iraq dont have adequate body armor or clean water supplies or basic human necessities like feminine hygiene products for our women soldiers six months after this battle started we still have soldiers without kevlar body armor and water purifiers what did they do with the first 79 billion war supplemental we now have a new request for money but we still have not heard details of how they spent the first money what progress has been made and what challenges remain i visited the assayllyah central command base in doha qatar last weekend and heard the concerns of the troops from their own mouths i heard testimony about how a ground soldier watched his partner and the operator of a military vehicle get tossed out as the vehicle was thrown airborne by a land mine why did you hit this mine i asked it was just one of those mines that was missed in the sweep said the soldier because there isnt enough personnel or specialists to assign to technical tasks unskilled or untrained technicians frequently get asked to do jobs that they have not mastered enough to guarantee the lives of those who must traverse the sands of baghdad the soldier misses his wife and newborn baby dearly because there hasnt been a change in the personnel on the front lines in several months many reservists and active duty servicemen and women have spent a longer time in iraq than was promised by the administration may 1 2003 was supposed to have been a day of hope and homecoming instead it was a sham some of these troops feel like sitting ducks out in the foreign terrain they dont speak arabic they dont know tikrit like they know their hometowns when i asked them if they have seen any troops of other coalition nations they responded what coalition troops they need support and they need continuous relief the president and his friends in leadership in congress did not listen to the warnings of the congressional black caucus or our international allies or hundreds of thousands of likeminded citizens who took to the streets some of my democratic colleagues voted for this war because they believed in the institution of the presidency and thought they had to give this administration the benefit of the doubt i did not regardless now the president has cut open this patient and the patient is laying on the surgical table the president has made a promise to the people of iraq and to the world that we will leave the patient better than we found itand it is up to our american soldiers and the american taxpayers to fulfill that promise much of the toughest burden will fall on the shoulders of the families of our troops overseas therefore i have submitted amendments that speak to alleviation of this burden 1 i firmly believe that before any further funds are sent to iraq to rebuild that country we need to ensure that our men and women in the armed forcesreservists as well as active servicemen and women are receiving the money and services that they deserve and in a timely fashion dr jones who works under lt col corbett shared this concern with me during my visit 2 i also believe that the pentagon needs to develop a plan to ensure that none of our troops or government employees must remain stationed in iraq for more than 6 months at a time 3 furthermore the administration must announce a definite and clear exit plan for the troops to give them real hope and a notion that an end to the fighting is truly near 4 there should also be more trained military policemen and women stationed in iraq to mitigate the vulnerabilities experienced by these men and women 5 similarly they need proper job allocation so that lives are not lost due to erroneous assignment of duties 6 moreover as to the national guard servicepersons the scheduled end of deployment should be honored rather than making them continue fighting until their respective units are released despite their frustrations i encouraged them with the following phrase you are as much defenders as you are peacekeepers to let them know that their work truly matters the most for the people of iraq as well as the people at home in the united states i sincerely wish the president had not put us in this situation but he and his administration did and now we have to deal with it if we are going to deal with it i feel at this point it is critical to take some of the control away from the people who have made horrible misjudgments at every step of the way who misled the american people and the congress about the need for war and who ignored warnings from inside and outside the administration either they knew the truth chose to mislead us or they did not take the time to adequately assess and plan for the true situation either way senior members of this administration were not doing their jobs that is why before any appropriations are sent to rebuild iraq the congress and the american people need to see an independent inestigation in progress looking deeply into several questions whether unitedstates intelligence reports were manipulated in order to misrepresent the threat saddam hussein posed to american interests whether the costs and dangers of invading and occupying iraq were deliberately understated whether american officials who offered differing views of iraq became the victims of inappropriate or illegal retaliation and whether one or more individuals within the administration is or are responsible for the leak of classified information regarding intelligence reports and the veracity of accounts as to the purchase of yellowcake for nuclear weapons production if any of these allegations are proved true those responsible must be held accountable i am concerned that there has been a methodical and undemocratic effort to mislead and intimidate the american people and the world in order to march us into this war and now we are being given an 87 billion bill to pay for that effort as we move forward in iraq unfortunately we have severely limited options because people like secretary rumsfeld have used reckless speech that has angered and exasperated our allies many of our most staunch allies are now reluctant to get involved in stabilizing and reconstructing iraq while our stale department has been reaching out around the world with a hand of cooperation and partnership mr rumsfeld has proudly displayed his arrogance and disdain for anyone not walking lockstep with him too much is at stake to distance ourselves from those whose help we need people from democracies around the world are now being asked to trust this administration with the lives of their sons and daughters in the military by sending them to fight under a unitedstates command whose leaders show them blatant disrespect they are being encouraged to send their hardearned money to reconstruct iraq under the authority of this administration that gives the largest contracts to its political supporters that seems to have no credible plan for the future and that ignores the advice of even the most trusted experts on the world stage it is not surprising that they are not stepping up with money and troops i think the problem is basically a lack of trust i cant blame them i do not trust this administration to do the right thing in iraq either i do not intend to vote to send another dime to iraq until the president takes some dramatic steps to restore credibility to his administration first i want to see new faces in top positions starting with donald rumsfeld we need people who choose integrity over politics end respect over arrogance second i want to see a full accounting of how they spent the first 79 billion and exactly how they came up with this 87 billion figure our sources say that the armed services were barely consulted on those numbersthat some critical needs were totally left out and others grossly exaggerated we need honest accounting and third once we have a true picture of what funds are necessary to support our troops congress should be able to vote on that funding aloneseparate from the money needed for reconstruction of iraq that bifurcated vote will allow us to quickly get money to protect our brave soldiers but will also give us the time we need to thoughtfully craft a plan for reconstructiona plan that will include our allies and the world bank nongovernment organizations ngos and oil and natural resources from iraq itself those are the three things i want to see before i can consider giving any more money to this administration for the united states effort in iraq this does not mean that i do not want to support our troops and this does not mean that i want to break the presidents promise to the iraqi people and to the world that he would make things better in iraq instead it is a call for action i want to get the appropriate amount of money to the people who deserve itbut right now i am not confident that 87 billion is the right amount or that it would be spent in a way that would help our troops help the iraqi people stabilize the region or prevent terrorism there are just too many questions and not enough answers why do we need 950 million for recruiting and training of police forces in iraq when we need more money for police and firefighters in houston new york washington dc and philadelphia why do we need 209 million for prison and detention facilities and 100 million for construction of a new prison in iraq when our federal prisons are overcrowded and severely underfunded too many questions and not enough answers do we really need 100 million for a witness protection program and 5 65 billion to repairand rehabilitate the infrastructure in iraq when a few months ago the whole eastern seaboard was without power are we really serious finally are we really serious about supplying iraq with 793 million for health care programs when we still have children without health insurance elderly without health insurance and our poor citizens without health insurance there are just too many questions and not enough answers there will be many thoughtful amendments offered that could ensure that the funds that we do not bankrupt our treasury while failing our troops and the people who need our help i urge all of my colleagues to put politics and pride aside and consider them so that together we can get our efforts in the middle east back on track i have several amendments that i think will help get our policies back on track my first amendment states that none of the funds made available in this act may be obligated or expended until government personnel policies have been implemented to ensure that no members of the armed forces or government employees are being required to be stationed in iraq continuously for a period greater than 6 months the president has stated that the war on terror will be a long and involved one therefore we must pace ourselves and we must ensure that our armed services can continue to recruit good people in the future this amendment will help ensure that our troops and their families remain mentally fit and rested and that military tours will remain a reasonable commitment in service to this nation the second states that of the funds made available in this act may be obligated or expended until all reserve and national guard personnel are paid in full the third amendment requires that none of the funds made available in this act may be obligated or expended until the president has submitted to congress a report setting forth in detail the strategy and projected timetable for withdrawing unitedstates forces in iraq without goals i am concerned that our efforts in iraq could drift indefinitely congress and the american people must know what lies ahead so that we can plan appropriately the fourth is a sense of the house of representatives that before any appropriation under this act is obligated a special counsel should be appointed to investigate the propriety and legality of actions by the administration in connection with the unauthorized release of classified information we have a complex mission ahead of us in the middle east to succeed we will need to take advantage of every single national security asset at our disposal recently one of our top cia operatives was outed by white house employees thus compromising her work and even the lives of her sources and acquaintances overseas if we do not show the appropriate immediate vigorous response we could undermine our efforts in the middle east by discouraging people to come to american officials with assistance or information finally i have two amendments that will help refocus some of our energy and resources on afghanistan the supplemental continues to shortchange afghanistans reconstruction and security and it does this at the peril of jeopardizing the rights of afghan women and girls and hopes for a peaceful democratic afghanistan the proposed funding levels neither adequately make up for the small amounts of reconstruction funding thus far nor do they meet the countrys needs in the last 2 years only 1 percent of afghanistans reconstruction needs have been met the country remains in shambles from two decades of war and lack of development most people in the country do not have access to electricity health care schools and sanitation not only is the lack of reconstruction depriving people of very basic services but it is contributing to instability in the country and a lack of confidence in the central government the transitional government in afghanistan estimates that between 20 to 30 billion is needed over the next five years in other postconflict settings an average of 250 per person was spent per year in aid but in afghanistan donors spent only 64 per person in the proposed 800 million afghanistan reconstruction supplemental spending request represents less than 1 percent of the total 87 billion iraq and afghanistan package the 20 billion request for iraq reconstruction funding is 25 times as large as the afghanistan request yet afghanistan has approximately the same population size as iraq and suffered more destruction over 23 years of war house chairman youngs mark to increase reconstruction funding for afghanistan by 400 million is a step in the right direction but still more must be done my first afghanistan amendment will shift 20 million from the iraq budget toward afghanistan to be used for developing electricitygeneration and transmission infrastructure if afghanistan is ever going to thrive and progress it will need consistent sources of energy to power its factories hospitals and homes these funds will help the other amendment will improve the plight of afghan women and girls women and girls continue to face severe hardship and violations of their rights in afghanistan yet the afghanistan request does not specify funds for programs to improve the status of women and to remedy the tremendous injustices they faced under the taliban regime my amendment proposes designating 300 million for womens programs in the area of political rights and human rights health care education and training and security protection and shelters i also propose earmarks of 10 million of the afghan independent human rights commission and 24 million for the ministry of womens affairs we must provide direct support to help strengthen those womenled permanent afghan institutions whose mission it is to promote womens rights and human rights these are funds already authorized in the afghan freedom support act of 2002 but which still for the most part have not been appropriated some girls have gone back to school in afghanistan but the majority have not because there are not enough schools and those that do exist are in very bad shape the asian development bank estimates that an additional 13 851 primary schools need to be constructed but the administration request is only for 275 schools some 40 percent of schools in afghanistan were completely destroyed during the war another 15 percent were heavily damaged and in many areas of the country there were no schools for girls whats more the advances in girls education that have been made are under attack in the past year fundamentalist extremists have burned down bombed and otherwise violently attacked more than 30 girls schools at most of the sites of these attacks leaflets have been distributed threatening the families of girls who attend school or the teachers who teach them flyers distributed at the site of one of the first attacks read stop sending your women to offices and daughters to schools it spreads indecency and vulgarity stand ready for the consequences if you do not heed the advice some families are now afraid to send their daughters to school our nation promised to help free afghan women we cannot allow the extremists to take back these newly won freedoms i hope my colleagues will support these amendments we must look toward a brighter future in iraq and work together to make that vision happen"],

the unified budget that is all of the money that comes into washington and all of the money that washington spends but about 10 percent of the money that comes into washington should not be washingtons money to spend because it is taken from the american people presumably to be put in trust for the american people to make available to them such things as civil service retirement as medicare benefits and as social security retirement in later years so there was a surplus but it was not a surplus that resulted in paying down the debt now a debt was paid down the debt that was paid down was the public debt and i am sure the average citizen had no idea that there were two debts a public debt and the national debt while we paid down the public debt the national debt kept going up as i mentioned earlier i checked with the cbo and there was not a moment in time during those 4 or 5 years when washington was telling the american people that we were paying down the debt when in fact the debt that really mattered the debt that we are passing on our children and grandchildren there never was a moment in time when that debt went down it went up that debt is projected to go up faster and faster over the next several years looking at the curve in the next 2 years this jumps up just about half a trillion dollars the advertised deficit ii only 245 billion but the real deficit is going to be roughly twice that because we have to add to whatever washington tells us the deficit is we have to add to that the monies that are taken from the trust fund now this whole trust fund charade started during the johnson years those who are older remember his guns and butter he was running deficits that were embarrassingly high so what his administration did to hide those deficits was to move those trust funds on budget and then take the surpluses in the trust funds and spend them and pretend that was not debt they make the perfectly silly statement the social security surplus offsets the deficits for me this year that is true because i did not have to go as a part of this government out in the marketplace and borrow dollars because what i did without their consent was to borrow that money from my children and grandchildren as a matter of fact what we have here what we are amassing here is the largest intergenerational transfer of debt probably in the history of mankind eleven years ago when i ran for congress i promised my constituents that i was going to conduct myself down here so my kids and grandkids would not come and spit on my grave i have tried to do rhat that is why i have always been honest with my constituents for all of those years that we were saying that we had a surplus and were paying down the debt i told audiences that it will probably not surprise them to learn that washington is not being altogether truthful we are paying down the debt it is the public debt but the public debt is only part of the national debt which is a sum that

confusing complex and complicated tax code i want to start my comments by commending our distinguished house democratic whip the gentleman from maryland for his steadfast leadership on this issue of the need for tax reform i thank the gentleman for leading on this issue he has not just started leading on this issue he has been leading on this issue for a number of years i believe that americans are doubletaxed and that the time and expense that it takes to file their taxes creates an additional cost to our taxpayers the current tax code is riddled with confusion complexities ambiguities and lnfairness of staggering magnitude we need to make drastic changes now our current tax code is beyond reason and basic common sense for instance the federal income tax code has grown from 45 662 pages in 2001 to 60 044 pages today at that rate at that number of pages it would take over a year just to read the current tax code and that is only if you were reading an average of 1 215 pages every week and doing it at least 8 hours every day that is absolutely incredible our four common tax forms 1040 and schedules a b and d take an estimated 28 hours and 30 minutes to prepare as our distinguished leader pointed out in 1988 when the irs began tracking this information the average paperwork burden was 17 hours and 17 minutes that is an increase of over 10 hours in just 6 years unbelievable alexander hamilton one of our great founders of this country perhaps the primary architect of our taxing system and our first secretary of the treasury said in order for our nation to succeed our taxing system must be simple literate and fair and i tremble for the future of my country if we fail in this endeavor and i tremble indeed for the future of our country also as mr hamilton did 200 years ago if we fail to reform our tax code indeed i predict a serious taxpayers revolt in the very near future because of complexity because of expense because of unfairness if we do not move with haste now to reform the tax code it now costs taxpayers 100 billion each year just in fees for our taxpayers just to complete their tax returns individuals businesses tax exempt publicprivate entities spend 6 billion hours each year just complying with the tax code it is a loss to our economy and it is a loss to our productivity and it is staggering as you know as an entrepreneur that has started a successful business as i have as a small business owner i believe that tax reform proposals that simplify the tax code merit serious consideration and to that end i am a cosponsor of h r 1783 the freedom flat tax act let me just tell you for a minute what this flat tax will do it will take the complexity out of our tax code it will ensure fairness by closing creative loopholes that allow some unscrupulous persons to avoid paying their fair share of taxes 0i 2300 this measure would phase in a flat tax over a 3year period with a 19 percent rate for the first 2 years and a 17 percent rate in subsequent years and it will allow for no deduction loopholes but will allow for personal exemptions including a 5 300 exemption for each dependent i do not believe that the flat tax is perfect but at least it is a starting point to do 2 essential things give our taxpayers back their time and give them back some of their money that is what the american citizens are asking for this current tax code is mesmerizing in its confusion and unfairness for example there are 5 different tax breaks for families with children dependency exemption head of household filing status the child tax credit the child independent care tax credit the eitc and all 5 of these define a qualifying child differently how confusing taxpayers overpay their taxes by an estimated 1 billion a year because they fail to claim itemized deductions opting for the standard deduction instead according to the general accounting office because they say the tax code is too hard to understand about onequarter of taxpayers who are eligible for the earned income tax credit which is designed to help the working poor fail to claim it because they say it is too complicated our tax code is terrible we cannot wait any longer the time for tax reform is right now we must not tinker around the edges of the tax code but go right to the heart of the problem the american people are depending upon us and we democrats must provide the way and the leadership on this critical issue of tax reform the american people need and deserve a tax system that is simpler fairer and more efficient just as the gentleman from maryland stated

the purposes of entering into a colloquy with the gentleman from texas chairman bonilla and the gentlewoman from ohio the ranking member last years farm bill authorized the resident instruction and distance education grants program for the insular areas to address the critical agricultural research needs of the land grant univ6rsities in the unitedstates territories and puerto rico we receive very little by way of formula funds tstar grants and other special grants existing programs simply do not orient themselves toward the land grant universities in the insular areas additionally our universities have seen no money under the national research initiative the flagship agricultural research program while our institutions are 1862s by definition they have only been established as land grant universities for the past 3 decades this coupled with the decline in funds for the cooperative state research education and extension service overall makes competing with other institutions very difficult so last year congress authorized a new funding mechanism to provide competitively awarded grants to meet the unique needs of this underserved set of universities this new authorization is especially important to the land grant universities in the insular areas because it will help them to develop education and training programs while working in collaboration with leading unitedstates universities on the mainland building on their expertise and helping us to make the best possible use of limited program dollars this years appropriation bill has no funds whatsoever for this new program as the land grant universities in the insular areas face many critical agricultural research needs including food safety and security health and nutrition and the environment i am hopeful that this new program will be funded in the near future although my request to fund this account in this cycle has not been met i am grateful for the inclusion of report language that speaks to this need i know that the gentleman from texas chairman bonilla and the gentlewoman from ohio our ranking member are supportive of the land grant universities in the insular areas and i urge them to utilize this new program to ensure the survival of these institutions"], [0.0007603764533996582, 0.5007603764533997, 1, "mr speaker i yield myself such time as i may consume i will read into the record some letters that we have here this bill has been represented as a bill on family violence we have here a letter in opposition to the bill and in support of the lofgren substitute from the family violence prevention fund it says if congress is serious about stopping domestic violence against pregnant women and helping women and children who are victims members will quickly pass the domestic violence screening treatment and prevention act h r 1267 the american association of university women is opposed to this bill the national womens law center is opposed to this bill the national council of jewish women is opposed to this bill in which they say that this bill defines an unborn child as a member of the species homo sapiens at any stage of development for the first time it gives selarate legal protection to a fertilized egg embryo or fetus and mandates penalties for harm to an unborn child equal to those mandated for harm to the woman herself this legal definition will set a precedent that the antichoice movement can exploit in its ongoing efforts to equate abortion with murder and it would establish a foundation on which to build a case that the rights of fertilized eggs embryos and fetuses are apart from and superior to the rights of the women in whose bodies they develop the unborn victims of violence act is a sham designed to exploit the understandable public sympathy for a woman who loses her pregnancy or her life to violence in order to promote an agenda by which women will in fact lose control of their bodies to the state that is from the national council of jewish

can and have been told about him the people remembered him and loved him throughout all of east texas i remember fondly the days he would come to all of those parades we would have through east texas he always had a mule that he saddled up and rode in the parade wearing brightly colored clothes and those suspenders that were always his trademark a wonderful caring human being charlie wilson probably taught me more about and i think many of the other of his colleagues and those of the house that followed him about the job of a member of congress providing constituent service he prided himself on what he did for the people at home and it was interesting a comment that was made in an article not long ago jane 1 2004 when he said that when the day was done says charlie the working people knew i was on their side and the blacks knew i was on their side it is hard to explain but there is a tolerance for human frailty that does not exist outside of east texas charlie wilson loved

sponsoring this resolution saluting the new england patriots in their second super bowl championship in the last 3 years and i yield myself such time as i may consume it is indeed an honor to be able to stand here tonight and talk not only as a fan but as a person from new england about what it means to our region to be able to salute these new england patriots we are always grateful in new england having rooted for the red sox for so long and witnessed so many heartbreaking seasons for wellcoached wellrun wellorganized teams that win and bring home the ring so many individuals need to be saluted but it is important to note that when we talk about the new england patriots we talk about teamwork we talk about cooperation we talk about individuals in highprofile positions subverting themselves to the greater good of the team and that has always been the history of this team that had to recover from injuries that had to recover from the loss of major free agents at the beginning of the season and still despite those setbacks were able to win but it is also important for us to note several individuals that have made not only this season possible but others in the past it starts with the ownership of the new england patriots mr bob kraft and his sons have just done a tremendous job bringing back firstclass football to new england and keeping the franchise in massachusetts and were it not for the kraft ownership and all of the things that they have done to make this possible we would not be seeing that success today the coaching staff led by bill belichick has done just a stupendous job of putting together unique individuals and making the team function as something that is greater than the sum of all of the parts but bill belichick cannot do it by himself he has a tremendous staff in the front office all the way down to the trainers and the people that work in public relations from the top to bottom the patriots organization is a tremendously wellrun organization the players are bar none the best team in the league and when adam vinatieri kicked that field goal even though he had missed 2 already that afternoon you knew that he was going to kick the third one and that we would win again 1900 also in need of being saluted are long time announcers gil santos and gino cappelletti the voices of the new england patriots who for many many years kept the faith alive and perhaps the most important people that need to be celebrated are the fans of new england who have never given up on their team not only this year but for the last several years and braved the coldest of cold weather the snowiest of snowy days and were outnumbering the carolina fans in houston last week by 100 to 1 but as we celebrate the patriots let us also not forget the fine teams that they beat all year starting with the carolina panthers who no one gave a chance to be successful in the super bowl last week who played a tremendous game it was one of the greatest games in the history of the national football league the patriots also beat two other fine teams in the playoffs the indianapolis colts and the tennessee titans and had a tremendous regular season where they won 12 in a row and then three playoff games hopefully we will continue this next year and do it one game at a time i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from massachusetts"]]}
