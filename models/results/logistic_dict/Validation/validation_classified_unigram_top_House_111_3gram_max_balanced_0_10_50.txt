heres my difference the minority leader came to the well and said tarp was passed to be an emergency bill and the emergency is over you cannot directly address a member so let me say will someone tell the minority leader it aint over until its over on main street all throughout america maybe when the republicans had that meeting with a group of financial lobbyists they took some time out to celebrate the ending of an emergency but most of us know the emergency is not over i didnt say aint again the emergency continues and heres what the administration has proposed under the bush administrationand i voted for tarp i thought that the lack of regulation created a crisis but the big banks got the first tarp money we are now finally succeeding in getting tarp money for smaller banks who can do community lending and small business lending we voted today to take 3 billion and give it as loans to people who cant pay their mortgages because theyre unemployed not people who got mortgages they shouldnt have gotten not subprime mortgages hardworking people who cant pay a mortgage the 3 billion would go for that to help them avoid foreclosure and they can pay it back when they get the job thats gone so the antisocial parts of tarp are okay and now they want to get rid of the other parts by the way who are they saving money for here their friends the big banks the original tarp legislation said at the end of the day any tarp shortfall will be made up by an assessment on the financial community weve gone further than that the amendment we adopted over republican opposition by the gentleman from michigan instructs the fdic in this bill that they want to kill not surprisingly to assess the financial institutions to make up any shortfall from the tarp they kill that they complained before about our assessment they are very upset that we might levy on jpmorgan chase and morgan stanley and goldman sachs and the others some responsibility financially for whats gone on so heres what they do first of all they kill all reform and their pretense that they are for a different form of it they deliberately left it out of their bill they were just playing it they secondly say now that tarp money has gone to the big banksand they dont have to pay it back by the way under this bill necessarilyand we are trying to use it socially to encourage lending to give it to community banks with some requirement they lend to help people who are unemployed avoid having foreclosure until they get their jobs back now they want to get rid of it and to whose benefit the big banks the question is should we use tarp money to give to the small banks for community banking should we use tarp money to help people avoid unemployment or should we do what they want to do and give it back so that the big financial institutions arent assessed thats whats at risk here not the taxpayers the taxpayers are not on the hook for this tarp money the large financial institutions are and

consequential world diplomats of the last halfcentury and his tireless work in pursuit of united states national interests and international peace have put us all in his debt his advocacy for peace was of course most clearly shown during the conflict in bosnia his tenacity and force of will brought the warring parties to the negotiation table in dayton ohio where he skillfully brokered the accord that ended the over 3 years of atrocities and bloody conflict over 100 000 perished in the bosnian war and it is impossible to say how many thousands were saved by ambassador holbrookes actions at dayton and while that accomplishment would have been enough to mark any diplomatic career with high distinction it was only one of the many facets of his service which continued to the end of his life as assistant secretary of state for two regions of the worldeast asia and europe as united states ambassador to the united nations and as unitedstates special representative for afghanistan and

unemployment rate is 8 5 percent or higher thats about half the country and the number is likely to grow and we arent even close to the end of the road on september 11 2009 larry summers chair of the presidents national economic council said todays level of unemployment is unacceptably high and will remain so for a number of years how high todays unemployment rate is 9 7 percent the administrations august midsession review foresees 10 percent at the end of 2009 9 7 percent in late 2010 and 8 0 percent in late its highly unlikely congress will stop paying extended benefits then we need to ask how long can this go on and what does any of this have to do with helping people get back to work since this extended benefits program was created in june 2008 and expanded twice unemployment rose from 5 8 to 6 8 to 7 6 to now 9 7 percent even though the administration swore it wouldnt exceed 8 percent under their stimulus law there are now 6 million more unemployed including 3 million more longterm unemployed than when this program was created we are perpetuating unemployment not solving it larry summers also has stated that unemployment benefits contribute to longterm unemployment by providing an incentive and the means not to work each unemployed person has a reservation wagethe minimum wage he or she insists on getting before accepting a job unemployment insurance and other social assistance programs increase that reservation wage causing an unemployed person to remain unemployed longer a senior labor official in the clinton administration reflected on what that meant in terms of when unemployed workers find new jobs there are large spikes in the escape rate from unemployment at 26 weeks and at 39 weeks for ui recipients spikes of similar magnitude at 26 and 39 weeks are not apparent for ui nonrecipients what happens after 26 and 39 weeks of unemployment state and federal unemployment benefits end and there are large spikes in people finding new jobs is ending a long spell of unemployment easy of course not does everyone quickly find a job unfortunately not do those who return to work always make what they did before no but government cannot solve all ills and sometimes makes things worse by trying to recent articles have noted that a majority of the unemployed are willing to take a pay cut to get back to work that there is a huge traveling workforce that follows the jobs and that states have innovative options to get unemployed workers back on the job but extending benefits to 21 months undermines those return to work incentives leaving workers worse off and employment prospects more depressed going forward just currently approved unemployment spending has drained the state and federal unemployment accounts and will lead to deficits totaling more than 100 billion by late 2010 and nearly 200 billion by late 2012 further extensions and expansions will add massively to that tide of red ink that undermines job creation by requiring even more massive tax hikes to pay for all the continued benefit spending already state unemployment taxes are poised to double in the coming years extending benefits even more will require even greater jobkilling tax hikes hurting especially the longterm unemployed we are trying to help we can and must do better its well past time for us to review how we can really increase jobs so laid off workers get paychecks not unemployment checks"]]}
