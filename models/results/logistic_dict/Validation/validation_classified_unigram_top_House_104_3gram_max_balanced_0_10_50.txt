the american people just last year last year the american people examined the republican proposals to cut medicare to pay for tax breaks for the privileged few for wealthy americans and the american people said these are not our values these are not our priorities this is not what we want to see we dont want to see the funding for education for environment for medicare andmedicaid slashed and because the american people really spoke out they rose up against this budget last year congress in the end passed a budget that protects our nations priorities yesterday when the congressional majority when their leadership unveiled their new budget it was as yogi berra once said deja vu all over again we see the same skewed priorities the same skewed values and a willingness to do harm to working middleclass families in this country one of the most disturbing parts of this budget is the way that it undercuts medical protection for our nations seniors republicans propose cutting 168 billion from medicare once again they propose and their proposals and these medicare cuts will result in less choice for seniors in choosing their doctors thepotential for closing down hospitals in this country and for creat ing a second rate health care system for seniors in the united states of america the 168 billion they want to cut from medicare is not do not let them fool you is not necessary to make the medicare system solvent they may say that but again do not let them fool you and do not buy it the way you did not buy it in the last goround the money that is being cut is not going to be put back into the medicare trust fund once again it is going to pay for tax breaks the president proposed extending the solvency of medicare for the same amount of time without making the same deep cuts in the medicare system they are using the money from these medicare cuts to fund 176 billion in unnecessary tax breaks if you want to know the real agenda of the republican leadership on medicare all you need to do is to recall the words of house speaker newt gingrich on medicare not too many months ago not years ago but not too many months ago the speaker said now we dont get rid of it in round one because we dont think that is the politically smart thing to do and we do not think that is the right way to go through a transition but we believe it is going to wither on the vine because we think people are voluntarily going to leave it the majority leader of the other body said that he was proud to have voted in 1965 against medicare because it is a system that does not work these people truly believe that medicare is a wrong system a bad system and that it needs to be destroyed do not let them kid you in the direction they want to take the medicare system that is what the republicans really want to do to medicare they want it to wither on the vine the republican assault on health care for seniors does not stop with medicare in their budget they also propose cutting medicaid by 72 billion that cut combined with the block grant approach will jeopardize the guarantee of coverage for folks who are in nursing homes most people do not understand what medicaid is about it is seniors who are in nursing homes that medicaid covers in addition to cuts in medicare and medicaid they propose including risky medical savings accounts in the medicare system a system that would allow wealthy seniors to operate out of the medicare system thereby weakening the program allowing those who are most ill most frail to stay in traditional insurance programs driving those premiums up and not allowing people to be able to get health care to sum up what this new republican budget amounts to is yet another assault on the health care system for our nations seniors unless they withdraw this budget and rework their proposals i expect that they will ignite and i certainly hope they do the same firestorm that forced their retreat last year their proposal is wrong and

medicares impending bankruptcy in fact they have ignored the warnings of the medicare trustees and instead demagogued this issue waging a campaign of fear and misinformation when the republicanled congress sent a bill that passed the house and the senate to the president which would have saved medicare from bankruptcy and preserved it for future generations the president vetoed the bill yet 3 weeks ago yesterday new evidence revealed that medicare is indeed going bankrupt faster than the clinton administration admitted three weeks ago yesterday there was an article in the new york times not exactly a conservative publication that said the medicare insurance trust fund lost money in 1995 this little article reads medicares hospital insurance trust fund lost money for the first time since 1972 2 years earlier than officials in the clinton administration had predicted that is what the new york times reported again 3 weeks ago yesterday we had projected that 1997 would be the first fiscal year with a deficit said richard s foster chief actuary of the federal health care financing administration which runs medicare once the trust fund starts losing money the losses are expected to grow the new york times reported then the next day the washington post reported the following the white house confirmed a report yesterday that suggested the medicare hospital trust fund may be hemorrhaging even faster than previously expectedending fiscal 1995 with a balance that was 4 7 billion lower than predicted in april 1995 the medicare board of trustees including three clinton cabinet officials and the commissioner or the director of the social security administration warned congress and the president that medicare would be bankrupt by the year 2002 unless it took steps to preserve medicare from bankruptcy and to reverse the soaring spending rate the exponential spending rate path medicare was on to bankruptcy the clinton administration of course tried to sweep these findings under the rug when the president spoke to the white house conference on aging just a month later in may of 1995 he never mentioned the medicare trustees report instead the president and the liberal house democrats spent most of last year and again the early part of this year blasting republican plans to save medicare but as i mentioned earlier according to the new york times the clinton administration had data as far back as last october that indicated that the situation was far worse than predicted while the administration had estimated a projected surplus in the medicare trust fund of 4 7 billion for 1995 in fact the balance in the trust fund fell by 35 7 million as i mentioned the first time since 1972 that the trust fund has lost money so clearly we now know medicare is headed for bankruptcy even earlier than 2002 and the president and the liberal house democrats have no plan to save it in fact they have done virtually nothing to address the problem for 10 months the president an the liberal house democrats have ignored the warnings of the medicare trustees regarding the systems impending bankruptcy and instead they have played politics with medicare exploiting and twisting the issue to deceive and scare senior citizens which is particularly i think despicable given the fact that so many of our senior citizens are frail and elderly and vulnerable and the president has submitted a string of budget plans that all fail to again deal with medicares financial crisis unlike the president and the liberal house democrats republicans listened to the medicare trustees warnings and we passed a plan that would have saved medicare for another generation our plan increases medicare spending per beneficiary per medicare recipient each year from 4 800 last year to more than 7 100 by the year 2002 that is a total medicare spending increase of 62 percent so we increased medicare spending increased medicare health care choices by introducing the concept of managed care physician service organizations and of medical savings accounts while saving the program from bankruptcy unfortunately as i mentioned this is the legislation that the president vetoed last november in addition to saving medicare from bankruptcy we republicans are taking steps to aid senior citizens despite the president and the liberal house democrats as part of our contract with america we repeal the tax increase by the clinton democrats on social security benefits a tax increase that takes affect on social security beneficiaries earning as little as 3 400 per year we offer tax relief for longterm health care insurance premiums and a 1 000tax deduction for elder care as part of the gop balanced budget act again these are proposals the president vetoed we have passed legislation to increase the social security earnings test so that older americans can continue to work without punitive taxation and we passed a law that the president did sign protecting the rights of seniors to live in senioronly housing clearly colleagues and saving medicare is not one of the presidents priorities getting reelected is rather than preventing or joining with us to prevent medicares bankruptcy the president and the liberal house democrats prefer to play politics they seized on this issue to try to win back control of the house of representatives they are only interested in using this issue exploiting it for naked political gain this is a transparent grab at political power regaining political power as much as the president would like it medicares problems will not wait a minute until after the novembef election to be solved we republicans have a plan that will save the system for future generations of senior citizens and"], [1.7404556274414062e-05,

budget bill got even worse the gingrich republican budget reconciliation conference report cuts medicare by 270 billion in order to pay for a 245 billion tax break for the wealthy despite the fact that the medicare cuts are 3 times greater than what the trustees recommended in order to make medicare solvent the medicare premiums for seniors are doubled at the same time the wealthy are being given huge tax breaks working americans will get a tax increase that is a tax increase for working americans of 32 2 billion cut in the earned income tax credit 9 billion more than the housepassed bill and upon the date of enactment of this legislation medicaid is repealed and 36 million americans will lose guaranteed health insurance and longterm care the worst part of it in my opinion is this

i want to discuss two of the most critical issues facing this congress they are first the question of ethics the question of special interest influence on the peoples house and whether the peoples interests out there across america are being tended to in this house or only the special interests interests then there is the question of medicare the fact that within only a few days this house will be called to vote upon the republican medicare plan that is the pay more get less plan for the nations seniors and people with disabilities indeed not only do i want to talk about these two critical issues but to discuss what appears to be an interrelationship between the critical matter of the future of medicare and the 270 billion that the republicans have proposed to cut from it and this question of lobbyist and special interest influence as we look at the first question that of ethics and of lobby reform it was on day one of this congress from this spot that many of us were calling to change business as usual to call for a gift ban to call for lobby reform since that time we have had considerable talk of change indeed if talk was change i guess the capitol dome would be upside down by this point because we have had so much talk of change and yet when it comes to the basic way in which this congress operates there does not appear to have been a very considerable amount of change we made absolutely no progress on getting a gift ban no progress in getting new lobby registration laws but we did have considerable talk about how much things have changed the lobby registration laws were enacted the year that i was born in 1946 and many of us think that it is time for there to be real change in the way that the lobby is regulated there was talk of change and finally under considerable demand from members of the democratic party in the unitedstates senate that senate acted this summer by a vote of 98 to 0 both republicans and democrats coming together to reform the lobby registration laws those are embodied in senate bill 1060 and among other things this particular piece of legislation will close loopholes in existing lobby registration laws it will cover for the first time all professional lobbyists whether they are lawyers or nonlawyers whether they are inhouse or outhouse lobbyists and they will cover those who are lobbying the executive branch as well as those that are lobbying this congress furthermore this proposal will require disclosure of who is paying whom a very important matter with reference to lobbying and it will also require more detailed reporting of receipts and expenditures with reference to lobbying this is information that the american people need to know and should know in order to find out whether this congress is focused on their needs on the national and the public interests or focused only on the needs of a handful of washington special interests but despite the fact that the unitedstates senate republicans and democrats finally coming together to reform these lobby laws after 50 years what has happened here in the unitedstates congress on the house side on this side of the rotunda and the answer is there has been a little talk but there has been no action there has been talk about change but there has been no change we have had time to consider matters this afternoon like edible oil but we do not have time to consider what members of congress eat and drink and dine and wine with members of the lobby or the way that is reported there just does not seem to be time under this republican leadership to deal with these matters that i think are important to the american people indeed when it comes to the question of lobbies and lobby influence here the only real change that the republican leadership appears to have committed itself to until this time is that of affirmative action now i know some of you are out there saying wait a minute the republicans a lot of them are against affirmative action well you are wrong about that you have not had a chance to follow what has happened here in washington you see there may be some republicans that are against affirmative action on the basis of ethnicity on the basis of gender whether you are a woman and should have some affirmative action but there is very very strong support among this republican leadership for affirmative action based on party and they have spent much of this year going around to the washington law firms and lobbyists checking to see if they have 4 sufficient quota of republicans among the lobbyists that come over to this house some members of this house would not even see a lobbyist unless they are a republican so affirmative action is alive and well as long as it is on the basis of party and that has been the principal lobby reform that this particular house leadership has provided there is of course one second area and that is the one to which my colleague the gentleman from colorado referred to earlier and that is that many in this republican leadership have been extremely concerned about those very vicious lobbies the girl scouts catholic charities the ymca some of the other nonprofits that come to the congress from time to time not using federal money since there is a barrier to that but who may in the course of their public service work receive some federal grant for some other function and the mere fact that they might want to voice their concerns to this congress there is great determination to silence them from having any say at the same time that at least one commentator looking at the beginning of this congress with the new york times suggested that after the republicans took control of the house the relationship between lobbyists and legislators moved from discreet help to open collaboration and then they proceed to give a number of examples of the tremendous increase in influence that the paid lobby not the nonprofit lobby has had in this session of congress so it is little wonder that this republican leadership cannot find a minute this afternoon or tonight or tomorrow or next week or next month to deal with the question of lobby registration and reforming the laws that are nearly 50 years old with reference to lobbies and the way they influence this congress they do not have time for that and ofcourse the same is true with reference to the issue of gift bans with reference to the golf caucus of this congress which is not limited to the bemocratic or republican side but includes both whether or not members of this congress should be able to enjoy a lengthy vacation done under the name of attending a charity ski resort or whether they can be wined and dined every day by members of the lobby that issue of gift ban finally again after democrats passed gift ban through the last session of congress did it a couple of times and saw it killed over in the senate by the republicans well this year finally under democratic leadership the democrats and the republicans worked together and even though the senate is a majority republican body at present they came together and worked out a reasonable balance to the gift ban issue it does not prohibit every single gift but it gets at the excesses under this whole problem of gifts something this congress has not come fully to grips with in the past and that bill also passed unanimously once it got out of the light of day on the floor of the unitedstates senate and it has been sitting over here for some time at the speakers desk again there is a suggestion by the majority leader my colleague from texas mr armey that this house just does not have time at the moment even though it has time to deal with this very critical national issue of edible oils to deal with the issue of gifts and the oiling of the political process by lobbyists through freebies to members of congress well a newspaper in his district had this to say under the title wait a minute i am referring to the forth worth startelegram of october 3 it said hold up the praise for the house of representatives if you are a lobbyist take your favorite house member to lunch steaks for everyone you would expect them there at the stockyards in fort worth to be thinking of steaks for everyone and how about a golfing vacation for free the house leadership will not get to lobby legislation until next year which might mean 1997 next year being an election year thus do the republicans once in power act like the old democratic leadership which the fort worth startelegram criticized last year upon which these republicans heaped descriptions like arrogant the most fundamental changes have to do with reforming campaign finance and lobbying without that the qonservative chant about taking back our federal government is mere loose verbiage the words of a very conservative texas editorial writer with reference to this willingness to talk about edible oils without talking about the oiling of the political process in my hometown of austin tx in the daily texan last week a very i think thoughtful article under the title gop stalls on congressional ethics reform by kim bridges a student there at the university of texas he says gop stonewalling will not restore americas faith in their officials ethics reform despite what mr armey seems to be implying is not a trifling issue it is not a gift for the people but a vital act to relieve frustrations americans feel about the integrity of their government well put i would say with reference to this whole issue of gift ban and of lobby reform for when my colleague from texas speaks of the fact that he thinks we have to deal with the national issues first and maybe get around next year or the year after to lobby reform and a gift ban he has got it all backwards because you cannot really deal with the national issues unless you are willing to deal with the process that produces the judgment on that issue and we are going to see as i discussed the whole question of medicare how that is particularly important in this debate about the republican effort to cut 270 billion from medicare and oh yes there is of course least but certainly not last the whole question of ethics in this house as it relates to the work of the house committee on standards of official conduct i found quite alarming and have commented on it previously the comments of the chairman of that committee that the letter of the law is not compelling to me she said my goal is to have a process that the committee members feel good about and apparently the standard in the house committee on standards of official conduct is the feelgood standard not exactly the one that i think the american people who spoke out and said they wanted real change in this body had in mind the only encouraging thing has not come from the leadership but the fact that perhaps finally a few members of the house are willing to act in a bipartisan basis republicans speaking up and joining democrats to demand an independent counsel last week i was encouraged to read one of my new freshman republican colleagues saying for the first time in print that one of the biggest problems we have in this place is trust he referred to the public demand on congress for gift lobbyist pension and pac reform and he said that for that reason this concern of the american people to have trust in the most basic institutions of their democracy that probably right now and i am quoting probably right now i would try to go to an independent to an outside counsel were his words and indeed an outside counsel a truly independent counsel with full powers unrestrained to search in a bipartisan or a nonpartisan way really for the truth in the matter involving speaker gingrich is essential to the standard in this house and to removing the ethical cloud that has hung over this house from day one what about the issue of medicare and what does all this business about ethics about special interests influence have to do with the question of medicare and the fact that republicans think that americas seniors should pay more and get less should in fact not be able to have the protection that medicare was designed to provide them well for those of you who watched the cbs evening news last night you begin to get a picture of what is involved here and how this questitn of special interest influence that some want to defer until some day somewhere over the rainbow perhaps over the next election over the golden rainbow how all of that is related to this immediate question that will be taken up in the house on october 18 next week on slashing the medicare program by 270 billion for in this particular piece my fellow texan dan rather began the introduction of the piece and he said last night on the cbs evening news one key proposal would let medicare recipients opt for something called a medical savings account or a msa a sort of medical individual retirement account it is a controversial idea some have called it radical so you may be wondering how it got included in the republican plan and i am sure millions of americans are wondering how is it that this idea of experimenting on us with msas got in this republican plan in the first place there was nothing about it in the socalled contract on america where did they come up with this idea in fact indeed there was nothing in the contract on america about slashing medicare by 270 billion he goes on to say you can start in getting an answer to that with a company calling itself golden rule which apparently did unto others with an open wallet for the politically connected then they began something that they do on cbs called the reality check and turned to eric ingberg mr ingberg reported the following the stampede by republicans to anoint medical savings accounts as a miracle solution and indeed that is what it has been called a panacea a miracle solution to the needs of our seniors he says it owes much to one businessmans wellfinanced political crusade j patrick rooney the head of indianas golden rule insurance pioneered selling the msa type plans he originated a textbook campaign to promote msa legislation which could bring rich rewards to his company one early move giving money to the national center for policy analysis the think tank that developed msas that helped sell the idea to newt gingrich who in turn put rooney on his tv college lecture series one of the matters pending there in the ethics committee the particular group the national center for policy analysis has itself been involved not only in receiving money but in debating and supporting this msa concept in one recent television presentation not last night on national television one economist pointed out that a principal effect on msas would be to provide significant help to companies like golden rule insurance co that are currently experiencing a decline in market share were his words because they have failed to innovate they may have failed to innovate i am not sure but they certainly understand the legislative process because as mr ingberg reported last night then rooney and golden rule following a timehonored political custom opened their checkbooks they gave at least 157 000 to gopac gopac is the group that is currently fighting a federal lawsuit concerning disclosure of information about its contributors gopac has been very resistent to the idea of even letting their contributors be known and certainly to letting federal authorities question their contributors about whether gopac was perhaps an attempt to pervert the democratic process and completely circumvent federal election laws gopac is also the same group that paid for jet trips and nights in resort hotels for the speaker they paid for him and this was when he was a member of congress not actually serving as speaker they paid for a trip for him to bermuda in 1992 they paid for an 18day stay in the colorado rockies in 1989 they reportedly funded trips to promote a book that he wrote in 1984 they provided a copy of their mailing list for his campaign so this same gopac that got 157 000 from the golden rule folks has been pretty involved up here for a number of years indeed i found considerable irony in a report of the wall street journal on this whole matter of ethics reform that instead of doing something about a gift ban and a lobby reform this fall that speaker gingrich had advocated writing a paper you would think as many books as he has been able to write both fiction and nonfiction though sometimes when you look at them it gets confusing as to which is the fiction and which is the nonfiction when it deals with the way our government intertwines with the lives of ordinary americans but you vould think that a person who had time to write that many books for personal profit and pleasure would have had time to write all the papers in the world that he needed about the gift ban and the lobby reform that this congress of which he was a member passed not once but twice last year but which still as this congress is beginning in september of this year he still thinks we need to write a paper about the paper i do not know if it has been written there are certainly none presented the book sales are going on let me return to mr ingberg because he says in addition to the 157 000 to gopac the gingrich political arm another 45 000 went directly to the last two gingrich campaigns and in addition out of concern for the american people and what they know about the political process golden rule was golden in its rule and it sponsored the gingrich cable tv show he says gingrich insists himself that he likes msas because they work and it appears that they have worked very well for him and for gopac indeed continuing with the ingberg report from last nights cbs news golden rule would not talk to mr ingberg and he concludes his report by saying washington has its own golden rule money talks it is not exactly clear yet on the msa issue how loud eric ingberg cbs news washington i think that it is a good example of why when we are dealing with matters of public policy we need our lobby laws reformed we need gifts banned we need to be assured before we slash 270 billion from medicare that it is being done in the public interest and not in the selfserving interest of some insurance company someplace indeed an insurance company that the wall street journal has reported in september of this year that perhaps no other health insurance can cherrypick that is pick the best risk out and leave perhaps the taxpayers in the case of medicare with the balance no other insurance company the wall street journal reports can cherrypick its way to unusually high profits as well as golden rule insurance company screening insurance applicants carefully golden rule tries to sell policies only to the healthy or those whose existing medical problems can be exempted from coverage one of the real basic problems whether you are talking about golden rule or any other insurance company or no insurance company with these msas is that whole problem of leaving on the traditional medicare system as it sinks those who are least healthy and cherrypicking off the others into these socalled msas which may be more to the direct savings benefit of some of those who set up the plans than to those that might participate in those plans so it is the interrelationship between the need to make a break between the special interest and the public interest and the interrelationship between this sad circumstance and the debate that lies ahead within the next few days on the question of medicare and of medicaid october 18 a day 1 day in american maybe the states can make up for it history the only day in american his and take care of it in some way tory that this same republican leader in the course of transferring the medship that has been so closely tied with icaid problem to someone else instead golden rule is going to rule that the of assuming responsibility where it beamerican people and their representa longs as a national problem as a natives here in congress will have that 1 tional issue of providing a safety net to day to mark up on the floor of the the most vulnerable people in otir socihouse and decide the fate of the medi ety our seniors who cannot take care care system whether the medicare sys of themselves and are in nursing tem will follow the approach of the ma homes our people with disabilities who jority leader the gentleman from are in nursing homes today this retexas who said there in publican leadership has added to the texas earlier this summer that medi taking away adequate money they care is an imposition on his freedom have also taken away adequate health he would have never set it up in the and safety standards first place whether we follow the ap yes it was with considerable effort proach of eventually seeing medicare and after one scandal after another abolished as an imposition on some that states were not adequately policones freedom or we take the approach ing in fact i know from my service in that those of us from texas and else the texas legislature as a texas state where who supported the medicare cre senator that we uncovered with one ation in the first place that having the agency there in texas a pile of about security the health security in ones 600 complaints that had never even retirement years affords a certain been looked at with respect to some of freedom of itself these administrators in some of these there is closely linked of course to homes the medicare issue in this congress as yet after one problem after another it relates to seniors as it relates to it finally produced federal standards people with disabilities the question of to ensure the safety and health somemedicaid some people think of medic times not adequate standards but ceraid only as a program for poor people tainly better than what we would have it is true that the people who partici otherwise across this country for those pate in the medicare program are poor who are in nursing homes what does but in my state of texas three of this republican leadership do about every four residents of nursing homes those safety and health standards it are on medicaid that is the principal repeals them it repeals not just one financing system since a deficiency of that someone might find debatable or medicare which we should be out here questionable or not productive in astoday debating how to improve and suring health and safety we need to strengthen it instead of how to bleed it review all these regulations to see if dry but a deficiency with reference to they serve their purpose however the medicare is that it does not adequately republican leadership has a better cover longterm health care or pre idea instead of looking to finetune scriptions the medicaid program is the regulations and assure the health therefore turned to and safety of the millions of americans what is the solution that is being of who are in nursing homes they repeal fered to those three of four texans who all the regulations so that we will rely on medicaid to help them in nurs have the least common denominator ing homes being there i am sure since with reference to health and safety in i have yet to find anyone in this coun nursing homes try much less my home community of i suppose at a time when funds are austin tx who had as their ambition going to be cut back to those nursing to go into their nursing homes there homes one could hardly expect that are many fine nursing homes but most even the most concerned nursing home of the people if not every single one of would not be out there trying to figure them that are in nursing homes are in a way to cut some corners in order to there because they cannot take care of make a go of it yet at the same time themselves so those most vulnerable the money is going down the regulapeople in our society three out of four tions are being totally repealed we texans in nursing homes they are de leave the health and the safety of milpending on medicaid lions of americas most vulnerable senwhat does this same republican lead iors and individuals with disabilities to ership that could not find time to deal no federal protection whatsoever as i with lobby reform or ethics reform visited at austin this weekend people could not find them to complete an there were amazed were in a state of ethics investigation how is it that disbelief that a leadership could be so they propose to deal with medicaid the callous as to repeal every one of those safety net for those three out of four health and safety regulations texans and many many people across there is another aspect of it tlat is this united states they proposed to the fact that we will also no longer abolish medicaid to eliminate it they have any limitation with reference to say that they will replace it with cer compelling a spouse who has the mistain block grants to the states and fortune of no longer being able to atthen they will just transfer the pro tend to the needs at home of their gram along to the states of course loved one their husband or their wife they will not transfer enough money and have to place their husband and for the states to do it adequately but wife perhaps with alzheimers or with some other exceedingly difficult and troubling disability which takes an immense emotional toll on a spouse in any event but now in addition to that they could be forced to sell their home to sell their car in order to finance the spouse being in a nursing home under the way this plan is going to be revised some may think that that is just you know a possibility that might not be achieved but i had occasion this weekend in austin tx to talk with someone who faced a very similar situation i stood for a couple of hours out at a grocery store in north austin and held office hours there so people could come up and discuss with me their individual problems or discuss this great concern that so many of them have about medicare and medicaid carlene willy came up a university of texas employee and told me about the plight of her mother about the fact that when her mother had to go into a nursing home that she was forced to sell her house as a part of going into that nursing home in order to get approved for medicaid how she is struggling as an individual and does not really know if medicare costs go up considerably and we end up with this pay more get less republican plan and if at the same time the medicaid that provides financing for nursing homes that is blockgranted in a truly blockgranted hinted approach that if that happens she is going to be faced with a personal crisis because you see it is not only a question of how medicare affects our nations seniors and our nations millions with disabilities but it is a question of how it impacts the ordinary middleclass family or in her case a single individual how they are going to face the problems of making ends meet themselves in some cases taking care of their children and at the same time meeting a medical emergency or a need for longterm health care of a parent or a loved one of advanced years my problem as i listened to these stories at home of people concerned that we are about to junk one of the most effective programs this congress has ever set up medicare supplemented by medicaid when we hear then in washingtonhow the members of the republican leadership think they can fix up and doctor up medicare that the kind of doctoring they have in mind is the kind of doctoring done by dr kevorkian it just does not it seems to me that medicare or medicaid need any kind of mercy killing i think it needs to be strengthened and improved on a bipartisan basis not bled to death i guess that is perhaps another analogy there was a time in medical history a couple of centuries ago when doctors thought many elements could be treated by bleeding that seems to be the approach that our republican colleagues have taken to medicare they say it has some problems and it does and it needs attention though it is not a crisis situation but their solution is not to improve and strengthen medicare their approach is the approach used by the medical profession 200 years ago bleed the patient keep bleeding it in this case they want to bleed it to the tune of 270 billion in order to fund a tax break for the wealthiest people in this country 245 billion over the next few years eventually 600something billion in total tax breaks that are going to come out as a result of cuts or with the benefit of cuts from the medicare system with the slashing of the medicaid program to fund those tax cuts treat that patient by bleeding it and bleeding it and if bleeding does not work start amputating things which is what they are doing with reference to both medicare and medicaid i believe that as we look at this republican medicare plan and little looking has occurred because we have had the committee on ways and means only this week beginning to have a chance to mark up or chop up the bill that is going on perhaps this afternoon the medicare program is getting its first markup now and then in little more than a week it will be here on the floor of congress with only a day to debate it and then the american people will hear some discussion of the paymoregetless plan but itwill be perhaps only after a conference committee resolves the differences that we will know the full burden of that plan and what it will ultimately mean to the people of america before going into that i do need as a texan to point out one other thing about this medicaid debate and it is a particularly critical one for my state not just my state and that is the question of the formulas for as the state comptroller of texas has so ably pointed out throughout this debate this particular medicaid formula being advanced here in the house is going to provide the state of texas next year with 46 cents on the dollar 46 percent of the medicaid spending of new york state 298 per capita in texas 654 in new york by the year 2000 a texan will be worth 54 percent of what a person in new york is worth now i am confident that there are very significant needs in new york state with reference to the health of disadvantaged young people about 1 in 4 children in this country are on medicaid for their health care needs for disadvantaged seniors but why is it that a texan is only worth half as much as a person in new york i think all of these people are important and in need of health services but the formula that this house is being asked to approve gives us 50 cents on the dollar not even that next year in the state of texas and yet some of the texans that are in this republican leadership have blessed that plan which denies to texas and denies to many other states a recognition of the growing levels of people that come on to our medicaid program again when you shortchange texas as this plan does as our state comptroller has pointed out you again put the squeeze on nursing homes at the same time you take off the regulations you assure shortcuts you assure poorquality care and assure danger until another scandal comes along and someone says wait a minute that republican congress that was so zealous so extremist in 1994 has to repeal every single health and safety standard as to giving texas 50 cents on the dollarwith reference to its individuals with disabilities and seniors in nursing homesof what new york got we have to go back because we have had one scandal after another of people being found dead and diseased in nursing homes across this country we ought not to let that happen if we would address this formula and in fact address whether it is really in the interests of this country to shift the medicaid problem to the nations states instead of dealing with it here as a part of our responsibility to assure that every american would have the level of health care coverage that a member of congress would have then i think we would be doing a better job than getting mixed up in the formula debate in the first place but let us look now as a part of this republican paymoregetless plan at some of the things that are done with reference to differences between the senate and the house plans because i think ultimately we are going to get a little bit of both the republican plan as analyzed would appear to mean premium increases per month of about 18 over what we would otherwise have that does not seem like much to a lot of people but to the person who came along to see me out at the grocery store in north austin this weekend and had a sack of prescriptionsnot one of which was paid by medicare since medicare does not cover prescriptionsanother 18 a month is a mighty big chunk to have to take care of also the deductibles would be increased both the house and the senate plans increase premiums and the senate plan also cuts benefits and doubles deductibles from 100 a year to 210 a year now i understand that to someone making well over 100 000 here in the congress that does not seem like very much but if you are one of the women in this country the millions of women in this country who have nothing more than a social security check and a small one at that to pay for your health care and for your rent and for your prescriptions and your food getting that deductible increased so that you do not have medicare after you pay the first 100 you have to pay the first 200 or 210 before you have medicare i think what is going to happen is what people told me about yesterday when i was over at the conley guerrero senior activity center there in austin is that when they face that choice of whether to get health care many of those seniors are going to say well i believe i can wait i believe i can tough out the pain i do not believe that i can afford to eat and pay my rent and go get that additional care because i have to come up with 18 more a month in premiums i have to come up with 210 before it even does me any good and i believe i can put it off in many cases putting it off is going to do serious damage to the health of that senior who is not an expert in health care i think we need to be encouraging access to health care accessibility of that health care rather than erecting new barriers for those seniors i also found in my visits in austin considerable concern about the question of whether or not one would be able to continue to see their own physician many of these seniors have complex health care problems it is important once a physicianpatient relationship is established there are things that cannot be recorded in that funny handwriting you sometimes see the doctor makes on the chart there is a human connection between the health care provider between the physician and the patient seniors particularly have concern about havingthat relationship broken about having that relationship ruptured by what they call managed health care they are concerned about the quality and the contact with the health care individual i think that is a legitimate concern and one that is not being adequately addressed by this republican plan then the senate plan as you may know is a plan that would also instead of bringing down the age and covering more of those in our society who do not have health insurance the senate plan goes the other way it says well let us eventually not cover people who are 65 years old at all with medicare deny them all medicare coverage just as we are going to repeal all of those health and safety standards for the nursing homes deny it for those who are 65 deny it for those who are 66 entirely and raise the age to 67 i think that is the wrong direction in which to go these changes that are being proposed to be implemented this year through as bad as they are as farreaching as they are when they come up in this house on october 18 next week are not nearly so severe as where we are headed with reference to medicare you see the basic premise that these great reformers have with reference to medicare is the basic premise that medicare is an imposition on their freedoms that it was a mistake that is why over 90 percent of the republicans who are in congress in 1965 voted against it in the first place if you go back and you look at the debate 30 years ago you can just about read it today because they are saying the same thing today that those who opposed medicare were saying three decades ago i see the gentlewoman from colorado who has spoken so eloquently on these matters entering i have been discussing of course the interrelationship between the failure of this congress to deal with ethics continuing to postpone this investigation of the speaker continuing to defer action on lobby reform on gift reform and now the fact that we are about to get 1 day on the whole question of gutting and cutting medicare by 270 billion which may actually have as a principal benefit apply the golden rule to golden rule insurance companies providing significant savings to thosewho may prosper as private companies on this disintegration of the medicare system but may do nothing but cause great pain and harm and fear to the nations seniors and individuals with disabilities"], [2.3245811462402344e-05, 0.9999767541885376, 1, "i rise in strong opposition to the conference agreement on the budget that we have before us today like the republican budget proposal which passed the house last month this is a measure which seeks to pay for the republicans tax breaks for wealthy individuals on the backs of childrens nutrition and the elderlys medicare and at the expense of sound education health and welfare benefits the conference agreement worked out by the republicans is to say the least disappointing in this time of fiscal stringency it makes no sense for the republicans to continue to insist on providing costly unfair tax breaks to wealthier americans and corpora tions while cutting off programs which invest in our nations future our children and our people yet that is what this conference agreement does the size of the tax breaks is slightly different from the housepassed resolution now they cost 245 billion over just five years but they remain unfair and slated for enactment before the budget paper promises are close to being fulfilled surely the republicans do not expect the american people to believe that these huge unfair tax breaks which are a throwback to the failed economic policies of the 1980s will be an investment in our countrys future the republicans make this claim even as they plot deep cuts in student loan funds by 10 billion over seven years as they cut funding for education across the board which is one of the most important investments our country can make at a time when jobs demand more preparation and the cost of a college education is rising twice as fast as income cutting education funding is indeed a losing proposition we need to support education as a budget priority not as a political throwaway to pay for the wealthys tax breaks this conference agreement has it backward the gop budget further digs the deficit hole deeper with seventy billion dollars more for the pentagon wed to cold war mentality at the same time this is a budget which not only slams doors shuton americans wanting to gain an education but sadly decimates programs which provide a safety net for our nations elderly and poor the budget cuts 270 billion from medicare 182 billion from medicaid 100 billion from welfare programs and another 71 billion from other entitlement programs in the seven year republican paper promise to achieve a balance ironically economists can often predict 7 months in advance much less seven years into the future in the absence of any real explanation the republicans simply split the difference on the cuts to medicare and medicaid between the house and senate plans thus the amount of the cuts were arbitrarily set without rhyme reason or thought as to the consequences on people today without contemplating the effects the republicans today promise draconian cuts that will mean fewer benefits higher outofpocket costs for seniors and less choice of doctors this is the gop blueprint nearly 83 percent of medicare benefits go to seniors with incomes of 25 000 or less just think about what that does to seniors who rely upon the federal medicare promise the proposed reductions would have a devastating effect on these people likewise medicaid is the only major federal source of funding for longterm care and the proposed cuts will have drastic results for our nations seniors with over onehalf the benefits flowing to elderly americans the irony of this is that in the last congress the republicans refused to support meaningful comprehensive health care reform saying there was no crisis in health care now they have conveniently discovered ironically a slightly improved medicare trustees annual report and bemoan it as a crisis actually the 1995 report suggests a slight improvement over 1994 the gop is going to solve this health care crisis by cutting benefits to seniors and reimbursements to health care providers while giving tax breaks to wealthy americans this is not the approach that will protect and preserve medicare and the elderly and help finally to rationalize the health care system its an unfair plan its unworkable but no doubt the gop will score the political points and then try to dump the problem and duty on the president or the democrats the priorities outlined in this budget agreement are outrageous we ought to be offering hope by acknowledging the reality that the federal government needs to remain a partner in supporting the basic needs of our citizens the people we represent however what i am seeing is an erosion of support for working families and an eradication of support for those who cannot make ends meet in order to give wealthier folks unreasonable tax breaks republican paper promises and up front tax breaks with back loaded deficit reduction dont signify political courage as they would have us believe but political pandering yet another postponement of fiscal reality republican priorities are focused on change at the bottom line producing enough money for the republican tax breaks today for well off americans not empowering families and compounding the serious deficit problems for tomorrow this proposition will abandon the policy track of the 1993 democratic budget blueprintwhich is exceeding its promise a balanced democrat 1993 budget package of tax fairness and reductions in spending which would be a one trillion dollar deficit reduction in its seven year cyclethe republicans may have the votes to hatch this ploy but beyond the tax breaks no stomach to carry out the plot i urge my colleagues today to reject the gop scheme and get back to the real world of fiscal discipline not

congress this year is about choices it is about choices that the republicans have made for millions and millions of americans it is about the choice that they made to cut medicare by 270 billion it is about the choice they made in those medicare cuts medicaid cuts to remove nursing home standards for the protection of our elderly to remove our elderly from the entitlement of having nursing home care paid for if they and their families cannot afford it in the twilight of their lives it is about the choices that they made to cut 10 billion from student loans so that now americas students their families are deeper in debt to pay educational costs than any time in the history of this country it is about the choices that they made to cut the school lunch program and to cut back on nutrition programs for those who are the most vulnerable in our society those are the choices of the republican party in this budget reconciliation bill those are the choices that they made about this generation of americans those are the choices they made about that generation of americans that fought the world wars that fought the korean conflict that fought in vietnam who fought hard for democracy who fought hard to save western civilization in its time of need but the republicans are not prepared to fight for their medicare we should fight as hard for their medicare as they fought on the beaches of normandy or the beaches of iwo jima or okinawa or in korea but we are going to cut that medicare 270 billion why because the republicans did not want to make other choices they chose not to have highincome americans continue to pay their fair share in fact what they chose was what the wall street journal points out the choose to give them a tax cut as the wall street journal said to the rich of this country dont do anything yet but start salivating why should they start salivating because the tax bill passed on wednesday by the house of representatives could turn out to be the biggest tax saving bonanza in years for upperincome americans so we have 270 billion in cuts in medicare to pay for 245 billion in cuts to some of the wealthiest people in this country as we see under the republican plan 64 percent of the wealthy families in this country get a tax break but 86 percent of middleincome families get a tax increase or they pay the same those are choices that the republicans have made in this proposal they have chosen to give the wealthy the rich those who do not need a tax cut a tax cut they chose to pay for it by cutting the health care to our elderly by cutting the health care to our poor by cutting the health care to millions of americans children they chose to pay for it by cutting student loans and they chose to pay for it by cutting school lunches they chose to create millions of desperately poor americans so that they could take care of the wealthiest in this country they also chose to hold the defense department harmless everybody else has to contribute to balancing the budget but not the department of defense they also chose to hold harmless corporate welfare the large timber companies the large mining companies the large oil companies on which this bill lavishes billions of dollars in subsidies to those who do not need it to some of the most profitable companies in this country but those were the choices that the republicans made they chose to lead those people out of the sacrifice that millions of americans will be making in the coming years to balance the budget to balance the budget so we can have a prosperous economy but they chose that some would not have to enlist in that fight i say to my colleagues if youre very wealthy you wont have to enlist in that fight if youre a defense contractor you wont have to enlist in that fight if youre on the corporate welfare dole you wont have to enlist in that fight but if youre aged or if you are a student seeking an education or a child seeking

resolution before the congress today this is no time to be providing tax cuts to wealthy individuals and corporations while hurting the elderly the children and the working families of america we have heard for solong now the rhetoric of the republican majority promote the false notion that their mission to dismantle the federal government is based on a mandate of the american people my constituents however do not want to dismantle the federal governmentthey want smaller government that works better and is more efficient the american people want wasteful functions and programs eliminated they want programs that work to be left alone and they want fairness and equity in the allocation of limited federal resources the former democratic majority had been working to meet this mandate for at least the 4 years prior to last novembers elections it passed historic deficit reduction legislation in 1990 and 1993 that set a course for a stable budget and massive deficit reduction in 1990 the democratic majority broke the partisan logjam that prevented unified deficit reduction action on the part of a democratic congress and republican president in 1993 despite not one republican vote the democratic majority passed legislation that has brought our deficit down to its lowest level as a percent of the economy since 1979 these successes however were understandably not enough for a public weary of politicians and the status quo the american people said in last years elections they want change faster than democrats provided it is my belief therefore that the new republican majority had a tremendous opportunity to help enact much important and needed change it now appears that such an opportunity is lost it is lost because the republican majority not only targeted the wrong people and programs in their budget but because the party is mired in an ideology that promotes getting rid of critical federal programs and which demands tax cuts for the wealthy this ideology is driving the republican budget decisions to cut medicare and medicaid for the elderly cut education for our children cut job training for our workers cut economic development for needy communities and provide new tax loopholes to multinational corporations and individual millionaires and billionaires in this budget resolution republicans have chosen to target middleclass america without at least also targeting the hundreds of billions of dollars lost to this country from corporate welfare and tax loopholes which benefit the wealthy both liberal and conservative interest groups have recently put forth detailed and comprehensive studies of corporate welfare that should be eliminated but most proposals have been completely ignored by this budget resolution tax loopholes and corporate welfare are not the only things left untouched the resolution also leaves in plae wasteful defense spending and interational programs like the national endowment for democracy that have clearly outlived their usefulness in the postcold war era the republican majority is saying in this budget it wants a balanced budget by the year 2002 and provide tax cuts to the wealthy to fulfill a campaign promise no matter what the cost republicans claim that they are not cutting medicare and medicaid but they are saving a total of 475 billion in the two programs over 7 years that amount of money can be saved only through program cuts it is just that kind of doublespeak that has fostered the high level of cynicism and distrust of our government the cost of this budget resolution is certainly tremendous cuts in medicare and medicaid could increase outofpocket costs to the elderly by as much as 1 000 per year business would be forced to cut health insurance to workers because of higher premiums from costshifting by medical care providers more working families will be forced to drop health insurance altogether for hospitals who have a disproportionate amount of medicare and medicaid patients many will be forced to close in my district there are a number of hospitals where the percentage of patients served by medicare and medicaid exceeds 60 percent a full 61 percent of palmerton hospital patients 69 percent of patients at mercy hospital in nanticoke and a staggering 84 percent of shamokin area community hospital patients are served by these programs i do not think it is realistic to believe we can impose a 25 percent cut on these hospitals and have them still remain viable many hospitals will be forced to shift costs to persons who have insurance because of these cuts as a result more small businesses will be forced to cut or eliminate insurance altogether for employees more and more working families will be forced to chose between buying insurance and paying rent i already have more than 53 000 persons in my district without health insurance coverage how many more of my constituents will lose health care coverage because of shortsighted federal policies and inaction on health care reform sadly even with the largest budget cuts coming in the medicare program under the republican plan we do not even know in what direction they want to take the program under normal budget processes it would be the job of the committee on ways and means to decide precisely how to make the necessary changes to the program to achieve savings yet the republican leadership is trying to pass legislation that would require someone else to do their dirty work they are trying to pass the buck to a group of unelected medicare trustees who never until this republican congress was thought to have the responsibility to make decisions on preserving the solvency of the medicare trust fund in another critically important budget area republicans are proposing to eliminate most of the meager amounts this country spends directly on economic development the budget proposes to eliminate two agencies that play a critical role in economic development the economic development administration and the appalachian regional commission we spend less on these two agencies combined than we do on one b2 bomber what have these two agencies done recently for northeastern pennsylvania the eda has provided money to help build new buildings in nanticoke wilkesbarre and hazleton that serve as essential anchors for economic development and revival in these struggling towns substantial eda assistance is in the pipeline for expansion of an industrial park in luzeme county the eda and the arc help northeastern pennsylvania and other regions of the country that are struggling to attract scarce private economic development assistance without this type of public assistance smaller areas will either have to raise money themselves which many cannot or seek assistance from states where budgets are already stretched thin if we eliminate the eda and the arc along with cutting community development block grants and local housing assistance small economic markets will be at an even greater disadvantage tomorrow than they are today instead of saving economic development funds from cuts republicans provide more tax cuts and loopholes to the wealthy billions of dollars in new tax writeoffs are being offered to rich corporations people making more than 100 000 a year are being provided the opportunity to invest in taxfree retirement accounts and receive massive tax reductions on capital gains from the sale of stocks and bonds in all the wealthiest americans will receive a tax break of 20 000 under the republican tax proposals while the average tax break for middleincome families will be only 555 that meager 555 will be offset by higher health insurance premiums resuting from medicare cuts higher nursing home costs resulting from medicaid cuts and higher property taxes resulting from cuts in education and economic development middleincome families are going to be net losers under this republican budget resolution this budget resolution is bed plain and simple i would urge the republican majority to go back to the drawing board forget campaign promises and tax cuts for the wealthy and try and work with the president and democratic minority to fashion a good deficit reduction budget resolution i am confident that working together we can accomplish much more than we can working apart we must forget partisan politics

have expressed opposition to these proposals the majority is once again proposing fundamental changes in medicare and medicaid which i might say helps and empowers over 70 million americans gain access to health insurance their plan is to change the medicare and medicaid from programs which assure health care for those who need it to programs which limit federal spending to a defined amount in other words they are changing them from defined benefit programs to defined contribution programs congress should be acting to expand health care coverage and rein in escalating health care costs but instead republicans in this congress are focused on tearing our nations health safety net potentially adding millions more to the ranks of the uninsured at the same time the republican plan includes tax breaks from 124 billion to 175 billion over the 6 years and leaves the option open for even additional tax breaks such as the costly capital gains tax break the majority would not need to make such drastic cuts and changes in medicare and medicaid if they did not insist on providing tax breaks for the wealthy their plan will jeopardize health care for 623 000 minnesotans who are enrolled in medicare and 443 000 minnesotans that receive help from medicaid half of those are children in other words 220 000 children receive medicaid in minnesota in fact about 1 in 5 minnesotans relies on medicaid or medicare over a million people the republican medicare plan continues to essentially include the same policy proposals as last years plan drastically cutting payments to the providers restructuring the current programs and heavily relying upon untested medical savings accounts the medical savings accounts proposal has been predicted to cost at a loss to the medicare trust fund an estimated 15 billion because medicare funds would be given to healthier wealthier people who most often do not need medical care the claim of extending medicare solvency is only a pretext for the out of context policy the gop pursues the medicare part a program needs changing but the republican plan goes too far and in the wrong direction changing medicare from a reliable health care insurance for our seniors to a secondclass health care system for medicare recipients under the medicare plan seniors will pay more and get less the plan would allow doctors and hospitals to charge seniors above and beyond the established medicare reimbursement rate balancebilling will bottom the norm as providers shift more cost to the seniors the proposed cuts by the republican congress will show up as bills on the backs of the medicare elderly who earn an average of 10 000 or less yearly perhaps even more damaging than the medicare cuts are cuts and program changes planned for medicaid under the republican plan seniors people with disabilities and lowincome families who receive help from medicaid would be at risk of losing their coverage in addition states will be allowed to reduce their own share of funding for medicaid making the actual cuts more severe than they first appear twothirds of all nursing home residents receive help from the medicaid system to pay their nursing home bills the republican plan will allow states to target the assets of seniors children to help pay nursing home bills which average 38 000 per year again the plan is really nothing less than a form of costshifting the plan cuts federal expenditures but does not limit consumer costs in fact these programs were put in place to permit families to take care of themselves when a health care crisis occur now the changes being proposed would pull the plug on the 30year commitment to medicare and medicaid republicans have shown that they are indifferent to the elderly and willing to send the american working families and seniors the bill for tax breaks for the wealthy but these are not responsible or fair priorities for our nations future the american people expect shared sacrifice not

generous words of concern about our colleague and friend the gentleman from ohio tony hall and his entire family we do not object to the rule for the consideration of h r 3756 the treasury postal service and general government appropriations bill for fiscal year 1997 however i must say that for an open rule it looks and sounds very complicated it does waive several house rules as the gentleman has said that are violated by provisions of the bill including the prohibitions against unauthorized and legislative provisions in an appropriations bill and against reappropriations as we have been with other legislation we are especially concerned about the waivers the rule provides of points of order for the bills failure to comply with sections of the congressional budget act the three important provisions of the budget act being waived are section 302 f which prohibits consideration of legislation that exceeds the committees allocations of new entitlement authority section 308 a which requires a cost estimate in the committee report on legislation containing new entitlement spending and section 401 b which prohibits consideration of legislation providing new entitlement authority that becomes effective before the start of a new fiscal year the waivers appear to be technical in nature and the provisions in the bill that are being protected are we are told minor for instance they make changes in certain voluntary separation incentives and retirement and annuity requirements and permit the unitedstates mint to set up a demonstration project however we bring this up again because the budget act waivers are appearing more frequently in the rules we being to the floor we strongly urge committees to be more careful in including provisions in bills that require budget act waivers they should make every effort to comply with the provisions of the budget act and the rules of the house and we would hope that the majority would be careful about the practice of continuing the waiving of these important safeguards on an almost routing basis the rule also selfexecutes and amendment striking certain expedited procedures that are under the jurisdiction of the committee on rules in addition it makes in order as the gentleman stated three amendments and protects them against points of order some of us feel not the gentleman from florida but some of us that two of these amendments one dealing with the drug czars office and another capping the number of socalled political appointees in the executive branch are purely political in nature and really do not belong in this debate the fact that the majority has seen fit to allow and protect those amendments is a certain and inescapable sign that this is an election year the same observation holds for the third protected amendment which continues the freeze on cost of living adjustments for members of congress and other government officials we know how difficult it is to oppose the cola freeze but i would caution my colleagues about being so intent on denying modest cost of living adjustments they are not raises they are cost of living adjustments to people who the great majority of them at least work very hard for long hours and are committed public servants the wisdom of this parsimony is questionable and may come back to haunt this body and this government we ought to question seriously whether the minuscule savings from this pay freeze are worth the effects the level of pay is no doubt a serious disincentive to potential candidates who are well qualified for this and other jobs we need to be concerned about the relatively low level of pay and the level of competence of the people who are both attracted to run for office and to accept appointments for jobs in the executive and judiciary branches as well this is fortunately an open rule because we strongly oppose many portions of the bill itself the bill represents a continuation of the majoritys belief that government needs to be downsized frankly we are concerned that the appropriations in the bill inadequately fund some of the most basic functions of our government including tax collection and compliance both of which are of course essential to our effort to balance the budget especially egregious are the unwise and unprecedented funding for the internal revenue service and the legislative initiatives in this appropriations bill that would gravely affect the irs we are puzzled by the inadequate level of funding which is 1 4 billion below the presidents request and a cut of 776 million from last years appropriation for an already fiscally strapped agency the bipartisan leadership of the committee on ways and means in fact has joined the administration in expressing serious opposition to those cuts which they say and i quote a letter from the gentleman from texas chairman archer seriously impair the irss ability to perform its core responsibilities it is difficult to understand why the committee on appropriations would so drastically cut funding for the very agency that is responsible for bringing in the revenue that will help reduce the deficit and balance the budget no matter what the concerns are about the features of the computer system the irs has admittedly been struggling to set up this damaging cut along with the requirement that the department of defense the military handle the new computer system for the irs is no solution at all to the problems many members do believe exist there we ought to be finding ways to help the irs enforce our tax laws in a fairer and more efficient manner instead of so severely underfunding the very agency that congress expects to collect taxes to fund every other program we approve many of us are also deeply disappointed that h r 3756 continues the prohibition on federal employees choosing a health care plan that provides a full range of reproductive health services including abortion in 1993 we wisely i think reversed that policy that had been in place for about a decade the continuation of last years prohibition threatens the right of federal employees to choose to have an abortion a right that has after all been guaranteed by the supreme court and discriminates against women in public service abortion is not illegal congress should not be taking action to make it more difficult to obtain or more dangerous to obtain i regret that we are taking one more step against assuring all women the right to a safe and legal abortion we are also disturbed by the level of funding for the federal h7614 co election commission the agency that is responsible for enforcing our campaign finance laws and what that will mean to improving the current inadequate enforcement of our campaign finance laws the fec is already operating under severe budgetary constraints and this bill will severely hamper its ability to carry out its responsibilities to assure the integrity of elections in this country it should be obvious that the fec is understaffed and needs far more resources than it currently has that is especially true in this presidential election year it seems especially ironic that in the same week we will take up socalled campaign finance reform legislation we shall also apparently deny the fec the type of increase in funding that it needs in fact the committee on appropriations has directed a reduction of three employees from the fec press office which now only has five fulltime employees this move will obviously cut the fecs press office which is in charge of the commissions disclosure role by more than half it seems to us that the last thing we should be doing during this highly ballyhooed reform week is making it more difficult to get information out to the public about campaign spending we should in short be very concerned about how the bill treats the fec we talk constantly about the need to protect our process and keep it as free as possible of outside special interests but the provisions of the bill that affect the fec are clearly attempts to reduce the effectiveness of the one agency that has the responsibility for overseeing in some objective fashion the election process the bill has a number of other questionable provisions including the restrictions on the operations of what we hope to be a newly invigorated office of national drug control policy the provisions that will permit certain convicted felons to sue to regain their firearm privileges and overall the inadequate level of funding for some of the most basic functions of our government because of the urgency many feel to balance the budget some of the agencies funded in this bill simply will not have enough money we fear to carry out their responsibilities in a proper manner in any event and as i said at the outset we do not oppose the rule we welcome the opportunity it gives us to address some of the more unacceptable provisions of the bill i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.991366446018219,

more are just a pinkslip away from losing all of their health care coverage there are provisions in h r 3103 that i support i agree that it is high time congress acts to correct some of the more egregious practices of insurance companies denying insjurance to individuals because of preexisting conditions genetic information or a history of domestic violence is outrageous it is a good start to ban these practices ive supported legislation that would correct these policies ive authored legislation that would prohibit using domestic violence as a risk factor ive also cosponsored the kennedykassebaumroukema health care reform bill which has the support of senate republicans and democrats as well as the president the democratic substitute would replace h r 3103 with language from the kennedykassebaumroukema bill this bill would expand access to health insurance for americans by increasing portability and limiting insurance companies ability to deny coverage because of preexisting conditions the political consensus for the kennedykassebaumroukema bill means that it could become law in a matter of weeks but h r 3103 embraces controversial divisive policies that doom any chance of insurance reform and minimal health security for the american people as a longtime advocate of fiscal responsibility i must oppose the provisions in this bill establishing generous medical savings accounts the msas would result in a significant loss of taxpayer doilars without a substantial revenue offset under this bill individuals could deposit up to 2 000 annually and families up to 4 000 in taxfree msas the joint committee on taxation has estimated that this provision alone would cost the unitedstates taxpayers approximately 2 billion this flies in the face of the deficit reduction goals to which this congress purports to aspire the republican leadership counters that the bill contains budgetary savings to offset the revenue loss from msas this assertion is laughable and cynical the budgetary savings are achieved through reforms in the medicare programthe health plan for americas senior citizens this is the same medicare program that the republicans claim is in such a dire financial crisis any savings achieved through medicare reforms should be used to shore up the medicare trust fund failing that these savings should be used to lower deductibles and increase benefits for medicare beneficiaries it makes no sense to use this savings to offset a tax break for the limited number of individuals who can afford msas individuals who choose to open msas will likely be healthier wealthier and younger than average unfortunately the majority of the medicare population is among the older and sicker and would not benefit from msas the republican leaderships bill would therefore steal money from medicare recipients to pay for tax breaks for healthier americans ironically h r 3103 would also remove state oversight and replace it with federal regulation to advantage insurance companies this would be a severe blow to the states rights movement for the past year we have heard republicans disparage the role of the federal government yet under

the vice president this morning on the news shows and other cabinet members on the news shows all pushing the latest white house line unfortunately what they push and the rhetoric that comes across is totally separate from the facts this socalled radical extremist republican budget over the next 7 years increases spending 2 6 trillion increases in revenues to the government of 3 3 trillion spending will grow between now and the year 2002 under the republican radical extremist budget spending will grow from 1 514 trillion in this current year to 1 844 trillion in 2002 a 22percent increase medicare spendingwhich i am sure everyone has heard from the president and his spokespeople that is going to produce dramatic cuts throw people on the street throw the elderly out of their nursing homes and so forthmedicare spending will increase in that 7year period 61 percent from 178 billion in 1995 to 286 billion in 2002 medicaid spending will grow at a 41percent increase total welfare spending will increase 38 percent food stamp spending will increase 45 percent supplemental social security income 69 percent earned income tax credit spending 22 percent foster care spending 86 percent this is the radical extremist republican budget if we look a little more specifically at medicare i think we can begin to understand the length to which the president and members of his party will go to radically alter the news that is being presented to the american people to put their political spin on something that is totally opposed by the facts of the situation republicans are addressing the medicare spending issue because the presidents own trustees report in april 1995 stated the following the medicare program is clearly unsustainable in its present form we strongly recommend that the crisis presented by the financial condition of the medicare trust funds be urgently addressed on a comprehensive basis including a review of the programs financing methods benefit provisions and delivery mechanisms that is the medicare trustees report of april 1995 incidentally three of those trustees are members of the presidents own cabinet our party has stepped forward in a responsible way to address this alarming report it has done so by recognizing that unless we slow the growth of medicare from its current threeplus times the rate of inflation to around two times the rate of inflation we will not successfully even begin to address the concern raised by the trustees report we are not the only ones who think that something needs to be done on october 5 1993 the following statement was issued today medicaid and medicare are going up at three times the rate of inflation we propose to let it go up at two times the rate of inflation that is not a medicare or a medicaid cut so when you hear all this business about cuts let me caution you that that is not what is going on what republican said that because that is exactly what republicans have attempted to do so when you hear all this business about cuts this person said let me caution you that is not what is happening what is happening is that we are reducing the rate of growth from three times the rate of inflation to two times the rate of inflation that statementwas made by the president of the united states william jefferson clinton in october 1993 you would never know that today because what is coming out of the white house is the exact opposite of that statement we are also talking about the level of premium at 31 5 percent that is what it is currently today you see this country offers an extraordinarily generous benefit program for those 65 and older called medicare part a of medicare hospitalization is 100 percent covered and part b which provides for doctors fees and other nonhospital costs is paid for to the extent of 69 5 percent by the taxpayer we are asking the elderly for that part b coverage only to cover 31 5 percent that is the current rate that we are asking them to pay their part their share of the program and the gop budget plan requires that that stay at that level does not increase it but asks that it stay at that level but what the president would like to do is revert it back to a level of 25 percent we are saying given this trustees report this is not responsible can we just ask those currently under medicare to maintain their same level of support that is the socalled cut that the white house and the president or those who speak for him are talking about and it is not a cut ironically in the year 2002 under the republican plan medicare recipients will pay a 90amonth premium if current increases in medicare costs are as projected under the presidents plan they will pay 382amonth premium an 38 difference this is what is labeled as throwing people out of nursing homes on the street without medical care these are the cuts the socalled cuts in medicare when we debated the balanced budget amendment earlier this year we were told by member after member of the democratic party on the other side of the aisle that balancing the budget was an absolute imperative and i want to quote some of them i will not give their names the budget is not going to be balanced in 2002 unless the responsible people that is those of us in the congress in 1995 start to focus on their share of the work words on a piece of paper cannot balance the budget only legislators like you and i can said another senator a third said lets go on the record democrats and republicans alike that we are serious about deficit reduction we are serious about balancing the budget because i think that we all are another said i believe a balanced budget is the correct policy decision for this country another said let senators get to work and show americans we have the courage this amendment presumes that we lack republicans had the courage they came forward with a balanced budget plan enacted over a 7year period of time because a 4 9 trillion debt is irresponsible legislating the rate of growth of our debt is staggering it imposes a burden on the american economy and on the future and future generations that is immoral we have come forward with a plan our friends and colleagues from across the aisle did not bring forward a plan and what little attempt they made out of the white house was discounted by the very scoring agency that the president asked us to use so now here we are with a plan a plan to deal with one of the most serious financial crises this country has ever faced it is not a radical plan it is not an extremist plan it is a responsible plan and for the first time in decades in response to the call of the american people in november 1994 we are beginning to rein in the outofcontrol growth of government for the first time in decades we will actually limit the rate of growth of government finally the congress under the leadership of the republicans has proven that they can deliver on the promises made to the american people to balance the budget several weeks ago mr president i stood on this floor discussing and debating the reconciliation bill which we were about to pass that bill that combines a number of efforts to reach our goals for putting in place the process of responsible spending and balancing the budget and i said the reconciliation bill we are debating not only makes sense it makes history for many of us a balanced federal budget is a distant memory for decades it has been an empty political promise all that remains is one final act of courage and vision i went on to say that courage will be tested in the congress by some difficult choices and that vision will be measured in the president as he becomes either a partner or a partisan if either he or we are unequal to the task the patience of the public will be exhausted and we will have squandered a unique opportunity and we will feed a dangerous disillusionment with american politics that moment is here that time for courage is here the courage has been met by the republican budget plan republicans stand today and say mr president we have a plan we have responded to the callyour call our colleagues callto be responsible and balance this budget but the vision called for and necessary on the part of the president has not been met there is no vision beyond november 1996 the vision is to reelect the president at whatever cost the vision is to make sure that the presidents campaign succeeds regardless of what he has said in the past regardless of his rhetoric just a few short weeks ago it appeared we were on a path to negotiating a sensible plan to balance this budget with the presidents support if you looked at what the president said and what he called for it was very close to what the republicans enacted but then someone determined that the president needed to have his weak vacillating character firmed up and so the whole plan was thrown out the window now we are in an exercise of what i think is the utmost in political cynicism of making sure that the presidents political posture is the kind of posture that will be necessary to inch him up in the polls so that he can be reelected in november of 1996 the courage of the republicans in providing a plan which yes includes tough choices but yes responds to a desperate need a need to get control of a government that for years and years and years has been simply out of control that plan is before us but that plan is before us without the vision of the executive branch and particularly of the president so while the democrats continue their efforts to tear this bill apart piece by piece we have to remember that the centerpiece of what we are attempting to do is to balance this budget in the future this will be recalled as our contribution to history if we ignore this budget crisis this country and future generations will pay dearly i think the argument for a balanced budget comes down to something simple it is one of our highest moral traditions that parents sacrifice for the sake of their children and it is the depth of selfishness to call on children to sacrifice for the sake of their parents if we continue on our current path we will violate a trust between generations and we will earn the contempt of the future this is our moment this is our time it will take courage and it will take vision let us trust that both the congress and the president will have an ample amount of each in order to accomplish what i think we all know needs to be accomplished mr president i thank you and i yield the floor"],
