frustration that we are feeling on this side of the aisle as the gentleman from new jersey has so readily done on a weekly and daily basis here in the house i rise today to express my outrage and my disappointment as a freshman member of this house with the actions or should i say the inaction of this body we are more than twothirds of the way through this session and the republicanled congress has had no major accomplishments this is despite the efforts from within their own party and by democrats working together to pass meaningful hmo reform school construction legislation and even a minimum wage bill instead the republican leadership has been playing games with the budget giving tax cuts to the wealthiest 1 percent of the people in this country and their special interest friends blocking meaningful attempts at gun safety legislation and taking money away from class size reduction and new teacher initiatives as a freshman i arrived last january prepared for action and believed that with gop promises of less partisanship that we could all work together to help the american people yet the last 10 months have been partisan and without any intelligible agenda instead the special interests and their whims have dominated leaving the american people out in the cold rather than passing a meaningful tax bill complete with estate tax and marriage penalty changes and modest tax cuts the republican leadership pushed through a tax package thatbenefited only the wealthy and corporate special interests almost 1 trillion to the wealthiest in this country in fact if you are not in the top 1 percent of wage earners the tax cuts would not mean anything to you or very very little now maybe all the constituents in republican districts make that kind of money but the working class people in districts like mine do not why not provide a family of four living in a place like new york city a high cost place like new york city in the bronx in queens in my district earning 40 000 annually some tax relief what is wrong with that well it is probably because they will not be contributing to the republican leaderships political action committee this year or next year what about our patients bill of rights we finally voted today on a motion to go to conference on the bipartisan patients bill of rights it has been 4 weeks since the house passed by an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 275 to 151 the norwooddingell bill the senate appointed conferees back on october 15 and yet it is only today november 2 that the house gop leadership is finally bringing up a motion to go to conference as far as i can see this delay strategy by the gop leadership is their attempt to stop the momentum that was obtained by very strong bipartisan vote in favor of the norwooddingell hmo reform bill why are we stopping what members of your party want what the american people overwhelmingly want why are we stopping it we cannot even get on the runway or get off the charts a prescription drug bill to reduce the cost of prescription drugs to our senior population let me tell you a story that i heard recently i received a letter from two constituents mr and mrs done and gertrude schwartz of long island city in queens he is 89 and she is 84 years of age recently he went to have a prescription filled for his wife he bought 100 tablets of prilosec an extremely popular drug among our seniors it cost him 394 89 394 for 100 tablets of a vitally needed prescription people are making life and death decisions as to whether they will pay the rent buy needed groceries or skip a day of taking a needed prescription drug or simply not buying the prescription drug at all and we are here in congress doing nothing as far as i can see to help them then there is the budget debacle we are 34 days into a new fiscal year and still we do not have a budget what is the republican solution to send the exact same d c appropriations bill that we have seen vetoed twice to the floor again today without removing the riders that caused the vetoes in the first place it makes absolutely no sense to me the republican leadership did not even bring to the floor the laborhhs appropriations bill for a debate they went straight to conference without any democrats represented at all at any point in time but having said all i have said it is education that is most troubling to me we passed ed flex which impacts the elementary and secondary education act before we even considered esea reauthorization then the republican breakup of esea into pieces passing the flawed teacher empowerment act and i want you to know this was not supported by one not one teachers organization we just passed a dramatically underfunded title i bill when crafting tax packages the republican majority will not even consider adding school construction assistance even though our deteriorating school infrastructure and classroom overcrowding is a national crisis then we have social security republicans say they want to save social security well we will just go back to history a little bit here back in 1935 in the early thirties nearly 40 percent of americans were dying in poverty it was a democraticled congress and a democratic president who signed into law the current social security system this despite fierce opposition from the republican party in fact all but one republican in the house voted for a motion to recommit title ii of the bill to conference and would have thereby struck the social security act and killed social security as we know it today only one republican in that entire conference now we are to expect that the republicans are going to protect and save social security something they never wanted in the first place in fact let me just show you some of the comments made by majority leader dic armey when he ran for congress proposing to abolish the social security system ultraconservative economics professor dick armey who has based his campaign on his support for the abolishment of social security the federal minimum wage law the corporate income tax and the federal aid to education that is from united press international october 31 1984 again we see mr armey in 1984 said that social security was a bad retirement and a rotten trick on the american people he continued i think we are going to have to bite the bullet on social security and phase it out over a period of time see that is the republican side of this issue they never wanted it in the first place i do not see how we can expect them to save it the american people do not want this they do not want a partisan congress living up to its donothing billing i urge you to work with the president and the democratic leadership to craft budget bills we can all support i implore you to let the majority rule and move the bipartisan norwooddingell bill on to the president unchanged finally i want to invite you to come to my district and tell the students that are being taught in closets in hallways tell the children in kindergarten classes with 60 kids and two teachers tell those children going to school in buildings that arestill burning coal that they do not need to have school modernization provisions added to any tax bill now i know there are very decent people on the republican side of the aisle i have had the pleasure to work with so many of them in this my first term in congress and i can call many of them my friends but i am not giving up on the rest of you either but we need to work together we need to end the partisanship and do what is right for

save the entire surplus until weve taken care of social security and medicare no one believes the house can approve the appropriation bills that would be drawn from this budget template do we want a

risky tax cut measure before us today i urge my colleagues to support representative tanners motion to recommit the bill to committee where it can be improved should that motion fail we must reject this irresponsible bill the leaderships bill eagerly spends a surplus that may never materialize it commits almost the entire nonsocial security surplus to tax cuts ignoring other critical needs like reducing our 5 6 trillion national debt it jeopardizes funding for education veterans benefits agriculture and other basic programs which will have to endure huge cuts over the next ten years if these tax provisions are enacted it spends hundreds of billions of dollars that i had hoped we would use instead to reform and strengthen medicare and provide a prescription drug benefit making it extremely unlikely that medicare solvency can be ensured without slashing benefits or increasing costs for our senior citizens the bill also directs twothirds of its tax cut benefits to the wealthiest 10 of americans and close to half of the cuts would benefit the richest 1 of taxpayers with incomes exceeding 300 000 and although the price tag attached to this bill is staggering enough it pales in comparison to the costs that will result once all of its provisions are in full effect a decade from now from 2010 to 2019 this tax package would cost the treasury 2 8 trillionseveral times the initial cost of the bill and a burden that cannot possibly be borne while maintaining adequate funding for domestic programs and continuing to pay down our debt like many of my colleagues i support certain provisions in the leaderships bill including in particular the phaseout of the estate tax and the elimination of the marriage penalty in fact i am a cosponsor of standalone bills that would accomplish both of these goals but i simply cannot ignore this reckless and dangerous use of a budget surplus that should be divided among several equally important needs rather han snatched up before it even exists and lavished on the wealthiest americans at the expense of programs that benefit our working families and elderly due to some of these same concerns i will also vote against the democratic substitute although this alternative is a more responsible and targeted approach it still makes the dangerous assumption that a large surplus is guaranteed for the next ten years and beyond if this does not prove to be the case we will all suffer when our debt continues to spiral out of control funding is no longer available for some of the most basic federal programs and the solvency of social security and medicare becomes a goal that is no longer in reach the yea vote i cast today will be for representative tanners motion to recommit this bill to the ways and means committee the motion mirrors the fundamental principles of the blue dog budget that i along with a majority of democrats and 26 republicans supported earlier in the year this motion changes none of the specific provisions in the majoritys bill instead it simply requires the committee to reduce the overall tax cut to onequarter of the onbudget surplus and to create a debt reduction account to ensure that half of the onbudget surplus is preserved for reducing our debt altering the bill in this way would ensure that when there is a surplus there will also be a generous tax cut but it will also allow us to be secure in the knowledge that our debt will continue to be reduced and that our children and grandchildren will not have to shoulder the burden of our recklessness i consider myself extremely fortunate to have entered congress at a time when the tough choices made by my colleagues and predecessors who balanced the budget in 1997 are beginningto yield tangible results i now consider it my duty to maintain the fiscal responsibility that led us to this point and ensure that we do not recreate massive deficits like the ones weve just escaped from we all want to reward hardworking american families by returning some of their tax dollars but i cannot in good conscience do this at the expense of our future fiscal health therefore i will support the motion tb recommit because i believe americans deserve a responsible tax cut when we are sure we have the money to pay for it but i will vote against h r 2488 because i also believe americans deserve a balanced federal budget a solvent

years we have asked a pretty fundamental question and that is is it right is it fair under our tax code a married working couple where both the husband and wife are both in the workforce a married working couple with a twoincome household pay higher taxes under our tax code than an identical couple with identical income who choose to live together outside of marriage is it right is it fair is it fair that under our tax code that 25 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married of course not the goal of this legislation i am proud to say is to wipe out the marriage tax penalty almost entirely for 25 million married working couples i think it is pretty fiscally responsible to take onehalf of 1 percent of a 2 2 trillion surplus to eliminate the marriage tax penalty to listen to my friends on the other side of the aisle you think we would be breaking their piggy bank to take onehalf of 1 percent of a 2 2 trillion surplus to help 25 million married working couples who pay higher taxes jut because they are married i for one and i am pleased to say that 222 republicans and we were joined by 48 democrats who broke with their leadership who believe it is time to eliminate the narriage tax penalty that this house has voted to send to the senate today we are voting on theagreement between the house and the senate we hope the president will join with us to eliminate the marriage tax penalty let me introduce a couple of constituents from the south suburbs of chicago which i represent shad and michelle hallihan they are public school teachers shad is at joliet high school and michelle is at manhattan junior high school their combined incomes are about 62 000 they pay just around 1 000 in marriage tax penalty just because they are married under our tax code now this photo was taken when they were married it was about the time we introduced our legislation about 2 years ago since then shad and michelle have had a little boy little ben and little ben of course is this little guy we hope some day he does not have to pay the marriage tax penalty our hope is for his parents we can eliminate it this year i would point out under this legislation we provide middleclass tax relief for middleclass couples like shad and michelle hallihan this year because our legislation is effective january 1 of 2000 so if the president would join with us to eliminate the marriage tax penalty for 25 million married working couples shad and michelle hallihan would see their marriage tax penalty eliminated this year now under our legislation we do several things we double the standard deduction for those who do not itemize to 8 800 twice that for single filers we also widen the 15 percent bracket to help those who do itemize shad and michelle hallihan are also homeowners and because they are homeowners they itemize their taxes and the only way to help people middleclass families who own a home or give to church or charity or their synagogue is to widen the 15 percent bracket so that they too can receive marriage tax relief under our proposal we eliminate the marriage tax penalty suffered by shad and michelle hallihan think about it in joliet illinois the marriage tax penalty of 1 400 the average marriage tax penalty is one years tuition at our local community college it is 3 months of day care for little ben at a local child care center in joliet it is 3 000 diapers for little ben but it is also if we also think about it if shad and michelle had that money that they currently pay in the marriage tax penalty were able to set it aside in an education savings account for little ben by the time ben is 18 they would have been able to set aside almost 20 000 that they currently send to uncle sam they could put in little bens college fund that is what marriage tax relief means for the hallihans now we have heard a lot of excuses from our good friends on the other side let us do just a little bit so we can say we have done something we have other priorities we want to spend it on but think about this one half of 1 percent of a 2 2 trillion surplus is being given back to middleclass working married couples like shad and michelle hallihan so they can take that marriage tax penalty that currently goes to washington gets spent on other things and use it to take care of their families needs little ben in particular so let us do the fiscally responsible thing let us help middleclass workingmarried couples who suffer the marriage tax penalty there are 25 million of them that is almost 50 million taxpayers who pay higher taxes just because they made the choice of getting married my hope is the president will join with us and sign this legislation the president joined with us when he changed his mind on irs reform he was opposed to it decided to support it he was opposed to balancing the budget now he takes credit for it he was opposed to welfare reform now he takes credit for it my hope is the president will join with us and sign the elimination of the marriage tax penalty the legislation we are going to hopefully pass today we will certainly share the credit with him because

five appropriations bills because he says they do not spend enough yet the president has not offered a single solid proposal to pay for those spending increases it appears the president may be willing to spend social security dollars to pay for his spending projects congress and the president are faced with a very clear choice ask federal agencies to save one penny just one penny of a dollar in waste fraud or abuse so we can protect social security or give in to the big washington spenders and raid seniors social security dollars amazingly enough there are still people in washington that do

of waste in order to protect social security dollars so many seniors so many seniors rely upon let me present my colleagues with some examples of waste fraud and abuse that we have found in the

waste over 20 billion annually another the department of education maintains a 725 million slush fund which it cannot account for the department of housing and urban development hud estimated it spent 857 million in 1998 in erroneous rent subsidy payments in fiscal year 1998 about 5 percent of the entire program budget let me close with this for a moment and that is delays in disposing of more than 41 000 hud properties cost taxpayers more than 1 million per day these are all examples of how congress and the president can find one penny 1 percent out of a dollar in waste fraud and abuse in the

advertisements that are paid for by the health care industry they want the american people to think that the program the democrats are propounding is a big government plan there could be nothing further from the truth what does this have to do with big government a woman by the name of gail rattigah from henderson nv writes i am a registered nurse who recently cared for an 82yearold woman who tried to commit suicide because she couldnt afford the medications her doctor told her were necessary to prevent a stroke it would be much more cost effective for the government to pay for medications that prevent more serious illnesses and expensive hospitalizations these include but are not limited to blood pressure medications antistroke anticoagulants and cholesterol medications the governments current policy of paying for medications only in the hospital is backward get into health promotion and disease promotion and save money this is a registered nurse from henderson nv i want everyone on the majority side to know they are not going to be able to come over and make these statements as if there is no opposition to it what my friend from tennessee says is wrong he states he has gotten all of these letters saying i am against the big government plan that is because of the radio and tv advertisements from the powerful health insurance industry but the real people are like the 82yearold woman who wanted to commit suicide because she couldnt get medication also i want to spread across this record that my friend from tennessee who came and said we need the republican plan makes the statement that he wants to involve senator breaux in this the majority cant have it both ways they either support the bush plan the plan of the person running for the president of the united states on the republican ticket or they dont support the nominee it appears what my friend from tennessee is doing is trying to have it both ways because the senator from louisiana does not support governor bushs plan the majority realizes that their medicare plan simply can not work because of their nominees 1 6 trillion tax cut proposal senator breaux pointed this out quite clearly today my point is i say to my friend from north dakota people who come here and make statements on the floor need to have substantiation i say the senator from louisiana does not support the bush medicare plan i also say the majority has introduced a proposalso we understand it but it is a medicare prescription drug benefit in name only a new york times writer states all indications are that this plan is a nonstarter insurance companies themselves are very skeptical there havent been many cases in which an industrys own lobbyists tell congress that they dont want a subsidy but this is one of them i take just another minute or two of my friends time the gop plan subsidizes insurance companies not medicare beneficiaries health insurance companies continue to say the republican plan is unworkable the majority tries to give this to the insurance industry but the insurance industry doesnt want it because it wont work charles kahn president of the health insurance association of america has stated we continue to believe the concept of the socalled drugonly private insurance simply would not work in practice i dont know of an insurance company that would offer a drugonly policy like that or even consider it mr president i say to my friend from north dakota we know there needs to be something done about the high cost of prescription drugs no 2 we know there has to be something done with medicare to help senior citizens of this country be able to afford prescription drugs that is all we are saying and we want everyone to know the program put forth by the minority is a program that helps senior citizens it is not something that is means tested but a program that helps all senior citizens not people who make less than 12 000 a year it is a program that is essential it is essential because people as we speak such as gail rattigan who is a registered nurse who wrote to me write that people are considering suicide if they are to take one pill a day they are splitting them in two they are asking if they can get half a prescription filled because they simply cant afford it we need to change that"], [0.9703753590583801, 0.9703753590583801, 0, "i thank the gentleman

last congress and i introduced this congress we do not run the committee on ways and means but there have certainly been proposals out there to gear savings incentives to modest and middleincome households to accelerate the rate of savings and any fairminded look at the savings issuein this country would identify that the lowerincome modestincome middleincome levels are having the harder time saving let me just say about the underlying legislation the problem is not so much what is in it the problem is what is left out that is why the democrat substitute is additive not detractive it does not change the underlying bill it adds to it in a very important way savings incentives for families who need it we have learned that the underlying bill addresses workplace savings that is great except half of the people in the workforce today have no workplace savings half have no workplace savings as we get down to lower levels of earnings the percentage goes up in fact 70 percent of workers earning under 15 000 have no workplace savings in the workplace 70 percent portmancardin will not relate to that group we know that the other second major component of the legislation is the ira taking the ira from 2 000 to 5 000 treasury data tells us that 93 percent of those eligible to use the tax deductible ira those earning 50 000 and below do not use it as of 1995 93 percent it is used by only 7 percent so if a family cannot afford to save 2 000 a year our response saying well great now you can save 5 000 a year is completely ridiculous it misses the point they need additional help that is what our substitute offers a tax credit on savings for those income eligible we would match 50 percent of the contribution i consider this like an uncle sam match much like an employer match on savings incentives you save 2 000 the ira tax credit of 1 000 matching your savings effort i believe that this will accelerate savings for those most needing to save this chart shows that savings rates is related to income twentythree percent earning between 15 000 and 25 000 are projected to be saving enough for retirement whereas well over 60 percent earning over 100 000 are saving at the savings rate we know that this tax credit incentive on savings will work because it is modeled after the savings incentive most effective in the marketplace the 401 k match when employers provide savings opportunities with no match 65 percent save when there is a 50 percent match like this bill would provide there is a 78 percent response in saving as members of congress we have access to the thrift savings plan and the federal government matches our savings contribution 100 percent on the dollar do we not think it is only fair that we extend a match opportunity to american workers who have no savings at the workplace and no opportunity to save in light of sparse discretionary dollars this is a tax cut but it is tax relief to those who need it most those earning up to 80 000 a year struggling to save for retirement it is time we take this step last congress we passed the roth ira we increased the limits on the spousal ira we did a lot of things for a lot of people but we did not do anything new by way of savings incentives for those earning 50 000 and below it is time we take this step and that is what the substitute is all about"], [0.00028458237648010254,

events that have been relived these past months harsh memories of vietnam that are unpleasant to all americans while the vietnam war is over for america the plight of our friends and allies within this region and laos must be remembered laohmong soldier as young as ten years old were recruited fought and died along side 58 000 unitedstates soldiers sailors and airmen in vietnam as a result of their bravery and loyalty to the unitedstates the laohmong were tragically over run by the communist forces and lost their homeland and status in laos after the vietnam war between 10 000 and 20 000 laohmong were killed in combatrelated incidents and over 100 000 had to flee to refugee camps and other nations to survive in the minnesota area today approximately 60 000 laohmong know the minnesota region as their new home many of the older laohmong patriots who made it to the unitedstates are separated from their family members and have had a difficult time adjusting to many aspects of life and culture in the unitedstates including passing aspects of the required citizenship test learning to read in english has been the greatest obstacle for the laohmong because written characters in the hmong language have only been introduced in recent years in addition their long participation and service to unitedstates forces in the southeast asian military conflict significantly disrupted any chance laohmong patriots may have had to learn a written language the hmong veterans naturalization act would help the process of family reunification and finally ease the adjustment of the laohmong into our unitedstates society specifically h r 371 would waive the english language requirement for laohmong who served in special guerrilla units in laos during the vietnam war this legislation would effect individuals who today reside legally in the united states it would not open new immigration channels nor would the bill give the laohmong veterans status to make them eligible for veteran benefits moreover the bill establishes strict criteria for approval and sets a cap of 45 000 to who may benefit from this legislation this is an historic opportunity to recognize and in some small way honor the loyalty and address a key problem of the older laohmong family members who are continuing to have a difficult time adjusting to life here in the usa fortunately there is something positive we can do to help the process of family reunification and finally ease the adjustment of hmong into unitedstates society it is time to move forward with action and grant citizenship to the laohmong
