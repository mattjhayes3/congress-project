consistently failed to demonstrate restraint when it comes to escalating the occupation of iraq it has coldheartedly insisted on denying the children of struggling working families with health insurance in the name of fiscal discipline once again the values of the administration are glaringly out of step with the values of the american people the administration will not stand for accountability transparency or dissent when it comes to ending the occupation of iraq they will however support another blank check resulting in more lives lost and more of our priorities left unfunded earlier today the house voted on overriding the presidents veto of the childrens health insurance reauthorization or schip when the president vetoed schip he argued that the appearance of fiscal responsibility was more important than the health of 10 million of our children in this nation but when we learned that insuring 10 million children in america for 1 year costs the same as 40 days in iraq it is clear that the administration does not have its priorities straight supporting our service men and women is certainly our absolute responsibility our nation has an obligation to those who sacrifice and defend us during times of war however our servicemembers in iraq were sent into combat without adequate training without stateoftheart body armor and equipment and without assurances that their tours of duty will not be overextended the glaring failures in iraq show that not only is the bush administration defunding our nations priorities to continue the occupation but that it is allowing much of that money to be wasted the inspector general has reported that 8 8 billion appropriated for iraqs reconstruction cannot be accounted for media sources have recently reported that the administration is constructing a 600 million american embassy located in the green zone in iraq this embassy which is the largest in the world in fact it is larger than the vatican this embassy will include grocery stores a movie theater tennis courts and a social club it will require 1 billion a year to keep it up and to be maintained instead of our childrens health care the priorities of the bush administration seem to be waste fraud and abuse when the administration vetoes a bipartisan investment in health insurance for our nations children it rejects the priorities of the american people when the administration spends billions on constructing and maintaining an embassy in iraq while iraqs infrastructure collapses around them it compromises the safety of our troops abroad and when the administration refuses to end the occupation in iraq it assures that countless generations will suffer for their mistakes the priorities of the american people are clear they want to provide health care for children they want to promote peace and protect our troops they want us to fully fund the efforts to bring our troops home they want us to do it now"],

with you in the state legislature and we fought off a state income tax together back in our home state and it worked well in tennessee and it would work well here to keep our taxes low as you well know mothers and fathers all across tennessee im more concerned about east tennessee to be honest with you but mothers and fathers all across east tennessee and across america sit around their kitchen tables putting budgets together they have to make decisions on how am i going to fill up my pickup truck or my car and it costs over 50 a tank how am i going to put food on my table how am i going to pay my housing payment how am i going to pay for my health care those are some of the things that real americans real mothers and fathers have to make decisions about and if you look at the gasoline prices and you look at the energy bill that actually came out of this house back in december i voted against the legislation it had new taxes it had new reguilations the only thing it didnt have was any new energy and i think the american people are starting to feel that today and because of that theyre starting to see increases in things such as their food bill going up i know my wife comes home every week and says i cant believe how much our grocery bills gone up this month so people all across east tennessee are struggling to make ends meet the democrat budget resolution fails the test of fiscal responsibility miserably instead of exercising fiscal restraint and lowering taxes the democrat budget raises taxes as you well know by 683 billion over the next 5 years you heard me correctly 683 billion over the next 5 years and as its been pointed out that is the largest tax increase in americas history not only americas history its the largest tax increase in americas history but its also the largest tax increase of any country in the world thats pretty amazing i dont go home every weekend and hear people say if you could just raise my taxes my family will do better i hear just the opposite keep taxes low keep regulations low lower gasoline prices and let me succeed this budget actually blows away the previous record tax increase back in 1993 that was 443 billion these are real tax hikes being imposed on real people here are some of the staggering statistics for families in tennessees first district according to the heritage institute because of the democrat budget the average taxpayer in my district will be forced to pay an increase of 1 596 and it will result in almost 2 000 jobs being lost and a loss of 188 million in the first districts economy thats not what i hear when i go home every weekend to east tennessee if you could just raise my taxes increase regulations then its going to be good for my family thats not what i hear i hear keep taxes low keep regulations low lower gas prices and get government out of my way and we will be able to do better and by reimposing the marriage tax you know i hear comments here in washington that well if we could only tax the wealthy well when i go home to east tennessee every weekend theres a lot of married folk that are not wealthy thats just common sense and by bringing back the marriage tax roughly 23 million taxpayers will see their taxes increase by 466 by the year 2011 simply because theyre married i dont know if thats the policy that we need to be bringing forth in this congress thats not what i hear when i go home to east tennessee every weekend we have a choice between bigger economy or bigger government taxing and spending is not a road we need to head down ronald reagan once said we dont have a trilliondollar debt because we havent taxed enough we have a trilliondollar debt because we spend too much i think we as members of congress need to be more concerned about the budgets of mothers and fathers who have to put a budget together around their kitchen tables back in east tennessee and across america rather than growing a federal budget that supports outofcontrol spending that relies on taking money from the very mothers and fathers who are struggling to make ends meet back in northeast tennessee and across america i would like to thank my colleague congresswoman blackburn for her leadership in putting on this budget school and if we could just get back to using some common sense we will go forward in america its worked well for over 200 years we just need to get back to that common sense thank you for your leadership"], [0.0027657151222229004, 0.9972342848777771, 1, "thank you very much mr towns first let me thank you for yielding but let me thank you also foryour leadership on this issue and for so many other issues your voice is extremely important your work has been important and it continues to bq quite amazing in your coming from new york and in my coming from california we have very similar issues that we have to deal with in terms of this horrific energy crisis and so thank you for giving us the opportunity to talk about it one more time also just as i was listening to my colleague mr johnson from gcorgia thank you for that very brilliant presentation and for that historical context you know sometimes we forget the past in the ghanaiah language in the akan language theres a term called sankofa in order to move forward we must look back at our mistakes and i think awhat you talked about tonight really makes it very clear that we have to understand how we got to where we are so that we dont make those mistakes again such as you talked about which was the drilling in the pristine area in alaskain anwrand all of the proposals that this administration wants to embark upon so thank you very much for that to my colleague from texas ms jacksonlee you have been on this for many many years you come from oil country and you understand very clearly the oil industry and what we need to do to dig ourselves out of this hole and so your voice continues to be important in coming from texas in understanding that the american people deserve not to have to pay 5 a gallon for gas the courage that youve displayed has been amazing thank you for your voice and for your leadership as we work to reduce skyrocketing prices at the pump we continue to face opposition from the bush administration and our colleagues on the other side of the aisle seem to be content to subsidize the big oil companies record profits that mr towns talked about and that you talked about mr johnson and ms jacksonlee they reach record profits quarter after quarter rather than adopb a real solution to meet the energy needs across our nation more specifically we have proposed legislation that would invest in true clean and renewable energy sources our proposals would also bring much needed accountability which we need desperately to the energy markets in order to eliminate the price gougingdo you hear me thats taking place and the market manipulation and the speculation that have inflated energy prices to record levels this week we will also take up legislation to expand the use of public transit systems to save eilergy and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in light of this growing energy crisis i cannot help but to reflect upon the bush administrations determination to squander our resources on the immoral occupation of iraq that has directly contributed to the current economic downturn of the high gas prices that the american people are seeing at the pump make no mistake we are in the middle of the bushiraq recession the economic hardships that americans face today are the direct result of this administrations failed and flawed policies at home and abroad when president bush took office in january of 2001 the price of oil was 23 a barrel and gasoline cost as little as i think it was 1 35 per gallon now after more than 5 years of bombing and bloodshed in iraq since the iraq invasion oil has topped 130 a barrel and gasoline is averaging more than 4 a gallon as congressman johnson said it probably will hit the unfortunate cost of 5 per gallon by some estimates the war and continued occupation of iraq could cost the united states more than 3 trillion thats a 3 trillion bill for this administrations failed policies in iraq that our children and grandchildren will be paying for years to come the american people recognize the toll this immoral occupation has taken on our economy theyre in dire need of assistance many face the impossible choice of buying food for their families or of purchasing the gasoline they need to go to work if we want to see prices at the gas pump go down one of the first and most essential steps we must take is to end the war and occupation in iraq we must also focus on transitioning our economy away from fossil fuels to the greener alternative fuels of the future this will be a longterm process that will affect communities throughout our nations in different ways its very important to note that as we continue to forge these new frontiers to achieve energy independence and to safeguard the environment communities will face many complex environmental and public health challenges the drastic acceleration of greenhouse gas emissions has often been concentrated in lowincome and minority communities putting these vulnerable populations on the front lines of the fight against environmental degradation and global climate change the communities in my district like in mr johnsons district and in mr towns district and in ms jacksonlees district all face the severe consequences of pollution of urban sprawl and of environmental injustice which harshly affect people of color and lowincome communities sadly this epidemic is hitting our children the hardest for example back at home in my own district when children grow up in the area of west oakland theyre seven times more likely to be hospitalized for asthma than is the average child in california none of us can afford to take this lightly the health of our community and neighbors affects all of us i would also like to just take a moment and recognize the rolethat californias east bay is playing at the forefront of the green jobs and green industry movement which is really a critical part in terms of addressing the energy crisis one of the most exciting and inclusive solutions to the many issues facing environmental health and our energy crisis is the possibility afforded to us by promoting green jobs training and the growth of the green economy in america a true green economy one that is sincere in its mission and that is deeply rooted in local communities and businesses can provide innovative answers to many of the problems that our environment faces green jobs provide pathways out of poverty for those most affected by environmental injustice nanely people of color and our urban youth we have been working closely in my district with the ella baker center and with the apollo alliance mayor ron dellumsmy predecessor here and our colleaguehas been working very hard on a new initiative to support the development of green model cities and to focus on economic development through green job training academies and to create a national green institute to serve as a clearinghouse for the green movement so there are many many initiatives to which we need to look forward in terms of providing for an alternative to our dependence on foreign oil let me just conclude by saying and by reminding the country that most recently the bush administration has threatened to veto the housepassed h r 5351 which is the renewable energy and energy conservation tax act of 2008 this legislation makes critical investments in clean and renewable energy and energy efficiency that will create hundreds of thousands of new jobs and that will help to maintain the united states position as a leader in innovation as we move toward true energy independence so i have to thank my colleagues again especially the congressional black caucus and congressman towns for allowing us to come down for an hour to talk about the basic components and reasons for this energy crisis and also for allowing us to provide what we see as some real and practical solutions that we can embrace right nownot next year but todayif in fact the bush administration and his oil industry administration would accept the fact that theyre responsible for this energy crisis the american people deserve a way out thank you"], [0.0029735141433775425, 0.0029735141433775425, 0, "i thank the gentleman from nebraska a mr smith who has come to washington to stand up for middleamerican values and to hold the line on the spending in the budget committee hold the line on the constitutional issues with the micromanagement that is coming out of here with this supplemental spending bill this emergency supplemental spending bill and i will make no such pledge that it isnt my job to challenge the people with whom i disagree with in fact i believe it is my job to do that and i intend to step up every time and draw those bright lines when i think it is imperative that those bright lines be drawn so here we are with this bill on the floor being debated several hours today with 1 or 2 hours left in the debate for tomorrow and maybe it will go to final passage maybe the votes wont be there maybe the vote will get pulled down just like d c voting was pulled down today they take it all the way through the process and at the time it is supposed to go up on the board realize we lost the debate so now we cant allow a vote that is exactly what happened here in the house of representatives today the peoples voice wasnt heard we have got a little debate to go tomorrow people are going to sleep on this tonight and they are going to think about the president asking for 99 billion to provide for afghanistan and iraq the surge in iraq the strategy that was part of the iraq study groups recommendation the bipartisan iraq study groups recommendation and the effort to succeed in iraq and it is interesting that the president has retooled our approach here we have a new secretary of defense secretary gates we have a new secretary at least an acting secretary of the army mr geren and we have a new commander at walter reed hospital we have a new commander of centcom and this is a new plan a new plan put together by the individual who wrote the book on counterterrorism and the most successful general that i believe that we have seen come out of the iraq theater and that is general david petraeus i believe the most impressive military individual i have met in my time here in fact in my life and his strategy is part of the same strategy that the iraq study group put out and having written the book on counterterrorism and being endorsed without opposition for his confirmation for a fourth star by the united states senate and within a week the united states senate is back trying to jerk the rug out from underneath his plan trying to oppose the surge in iraq and trying to oppose the 21 500 extra troops that go in there and now we are seeing a little wavering a little quavering and some people going a little wobbly because they are starting to see the positive signs in the effort in baghdad now the situation there is kind of interesting baghdad and 30 miles around outside of baghdad is where 80 percent of the violence in iraq is taking place and it occurred to me it was actually back in december i was reflecting backupon the 101st airborne 62 years earlier had been surrounded at bastogne during the battle of the bulge in world war ii bastogne a city that had seven roads leading to it and through it was the centerpiece of the transportation link it was the key to success or failure in the battle of the bulge and maybe it was the key to victory or defeat for either side in world war ii at least in the european theater and so as the 101st airborne was surrounded at bastogne mercilessly being shelled by the germans and the germans demanded the surrender of the 101st general mccollums response is famous and it should echo throughout all of american history when he said in his response to the germans nuts we understood what that meant being americans the germans didnt they had to go get their linguists to try to understand what it meant and they still i dont think have figured out to this day well that was in one word four letters the american spirit of defiance the american spirit of perseverance and there they were surrounded at bastogne hopelessly surrounded and their response was nuts we are hanging on and we are going to defend bastogne and shortly thereafter we had general patton and the 3rd army that came and relieved the 101st airborne they argue to this day that they didnt need the help of the 3rd army that they had the germans right where they wanted them that was the american spirit 62 years ago and today 80 percent of the violence is within baghdad or 30 miles from baghdad baghdad is essentially surrounded it is not a stronghold we have always gone wherever we wanted to go in baghdad or any other city in iraq for that matter even though the press calls it a stronghold we went wherever we wanted to go and we go more now than we did before baghdad is significantly pacified but baghdad was surrounded by peace a relative peace at least and the violence was in there now if we had pulled out or if sometime in the future this side of the aisle is successful in shutting off the resources so that our military cant succeed in their mission and we pull out of there i believe history will judge us nuts if we do such a thing there is too much at stake there is no discussion on this side of the aisle here about the consequences for pulling out no one has a plan for victory no one over there will utter the v word the victory word no one will define it they are just a group of defeatocrats that cant get it out of their head that americas destiny is worth more than marking political points against your opposition so we sit here with more than 3 000 lives sacrificed for the freedom of the iraqi people and the destiny of the world because if we dont defeat this enemy here in iraq as prime minister maliki said right here behind where i am standing right now he said if the terrorists cant be defeated in iraq they cant be defeated anywhere now if mr murtha gets his way and troops are deployed out of iraq the bill doesnt say where but he has said where okinawa okinawa over the horizon is okinawa and we can put our troops over there and then we can fly them wherever we need them whenever we need them i would say we might as well take them right to afghanistan and i am going to explain the reason for that first this is a poster of muqtada alsadr he is quite an interesting character he started out in this conflict as a militia general and he wasnt doing very well down south of baghdad a couple of years ago when he suffered huge huge casualties in the madhi militia in fact the casualties were so heavy that he decided to become a politician instead of a general and so he entered into and built a little coalition and picked up 30 seats in the iraqi parliament he also took over the security on the civilian side of baghdad international airport along with one portion of the shia region of baghdad and some of the area to the south muqtada alsadr not a friend of the united states an individual who has empowered himself by attacking the united states and denigrating the united states and inspiring his followers the same way and this is how he did it and i was sitting in kuwait city the date is right here june 11 2004 waiting to go into iraq the next day and i was watching aljazeera tv now muqtada alsadr came on this burly face and he was speaking in arabic so i was looking at the crawler underneath in english and it read just like this if we keep attacking americans they will leave iraq the same way they left vietnam the same way they left lebanon the same way they left mogadishu that was muqtada alsadr june 11 2004 aljazeera tv i attest to that i was there i wrote it down i saw it i heard it and that is the statement that he made now i went back and picked up the book written by general vo nguen giap and it is how we won the war and he is writing about the vietnam war how they won the war and very early in the book he takes the position that because the united states did not win a clear victory in korea they understood that we would maybe not have the will to win a clear victory in vietnam so their strategy from the beginning was to fight the war in such a way that it would break down and defeat american public opinion and encourage the antiwar activists all across this country and around the world that was a part of their calculated strategy that is in the book how we won the war by general giap now it hadnt occurred to me that because we settled for a truce at the 38th parallel in korea at the place the same line as the beginning of the war was the end of the war but because we didnt push the communists all the way out of north korea and draw a new line they believe that we could be defeated because we didnt demonstrate the will to succeed carl von clausewitz wrote the treatise on war and the name of the book is on war and he states in there the object of war is to destroy the enemys will and ability to conduct war to destroy the enemys will and ability and i believe clausewitz lists will ahead of ability because it is more important here your will to succeed your will to prevail is more important than your ability to conduct war in other words if you are fighting an enemy and you destroy their airplanes and their navy and their tanks and their guns and their ammunition and they still have the will to fight you they will come at you with ieds or rocks or fists or boots or clubs because they still have the will to take you on but here in this congress there have been dozens there are scores there in fact may be more than 100 there may be more than 200 that dont understand that when they stand here on this floor and they speak against our militarys mission they are encouraging people like muqtada alsadr when he is inspiring his people by saying all we have to do is keep attacking americans and they will pull out of iraq the same way they did vietnam lebanon and mogadishu and if we should do that i can show you the next poster you will see on this floor the next quote that will show up in the news media this is another notorious individual osama bin laden where is he we are looking diligently for him one day we will find him but the lesson from muktadr alsadr the lesson that needs to be understood by the defeatocrats is that if we pull out of iraq we dont win there you have al qaeda taking over you have iran coming in and taking over 70 to 80 percent of the iraqi oil you have iran with their hand on the valve that could shut off at the straits of hormuz 42 6 percent of the worlds export oil doing so lets them control the world economy including that of the united states including that of china empowering russia empowering iran intimidating and controlling the entire middle eastern oil supply by ahmadinejad that is what is in store for us if we dont prevail and so maktadr alsadr has laid it out and he has got a clear vision his vision isnt hard to figure out general giap has figured it out just from seeing that we would settle for a truce at the 38th parallel and we have got maktadr alsadr seeing that and vietnam and lebanon and mogadishu and several others by the way but if we pull out of iraq our troops arent going to be deployed to over the horizon mr murtha or over to okinawa mr murtha they may get to go home for a little while and polish their boots but they are going to afghanistan because that is the next stop for these terrorists that are going to keep coming at us until we defeat them or capitulate and so this will be the next quote you will see if we pull out of iraq it will be osama bin laden this time and he will be saying if we keep attacking americans they will leave afghanistan the same way they left vietnam the same way they left lebanon the same way they left mogadishu the same way they left iraq that is what is in front of us if we dont have the will to prevail and these kinds of unconstitutional supplemental or emergency spending bills that tie so many strings on to the hands of the commander in chief that if he adheres to the language that is in here ties his hands so he cant win now why would you not be for victory why would you send money over there and not provide a way for the troops to win this bill pulls us out of iraq that is the goal and they have said so their goal is not victory their goal has been defeat for a long time so they can say i told you so to put a stain on this administration perhaps to try to gain political favor perhaps but whatever is their motivation i will submit that this appropriations bill is unconstitutional because it is micromanagement of the duties of the commander in chief and so i will submit that this constitution gives this congress three responsibilities when it comes to war the first one is to declare war we havent done that since world war ii the second one is constitutionally to raise and equip an army and a navy and by implication an air force the third one is to fund the war that is it no other constitutional responsibilities declare a war raise a military fund military but the president is commander in chief because our founders lived through the mistakes of trying to run a war with a whole series of micromanagers and trying to do so by consensus or majority rule within the continental congress the continental congress tried to micromanage the war that was fought by the continental army and they were so stung by that painful effort and the only thing that preserved them was they had the will for victory they carried themselves through the hardest of times barefoot at valley forge because they were determined that they were going to defeat the british and establish a new nation and that is the legacy that the founders have passed along to us and they drew bright lines in this constitution because they understood you couldnt fight a war by committee you couldnt fight a war if a congress was going to micromanage the commander in chief so they drew the line clearly and there is no equivocation and there is no historical record about the founders wondering about who had what responsibility when it came to fighting a war no it was the commander in chief and they gave congress the authority declare a war raise the army and the navy and then i said by implication the air force and fund it so if you dont want to support our military and if you dont want to support their mission then you ought to have enough intestinal fortitude to come down here with a bill that unfunds our military and face the wrath of the american people and the wrath of the united states military who by the way are 100 percent volunteers not just to join the military and put on the uniform but for the mission that they are on everyone there has had an opportunity to retire from the military in such time since the beginning of this conflict yet they step forward and they reup and they volunteer in greater numbers than one ever anticipated these are brave souls that are on a mission and to say to them after they have volunteered for one or two or three or more deployments well thanks a lot for the effort but we are not going to let you finish the job we are going to drag you home well i would say to that that i could quote a colonel that i went to iraq with not that long ago and he said and i dont know if i will find it so i will speak from off the cuff and this will be close it wont be probably an exact quote he said dont save me i volunteered for this mission dont save me i am here because i volunteered for my children i am here to fight this war so my children dont have to fight this war you are not doing me any favors if you try to pull me out of this mission that i am committed to and i have children at home that i am here to defend now i would say also that probably the most profound statement that i heard from a military person over there was a major from kentucky and he is a farmer a father loved his cows worried about his bull wanted to see the digital picture of his new bull and loves god and he said to me he said we have everything we need so when you pray for us meaning the military pray for the american people pray they understand the threat and pray they do not lose their resolve we will not lose ours that is the kind of personnel we have that put their lives on the line for the future of freedom in the world for the safety of the american people so that we can ultimately prevail in this long long war against these global terrorists who believe that their path to salvation is in killing us it is not going to be easy it is not going to be over quickly and in fact every time we step back and show weakness it empowers the enemy and we are more likely to hear this statement sooner but this is not over if we pull out of iraq as general pelosi and mr murtha would like to do it is not over they will follow us here and they will be more empowered they will have abase that is protected that they can operate from out of iraq and you hand over that oil money to the iranians they will be spending it to buy missiles to deliver nuclear weapons not just to tel aviv not just to western europe but within a few short years to the united states and we will face an enemy that is a lot tougher than the one we are facing right now we need to resolve this issue in the middle east now this is the time to do so put the cross hairs on irans nucleaf and tell them cease fighting this proxy war against the united states within iraq resolve and pacify iraq and turn our focus over to afghanistan because if we dont do so this man and his allies turn iraq into a terrorist base camp and they turn their effort to afghanistan to try to drive us out of there and destroy the freedom that has been established there where people voted for the first time on that soil in all of history that is what we are faced with this is a long war we need to step up to it we need to understand that we need to let our voluntary military perform their mission and stand with them because not only do we stand with our military but we stand with them in their mission i do so on this side of the aisle i challenge everyone on that side of the aisle to do the same it is intellectually inconsistent to take a position that you can support the troops and not their mission and it is constitutionally inconsistent in fact unconstitutional to micromanage a war from the floor of congress and tie so many strings in there that they cant be met so that it is certain that if this language passes and the president adheres to it that there will be an end to this sort of victory and i ask the president to stand on this constitutionally he has the authority to do intradepartmental transfers if the money goes to dod and it is directed to an aircraft carrier and we need armored humvees and strykers and bulletproof vests he can mothball that aircraft carrier and put the money where it is needed that is why he is commander in chief that is constitutional this bill is not and i urge that all members stand up and vote no on this when it comes to the floor tomorrow"], [0.0032579528633505106, 0.0032579528633505106, 0, "the democrat hoax energy bill appears to be another disappointing response to families hurt by high gasoline prices never mind the

new spending represents the greatest economic challenge of our era and it is a challenge that the democrat budget has chosen to completely ignore while going on its own spending spree elsewhere in the 32nd congressional district of texas which i have the honor to represent the heritage foundation estimates that the passage of this budget will cost every single taxpayer an additional 2 920 in 2012 it will also mean a per capita loss of 474 in personal income as well as 2 389 lost jobs as a result of a loss of 328 million to the local economy of the 32nd congressional district of texas i will insert into the record this entire document which details the severe negative impact on the passage that this budget will have on every single taxpayer from every single district across the country if fiscal discipline is what the democrats promised voters this past fall then by my account it took only 3 months for the democrat candidates to abandon their campaign promises and an additional 2 months for democrats to reiterate their really true support for taxandspend policies again here on the house floor today this deeply flawed budget would increase taxes on almost 8 million taxpayers just in my home state of texas alone it would collect these taxes by allowing the 2001 and 2003 tax relief provided by the republican congress to expire in real terms for every american taxpayer this means reducing the child tax credit for working families so that the government can collect 27 billion more to finance yes youve got it brandnew spending it means reinstating the marriage penalty and the death tax to collect an additional 104 billion so that the new majority democrats can kick the can further down the road rather than reforming and strengthening our nations entitlement programs and it means completely ignoring the alternative minimum tax crisis which is projected to hit 23 million middleclass families if not dealt with in a responsible manner i believe the voters watching this debate on cspan understand what these tax increases mean for them the economy and for our ability to compete globally but they may not realize what they mean for the average family of four with 60 000 in earnings it will mean a tax increase of 61 percent it means that a single parent with two children and 30 000 in earnings would see a tax increase of 67 percent and it means that an elderly couple with 40 000 of income would see their taxes increase by a whopping 156 percent you can see the advantages of the republican tax cut and what it means to every single middleclass american now one would think that a hike of almost 400 billion impacting every american taxpayer would be enough to finance the democrats appetite for big government but trust me its just the start this budget also contains 12 reserve funds or pet initiative ious which set the stage for more than 115 billion in higher future spending which would have to be financed by you guessed it even higher taxes for the last 4 years responsible budgets passed by the republican party kept discretionary spending at or below inflation for all nondefense nonhomeland security spending this budget plan brought forward by the democrats brings this fiscally disciplined tradition to a screeching halt by allowing about 25 billion more in discretionary spending than president bush or even the spendthrift senate for that matter which asked for about 7 billion less than the house thankfully its not too late to stop this fiscal train wreck by voting against this rule every member of this body can demonstrate their opposition to the federal largesse included in this budget as well as their opposition to the largest tax increase in american history without the meaningful tax relief passed by this recent republican congress our economy would not have seen the massive job growth with 7 6 million new jobs created for american workers and tremendous economic growth of 3 5 percent per year that has our

percent of students drop out of high school before graduating and only four out of ten children eligible for head start are able to participate this budget reverses the administrations policy of underinvesting in education for our children the budget rejects the presidents proposal to cut funding for the department of education by 1 5 billion below the 2007 enacted level and to eliminate 44 entire programs it instead provides for substantial new investments in vital programs such as head start special education idea title i and other programs under the no child left behind act the bill

development block grant program by 1 1 billion below last years level and instead provides for the first cdbg increase since 2005 the cut advocated by the president would endanger job creation economic development and affordable housing efforts cutting cdbgs for nearly 1 200 state and local governments this budget rejects the presidents proposal to cut child care development block grants and social services block grants by 520 million below the 2007 level the presidents budget would lead to a decline in valuable assistance for child care that allows many working parents to earn a living the conference report would allow for the first increase in this funding since 2002 further knowing that we now have more uninsured americans than six years ago this budget blocks the presidents proposed cuts to medicare and medicaid these cuts would have made healthcare less affordable and accessible for millions of americans this budget ensures that up to 50 billion over the next five years will be devoted to the state childrens health insurance program schip so that millions of uninsured children can be covered new jersey is a national leader in covering children through the schip program and this additional funding is desperately needed to ensure our states good work and that of other states can continue this budget reverses the presidents dangerous cuts to our nations

other government investigations in connection with the walter reed scandal and allows funds for action when those recommendations are received to help protect our nation from a terroristsponsored nuclear attack nonproliferation programs such as the cooperative threat reduction program are given greater priority and higher funding this budget also helps us keep our promises to our nations

5 billion increase 8 9 over the administration request for fy08 this budget provides a far more realistic spending plan than the presidents proposal our proposed increase in this area will help meet critical needs including ensuring that medical inflation does not erode vas ability to deliver quality health care to our veterans in order jo maintain american competitiveness we must make

good friend from california for yielding me time and i would like to thank my good friend from california for his leadership on this resolution the resolution before us today is a reminder that from great injustice can come great awakening we take up this resolution to mark the 65th anniversary of executive order 9066 the resolution is a reminder that each of us has a responsibility to ensure that something like executive order 9066 never happens again in a time of war thousands of innocent american citizens were rounded up forcibly removed from their homes and shipped to internment camps sadly this was an avoidable consequence of racial prejudice and wartime hysteria the government at all levels was blinded by war it is imperative that we learn the lesson this moment in history has taught us that is why i applauded the creation of a grant program to preserve the internment camps and related historical sites where japanese americans were detained during world war h we must preserve these camps as a physical tangible representation of our governments failure to protect the constitutional right of every american and also as a symbol of our nations ability to acknowledge our mistakes further these designations will ensure that future generations will be able to visit the internment camps to gain a better understanding of the previous generations experience we may have won world war ii however we were not victorious because of our treatment of japanese italian and german americans but in spite of it now 65 years later we are once again engaged in armed conflict overseas and once again the undertones of suspicion and mistrust toward particular groups of people lurk beneath the surface of our society which is why it is more important than ever to recall our past so we do not repeat our mistakes i hope every american will take this day to reaffirm their commitment to our constitution and the rights and protections it guarantees to all of us the resolution before us today recognizes the past injustices and points the way toward a future where such wrongs are no longer perpetuated in this country each member of this congress as a servant of the people is duty bound to apply these lessons of the past to the challenges we now face in doing so we show our continued efforts toward ensuring that our country avoids similarly misguided policies now and in the future"], [0.0003268420696258545, 0.49967315793037415, 0, "i urge all my colleagues to vote yes on this resolution honoring the historic accomplishment of tim tebow winning the heisman trophy as a

comments being from an oilproducing state such as louisiana we have for decades been producing americas energy needs to this day approximately 30 percent of all the energy supply is domestically produced in our coastal areas in louisiana the same areas that produce all that oil and gas are also home to what we refer to as americas wetlands the coastal marshes of south louisiana are predominately the ones we are losing the most ironically in my district they provide roughly 30 percent of the seafood to this country now people say how can the oil industry and the seafood industry coexist side by side well for a number of years back at the beginning of time so to speak when the oil and gas industry began offshore drilling and wetlands drilling there werent the environmental standards and all the other standards that are put forth now there wasnt the technology that is there today so yes there were mistakes made we have learned from our mistakes our government has recognized it the states have recognized it they have addressed those issues if you look back after the storms after hurricanes katrina and rita if you look at the devastation that occurred across the gulf coast did you hear of oil spills the worst spills that you had actually were the gas tanks that were leaking fuel and oil on land at the oil refineries and from the service stations throughout the flooded areas theres a misconception theres a fear by people thats more the fear of fear itself that people seem to concern themselves with we have in this country as was mentioned by some of the previous speakers in the first hour an industry that may be misunderstood it is called big oil but if you look who is producing the oil and gas in the united states for the most part it is small the independent it may be a company such as devon out of oklahoma yes it is on the stock market but it was a company started in 1971 by a father and son they took that gamble they got out there it has in fact by the numbers i have seen been determined that for the major oil companies to drill in the united states whether onshore or offshore whether deep water orlshallow water it is more expensive an investment and proposition than it is to drill in other parts of the world of course there are some security problems going on in other parts of the world as we look at what we believe in in this country and what we should believe in in this congress we talk about energy inde sendence and energy independence as mentioned is not about republicans and democrats it is about the old folks it is about the young starting families it is about the working people it is about everybody that pumps gas in that car it is about everybody that goes to a job when you look at natural gas as mr peterson talked about it is a clean fuel and we have ample supplies throughout this country and we ought to be producing those fuels however our own policies have seemed to stymie us the blue dogs have put together a package that we are proposing that is a principle not a package a principle that we feel we ought to be looking at and having guide us as we go through the process of developing energy legislation we are not going to get this country moving forward unless we encourage development of oil and gas alternative fuels green fuels whatever it all hag to be part of the mix this is not about one fuel being better than the other this is not one fuel seeing if it can out politic another fuel this is about trying to bring together the country to devise an energy policy and we as the blue dogs felt that it was time for us to try and take the lead and to give some guidance and leadership in this matter with that i turn the floor back over to my friend mr matheson"],
