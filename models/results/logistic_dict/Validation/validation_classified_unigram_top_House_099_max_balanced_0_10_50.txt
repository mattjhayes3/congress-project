agreement only in accordance with certain provisions before seeking rejection of a collective bargaining agreement the debtor in possession or trustee must submit a proposal to the authorized representative of the employees which provides for those necessary modifications in the employees benefits and protections that are necessary to permit the reorganization of the debtor the statute also mandates goodfaith meetings in an attempt to reach mutually satisfactory modifications of the agreement only the court can approve an application for rejection of a collective bargaining agreementand only if the employees representative has refused to accept a proposal without good cause and the balance of the equities clearly favors rejection of such agreement h r 5490 clarifies that section 1113 of the bankruptcy code applies to retiree benefitrelated provisions of collective bargaining agreements a literal reading of current subsection f indicates that such provisions already are covered no provision of this title according to the mandate of subsection f shall be construed to permit a trustee to unilaterally terminate or alter any provisions of a collective bargaining agreement prior to compliance with the provisions of this section in spite of this language however a real controversy has developed over the application of section 1113 to retiree benefit provisions at a hearing in august the subcommittee on monopolies and commercial law received testimony on both sides of this question ltv corp which initially terminated funding retiree health and life insurance benefits when it filed for protection under the bankruptcy laws expressed the belief that the focus of section 1113 f is the continuation of payments to current employees the united steelworkers of america however argued that bly unilaterally terminating retiree life and medical benefits on july 17 1986 as of the chapter 11 filing ltv violated the bankruptcy code by unlawfully terminating the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement without complying with the detailed mandatory exclusive provision of section 1113 of the code bankruptcy attorney herbert p minkel jr and new york university law school prof lawrence p king pointed out the ltv chapter 11 illustrates the fact that reasonable persons disagree as to the effect of section 1113 on the rights of union retirees to receive benefits subsequent to the filing of a chapter 11 case this legislation resolves any ambiguity in the law by specifying that the reference in section 1113 f to any provisions of a collective bargaining agreement includes retiree benefitrelated provisions the statutory clarification recognizes that retiree benefits are central to the wellbeing of people who have worked for many years such
