benefits in stages to a level more closely reflecting the actual current cost of purchasing the thrifty food plan it gives families with children the same shelter deduction as the elderly and disabled

americans by a margin of almost 4 to 1 according to cornell economist eileen trzcinski since 1990 more than 300 000 workers with serious medical conditions lost their jobs because their employers did not provide medical leave during that same period employers without medical leave policies could have saved almost 500 million in hiring and training costs bad this legislation been in effect and

often than not aimed at the previous administration of ronald reagan the contempt which many in the majority continue to feel for our former president has fueled a very political attack on the right of any future president to execute his national security duties as commander in chief they have pushed hard for a 48hour reporting requirement in order to force the presidentany presidentto tell congress within 48 hours about the special operations that this country may be conducting wisely this bill avoids that debateand thereby avoids the certain veto that it would elicit from virtually any white house i commend all the members of the committee for sparing us the acrimony that such a provision would have brought in fact wth that provision left out the bill really is as the ranking member described it in his testimony before the rules committee a bare bones authorization there are differences between the majority and the minority regarding the proposed reorganization of the defense departments science and technology the majority would rush to make changes rather than study the proposed reorganization a bit more thoroughly it strikes me as the antithesis of the flybeforeyoubuy

moscow to sit atop the floors we know are laced through and through with bugging devices putting a cone of silence on top of a huge electronic bug strikes many of us as penny wise and extraordinarily pound foolish beyond those two issues there really is only one essential element missing in my judgment what is missing is a requirement for a secrecy oath to be administered to the members and staff of the intelligence committee such an oath would not serve in any way to draw into question the patriotism of any member nor of any staff member rather it would serve as a sobering reminder of the very solemn duty charged to this particular committee my understanding is that the ranking member mr shuster will be offering such an amendment later during consideration of the bill i will wholeheartedly support it and take this opportunity to encourage my colleagues of the house to do likewise the reason that an oath is necessary is to remind members and staff that quite literally lives are on the line and those lives depend in part upon committee members and staff keeping their lips sealed an oath would serve to underscore that vital fact indeed this issue is all the more important in light of operation desert storm based upon that experience the committee is renewing its call for greater reliance on human intelligence that is in my judgment a wise and good decision however it means that human livesnot mere machineswill hang in the balance will rely on secrets being kept will rely on people not leaking stories to the press as the committees report stated more eloquently than i there will always be secrets worth knowing if what is truly important requires significant personal and political risk then our country must be willing to pay the pricea price which may include compromised operations and the arrest of unitedstates citizens or their agents i agree 100 percent allow me to simply paraphrase there will always be secrets worth protecting if what is truly important requires significant personal and political risk then our countrys elected representatives must be willing to pay the pricea price which includes doing everything possible to avoid compromising operations or the arrest of unitedstates citizens or our agents it is so little to ask of members and starf of this committee that they reaffirm their commitment to protecting the secretsand therefore the livesof those who risk their lives on a daily basis so that we might enjoy the sweet fruits of freedom all they need say is this i do solemnly swear that i will not directly or indirectly disclose to any unauthorized person any classified information received in the course of my duties on the permanent select committee on intelligence except with the formal approval of the committee or the house i submit that such an oath is not too much to ask so i look forward to supporting the shuster amendment and respectfully request that my colleagues do the same recognizing

to our recent victory in the persian gulf the investment that our former president ronald reagan made in our conventional weapons and in the morale and training of our troops was on display for all to clearly see and just as our victory over iraqi aggression was due in large part to president reagans commitment to military preparedness we also must give him credit for much of our recent progress in negotiating new arms reduction treaties with the soviet union not only did he modernize our strategic forces compelling the soviets to go back to the table and negotiate in earnest he also adhered to basic commonsense principles of arms control how many times have we all heard him say trust but verity i raise this point today because i am pleased not just that we have before us an open rule but also the report on the fiscal year 1992 intelligence authorization bill a document that is equally frank and open in its admonition to our arms control negotiators allow me to quote from the report the monitoring of new arms control agreements will present a considerable challenge to unitedstates intelligence the intelligence community cannot afford major new systems or expeditures because of unitedstates oversights or misjudgments during treaty negotiations today we stand on the threshold of a new era in arms control with agreements on reductions in strategic arms conventional forces in europe and chemical munitions stockpiles all close at hand if this new era is to serve our national security interests and the interests of peaceand if it is to set the stage for global arms control agreementsit is absolutely vital that our negotiators ensure that inspection and verification procedures under such agreements are stringent and thorough now more than ever there is little room for error in these important areas during treaty negotiations and i am hopeful that our arms negotiators in the state department and elsewhere will heed the admonition of the intelligence committee our

that it is very difficult to imagine that he will no longer be a member of this house but as i said last week in a capitol ceremony to celebrate the life of dick bolling our former colleague who passed away a week ago in a sense it is sort of fitting that the memories of dick bolling which we talked about last week and the honor that we do mo udall this week come very close in time because in the years i have served here i have always viewed dick bolling and mo udall as sort of the way people of mos generation viewed the old football team that used to play for west point doc blanchard and glenn davis blanchard being the fullback and davis being the halfback on some of those famous west point teams davis and blanchard were known as mr inside and mr outside and i think in a sense that dick bolling and mo udall played those same roles for us in the house and in the democratic caucus over the years mo with his lighter style and dick bolling with his fullback chargeahead style they both made a tremendous team whether you were talking about congressional reform or whether you were talking about public financing of campaigns or any one of a dozen issues that dealt with the integrity of the political process or the welfare of the american people i think that mo udall really for an entire generation in this house gave us hope gave us the expectation that this institution would match the needs of the times when we took what some considered to be a chaotic approach and ran against john mccormick for speaker back in the sixties that run was necessary to try to energize our caucus to try to energize this house mos race even though he paid an eternal price for it for years his race was a key event in reforming this institution to bring it closer to the ideals that the american people have a right to expect i think our generation in this house will always be grateful to him for that on the issues whether you were talking about the environment or the economy or peace mo udall was absolutely crucial in defining progress all across the board mo udall was really synonymous for almost all of his career with progress toward a clean environment in the economy jack kennedy called mo udalls newsletters in the early sixties about economics the best of their kind in fact if you took a look at mo udalls newsletters across the board theywere the best of their kind and i think remain today the best that have ever been written by any member of this house it was mo udall who in 1967 i believe went back to arizona and wrote a newsletter to his constituents appeared in arizona and said folks i have been wrong about the vietnam war and i want to tell you why it was his conversion that led the way for all kinds of politicians to see the same truths that he saw including yours truly and we will be forever grateful to mo for that in 1976 henry reuss and i approached mo udall over in the fourth row of this chamber and said mo you know we have had a lot of turkeys run for president all of these years it would be nice if we had a swan we suggested that he ought to take a look at running and we signed up an awful lot of our members in those years it was unheard of for a house member to run for president if we did not have the title senator or if you were not a governor you were not considered mo changed that for the better i felt highly privileged to campaign in 17 states for mo during that campaign let me tell you he sometimes did not give you easy jobs i remember we were up in boston campaigning all day up there and mo came to me about 4 oclock in the afternoon and said i have got a chance to be on issues and answers on abc tomorrow sunday would you fill in for me in a speech i have tomorrow morning i said sure i will take the assignment what is it well i was supposed to explain mo udalls pro choice position to the knights of columbus in boston ma and i did not fully agree with mos position myself but that was a very tough job and i cannot say that i enjoyed it but i took it on he also asked me in pittsburgh if i would go to a black baptist church to explain what mo udall was all about i had never been in a black baptist church in my life i had never been in a baptist church in my life but i said surely i would and i went i discovered at that point that the task was a little bit tougher than the one that i thought i had been given because jimmy carter who was himself a baptist had been in that very church the sunday before so mo sometimes played tricks on his friends but we enjoyed it nonetheless and loved him for everything i think more than issues more than the leadership he provided on issues was the leadership he provided this nation in defining what kind of politics fit america what kind of politics were indeed respectable to practice as i said mo really wrote the best newsletters that i think have ev2r been written by a member of the house he was passionately devoted to institutional reform h 2741l i find it kind of ironic that 12 of us today have introduced a new major campaign finance reform bill an issue which mo took the lead on for years and years in this place it is fitting that we introduce a new effort to deal with that same problem on the day that we talk about mos accomplishments and our affection for him i think there are a couple of quotes that really sum up to me the kind of politics that mo udall has brought this country oliver wendell holmes said once and it is a very famous quote i think he said as life is action and passion it is required of a man that he should share the passion and action of his time at the peril of being judged not to have lived certainly mo udall entered into the political process with passion he understood that political death was not defeat in an election he understood that political death is really having the ability to do something good for people having the power to do good in the system and not fully using that power that is the true definition of political death and mo udall always understood that and always demonstrated that belief there is another quote that reminds me of mo udall adla stevenson another one of my heroes said this the hardest challenge in politics is to win without proving that you are unworthy of winning i think that is what distinguishes mo udalls career from a good many other practitioners of the art of politics in our country today there are really two kinds of politics being practiced in this country one is the slash and burn kind the kind that says bring the dialog down to whatever level you have to bring it in order for us to win then you have the udall kind of politics which says let us bring the dialog up let us bring the public understanding up to the level that is required to win to me that more than any other question divides politicians in this country today and mo udall was always on the right side when it came to that question he personified ethics he could fight with passion and still have affection for those with whom he disagreed and i think that is the essence of any truly class act in political life and so i just want to say that i tremendously regret the fact that mo will be leaving this institution but we continue to respect him we continue to love him we wish him well we wish him a speedy recovery and i want to promise mo one thing as mo was for so many years in his career i want to promise mo that we will try to continue mo in the tradition of cutting through the goomwah"], [4.589557647705078e-05, 0.49995410442352295, 0, "last night national public radio

deep concern of this congress about the human rights abuses by indian security forces in punjab kashmir and in other regions of india and it goes further it urges the indian government to take a number of steps to curb abuses by the security forces i think this amendment to the amendment offered by the gentleman from indiana represents a consensus between the administration the congress and international human rights groups it was drafted in close consultation with asia watch the administration has no objection to the language i think if we realize that the amendment offered by the gentleman from indiana would cut several important programs n india we would realize that without my amendment it in fact will hurt those innocent people whom we are attempting to help the amendment offered by the gentleman from indiana would eliminate developmental assistance for certain housing programs for aids prevention and control in india for a whole range of other important developmental

offered by the gentleman from indiana in that it calls attention to the atrocities that are committed by milltant groups in the punjab and kashmir as well we condemn the conduct of those militants in

require employers to hire by numbers regardless of a persons qualifications for a particular job in evaluating their allegations i urge my colleagues to examine the facts the brooksfish bipartisan compromise explicitly prohibits the use of quotas by employers the claim that employers would be required to adopt quotas is baseless in fact during the hearings on the civil rights act employers could not produce any evidence that they were forced to use quotas in response to the griggs standard during the 18year period it was in use from 1971 to 1989 all the compromise would do is restore this standard the brooksfish compromise is the only proposal we have before us today which would ban the use of all quotas and would entitle the person harmed by quotas to sue for damages the administrations bill doesnt contain any antiquota language the administration tries to label this legislation as a quota bill yet produces no evidence to make it stick for those of you who believe that civil rights is actually a debate which belongs in the 1960s i ask you to examine the most recent statistics over the past decade complaints of sex discrimination and harassment on the job received by the eeoc have increased over 14 percent while staffing decreased by 24 percent women continue to earn only 68 cents for every dollar a man earns in the workplace the goal of equal pay for equal work continues to elude the vast majority of women in america on this important issue congress should not be sending mixed messages support the townsschroeder substitute which would remove the cap on punitive damages for victims of intentional sex discrimination the message we are endorsing through this civil rights bill must be one of equal treatment for all victims of intentional discrimination not unequal remedies for some simple justice requires that congress enact a strong civil rights bill if it was my daughter nr son being denied a job or a promotion based on
