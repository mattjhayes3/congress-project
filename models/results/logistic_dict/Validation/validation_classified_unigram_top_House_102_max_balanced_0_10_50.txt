such time as i may consume it is always interesting to serve on the rules committee at times we get to see some good things done for this house and for this nation at other times we see things done that are badsometimes even terrible today we have before us a rule that contains some bad and a little good i guess certainly it is an open rule that honors the minoritys right under the standing rules of this house to offer a motion to recommit with instructions and thats all to the good and the way it should be this very same rule howevei places an arbitrary time limit on consideration of amendments to the bill so it is not quite as open a rule as members might suppose it also makes in orderand i think everybody ought to listen to this it also makes in order as the text of the bill to be considered a nongermane substitute rules of the house require us to deal with germane amendments this substitute was offered at the last moment by the gentleman from california the chairman of the committee on science space and technology and it has not been considered in its entirety by his committee or even reported out of that committee so here we go again here we get to the point where this rule becomes not just bad it becomes terrible in a strictly arbitrary fashion the majority on the r les committee voted to refuse to make in order for debate the proposed amendment by the gentleman from pennsylvania sitting over here next to me the ranking member of the committee on science space and technology one of the most respected members of this house dealing with those subjects why was his amendment thrown out on the grounds that it is nongermane and has not been considered by the appropriate committee of jurisdiction thats why that is also hypocrisy let me repeat this point we are being asked to approve a rule that makes in order a nongermane substitute amendment as the text of the bill at the same time this same rule refuses equal treatment for a proposed amendment by the gentleman from pennsylvania e3 1440 why evidently because the sponsor the gentleman from pennsylvania is a republican who wants to offer major portions of president bushs economic reform package that the democrats continue to hold hostage to keep this country in recession to deliberately keep americans unemployed until after the presidential election that is disgusting that is gridlock disgusting gridlock i will seek to defeat the previous question concerning the rule when that motion is made i will do so in order to bring before this body my amendment to the rule that makes in order for consideration by this house the walker amendment break the gridlock debate the issue that is what the american people want before i yield time to those of my colleagues who wish to speak on this rule let me take a moment to comment on something said in the rules committee hearing last thursday i was momentarily called out of the hearing the other day and while i was absent my good friend from south carolina mr butler derrick whom i have a great deal of respect for and who is managing the bill for the majdrity spent some time deriding i repeat deriding a portion of the proposed walker substitute the taxpayer public debt reduction act he called it a gimmick i want to point out to my friend mr derrick that in an advisory opinion on this particular proposal requested by the gentleman from pennsylvania the congressional budget office told him this if taxpayers persisted in choosing the maximum checkoffs then spending cuts would total over 200 billion in 1997 and together with interest savings would result in guess what a balanced budget my gosh that is what the american people want so desperately i want to respond further to this talk about gimmickry first of all this rule itself is a gimmick it is not fair to this house or to our nation to prevent the opportunity for members to consider the walker amendment on the floor of this house second let me be more specific about where the socalled gimmickry lies when it comes to dealing with the public debt and our growing budget deficit which is turning this country into a debtor nation no matter what we republicans proposea lineitem veto a balanced budget amendment to the constitution a voluntary tax public debt checkoff some kind of a restraint on the inflationary growth of entitlement spendingno matter what we propose the democrats deride it as gimmickry what do you think out there america do you think all this is gimmickry i will tell you what many members of the democrat party think is not a gimmick and that is taxes when you boil away all the rhetoric deriding other ways to deal with the deficit that is all you find from the democrat party but let me tell you that taxes are the biggest gimmick of them all because more taxes only mean more spending by this unresponsible congress tax and spend tax and spend that is the heartbeat of many in the majority party we only have to look at the many attempts by the majority leadership in this house to break down the firewalls in the 1990 budget agreement to get their hands on more spending money we can tell where their heart lies now let us see if this bill that the rule would bring before us can give us further insight into whether a democratcontrolled congress plans even greater spending in the coming years listen the congressional budget office has estimated that if enacted this bill before us right now this bill alone would result in new additional spending of at least 1 6 billions1 6 billion of money we do not have here is the real gimmickry and it does not take long to realize it with a democrat president in the white house this democratcontrolled congress would be even more out of control with taxes and spending going through the roof now i will leave it up to the gentleman from pennsylvania to explain his proposed amendment including the taxpayer public debt reduction act it contains and how that amendment would help to get our economy back on track but let me say this about the package first of all over 2 years ago the commerce departments technology administration the very agency this bill purports to strengthen warned us that the unitedstates lead in research into various leading technologies would not reap the appropriate economic reward without bold reforms such as what product liability reform which is so badly needed thats what let me cite a quotation from a recent article on that issue which illustrates why this is so american business people are running scared and their fear of liability colors all kinds of business decisions the outcome reluctance to innovate and to invest when our economic future demands risk and creativity that was from the washington post last month the walker substitute addresses not just product liability but professional liability as well frankly the cost of frivolous lawsuits while they may be enriching certain ambulancechasing trial lawyers is diminishing our national wealth and undermining our competitiveness the walker substitute is not a gimmick it addresses longterm problems that are sapping our economic strength finally i have to remind my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that simply throwing money at our problems will not make them go away in fact it will only make them worse if we enlarge the deficit which this bill does let me tell my colleagues what a major ceo was recently quoted as saying you ought to listen to this out there because america thinks this way our biggest structural problem is a shortage of savings and we have a shortage of savings available for investment because the national budget deficit absorbs 80 percent to 90 percent of the savings pool that is from the washington post on my colleagues calling new spending an investment does not make it so if you doubt that gimmicks are being foisted upon this nation by the majority party let me quote from the ultimate liberal george mcgovern himself here is what he said i have a hunch that clinton and gore are much more liberal underneath and will prove it when theyre elected i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.00340454513207078, 0.00340454513207078,

the leading democrat candidate eagerly leaps into class warfare he wants to increase taxes on the jobproducers in america this is what his party did with the socalled luxury tax in 1990 their tax increase resulted in the loss of tens of thousands of jobs in the boat industry and other industries i urge my sensible colleagues on the other side of the aisle to join us in working toward passing a

in the speakers chair know to sit up there in that great historical american speakers chair and preside over this house let me say that my subject matter tonight in the fourth special order that i am doing on the presidency to come either a second term for president george bush or a 4year uncertain run for the governor of arkansas mr clinton is that one of my staffers pointed out to me this week by telephone when i was home in california the striking difference between some of the writings of mr clinton and the unbelievably moving and poignant letter by union officer and major of the 2d rhode island regiment to his wife sarah it was probably the high point for me of the whole incredible 1112 hour series on the civil war that pbs has already aired twice public broadcasting thinks so highly of this letter of maj sullivan ballou that when they have their subscription drives they offer this letter on simulated parchment from the civil war period and i could never come within light years of reading it in the same beautiful manner as the excellent narrators voice in that civil war series but i am going to do it to set the tone of what i think is the essence of pure honor and pure sacrifice when it comes to the ugliest of all mankinds shortcomings warfare this was the letter written at camp clark very close here to washington dc i will find out exactly where this camp clark was on todays map it was written on july 14 1861 and it begins my dear sarah the indications are very strong that we will move in a few days perhaps tomorrow lest i should not be able to write again i feel impelled to write a few lines that may fall into your eye when i shall be no more i have no misgivings about or lack of confidence in the cause in which i am engaged and my courage does not halt or falter i know how strongly american civilization now leans on the triumph of the government and how great a debt we owe to those who went before us through the blood and sufferings of the revolution and i am willing perfectly willing to lay down all my joys in this life to help maintain this government and to pay that debt sarah my love for you is deathless it seems to bind me with mighty cables that nothing but omnipotence can break and yet my love of country comes over me like a strong wind and airs me irresistibly on with all these chains to the battlefield the memory of the blissful moments i have spent with you come creeping over me and i feel most gratified to god and to you that i have enjoyed them so long and hard it is for me to give them up and burn to ashes the hopes of future years when god willing we might have lived and loved together and seen our sons grow up to honorable manhood around us i have i know but few and small claims upon divine providence but something whispers to me perhaps it is the wafted prayer of my little edgar that i shall return to my loved ones unharmed if i do not dear sarah never forget how much i love you and when my last breath escapes me on the battlefield it will whisper your name forgive me my many faults and the many pains ive caused you how thoughtless and foolish i have ofttimes been how gladly i would wash out with my tears every little spot upon your happiness but oh sarah if the dead can come back to this earth and flit unseen around those they loved i shall always be near you in the gladdest days and in the darkest nights always always and if there be a soft breeze upon your cheek this shall be my breath as the cool air fans your throbbing temple it shall be my spirit passing by sarah do not mourn me dead think i am gone and wait for me for we shall meet again maj sullivan ballou was killed just a few days later at the first battle of bull run very close to where my family lives here when the house is in session that sacred ground out there at what the south calls manassas and the north calls bull run it was the beginning of the greatest agony in the history of our country madam speaker 618 000 dead americans most of them dead to disease there were a lot of people that did not share major balous cause forty percent or more of this country fought on a different side very few of them were slaveowners but they were tragically even the revered gen robert e lee fighting a perpetual cause that would have perpetuated the second greatest evil in this countryi believe the greatest evil to be abortion and i am entitled to that opinionbut slavery the stealing of mens lives and womens lives and childrens lives but at least letting them live that is an equal horror and in some cases maybe for those in the most suppressed situations painful continuing this series of special orders about a man who has overcome incredible odds bill clinton to carry the nomination of the party that has the highest registration in our country when he finds himself coming out of his convention with double digits it may be 2030 points ahead when people are writing it is his race to lose i am questioning his honor and people have a right to know something about me just a brief sketch i joined at 19 because like bill clinton i had a fantasy of someday becoming president of the united states i thought it might be possible i dreamed about it often during the course of my life setting a goal in politics this chamber or the other side and i set a high standard for myself a standard that in the main i have tried to cling to i could be a better or more charitable person but nobody is shredding my reputation about breaking my marital vows or using drugs or letting someone else wear the uniform qf my country in my place i was watching john lewis speak tonight beautifully eloquently and i thought about sitting in the second row in front of the lincoln memorial watching john at 29 years of age address a quarter of a million people that had marched with martin luther king i was in that audience i had marched with dr king and i was proud of it i had nothing to bring to that at 30 years of age except to wear my air force captains uniform i remember a little lad a little child of africanamerican descent came up to me and said sir sir he was about 6 or 7 years of age he said are you guarding or marching i said i am marching son and he slipped his hand in mine from somewhere around 8th and 9th street i marched all that distance holding this little beautiful bodys hand and then lost him somewhere around the memorial i sat with a delegation of people who were mostly liberals and proud of it from hollywood hollywood was a different community then the liberal cause was generally civil rights a few old timers that had praised stalin and lenin and were sorry for it but they knew how to apologize in those days but it was not a city of violent films cocaine sexual promiscuity and the death of storytelling it was a pretty good group and i was proud to be with those liberals i have an impulse as an investigative reporter which is causing me to get on governor clintons trail and try to find the truth i swam the chappaquiddick channel on mary jo kopechnes birthday 1 week after somebody else did not swim it nobody in this chamber or the other has negotiated that channel by swimming except this member i have been to the soviet union 10 times i have been to vietnam 10 times only once in uniform for a couple of days ferrying an airplane i never could get my government to bring me back on active duty the shame of it is i had no right with five children under 9 years of age to even dare to ask to go back on active duty when i had served my time honorably in the most dangerous profession one of certainly the most top two or three most dangerous professions in the military flying supersonic aircraft bill clinton describes himself as a boy at 23 on this floor the other day i said that i felt i was a man that i was training to be an element leader i met one of my pilots that i checked out today over in the cannon caucus room he works for the national security council david palmer i have not seen him in years i just recalled the other day that i bailed out of an f86 sabrejet august 22 1960 i had only turned 23 a few months before on april 3 1 bailed out a second time when i was 26 when i bailed out the second time i had four children i was flying in the california guard not on active duty i used to laugh you get back on the horse that throws you if you love flying and want to serve the country and wear the uniform you do not take those brushes with death as some cowardly excuse to say not for me anymore now 23 is a man i find out now historically the most peculiar thing in the world i know now that the people in clintons headquarters watched this young george stephanopolous insulted me with some name like lunatic what does that young punk know i am going to show you a picture in a minute georgestephen i mean stephen stephanopoluisi am going to show you the antithesis of the man you are dedicating your life to i will tell you something about heroes he became an ace richard bong who dropped out of college to join the air force months before pearl harbor richard bong became an ace at 23 years of age betsey and didi and steve and all the people down there at the clinton headquarters did you ever hear of the sullivan brothers reading sullivan ballous letter made me think of the sullivan brothers i remember crying in that movie when i was a young boy about the sullivan brothers i have been reading about guadalcanal because we are going through the 50th anniversary of the longest battle in the history of the united states it started august 7 1942 and it wasnt over until february 9 1943 that is a long long time for young marines and then finally backed up by young army soldiers to battle in those jungles japanese soldiers used to capture an occasional marine and torture him and put a megaphone or a public address system in front of his mouth and the other marines would hear him screaming as he was tortured to death marine tomorrow you die i grew up in a time of heroes these five sullivan brothers were all killed when the light cruiser uss juneau was torpedoed during one of the many sea battles off guadalcanal they died that anniversary is coming up here the 50th anniversary we will be adjourned 10 days after the election listen to these deaths i want bill clinton to be aware of these deaths these were all men george 29 francis 26 joseph 23 a man not a boy governor madison 22 and albert 20 albert was the age that george bush was when he was shot down in the same pacific ocean twice 10 months later they all had worked these five sullivan brothers for the rath packing co and vowed to enlist and fight together after the death of a boyhood friend and all went down on that light cruiser together i was thinking about eddie rickenbacher who looked almost 10 or 15 years older than he was our ace of aces in world war i who shot down 22 airplanes and 4 enemy balloons he was 26 when he had his first few victories so i guess that is not close enough to suit governor clinton to 23 years of age here is what drives me on to do these special orders on clintons lack of honor it is simply the way he speaks the way he twists things the way he deceives here is a press release from the association of the medal of honor society j elliott williams president of the congressional medal of honor society today and this was 2 days ago criticized bill clinton for misleading the public into believing that the medal of honor group supported the democratic nominee during an interview this morning on nbcs today show that would be monday bill clinton indicated that he was backed by now get this clever wordage all the medal of honor winners who have endorsed me they know the facts but according to williams only three of the 205 surviving recipients of the congressional medal of honor have actually endorsed the governor his statements indicating support of all recipients of the medal of honor is blatantly false and misleading mr williams said i personally feel that clinton continues to lie about the draft issue and he lies about our endorsement we cannot endorse nor do we endorse bill clinton for president now one of the articulate women that serve in this house got up following me the other day and said bill clinton will be the greatest president of this century i immediately flashed on the roosevelts particularly teddy roosevelt i though about fivestar general eisenhower who walked through the concentration camps and looked at the emaciated bodies of the people he had liberated in what he called the great crusade i said here the other night he had the our father composed by jesus christ our savior pumped out over the public address system of 5 000 invasion ships and how politically incorrect that would be today this office of the presidency is special to me i can rattle off all 41 in a few seconds i said the other day that came from a punishment by a good nun in the seventh grade sister miriam rita when i was in beginning pilot training in 1953 i strived to be the highest ranking cadet out of about 1 500 and i miraculously made it i was the aviation cadet corps commander colonel cadet col robert k dornan i had gotten that position partly by memorizing what was called cadet memory the best of all the cadet memory was a general order a go sent out by gen george washington to his troops at valley forge this is why honor is important to me the quality of our first president the father of our country e 2310 he sent this order out in the winter of 1777 to men who were combatants without boots a third of them about foul speech i put the gennifer flowers tapes in the record the other day i did it partially thinking about what george washington would have thought of someone running for the presidency with these tapes out there and the news media suppressing them not knowing about them at all really here is the way he felt about men combatants in the presence of only men not in the drawing rooms of philadelphia society or in front of women and children but just men around men here is what george washington said the general is sorry to be informed that the foolish and wicked practice of profane cursing and swearing a vice heretofore little known to an american army is growing into fashion he hopes the officers will endeavor to check it and that both they and the men will reflect that we can have little hope of the blessing of heaven upon our arms if we insult it by our impiety and follow added to this it is a vice so mean and so low without any temptation that every man of sense and character detests and despises it george washington 1777 valley forge that is a quality human being and that is a strain that more often than not comes down through jefferson and madison and jackson and lincoln right down into these times and george bush i believe is that type of quality man as a father and a grandfather and a man who tried to compromise with leaders in this chamber and the other chamber and was taken to the cleaners on a tax increase that i am beginning to think was a cleverly devised plan looking forward to the 1992 election season to destroy a compact that the president had with his supporters and with thousands upon thousands of reagan democrats not to raise taxes i went out this weekend again on the road for the president a week ago i was in new haven and white plains new york a week before that colusa county and up in california this weekend i went to phoenix tucson for the president when i was in tucson because of the special orders of last week one of the veterans of the 355 tac fighter wing that flew out of takli we had two amazing bases in the center of thailand korat in takli these were our two f105 thunderstreak bases thunder chief bases the men gave a nickname to their planes thud the sound of it hitting the ground it was a beautiful airplane and it carried the heaviest burden on the air force side of attacking route pack 5 and 6 over north vietnam these men if they had been given the proper orders by robert disgraceful strange mcnamara they would have succeeded in stopping the aggresgion of the communists in north vietnam over the south one of the people who had been a veteran of this wing came to this gathering of 220 people the tucson trunk as in elephant trunk and tusk republican club and there were a couple of congressmen there a couple of my colleagues that i was appearing for there were many candidates who were state senate assembly one of the congressional challengers in my party was there all sorts of chairmen and party leaders i asked how many of them had ever read a single word of the gennifer flowers tapes not a single hand went up i asked how many of them had ever known till they saw my special order that bill clinton never graduated from oxford is not an oxford man barely got through half the program and spent all of this time creating demonstrations in europe and oslo and now we find out in moscow hardly anybody knew i asked them what they knew about the chronology or his record of draft dodging hardly anybody knew these are smart politically active people at the end of it this retired colonel came up and presented me with something and it moved me because he compared me to the symbolic type of composite hero that i thought i could join and help in the vietnam war but it was my fate to be a journalist and try and track the noble men and noble women in a noble cause here is what the colonel gave to me it is a picture that says at the bottom the fighter pilot it is by maxine mccaffrey the late maxine mccaffrey who became the most beautiful artist capturing the spirit of our fighting men and women in vietnam it says dedicated to the fighter pilot who flew in southeast 1964 when that year ended and we only had 23 000 people there to 1973 their mission was to fly and fight and they didnt forget it it says to united states congressman robert k dornan an american patriot from tucson river rats september 28 this year river rats are those men who flew missions over northeast vietnam in both the navy air force and many marines also and i think that this picture is the antithesis the very antithesis of bill clinton this is the type of hero that bill clinton is not this is the type of man that did his duty knowing that this chamber and the unitedstates senate and the white house was manipulating him and his life in a political way so that he was not allowed to achieve victory in vietnam you notice the colors are the colors of the flag of south vietnam free vietnam red and yellow you notice the frame is bamboo i will treasure this now there are two articles that i could submit to the record i choose to read them i think they are so important the first one todays los angeles times by harry g summers jr he is a retired colonel i think he was the best of all the former military experts who the networks utilized to try and bring us some understanding of desert shield and then the 42day air war over land and the last 4 days by the brilliant 4day land war called desert storm harry summers is a retired army colonel a lecturer in strategy and a distinguished fellow at the army war college here is what he says today which side are you on bill not clinton but those who served and fought communism are vindicated by history the column begins amazingi almost a quarter of a century later after all that has transpired governor bill clinton still sticks by the slogans of the antiamerican rallies that he organized in england and maybe in some scandinavian countries during his student days there most of his contemporaries have long since thought better of their actions given the horror of the reeducation concentration camps where 400 000 vietnamese were imprisoned for decades after the war and good colonel you leave out 68 000 executed by death squads of people who trusted us looked up to us believed in us and in many cases loved us we were not the french they did not want us to leave he goes on the unspeakable suffering of the almost 1 million boat people and the grinding poverty engendered by the rigid marxist economic policies of the communist victories most people who wave national liberation front banners and shouted ho ho ho chi minh the nlf is going to win now realize that their loyalties were terribly misplaced but not clinton one may question his morals or his patriotism but one cannot fault his tenacity in an interview published about a year ago in the october 5 army times clinton tells of how he worked for 2 of his college years on the staff of the senate foreign relations committee under fulbright i became convinced that our policy in vietnam was a tragic mistake that we werent going to win we werent trying to win we couldnt win if he had stopped there most americans including most who fought in vietnam would have nodded in agreement but clinton had to show his moral superiority to those who did serve by defending the slogans of his youth we werent supporting the sides that were capable of prevailing and who might that have been at the time according to senator fulbright and his ilk that meant the national liberation front the supposedly autonomous collection of south vietnamese freedom fighters opposing the tyranny of the saigon government sure enough the national liberation front did prevail only to then contemptuously reveal to those they had duped that they were in no sense an independent entity organized in hanoi in december 1960 the nlf was totally controlled and directed by the communists in north vietnam even at the time clinton was shouting his slogans soldiers of the north vietnamese army nva constituted more than 70 percent of the viet cong guerilla forces in the south and in great spring victory the account of his multidivision crossborder blitzkreig that overwhelmed south vietnam in 1975 north vietnamese army general van tien dung hardly mentions the role of the viet cong or the liberation front it turned out this is general van tien dung now the sides that were capable of winningexcuse me that is clintons quote were not the vc or the nfl they were north vietnams regular armed forces it was not black pajamaclad viet gong guerillas that broke down the front gate of the presidential palace in saigon in april 1975 it was a t4 tank of the north vietnamese army clinton could be forgiven for not foreseeing that in 196809his first year at oxford when i have to assume he did go to class a many people were misled by north vietnamese propaganda including not only fulbright but many viet cong cadres as well but to persist in that ignorance in 1992 is unconscionable almost 10 years ago in his landmark 1983 work vietnam a history former washington post correspondent stanley karnowand he is the central figure played by sam waterson in the amazing film killing fieldskarnow described the nlf as a true communist front organization which took their orders from the politburo in hanoi and he s a liberal writer he described the betrayal of their south vietnam supporters as well a quote from dr duoung quynh hoa he says i have been a communist all my life he is one of the 16 founders of the nlf but now for the first time i have seen the realities of communism it is a failuremismanagement corruption privilege repression my ideals are gone gone with the wind in his 1990 book flashbacks on returning to vietnam cbs news correspondent morley safer corroborated karnows findings remember morley safer was the one that showed the marine lighting the hooch on fire and a corps marine officer and said we have to burn this village to save it a good piece of film morley we must have seen it a thousand times during the rest of the effort to save the vietnamese from communism morley safer corroborates karnows findings they called it a peoples revolution said former vc colonel pham xuan an but of course the people were the first to suffer the people were immediately forgotten they still havent remembered the people a quarter of a century ago when bill clinton was leading his antiwar rallies through the streets of london i do not think colonel summers knows he was traveling to moscow i will straighten harry out tomorrow he undoubtedly believed that he occupied the moral high ground but clinton failed to notice that the ground has been shifted dramatically beneath his feet time has shown conclusively that it was not the national liberation front and their supporters among the american antiwar movement who were on the side of history it was those who clifiton loathed the young american men and women who served in his stead to oppose the spread of communism that have been vindicated that clinton still just doesnt get it that he still cannot admit that he was wrong is a sad commentary indeed on the depths of his intellectual ignorance since my special order on friday i have learned out of the mouth of his press secretary exactly when he arrived in moscow get your pencils help me madam chairman work with me people he arrived on new years eve the 31st of december a wednesday the last day of the year 1969 that means when he woke up somewhere in moscow with housing undoubtedly supplied by the kgb i have to give young boy clinton the benefit of the doubt that he didnt know that but every peace group was manipulated by soviet secret police kgbcontrolled they used their word peacemir like a hammer to pursue their goals in afghanistan angola cuba nicaragua and yes vietnam cambodia and laos and mongolia and in all the captive nations before that in east europe it was always peace they were fighting for if they could find a young american that would violate the sense of decency and honor to travel to great britain and arrange demonstrations against better men than he who probably hated the war worse than he did because they were the warriors who had to put up with the unbelievable political manipulations mig sanctuaries i mentioned the other day so these soviet mig fighters just on the outskirts of moscow shipped to vietnam could take off from a robert mcnamara dishonorably created sanctuary and our young pilots would see the sun glint off their wings knowing the next time they would see them is when they were coming at them from 40 45 50 000 feet to make one run to kill some lieutenant on his first mission who graduated from college with better grades than bill clinton who understood that when there is a window of opportunity and your country needs you as i quoted churchill the other night particularly if you ever want to lead men into battle or serve in a political position on an armed services committee or secretary of defense or president of the united states commander in chief if you ever aspire to that you do not let one two three and four young men take your place and wear the uniform of your country here is another article today by the way i said i swam the chappaquiddick channel marched with martin luther king what quirk of fate put me in moscow that very week i kind of felt something friday night when i was on the floor here that he was going to turn out to have been in the soviet union in the very early part of 1970 remember all i had to go on was one of those vague lines of his that he was there sometime in the early seventies you cant get any earlier than january 1 1970 and a few days later as i said the other night i arrived with carol hanson connie hessel pat hardy pat mearns we arrived there on a nonstop flight from cairo egypt and we were arrested at the airport because we didnt have the greased visa that bill clinton had gotten at the russian embassy in moscow where some agent came up to him pretending he was a fellow student and said you are a wonderful american demonstrating against this evil imperialistic interventionist war of american capitalism stopping the poor viet cong from controlling their own fate this is great that you have the guts to demonstrate against your own country with these skulls and crossbones and caskets and singing and chanting right here in grosvenor square in front of the statue to the american eagle squadron and under the nose of franklin roosevelt the commander in chief that helped pull russias chestnuts out of the fire against the german blitzkreig the nazi conquest operation barbarossa right in that square bill clinton was recruited to come on by the russian embassy i will give you that address tomorrow and to come to the soviet union in the dead of winter you know what the wives and i remembered that temperature to be twentysix degrees below zero i had the unitedstates weather service do a search over the last 2 days you know what the average temperature was that whole week he claims he was in moscow we dont know that he was there but 2 weeks 3 weeks 4 weeks who says it was a week everything else he twists and distorts that week the average temperature was 22 3 degrees below zero what student from oxford as dede meyers his spokesman said in response to my three special orders last week oh it is a ridiculous insinuation he was there like any other student traveling on a winter break no no no tourists were going there it was not very friendly as he describes it it was not a period of detente this was the height of the vietnam war i repeat again what i said friday soviet fighter pilots were flying mig23s against the israelis because the israelis shot down five of them soviet pilots may have been flying in vietnam killing our men and we know for certain they were training the north vietnamese no this was the height of the war here are the exact statistics the day he left for moscow and we do not know whether he flew in on a plane or came in a car because none of the people none of the media people in this country pinned him up against the wall yet and said how did you get to moscow train or plane when did you go when did you show up in oslo was it december 18 was it a month after how did you get there here is how many men died when he was there december 31 2 january 1 19 january 2 another 19 january 3 15 26 120 men and any one of them might have been one of the soldiers that took his place it is incredible what were the casualties for the vietnamese in that same week there were 304 of our allies killed 786 wounded and when i kept track of this every day off of the front page of the l a times and i have a scroll that goes from here to the other end of the speakers area i always recorded the socalled enemy boys because they were peasant kids they did not know what they were fighting for under ho chi minh there were 1 999 young men from north vietnam who suffered the ultimate death fighting to turn their country into the economic basket case that it is now there is the date i am trying to find out when clnton was in oslo sometime after december 12 not november as i said friday where did he go from oslo on december 12 before he claims through the mir that he shows up on new years eve 26 degrees below zero in moscow what hotel did he stay at what youth hostel wherever he stayed i will bet you that the soviet government picked up the bill the kgb and we just know that is the case and it will come out and the horror of it is that all of this will come out after he is president because then he picks up that radioactivity of the leader of the free world when i was a young fighter pilot we used to have an expression i just saw it in an aviation magazine 36 years later we used to say that there are only three jobs worth having in the united states a super rock star and notice the word super a super rock star president of the united states or fighter pilot that is how we loved our profession well this man avoided the third and his saxophone certainly is not going to get him in the first category and he is going to end up the president of the united states then he takes on the special aura of the office then what his alterego that he has been working with since that group worked for mcgovern in east texas as youth organizers in 1972 he and betsy wright then will have to worry about the bimbo expression that is her expression not mary matalins then the bimbo eruption will be able to get hard coinage of the realm of hard copy or current affair or maury povich or philly donahue and they will all be looking for these people a lot of them will be frauds like the flying saucer type people but a lot of them will be the real ones that are going to start to pop up and they are going to be telling the stories of i traveled to moscow with the future president of the united states we worked with people that on reflection i have to admit were probably kgb we worked for peace we did not realize we were part of the evil empire and were being used because as colonel summers says where are the admissions of youth in full naivete with the reflection of history he is still clinging to the chants of those disloyal marchers in foreign countries here is the september 9 wall street journal clinton ignores historys lessons in vietnam peter r kann who happens to be the publisher of the journal bill clinton was back onstage last week explaining his actions of 23 years ago in avoiding the draft and vietnam his complex maneuvers then and convoluted explanations now make it unlikely his one final statement on the subject will be his last i think that is the one he made at the american legion yet the real issue isnt where bill clintons heart and feet were in 1969 but rather where his head is in 1992 what he did 23 years ago and why is less relevant to being president than how he explains those actions today but even that socalled character issue is less germane to his potential presidency than what he now thinks about the rightness or wrongness the causes and effects of the american experience in vietnam when bill clinton says that 23 years ago and interestingly that is precisely half his life ago since he is now 46 when bill clinton says that 23 years ago be believed strongly our policy in vietnam was wrong he was reflecting a then common view of a controversial politicized confilct i added ollticized when 23 years later he says i still believe that it reflects obliviousness to the lessons of two decades of history in vietnam asia and beyond for those of us of bill clintons generation the late sixties and the early seventies were a testing time at the poles of our generation were those whose convictions led them to volunteer for vietnam and those whose convictions led them to resist the draft in between of course were the many who went because some combination of draft and duty called the many more who straddled fiddled and found sanctuaryfrom graduate schools to national guard unitsand later the many who lucked out with high lottery numbers conviction convenience class courage cowardice and simple luck all shaped the actions of our generation two decades later most might agree that its only those who went and servedor the families of those who did not returnwho truly inhabit a high ground from which to cast stones at bill clinton and the rest this high ground isnt populated by many politicians pundits press people or others positioned to play moral arbiter morality aside the political and military issues of the vietnam era confused many americans containing communism in a period of developing detente defending an often imperfect ally pardon me like france you know and like a lot of people that we have defended or like south korea there are a lot of countries that we have defended and shed blood over that turned out to be imperfect supporting distant asian dominoes sowing democratic seeds in soil that frequently seemed infertile waging the war with too much firepower or too little all this was eminently arguable two decades or more ago so too were the questions of what price was worth paying for victory and what cost might be paid for defeat all fair issues in 1969 but now its 1992 and it is hard to think of any issues or any place in the world where hindsight offers a cleaner spotlight in which to distinguish right from wrong and success from failure the postwar history of vietnamthe revenge of the reeducation camps the exodus of more than 1 million boat people 500 000 or 600 000 drowned at sea were ravaged to death by sharks or from days of dehydration on otherwise paradiselooking islands so there is a misery that still goes on there the crowded little cubbyhole hovels that people live in in hong kong at this minute as i read this the economic misery and political repression that was the lot of those left behindsurely has made it obvious even to former flower children of the sixties flower children of the sixties the blooming idiots of today that is my aside that the vietnamese communists were not as one of the friends of my youth put it those groovy little people in the jungle but rather the hardest and harshest of communist cadres these events in vietnamand in the killing fields of cambodia and poisoned villages of laos remember yellow rain red rain the poison that came from moscow the same kind of thing that saddam husein is doing today botulism nerve gas mustard gas all of these poison gases first tested in ethiopia and then in laos as to the rest of asia it did not go communist of course but rather emergedfree prosperous and stableas the model for the developing world and the pride of the developed one surely it isnt because we left or lost vietnam that this has all come about but rather because we stayed so long and fought so hard our long and painful vietnam experience bought the time for the rest of asia to build foundations of free enterprise economics and freer societies to create the prosperity and personal dignity that precludes communism taking root the president of singapore told me that to my face lee kuan yew ben blaz our colleague from the island of guam was there and stayed back he actually stayed back and i stayed back to talk to him ben blaz told him i have never heard such eloquence as you are expressing how our sacrifice in vietnam bought you freedom malaysia freedom thailand freedom the president of singapore understands these words these onetime political dominoes that we now call economic tigers they not vietnam were the wars winners and it is we who were and are their role model like this composite symbolic heroic fighter pilot what about the wider world the expansionist totalitarian ideology we sought to resist in vietnam two decades later it collapsed in stalins satellites and then in vladimir lenins own land in china in vietnam and a few other outposts the ideology lingers on trying to compromise with capitalism while repressing people a combination unlikely to last do not forget cuba and north korea communism however did not simply collapse of its own accord that is probably clintons opinion that is mcgoverns opinion his hero of his youth it collapsed because the unitedstates and other free societies waged a long twilight struggle from the 1940s through the 1980s late 1980s from harry trumans berlin airlift to ronald reagans pershing missile development from europe to vietnam to afghanistan we won some battles and we lost some battles but even the lost battles for those who view vietnam as a loss were part of winning the wider war for bill clinton or any of us to have foreseen and fathomed all of this in 1969 would have required a gift of wisdom if not of prophecyto understand it and in 1992 it requires merely common sense in the same week that mr clinton was reaffirming that america was wrong in vietnam the far eastern economic review of dow jones magazine published out of hong kong was reporting an extraordinary story titled the rebels that time forgot i will get this story because i missed it it is about a lost army of mountain tribesmen totally isolated in the remotest jungles of indochina like the hmong people in the pleiku area in the little village of kontum that put this bracelet on my wrist in september 1968 oh yes that was the month bill clinton was starting his sojourn with no tests no quizzes no book reports no papers no thesis to write or turn in that was a quarter of a century ago that i put this bracelet on the village chieftain put it on and said please do not take it off until they stop killing my people these tribesmen the rebels time forgot totally isolated in the remotest jungles of indochina continued to wage a lonely struggle to defend their culture their religion and their freedom against vietnamese communists these tribesmen however trapped in a time warp still understand the difference between what is right and what is wrong it is also important for presidents in the remaining 8 minutes i have i would like to tell a storyabout that september 1968 i did not realize i was going to think of this tonight i was going as a journalist with a uso tour a handshaker it was called the american performers went over there by ones and twos and they could go way out right to the front lines and i went over with a boyhood friend and schoolmate gary crosby bing crosbys son and gary and i went to all four corps areas went to wooden platforms built on the top of mountains along the~edge of the dmz in i corps all the way down to some of the jungle camps in the huminlr forest in the iv corps area south of the delta and it was in a hospital somewhere i believe in the iii corps area in the area where the l1th cavalry regiment a beautiful emblem red and white diagonal with a black rearedup stallion on it and it was commanded by general pattons son we went into one of the hospitals and they always wanted the handshake tours to go in the hospitals this was september 1968 the third week of september that the minitet offensive the major tet offensive being all of february the month that mcnamara resigned on new years eve day february 29 with blood on his hands walked off the battlefield gave the last year of johnsons secretary of defense leadership role to clark clifford who has got his own problems right now mcnamara 7 years of disgraceful service and he dumped out in the last year to clark clifford february was the major tet offensive this is september the minitet and gary and i go into a hospital we always met with the army nurses we were so impressed with the courage of these courageous women one of the nurses said gary i want you to come here and meet somebody a fan of your fathers knows you grew up with you cover of life magazine when you were 16 singing sams song he wants to talk to you if gary is listening now he will choke up listening to this he kneels down next to this trooper lying in a bed on his face his face was over the end of the bed his head was shaved he had metal stitches in his skull i had never seen that both his arms were gone he had part of one arm part of one leg but both his legs really were were gone and a big piece of his face and his chin was gone but he was able to speak his face was in a net looking down at a bowl where he was bleeding not bleeding as much as just saliva leaving his body but he could talk clearly and he started talking to gary gary choked and could not speak he stood up and came over to me and said please go over and talk to this trooper and i said ok i thought because gary could not that maybe i could i could not speak either when i knelt down and he said gary is that you and finally i got a response out and said yeah yeah it is and he said gary i am from chicago they tell me people in my home town are flying vietcong and north vietnamese flags is that true go back go to your local library and look at the september and late august issues of time and newsweek and look at the pictures in grant and lincoln parks with these flower children flying these enemy flags that have so torn up indochina these communist flags i said well yeah it is ust a few creeps do not worry about it it is not the country the people still support what you are trying to do here we have just got to figure out how to resolve this thing depoliticize it he said well gary will you make me a promise promise me you will never never let any of these people fly an enemy flag in front of you you have got to picture this probably very handsome young guy with his arms and legs all gone but one arm and his face in this mesh staring straight at the floor trying to turn his head i said to him i swear to you i will never let an enemy flag fly in front of my face and i have seven of them in a boy in my cellar at home four or five of them i picked up right out at the mall here april 23 1971 that was the day i saw a massachusetts navy lieutenant with the navy cross throw his medals at the capitol they are on his wall now over in the unitedstates senate he said he had borrowed somebody elses medals that he was throwing that asked him to but i remember the press conferences on a day in 1971 and they said they were his medals i kept my promise to that trooper he did not want to be in vietnam he let himself be drafted and in a sense was volunteering there were so many excuses to get out of there tomorrow when i pick up my next special order i am going to try and make sense of a lot of this what is the first casualty of politics the truth i am going to compare some of clintons quotes back and forth what he said last year and what he is saying now then i want to analyze the information in that letter to colonel holmes where colonel holmes said what he said alone in his december 3 1969 letter would have restricted bill clinton from ever qualifying to be an officer in the united states military this is why holmes placed that letter in the rotc files to make sure that clinton would never again be able to become an officer in the united states i just found out today that clinton took and failed his air force officer physical in 1969 he took and failed a navy officer physical in 1969 he sought federal employment that would bring a deferment in 1969 through influence he had a navy reserve billet set aside for him in a unit that was full that was in 1968 he had senator fulbrights chief of staff his aa exert pressure on that same rotc commander colonel holmes so that he would go to the draft board which he did to take clinton in under extraordinary arrangement take him into the rotc and in a 2hour conversation at the colonels house about his deferment he concealed from colonel holmes the fact that he had already received two draft induction notices been involved and been a leader in organizing antiwar activities in a foreign country and that information alone would have had the colonel say get out of my house sought draft avoidance with an oxford classmate through winthrop rockefeller and it goes on and on i will pick up tomorrow with more inserts to discuss why i do not believe or why i believe the governor of arkansas does not have the honor the principle and the character to be the president of the united states and the commander in chief"], [0.004869848024100065, 0.004869848024100065, 0, "when i left this chamber about 4 hours ago i vowed that i would come back and participate further in the debate when i left we were looking at charts that i did not have a chance to question the gentleman who was making the presentation on because he decided that instead of answers we were going to have filibusters i would just like to say that before i left the charts i saw and this ground has probably been covered but i would like to just note as i go into my remarks i saw charts being presented to the american people that looked like beautiful charts but interestingly enough the charts had absolutely nothing to do with unemployment which was supposedly what was the motivating factor on the other side of the aisle in fact the individual portraying these charts admitted that they had nothing to do with unemployment in fact when you looked at the charts they also did nothing to do with job creation we saw the charts and they also had nothing to do with job creation we saw the charts and they also had nothing to do with inflation and other ideas and concepts that deal directly with the wealth and prosperity of our people what we saw and i think it is down there at this point at this time what we saw was a chart that dealt with how many people were covered by unemployment insurance let us note that that chart made jimmy carter look very good usually when the democrats had both control of the presidency and both houses of congress any chart dealing with unemployment benefits looked good because you have so many more people on unemployment benefits it is often said that democrats like the poor so much they make a lot more of them one of the charts i saw was a chart which by the way presents such an inaccurate image of reality it is almost humorous and it was so skewed that it was presenting just the first 3 years of various administrations and portraying to the public exactly how much growth was experienced during those administrations under that scenario of course you have jimmy carter and i think it had 11 percent growth under the carter administration you cannot fool the american people with phony baloney like that they know what happened under the carter administration nobody wants to go back to the carter administration but you can have all charts you want ronald reagan was not reelected in 1984 because the people were so dissatisfied with him and all of a sudden the good days of the carter administration turned into a disaster but they were blinded by some commercial on tv the reason ronald reagan was reelected by such a great degree and that president bush was elected thereafter was because the american people felt they were better off indeed no lines on a piece of paper are going to convince them otherwise in fact most of the charts that we have seen coming from the other side of the aisle over the last 3 years have a funny component to them it is almost every time you take a look at a chart that says look how bad the reagan years were if you look real close at the figures of what they are actually analyzing they have added in the carter years to the reagan years in fact usually their charts leave out the last couple of years of the reagan years which were also growth years the american people are not going to be fooled by people trying to tell us that things were so great under jimmy carter i have something in my pocket when we were speaking of charts that i thought was interesting i just sort of while i was watching the gentleman on the floor present his charts and talking about how bad the reagan administration was and how bad the 1980s were i remember him talking about how he was there in 1981 when the reagan policies were first put in place i thought it was very interesting that this is a newspaper clipping that i just happened to find in my pocket this was taken out of the paper about a month ago it was taken out of the washington times i have another clipping from the washington post which says the same thing it says unitedstates poverty rate up median income falls the washington times has a chart and it has this headline the first rise in poverty since 1983 now one of the most important aspects of these headlines is the fact that it is suggesting that for the first time since 1983 there has been an increase in poverty if you listen to the other side of the aisle you would think that the reagan administration had brought great increases in poverty upon our people that has not happened at all in fact we have the first increase in poverty since 1983 which suggests it was going in the opposite direction for all of these years now why is that well i think it has something to do with tlie policies what is also interesting about the policies when you take a look at the numbers and the years you are talking about what policies affected what administrations i worked in the reagan administration i knew what policies we were putting in place and when they were put in place i also could say that it takes a little time for those policies to actually impact upon the economy usually what happens in a presidents third term is when his economic policies actually begin impacting on an economy so usually if you really want to analyze how policies are impacting on an economy you do not chart the first 2 years of an administration yes if you took a chart of jimmy carters first two years you would think perhaps the growth rate and the job rate and some of the other factors were pretty good because his policies had not had a chance to come online yet and to affect the economy anybody who stands in front of this body and tries to tell the american people that you are going to judge jimmy carter by the first 2 years of his administration and leaves out the figures for the last year iswell i do not think the american people will buy that let me just put it that way the fact is that you look at an administration you look at their policies and you take about 2 years for those policies to really have maximum impact you sort of judge the administration from the third year if you judge jimmy carter by that and you analyze the carter administration at a time when this body was controlled by the democratic party the senate was controlled by the democratic party the executive branch was controlled by the democratic party it became an unmitigated disaster for the united states of america if we had charts to show what was happening when they had control of this body and the senate and the executive branch the charts would go like this unemployment would start going like this inflation would start going like this interest rates would start going like this the poverty rate would start going like this in fact when ronald reagans policies began to have effect which we start in about 1983 it would start going in exactly the opposite direction the american people know that you cannot fool the american people with a bunch of squiggles on a piece of paper the american people i hope by now understand that poor president bush has been put into a corner time and time again by liberal big spending democrats who have forced him to accept more spending than he would have liked in fact what we are experiencing now the lament that comes from the other side of the hall is lamenting policies that they forced upon the administration they actually put the president in a box and said you have to reverse your position on taxes well i stood at this very spot a year before these maladies had come on and said if we increase taxes at a time when you have a faltering economy we are going to have massive increases in unemployment you will have undercut economic growth and you will have a high deficit and higher unemployment and higher taxes the worst of all worlds do people really believe that president bush wanted to break his word wanted to go back and gleefully went back on his word in terms of no new taxes he was forced into that position by liberal democrats who were absolutely joyful when they managed to get him to a position where he felt he had to give in to the democratic pressures to raise taxes well that joy on the other side of the aisle has led to misery for the american people all of the things that we have heard tonight about the lamenting may be honest concern the people on the other side of the aisle may have honest concern for the wellbeing of certain individuals and we hear case after case after case after case where this individual is going through a hardship do not point your fingers at me do not point your fingers at the administration when you are saying why this individual is going through hardship those individuals who supposedly the other side of the aisle is so caring and concerned about are being put through the wringer by the fact that we were forced to raise taxes at a time when our economy was weak it was predictable i know i predicted it i know everybody who is standing here today predicted it so do not come back and say it is the administrations fault all revenue bills start in this body anybody who complains about the tax structure of this country favoring the rich better look and see who controls this body revenue bills begin in the house of representatives in fact when we hear people complaining about ronald reagans terrible pollft8429 ces let us also remember that if the democrats wanted to stop it they controlled this body every single year of the reagan administration let me add when i was in the reagan administration yet i remember that on some of those tax bills there were some things that we thought were unfair i remember that the liberal democrats themselves had put on major special interest proposals within our own tax legislation and we were concerned about that in fact i remember listening to democrats attack the administration for being so much in favor of the special interests and such we looked back during the reagan years we found out that in all of the machinations that were going on when the tax bill was going through that it was actually the liberal democrats that put on the most odious special interest legislation or provisions of the tax bill we had a very simple idea and that was acrosstheboard tax rate reductions so that every american would benefit equally do not tell us the people who do not control this body that the loopholes in the tax system are coming from the republican party those loopholes are not being put in by the republican party we have no control of that anything that goes through this body is controlled by the people on that side of the aisle it is as simple as that unless they would go along with it those provisions would not be in the tax code thank god early in the reagan administration and we were able to attract enough support from that side support from that side of the aisle to at least have this overall reduction by 25 percent in the tax rate which brought about a greater prosperity and greater job creation and a longer period of extension than this country had ever known in its history if ronald reagan instead would have not been elected and those policies that were being followed under the carter administration which we were suffering under by them it was not the first 2 years of the carter administration it was the last 2 years when his policies had impact if those policies had remained in place the deficit which we also hear lamented from the other side of the aisle the deficit they say look under ronald reagan the deficits are going like this what would have happened to that deficit had we had the same increase in unemployment the same increase in inflation the same increase in interest rates that were going on because of the carter years that deficit would not have been going like this as it did under the reagan administration it would have been going like this it would have been totally out of control early on what has happened now what we are experiencing right now is the fact that in 1986 the liberal democrats retook the unitedstates senate and step by step by step have been reinstituting regulation and overtaxation namely the same policies that got us into the mess in the late 1970s and as liberal democratic policies are being put in place by a congress that is controlled in both bodies by liberal democrats we are facing hardship we are facing decline we are facing the potential of higher inflation as we have heard over and over and over again this evening we are facing a situation where individual americans are going through great hardship their families are being wrenched yes alcoholism drug use all of the things child abuse all of the terrible social problems that flow from hard times and unemployment are coming out in our society but those things are coming out not independent of the policies that were put in place but because of the policies that have been put in place not by the president of the united states but by the liberal democrats that control both houses of congress by the liberal democrats who forced the president of the united states and gleefully forced the president of the united states into a massive tax increase at a time when our economy was on the edge and it pushed our economy right over the edge no one can tell me that they are sympathetic for individual americans while they go about systematically destroying the economy of the united states of america because it is that economy that permits our people to live in prosperity and decency and those hardship cases that we hear about bear a direct relationship to the high taxes and big spending that took place in the 1970s and brought us misery and have been taking place now when we hear people lamenting about the unemployed what is fascinating it is as if by magic by lamenting and showing we are so concerned that all of a sudden our policies will have a good impact on the unemployed that is not the case at all simply because one is concerned does not mean one is right headed does not mean ones ideas are correct in fact since i have been here not only the tax policies have been wrong what i have seen from the other side of the aisle is the most efficient and effective jobdestroying machine in the history of mankind it has been seated on the other side of the aisle with a smiling face and good intentions good intentions do not feed anybody good intentions do not bring down the deficit good intentions do not help people out of their misery when we have legislation and our major legislation projects are aimed at supposedly helping people but in the end destroy job creating business we are not doing anybody a favor if we have got a civil rights bill that is a quota bill and does nothing but provide work for lawyers but destroys the capability of businessmen to do their jobs because of excessive litigation what we have done is help lawyers and hurt the average american we keep hearing about competitiveness and we keep hearing about job creation but we see things like mandated leave mandated leave it might be very wellintended what is the project of mandated leave what we are going to have is fewer jobs created and mandated leave may be wellintended but in the end it may be the straw that breaks the camels back and puts certain businesses out of business perhaps it is the quota system or the quota civil rights bill that will put them out of work if that does not perhaps striker replacement will do the job there is a bill that guarantees that america is going to have more strikes and that labor relations within our companies are going to be more costly is this what we should be doing during the weak economy basically provide more incentives for strikes and conflict between labor and management that is something for people who really are concerned and care about the unemployed and the downtrodden that it creates ill will between management and labor by changing the rules of the game to encourage strikes then we have got something else after all being compassionate why do we just not let business bear the total expense of a national health care system does that not sound great we are giving the people health care and we do not even have to raise taxes we will just put it on the small businessman boy it really sounds like we care about people that way the only trouble is you end up with people who now have jobs ending up without jobs so they not only do not have health care they do not have jobs anymore now all of these are very well intended and perhaps all of the rest of the spending programs that go through this hall this hall that is controlled by liberal democrats perhaps all of it is very well intended i mean i know that some people have hearts that bleed from everything from the snail darter to little birds the spotted owl and birds nests i know they care about people because they say it over and over again that does not mean their policies are going to result in a healthy economy that does not mean that their policies are going to end up with jobs and a decent living for individuals after forcing businesses both small and large to pay for all of their illconceived and anticompetitive measures i have no doubt that if the democrats succeed in these things that i have talked about which is their agenda which they have to some degree that businesses yes businesses will be forced to lay off people and more people will be added to the unemployment rolls and there is another thing another thing that i am certain of that if that happens and as we see our economy is sputtering the democrats will blame the president yes blame the president you can have as many anticompetitive measures you can raise taxes and kick the economy right off the edge of the cliff but then you blame the president as if the presidentof course you blame the president for any inequities that are in the tax system holy cow who makes the laws around here anyway i know and i think the american people are beginning to become aware of this it is happening over and over and over again when you take a look at the minimum wage increase that we had and you know i will have to say on the minimum wage again obviously who does not want people to earn more money who does not want to have people at the lowest income levels earning more money what we have done with the minimum wage and every economist of any prestige has indicated over and over again that what the increase in the minimum wage was going to do was it was going to hurt the very poorest americans it was going to hurt the very people who were struggling the most they would be hurt by an increase in the minimum wage and by the waymore unemployment was predicted when we increased the minimum wage from 3 80 to 4 25 but that did not make any difference just the fact that it was going to increase unemployment did not deter any of those goodhearted people on the other side of the aisle who voted for that when we increased the gas taxes when we had a 60day plant closing notification what happened or when we had an increase in the socalled luxury tax i do not have to go over that and over that again we keep going over it i think the american people are getting the idea we raised the taxes in order to pay for the programs programs aimed at helping people who are out of work and poor americans sure we raised the luxury tax and what did it do it put more people out of work so we have more people that we need to help and the fact is that the luxury tax did not raise any money at all it resulted in a net decrease in money coming into the government and it resulted in major increases in unemployment because businesses that were once healthy are no longer healthy and they are laying off people and i would imagine tonight some of the hardluck stories that we have heard and i do not say hardluck stories with a hardened heart they are hardluck stories because these people are suffering but the fact is those hardluck stories perhaps can be traced right back to the increase in the luxury tax which put out of work some people who have been perhaps working in the boat industry the luxury tax has totally destroyed the boat industry now our economy is sputtering and staggering around like a drunken sailor and democrats who control this body and control both bodies of congress have been running around like pranksters trying to trip a disoriented economy by increasing spending and by raising taxes and i will tell you at a time when this body began let us not forget that the people who are telling us they are concerned about these individual cases that we have heard about these are the same people that were so concerned that they managed to give themselves the largest pay increase in the history of this country you cannot have it both ways you cannot put 50 000 more a year in your own pocket and then sit there and lament and lament how hard it is for the unemployed you just cannot do it i am not saying that a lot of republicans did not vote for that pay raise a lot of republicans did vote for that pay raise sure they did but i will tell you one thing i do not know of any body in the majority i do not know of anybody who did not vote for it and i will tell you this much that it would never have happened had the democratic leadership not been pushing for that pay raise if they would not have pushed for it if the word would have gone out that i am sorry we have a situation where some americans are going through some rough times and it is not a good itme it is not a good time to increase our own pay by 50 000 i can tell you there would have been no pay raise whatsoever do not let anybody kid you that anything can get through this hall if the democrat leadership decides they do not want it to go through this hall so do not tell me that just because a few republicans voted for that pay raise that in any way this party deserves the responsibility a lot of us in this party fought against it and spoke against it and i remember delivering petitions up on the steps and there were a few people from the other party as well stalwarts and what the unemployed want they do not want to hear people saying we care they do not want to hear people say oh we are crying every night for you and we know how hard it is they do not want that they want a job they want an economy that will help them improve their condition yes it is nice to hear somebody say words that let you know that they have got a good heart and i know there are some people around washington who spend all of their time trying to provide that they have got a good heart and a lot of people think that they do not have a very good head on their shoulders because they run around with policies that are actually going in exactly the opposite direction in terms of the wellbeing for average working people what africanamericans want is they do not want a quota they want a fair chance and you can have all of the quota civil rights bills that you want but if our economy is going downhill black americans and all other americans are going to suffer and they are not going to have any jobs and there are not goint to be any businesses or lawyers to file lawsuits against because those people are not gong to have the jobs in the first place because they will not exist i think what working men and women in this country want are jobs and what the people who create jobs want is to get the government off their back so that they can move forward and produce the products and the services that they sell to the public we are in an internationally competitive situation yet we see our businesses loaded down burdened with more and more regulations more and more wellintentioned legislation and we are providing a wellintentioned path to economic hell for our own businessmen and thus our own working population the fact is we live in an internationally competitive market and every time we do something to burden our own businessmen unnecessarily what we are doing even if it is wellintentioned what we are doing is putting people out of business and what we are doing is putting people to work on the pacific rim in other countries democrats have shown us since they took over the senate in 1986 that they were willing to force the president of the united states into higher taxes and into reaccepting the carter policies that led to disaster in the united states of america i happen to believe that the government which governs best governs least and i happen to believe that thomas jefferson and some of these things have truths that ring true to us and not only create freedom but create prosperity ronald reagan a man who i worked for when his policies were finally put in place as time went on the type of headlines we had were dramatic decreases in unemployment if we could have a chart showing and i do not know if we have it on the board there but if we could have a chart showing how many people were unemployed during the reagan years we would find it was like this at the beginning when the carter policies were in place when the policies that were put in place when the democrats controlled both houses of congress the unemployment rate you would see being like this and the number of unemployed americans like this that is what the chart would look like and that is the kind of policies we should have now but the republicans do not control both houses of congress instead what we have is an increasing an increasing federal budget and a decreasing family budget and we are talking about what is going on with the typical american family it does not happen independently of the fact that our government is sucking up all the investment capital for new jobs and sucking up more and more of the familys income in taxes the projected outlays for 1991 are a staggering 1 35 trillion now that is an increase from 1988 of 286 8 billion in just 3 years todays budget gobbles up 25 percent of the nations gnp and the liberal democrats who control both the house and the senate continued their program of trying to buy off voters or trying to save people with very goodhearted but wrongheaded policies what is going to happen if we keep up this spending spree that we are on and regulating spree by 2020 the federal budget will take 41 percent of the gross national product you cannot have a privatesector economy thriving you cannot have private people you cannot have private citizens prosper if the government is sucking up all the resources of the society while in the eastern bloc we see these people jumping over walls trying to get here struggling to create freeenterprise socleities the liberal bigspending democrats who control both houses of congress are hellbent to take us to the very system that they are trying to escape which is more and more government even though it is very wellintended government it is more and more government control i happen to believe that free of government mandates directions its instructions commands and obligations the american people will see to it that our economy will grow and prosper if they have the resources in their hands to invest they will invest in new businesses and businesses that provide goods and services that the people want our job is to reduce that government burden that weighs down the producers the producers who produce both jobs and wealth for our society let us give americans the freedom to get back to work let us not give them a handout let us not stand here and keep debating what we are going to give to the people because we cannot give anything to the american people that we do not take away from them with our other hand let us talk about freeing them from the burden of government freeing them from nonsensical policies that put them out of work let us talk about freeing them from these social ills that come with unemployment by creating an economy that will give them jobs the american people believe in free enterprise the american people know that free enterprise has worked for them in the past the republicans in congress are offering alternatives that are progrowth projob profree enterprise and proprogress we care more about people and jobs than we do snail darters than we do about creating charts that look nice but do not tell the truth to the people about their own condition and those charts that we saw earlier are not going to fool anybody when we talk about tax increases during a recession which is what was foisted upon the american people and forced upon the president last year they know that that is what is causing this problem that we are going through today we have lots of proposals on this side that will help that cannot even get to the floor we have heard a lot about capital gains tonight ok people realize it the liberal democrats are not going to permit a reduction in the capital gains tax because that will deny liberal bigspending democrats the right or the ability to pit one group of americans who are less fortunate against another class of anericans who are more fortunate it is called classwarfare politics or wardstyle politics but we can if they will not do that at least they could repeal the earnings limitation on elderly americans there is a proposal for you that would help a lot of these people who are going through hard times now and suffering because they are older americans they can barely get by but yet we and i say we the people who control this body refuse to permit us to repeal a tax which actually taxes older americans at a level at a higher level than what donald trump is taxed the highest tax rate in this country is not on the rich the highest tax rates in this country are on elderly americans who want to work elderly americans who need to work and if this body and the people who control this body wanted to relieve that burden on elderly americans they could do it tomorrow but they will not do that in the same way they will not relieve the burden of those people who are unemployed by permitting our unemployment benefits bill to come to the floor you know for example we are talking about creating a free trade association between mexico and canada these are initiatives of the president i do not know how much support that is going to have on the other side of the aisle i am going to wait and see exactly how much support it has from the democratic leadership we could pass the balanced budget and it would have some disagreement on my side of the aisle too i might add but we could pass the balancedbudget amendment and there is nothing that would give more confidence to people who are trying to create businesses in this country or people who want to invest or people who have the longterm interests of our country and our people at heart than if we passed the balancedbudget amendment or gave the president of the united states lineitem authority over the budget there would be no confidencebuilding measure that would work faster than that in terms of turning around the dismal attitude we find among investors and businessmen today if we want to help the less fortunate among us why can we not pass urban enterprise zones you know ronald reagan talked about it and pushed for it for years i wrote speeches for ronald reagan about urban enterprise zones 10 years ago and do you know why we did not have urban enterprise zones because the liberal democrats who controlled this body all of those years refused to let that legislation even onto the floor if you are concerned about the least fortunate among us let us help working elderly americans who are barely making it let us set up urban enterprise zones and give the least fortunate among us a chance that is the way you help people you do not put them on the dole you do not make them more dependent on government programs you free them from the government burden and you perhaps give added incentives so the freeenterprise system will focus on their special needs passing these republican initiatives will help spur and create new jobs it will spur growth and create jobs it will bring about progress but more importantly what it will do is it will help the individual americans who are going through such great hardship now people who are having trouble with their families people who have nowhere to turn they do not know what is happening they know that during the 1980s they were working because the unemployment rate went down dramatically during that time but now try as hard as they can they cannot find a job and that is right i am concerned about that but the way we turn that around is to create more jobs and to make sure that any american who wants to work has a job and can find a job that is not going to happen with the policies we see coming from the other side of the aisle"], [0.004935008939355612, 0.004935008939355612, 0, "well i do not know about wisdom but first of all i want to thank the gentleman from texas for having developed this idea and having organized this because without the gentlemans leadership we would not be here tonight i want to thank both my friends from texas i think the gentleman is putting his finger on what is in some ways the most frustrating thing about serving in congress the gentleman was a businessman and he knows the hard way that if you did not actually close a sale and get in the check and clear it at the bank and pay your employees you would go out of business in business you have sort of a real driving force to face reality we are in a building dominated by lawyers who understand that reality is when you convince the jury to believe and if they can get away with the next final appeal then they get on to file the next case the difference in the whole structure is just very radical and it takes a while to get used to then of course our good friend the gentleman from texas mr armeyi the ranking republican on the joint economic committee is faced with the whole challenge of the fact that the entire bureaucratic structure of the congress is geared to an intellectual idea that is at least 30 years out of date and which literally rejects reality so if you walk in and you say here is what is really happening you know we are in a recession they say well we are not sure because our computer does not show that you say you are going to lose money and put people out of work they say well that is not in our computer it is like going to a doctor who says i dont care how much pain you are in you are not allowed to have a heart attack because my particular piece of equipment does not show it and you are laying on the table and you say wait a second i am in real trouble you would change doctors instead we find ourselves recently and i do not mean this in any sense as a personal comment about an individual but more as a comment about reality the joint tax committee has now brought in a new leader who is a jimmy carter treasury executive well if you look at the history as we have been talking about it tonight of 4 years under carter and you say you know what would that kind of person tend to do intellectually they happen to believe i think with great sincerity they happen to believe in ideas which are simply wrong they do not work it is ironic to me and i started to say this at other times so i do appreciate the gentleman yielding to me all across easten europe we are saying to poland to hungary to russia to lithuania to latvia to estonia go to private property get rid of your bureaucracies shrink your government decentralize have a market system use incentives encourage people to work encourage people to save and then what are we doing in washington creating more bueaucracy creating more redtape raising taxes everything the opposite of what we are telling people in eastern europe i find it fascinating that our good friends in the deomcractic party belong to the llgachov wing of the world that at a time when we belong to the yeltsin wing and we are part of that broad movement toward human freedom many of our dear friends on the left are wedded to an idea of higher taxes more bureaucracy centralized government less private property less incentives and in fact it is a true story a friend of mine was at a dinner party with a russian who was in fact traveling at the time with shevardnadze the russian asked one of the hosts what is the real difference between your two parties and the host said well the democrats believe in taxing people who are productive and prosperous and successful at a higher rate and the republians believe in encouraging people to create jobs encouraging people to create more prosperity the man looked at him and he said ah you mean your democrats are like our communists they believe in taking away from those who have giving to those who do not they believe in stifling free enterprise stifling initiative i do not mean this in any sense in the oldfashioned red baiting but in the genuinely intellectually honest argument that if you watch mayor dinkins wrestle with new york citys problems and you watch the reform leader of lenigrad now to become st petersburg and the reform leader of moscow the reform leaders of moscow and leningard would be on the floor with the three of us talking about how you shrink government and you open up the private sector and encourage small business and our friend david dinkins nice man wedded to the process of 50 years ago would be saying oh you couldnt do that to my city bring free enterprise to new york privatize the social services cut down the bureaucracy offend the municipal unions we couldnt do that what we have to do is raise taxes and so i just hope people as they watch this with us will understand we are in a very real debate in this city between people who understand reality and people who are wedded to a theory which is dead and i think these two gentlemen are playing a very very important role in making that debate possible on behalf of the american people and on behalf of the countrys future i just wanted to come back for a minute and say thank you to these two gentlemen"], [0.006793618202209473, 0.9932063817977905, 1, "i am pleased to join

the trends suggest disturbing realities for many of americas children and families the number of children in poverty continues to grow with children having become the poorest age group of all

employed africanamerican workers still experience 2 4 times the unemployment of their white counterparts it is even more outrageous for our younger african americans who are greatly suffering the

medical conditions lost their jobs because their employers did not provide medical leave during that same period employers without medical leave policies could have saved almost 500 million in hiring

backbitingmore often than not aimed at the previous administration of ronald reagan the contempt which many in the majority continue to feel for our former president has fueled a very political attack on the right of any future president to execute his national security duties as commander in chief they have pushed hard for a 48hour reporting requirement in order to force the presidentany presidentto tell congress within 48 hours about the special operations that this country may be conducting wisely this bill avoids that debateand thereby avoids the certain veto that it would elicit from virtually any white house i commend all the members of the committee for sparing us the acrimony that such a provision would have brought in fact wth that provision left out the bill really is as the ranking member described it in his testimony before the rules committee a bare bones authorization there are differences between the majority and the minority regarding the proposed reorganization of the defense departments science and technology the majority would rush to make changes rather than study the proposed reorganization a bit more thoroughly it strikes me as the antithesis of the flybeforeyoubuy mentality that so many of us in the house have endorsed for other defenserelated programs additionally many of us remain confused as to why it is better to construct a new portion of our embassy in moscow to sit atop the floors we know are laced through and through with bugging devices putting a cone of silence on top of a huge electronic bug strikes many of us as penny wise and extraordinarily pound foolish beyond those two issues there really is only one essential element missing in my judgment what is missing is a requirement for a secrecy oath to be administered to the members and staff of the intelligence committee such an oath would not serve in any way to draw into question the patriotism of any member nor of any staff member rather it would serve as a sobering reminder of the very solemn duty charged to this particular committee my understanding is that the ranking member mr shuster will be offering such an amendment later during consideration of the bill i will wholeheartedly support it and take this opportunity to encourage my colleagues of the house to do likewise the reason that an oath is necessary is to remind members and staff that quite literally lives are on the line and those lives depend in part upon committee members and staff keeping their lips sealed an oath would serve to underscore that vital fact indeed this issue is all the more important in light of operation desert storm based upon that experience the committee is renewing its call for greater reliance on human intelligence that is in my judgment a wise and good decision however it means that human livesnot mere machineswill hang in the balance will rely on secrets being kept will rely on people not leaking stories to the press as the committees report stated more eloquently than i there will always be secrets worth knowing if what is truly important requires significant personal and political risk then our country must be willing to pay the pricea price which may include compromised operations and the arrest of unitedstates citizens or their agents i agree 100 percent allow me to simply paraphrase there will always be secrets worth protecting if what is truly important requires significant personal and political risk then our countrys elected representatives must be willing to pay the pricea price which includes doing everything possible to avoid compromising operations or the arrest of unitedstates citizens or our agents it is so little to ask of members and starf of this committee that they reaffirm their commitment to protecting the secretsand therefore the livesof those who risk their lives on a daily basis so that we might enjoy the sweet fruits of freedom all they need say is this i do solemnly swear that i will not directly or indirectly disclose to any unauthorized person any classified information received in the course of my duties on the permanent select committee on intelligence except with the formal approval of the committee or the house i submit that such an oath is not too much to ask so i look forward to supporting the shuster amendment and respectfully request that my colleagues do the same recognizing that it is the very least that can be done to show our support and solidarity with those brave men and women who collect sensitive information on behalf of the american people i hope and trust that we will have that opportunity under this open rule i urge all members to support the rule over this past weekend our nations capital witnessed a tremendous demonstration of the military strength that led to our recent victory in the persian gulf the investment that our former president ronald reagan made in our conventional weapons and in the morale and training of our troops was on display for all to clearly see and just as our victory over iraqi aggression was due in large part to president reagans commitment to military preparedness we also must give him credit for much of our recent progress in negotiating new arms reduction treaties with the soviet union not only did he modernize our strategic forces compelling the soviets to go back to the table and negotiate in earnest he also adhered to basic commonsense principles of arms control how many times have we all heard him say trust but verity i raise this point today because i am pleased not just that we have before us an open rule but also the report on the fiscal year 1992 intelligence authorization bill a document that is equally frank and open in its admonition to our arms control negotiators allow me to quote from the report the monitoring of new arms control agreements will present a considerable challenge to unitedstates intelligence the intelligence community cannot afford major new systems or expeditures because of unitedstates oversights or misjudgments during treaty negotiations today we stand on the threshold of a new era in arms control with agreements on reductions in strategic arms conventional forces in europe and chemical munitions stockpiles all close at hand if this new era is to serve our national security interests and the interests of peaceand if it is to set the stage for global arms control agreementsit is absolutely vital that our negotiators ensure that inspection and verification procedures under such agreements are stringent and thorough now more than ever there is little room for

there are entirely too many bucks involved i think most would agree that managing the national budgetor should i say bringing it under controlis the most important task that the american people sent us here to do i take my hat off to the budget committee and its leadership for the job they are trying to doprovide for all the needs and wants while still balancing the budget and erasing the deficit we all know this cannot be done unless congress makes some fundamental changes people in my district were not favorably impressed with our budget effort last year they were even less impressed with the results they know there is still tremendous waste in governmentwaste which the gao estimates at 180 billion per annum i am asked is this congress also going to dance to lawrence welk i fear that many think it does and not many are ready to buy into the proposition that this years congress will really meet its challenges head onthat this year congress will cut out the deficit strip out the pork stamp out the redundancies there are not many believersand rightly sobecause nothing we are going to vote on today comes close to those goals but at least the presidents budget attempts to shift focus and prioritize spending within some limits it begins to make some of the hard choices i urge support for the presidents budget because it is the safest port for the american economy in the fiscal storm that is blowing but it is not enough we cannot pass any of the budget choices available this year and go away satisfied that our work is well done the taxpayersthe people we work forare

beginning november 24 1991 and november 22 1992 as national family week this resolution encourages the states and local communities to observe the week and celebrate the family with appropriate ceremonies and activities the purpose of national family week is to promote recognition of and appreciation for the american family as the foundation of our free society and to lay before the american family the challenge to continue to perpetuate and preserve freedom honor and trust among all people honoring the family in the united states is a practice everyone can be proud of i am pleased to state it was 20 years ago in 1971 when i first introduced this legislation and i have reintroduced it each congress a family is more than a group of individualsa family is a community of persons

h r 429 this agreement was approved by the full house interior committee while there are portions of the agreement with which i do not completely agree i believe that this agreement represents an unprecedented step in the debate on reclamation reform it is for this reason that i must oppose any amendments offered today to the provisions included in the agreement i am in agreement with the chairman that we must ensure that the bureau of reclamation enforces reclamation law so that those operations that clearly violate the intent of the law are charged the proper price for water however i believe that in an effort to get to this handful of abusers or reclamation law that many legitimate family farmers will be affected the bureau of reclamations recent audit report found only 120 farm operations in excess of 960 acres this is clearly a small minority of farmers receiving reclamation water the centerpiece of the agreement is the establishment of the criteria by which the secretary can and cannot make a presumption that a single farm or farm operation exists and thus whether or not farmers must pay full cost for water i must admit that the bill as reported by committee is quite complicated and will certainly create additional paperwork and uncertainty for farmers in my district however in an effort to draft a bill that provided clear exemptions for legitimate farming practices it became clear that the approach taken was necessary one of the shortfalls of the committee language is the separate treatment of family and nonfamily farming arrangements i believe that family farmers deserve at least equal treatment with nonfamily farmers it is my hope that during the consideration of this bill in the senate and in conference that some additional protections can be provided for family farms one of the provisions that i believe will provide an extra burden to legitimate family farm operations is the one eliminating trusts the agreement that was approved by the interior committee makes it illegal for families to place their property in trust and still receive reclamation water many families use trusts as a management tool in order to more effectively operate their farms while the bill provides for a phase in of this provision it will be a burden to many family farmers in my district i think that it is important that we do not lose site of the tremendous benefits of the reclamation projects the projects have been very successful in fulfilling their goals since 1982 there has been a federal investment of over 12 billion in reclamation projects only 5 4 of which has been for irrigation projects areas served by these projects generate almost 8 billion annually in increased economic activity supporting tens of thousands of farmers their employees those who provide materials and services for agriculture and the rural economies created by a healthy farm industry even this unprecedented agreement we are considering today will have the impact of forcing many farmers to pay 4 to 5 times that which they are paying now for water which is the highest cost farming expense for most this will mean the difference between a profit and a loss and will probably put farmers out of business this will have a profound impact upon not just farming economies but upon the rural economies of the 17 western states as well as i support the agreement today i firmly believe that much work remains to be done to ensure that legitimate farming practices are protected i will continue to work with my colleagues toward this goal"], [0.0005388557910919189,

house for the selection of werner brandt as our acting sergeant at arms i worked in the same office with werner for almost 2 years in the department of state where we shared similar assignments as fellow foreign service officers i consider mr brandt to be a man of extraordinary ability extraordinary competence as well as very high values the house is and has been fortunate to be so well served whether or not the minority was consulted in the choice of mr brandt i would say without equivocation that if this member of the minority had been asked i would have noted that a better selection by the speaker could not have been made by background brandt was one of the state departments leading political military affairs specialists he was on a star track in the foreign service before coming to capitol hill in the early 1970s as a congressional fellow today he is a true legislative professional i am confident lie will be fair to the minority and more importantly serve the public honorably in his new position the choice by the speaker of werner brandt to serve as sergeant at arms is a good first step in establishing credibility in the administration of the house"]]}
