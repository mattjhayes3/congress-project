somalia it is important to remember that thousands of servicemen from other countries are still there this past saturday the final 55 u s marines and three sailors left somalia bringing to a close our involvement in a mission that started 2 years ago but almost 19 000 troops from other countries acting as u n peacekeepers remain in somalis from the unitedstates military intervention in somalia in december 1992 through the subsequent united nations operaxion called unosom a total of 36 unitedstates servicemen were killed in somalia now at the end of our involvement in this mission when we remember and honor the service of our soldiers especially those who made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty we should also remember and take heed of the fact that over 60 peacekeepers from other countries have lost their lives in somalia as well of the u n peacekeeping force still in somalia 5 000 are from the army of india on august 22 seven indian soldiers were killed in defending a logistics convoy of the unitedstates company brown root when it was ambushed by a band of armed somalis as we honor the dedication and sacrifice of our own soldiers i believe we must do the same for those such as these indian soldiers who have served and sacrificed along side our own forces this is especially important to keep in mind for on this dayjust 2 days after the lost of our troops have left somalia5 000 unitedstates troops are being deployed in haiti in yet another mission again as in somalia the initial massive unitedstates military intervention will be followed by a much longer presence of international forces under the united nations in terms of the deployment of unitedstates military forces abroad i am deeply disturbed that successive presidents have gone to the united nations for authority to use military force internationally rather than to the unitedstates congress as the president is required to do under the constitution president bush did this in iran and somalia then president clinton rubberstamped the actions in somalia and now has pursued the same course in haiti and looked favorably upon both the invasions by president reagan of grenada and then the what i consider to be n infamous invasion on our part of panama with the results that the avowed purposes we had for invading panama has resulted in us having to keep right now twothirds of the number of our troops that we had at the height of the invasion of panama if we do not it will not be an american life safe in panama we went in ostensibly to capture what we said was the chief drug peddler and try to put a stop w the extensive dope and drug peddling as a natte of fact since our invasion the amount of narcotics illegal through panama and by panama and from panama is three limes more than it was at the time of our invasion so these are things that ought to sober us at this point this shakes our constitutional system of government to its coore but this also has a concrete impact on the lives of soldiers from around the world this new world order seems to be one in which the united states leads the charge to intervene militarily and then international forces are left to carry out the longer peacekeeping functions as we pay our respects to the service and sacrifices of those in our armed forces i believe we must recognize this same dedication of the soldiers from other countries who play a vital part in these operations and policies as well i would like to submit here for the record the letter i recently received from the ambassador of india the honorable

district and are proud to say we have given a great deal of money to foreign countries when we indeed are borrowing money for our needs in this country but under the circumstances i think it is as fair a bill as we can possibly expect there are some things in this bill that i really do not like and thus i am going to vote against it but i must admit we are moving in the right direction we have reduced historically for the last 3 years the amount of aid we are sending to foreign countries we have put some constraints on some of the recipients of this money this is moving in the right direction so while it is still not a popular bill and it is still not a bill i can vote for i must admit it is an improvement for example one of the things i supported was the mcconnell amendment to the senate bill senator mcconnell had some language that the other body adopted that we ought to tell president yeltsin to get out of estonia and to get out by august 31 or lose the aid provided in this bill we in the conference decided to remove that language but in the interim mr yeltsin finally changed his mind and said we are getting out of estonia and we are getting out by august 31 so only time will tell whether or not the message of the mcconnell amendment had any impact on mr yeltsin at all but i think it did on the aid to the nis the former soviet union states we were successful in putting language in the bill that would restrict to the country of russia only 50 percent of the 850 million that we are sending to russia and the other states so wemade some good steps incidentally i do not think it comes as any surprise to the members of this body that i have been against aid to russia we did and were able and were successful in bringing that aid down by 50 million to 850 million which i think s the right direction one other thing that concerns me in this bill and in our foreign policy is the indication that the administration wants to forgive jordans 700 million debt to the united states while i welcome the peace between israel and jordan i think it is a magnificent step and i agreed with everything king hussein said when he came and addressed this body let me tell this body we are making a serious mistake in the forgiveness of this debt we are sending the wrong message even though this bill does not forgive all of the 700 million it does forgive some 200 million of the debt to jordan so i am still going to vote against the bill but i am not here advocating that people vote against it i just wanted to bring out some of the things that i am still concerned about
