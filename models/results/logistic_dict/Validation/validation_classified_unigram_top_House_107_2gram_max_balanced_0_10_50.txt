necessary funding for critical domestic need the republican leadership is taking social security and medicare funds paid from the wages of working people and returning it through tax cuts to the corporations and individuals who are least in need the public deserves an honest longterm budget but congress is not able to provide one when there is such a broad disconnect between what the republican leadership promises and what they deliver the opportunity for an honest debate with alternatives and amendments has been stifled by the closed rule the republicans have put into place for

finally the rule provides for one motion to recommit with or without instructions today the average american pays more in taxes than for food clothing shelter or transportation combined for too long the tax burden imposed by the government has been going up not down the tax limitation amendment starts from this very simple premise it should be harder not easier for the government to raise taxes raising taxes should be an absolute last resort not an easy quick fix for excessive government spending i have observed with great interest the spirited debate surrounding our efforts to make portions of our presidents tax cuts permanent last week the house passed a bill that would permanently repeal the death tax in the same manner the house will later this week consider a bill that makes permanent relief from the marriage penalty tax throughout these debates it is apparent that there are those who would support repealing parts if not all of this historic tax bill these individuals would prefer that married couples be penalized for entering into holy matrimony they feel that the grim reaper and the tax collector should visit american families and farmers on the same day they believe that the federal government makes better decisions than families about how best to spend their hardearned money this line of reasoning is inconsistent with the fact that people all across this nation overwhelmingly support tax reduction i only wish that both bodies of congress would reflect the sentiment clearly expressed by the american people the people of this great nation will not be fooled by those who would support a tax cut during an election season only to work to repeal it the very next session of congress many members have stood on this floor of this distinguished house extolling the virtues of lower taxation today they will have the opportunity to show their constituents exactly where they stand the annual floor consideration of the tax limitation amendment gives us an opportunity to take a stand on the side of the american taxpayer by enacting the tax limitation amendment we protect the taxpayer and pledge that we as a congress will focus inward on cutting waste fraud and abuse instead of immediately raiding the pockets of american taxpayers by requiring a supermajority to raise taxes an incentive for government agencies would be created to eliminate waste and create efficiency rather than simply turning to more deficit spending or increasing taxes this legislation does recognize and make allowances for times of extenuating circumstances such as during a time of war a national emergency or when taxes may need to be raised the tax limitation amendmentwould allow congress to raise taxes in those circumstances but in the meantime it would prevent the intrusive and penalizing tax increases that have been enacted with recklessness to fund government expansion for the last few decades it is time the federal government joined the states and listened to the voices of americans it should be harder to raise taxes had this amendment been adopted sooner the four largest tax increases since 1980 which occurred in 1982 1983 1990 and 1993 all would have failed the tax increase in 1993 was the largest tax increase in american history and it passed by just one vote these tax increases today from 1993 total 666 billion taken from the american taxpayer the bottom line of this debate and let us make no mistake about it those members who support this amendment are here to support the hardworking taxpayers of america those members who are opposed to it are here to defend the tax collectors of america to me it is really just that simple the tax limitation amendment also allows for a simple majority vote to eliminate tax loopholes the de minimis exemption would allow nearly all loopholes to be closed without the supermajority requirement we will also hear that the government will be unable to function if a supermajority is required we all hear this as members but i encourage members to look at the states thirteen states have some sort of supermajority limitation in effect the ffiillions of americans living in these states have enjoyed slower growth in taxes slower growth in government spending faster growth in economies and lower unemployment rates today we can take one step closer to retaining liberty and ensuring future

legislation addresses a specific problem for consumers and businesses involved in the mortgage servicing industry by simply clarifying the existing law governing mortgage servicing this uncontroversial bill enjoys the support of 12 cosponsors eight democrats and four republicans and has been approved for consideration under the suspension of the rules by both the chairman and the ranking member of the committee on financial services i introduced this bill to fix a problem in the mortgage servicing industry which has hampered the ability of this industry to serve its clients effectively and to conduct its business efficiently for too long currently when a mortgage servicing company acquires the rights to service a portfolio of home loans it is exempt from the unnecessary strictures of the fair debt collection practices act under the creditor exemption that was also extended to the originator of the mortgage the new mortgage servicer is extended this exemption because its relationship to the borrower is more like the relationship between a borrower and a lender than it is like the relationship between a borrower and a true collections agency the law already recognizes this reality however in the typical loan servicing portfolio transfer a small percentage of the loans acquired by a new servicer will inevitably be delinquent or technically in default at the time of transfer these loans are currently treated by the law as being subject to the fair debt collection practices act and subsequently the new servicers of these loans are required to provide certain form notices known as miranda warnings to the borrower the law also currently requires that in every subsequent contact both written and oral whether initiated by the servicer or the borrower the servicer is required to provide a shorter minimiranda notice disclosing that the communication is an attempt to collect a debt and that any information provided by the borrower will be used toward that end the purpose of these cookiecutter warnings is to prevent unscrupulous debt collectors from using false or misleading tactics such as a phony winning sweepstakes claim to trick consumers into divulging private financial information or personal details like their home address or their home phone number the fair debt collection practices act has worked extremely well in preventing bad actors in the debt collection business from using lies and deceit to harm consumers and this legislation would in no way prevent it from continuing to protect american consumers however as i have already mentioned mortgage servicers are not like debt collectors their role to consumers is much more like that of a mortgage originator and in the context of a mortgage servicing transfer these miranda notices are both detrimental to consumers and unnecessary and inefficient for mortgage servicers operations first the notice misleads the borrower about the nature of the relationship between him or her and the new servicer unlike true debt collectors mortgage servicers have a longterm relationship with their client and these harshly worded notices often have the effect of discouraging a borrower who is slightly late on a mortgage payment from contacting their new servicer for fear that the servicer is a true thirdparty debt collector this ends up frustrating the servicers efforts to work with delinquent borrowers on developing strategies to bring their loans current and keep their credit ratings intact a mortgage servicers biggest hurdle in helping delinquent borrowers to help themselves is getting them on the phone and these threatening miranda notices only contribute to that unnecessary fear without doing anything to help the borrower additionally the information protected by the miranda notice is information already in the servicers possession so nothing new is truly protected by requiring these additional legalistic and threatening notices be provided finally these warnings simply make consumers feel unnecessarily defensive and antagonistic toward their new servicer during the first step of their new association which can have a chilling effect on the rest of their relationship mortgage servicers typically send these miranda notices along with a new customers welcome letter as required by the real estate settlement procedures act and this letter also includes important consumer information about the new servicer and the borrowers monthly payment arrangements this preliminary contact is the first opportunity that a servicer has to create a positive relationship with a new client and the harsh language used in the miranda warning can create animosity between the servicer and the borrower where none need exist additionally because the minimiranda is required in all subsequent contacts they can continue for decades even after customers bring their loans current and keep them that way for years h r 163 resolves this problem by creating a narrow exemption from miranda notices for the servicers of federally related first lien mortgages whose primary function is servicing current loans not collecting thirdparty debts it exempts these servicers only from the miranda notices leaving all other borrower protections required by the fair debt collection practices act in place this legislation is consistent with a longstanding recommendation from

historical perspective the issue is not as previous speakers have tried to make it no mexican trucks in the unitedstates or sinister special interest forces trying to keep mexican trucks from entering the united states that is not the issue the issue is safe trucks safe unitedstates trucks safe trucks from canada and safe trucks from mexico in 1982 the then committee on public works and transportation brought to the house legislation to prohibit trucks from canada and mexico entering the united states unless the president of the united states would issue a finding lifting that legislatively imposed moratorium on truck entry into the united states that was 1982 in 1984 president reagan lifted the moratorium with respect to trucks from canada but did not lift it with respect to trucks from mexico in 1986 1988 the president again lifted the moratorium on canadian trucks but not on mexican trucks because of a finding by the federal motor carrier safety office that those trucks did not meet unitedstates safety standards president bush the first in 1990 and again in 1992 lifted the moratorium on canadian trucks but not on mexican trucks simply because canadian trucks met unitedstates safety standards and mexican trucks did not in fact as the gentleman from wisconsin cited a moment ago the outofservice rate for canidian trucks is lower than that of trucks in the united states seventeen percent of canadian trucks are found by their and our inspection service to be out of compliance with safety standards while 24 percent of unitedstates trucks are found to be out of compliance and 36 percent of mexican trucks mexican trucks therefore have a 50 percent higher out of service rating than do trucks in the united states and more than twice as much as canadians well my colleagues cannot make a rational argument that this is an antimexico provision that we are offering on the floor it is simply a safety issue not a crossborder issue and what we are asking for is not as one speaker indicated a lot of paperwork no no i know safety from the aviation standpoint from the rail standpoint and i have looked at it for many many years from the surface transportation standpoint trucking issues as well we do not just look for this or that truck that is out of compliance we are looking for a system of safety for a system a structure ofcompliance d 1815 that is why we want to have an overall review of the mexican safety system canada clearly complies mexico does not the dispute resolution mechanism the arbitration panel that reviewed this issue found it may not be unreasonable for a nafta party to conclude that to ensure compliance with its own local standards by service providers from another nafta country it may be necessary to implement different procedures with respect to such service providers thus to the extent that the inspection and licensing requirements for mexican trucks and drivers wishing to operate in the united states may not be like those in place in the united states different methods of ensuring compliance with unitedstates regulatory regime may be justified in order to justify its own legitimate safety concerns if the united states decides to impose requirements on mexican carriers that differ from those imposed on united states or canadian carriers then any such decision must be made in good faith with respect to a legitimate safety concern and implement different requirements that fully conform with all relevant nafta provisions the sabo amendment which would have been offered had it not been struck would have met those tests"], [0.00023767352104187012, 0.49976232647895813, 0, "i yield myself such time as i may consume founded in 1924 the american zoo association is a nonprofit organization dedicated
