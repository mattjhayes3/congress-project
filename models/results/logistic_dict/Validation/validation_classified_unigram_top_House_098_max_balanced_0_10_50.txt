put in perspective a little bit some of the things that took place on the house floor earlier and i would like to lead off in putting that in perspective by first of all thanking you for your indulgence during that period of time when words got a little heated and things got a little sticky at times we appreciate the work that the chair did during that period of time and we thank you for putting up with what was sometimes a tough situation but it seems to me that it is important to understand that we opened up this legislative session by trying to point out that there is a problem in this house of representatives the problem is that the majority party the liberals in this body who talk so much about fairness but who are perfectly willing to use rules and laws to trample the minority do not play by the rules when the rules are used in a way which they do not agree with they simply ignore the rules and go on that is not only unfair it is downright dictatorial that was a part of a number of things that were done on this house floor today first of all it was raised by the majority leader that we should dispense with calendar wednesday that request was objected to why was it objected to because calendar wednesday is a means by which we can get around the scheduling that takes place by the majority leadership in the last several weeks of the previous session what we found was that the majority leadership was perfectly willing to use the schedule of the house for its own purposes so one of the things that we have had to decide is that we will not permit that to go on without some sort of counterforce and that counterforce can be the calendar wednesday rule that would at least allow legislation to come to the floor through some other means than the schedule put forth by the majority leadership that may not produce everything that we want but it will assure that a broader base of legislation will come before this house and that the individual members of this house will have more say in what it is that is considered that is the kind of democracy that this house of representatives is supposed to be it is the kind of democracy that we ought to be pursuing not abandoning through unanimous consent requests every week later on a number of us asked unanimous consent to bring to the floor some pieces of legislation that have languished in house committees for literally years i personally asked that we bring to the floor the school prayer amendment why did i do that that is an amendment that has been around for almost 20 years the american people have for that whole period over 20 years supported that amendment by overwhelming numbers the polling data shows 80 percent of the people on an average support the idea of allowing a constitutional amendment that would allow voluntary prayer in the public schools yet in that 20year period we have not been able to get the vote on this house floor for something that the american people are overwhelmingly in favor of why because in the unfair committee structure that we discussed at some length earlier on they do not permit that kind of legislation to come to the floor what happened well the request that we made was a far fairer request than that which brought the equal rights amendment to the floor just the other day the request that i made was for an open rule that would allow for consideration of that amendment an open rule meaning that we would have been allowed to debated amendments and we would have been allowed full debate of the issue the other day when the majority leadership scheduled a constitutional amendment on the floor they did it under a gag rule that allowed no amendments and 30 minutes of debate so what we were proposing was a far fairer procedure than that which the majority party has used within the last few weeks to bring a constitulonal amendment to the floor what happened well the gentleman from texas turned down our ability to consider that issue he singly decided that this house should not consider prayer we have some other requests that we said the house ought to consider first a balanced budget amendment that also was turned down we say now that we ought to consider line item vetoes since the grace commission recently recommended that as a way to get a handle on 200 billionayear deficits that was turned down we said that on this day when there are thousands of americans in washington d c standing up for the rights of the unborn that amendment ought to come out here to at least be voted on that too was turned down all of those amendment were to be brought out here under a procedure much fairer than the procedure that was used for the equal rights amendment just a few weeks ago but they were turned down it is unfair it is dictatorial so what we then said was that we needed to have some time some time over the next several weeks to discuss some of these matters to have some time of our own since we do not get the time from the democrats since they will not allow those issues to come out here on this floor to be discussed then we ought to have some time of our own to discuss those issues and to let the american people know exactly what is going on in this body so i requested time time for each of the days that we are to be in session in this legislative year i requested 4 hours of time to have some debate controlled by the minority and what happened on that well once again the dictatorship of the majority came down hard once again they said flatly no they said even though you are within the rules even though the rules clearly allow you to take that time we are not going to permit it there is no way we are going to allow you to schedule that kind of debate and allow the minority to make its case to the american people this is the party of fairness now we are talking about the party that says they stand up for minority rights the party that says that they believe in open discussion and open debate that is what they say but their actions do not prove it and i would say to the members that rev jesse jackson who was making some comments about what is going on in the democratic convention has a point because they have been practicing exactly those kinds of tactics right here on the house floor for years jesse jackson has found the convention unfair and i am sure it is i am sure the rules there have been stacked for the good old boy i just like the rules around here are stacked for the good old boys to make sure that the candidate selected is not really a free choice but is mandated by the procedures it is appalling what happened when lie took his case to the executive committee the other day well they ran him out they said there is no way they are going to consider changing their rules so much for that minority participation in the democratic convention so much for minority participation here on the house floor i think the amf ican people need to understand and they need to become concerned about the fact that their house has become a virtual dictatorship in which you had better go along or you dont get along in which you had better sit back and accept your fate or they will use their rules to roll over you like a steamroller that is a sad commentary it is not unprecedented however this house has had dictatorships of the majority in the past there have been other times when the rules have become a cover for outright dictatorship and the house has seen fit to move toward reforming itself and changing that status quo it appears to me as though it is time for a change now and i for one and i think a number of my colleagues are committed to trying to bring about some of those changes over the next several weeks i think it is important that the american people once again have a body in congress where they truly have a say where there is fairness where equal voices are heard so that the nations business can be articulated in a way which reflects the peoples will that is not the case here this has become a body of the elite that elitism is trqmpling democracy and must be stopped"], [0.014010071754455566, 0.9859899282455444, 1, "i ask

very foundation of our being frankly it is absolutely incredible that we should even be placed in the situation of having to argue for a right that so many have fought and died fornamelyto pray to the almighty acceptance of a divine being is a principal basis of our development as a nation and it is offensive for any court of law to arbitrarily strike this core of our existence from the national purpose the constitution of the united states guarantees freedom of religion it does not prescribe freedom from religion the founding fathers in their infinite wisdom were justifiably concerned about stateestablished denominations this is why the debate at the constitutional convention leading up to the establishment clause of the first amendment was among the most important of the entire constitution the foresight and genius of the establishment clause has truly given us religidus freedom if any nation in the history of the world ever had freedom of religion then certainly it is the united states of america but those same founding fathers were not neutral about religion they were only opposed to establishment of a state religion they clearly recognized the presence of a divine being they invoked providence at every conceivable turn and in deliberation after deliberation leading up to the founding of the republic they were anxious to associate the almighty with the official results of their labors from this genesis as a nation we honored god and the work of our forefathers by emiloying prayer as a part of our culture and development we developed historically by making prayer a key part of our national life our coinage seals emblems sthools courts legislatures civie events all sanctioned the name of god and ree ogritzed his existence now in one fell swoop the supreme court of the united states in the engel case in 1962 strudk down almost 200 years of history and replaced it with the rule of secularism of course with engel the precedent was set and in subsequent cases prayer and all official mention of god in the schools was stricken ironically while the right of children to participate in prayer and to so express themselves was wiped out schools were encouraged to have children exercise their first amendment rights to do anything they pleased as long as the law was obeyed thus we have the ironic to the extreme in modern schools students can gather for the purpose of paying homage to any current cult but if caught paying homage to god then they are in violation of the law what really galls me is that the opponents of school prayer respond that this may be true but after all nothing precludes a student from reciting a silent prayer well nothing precludes a child in soviet russia from reciting a silent prayer either so no right has been maintained or appointed simply because a child can think about god but heaven forbid if that same child or a group of children attempt to pray out loud at the beginning of the school day because if they do the law is against them i for one am getting fed up with a handful of malcontents trying to rearrange our history our constitution and our way of life the overwhelming majority of the american people want prayer in schoolover four in five want the right restored yet the federal courts have given a vociferous minority preferential rights in dictating what the majority can and cannot do our constitution clearly guarantees rights for minority thinking and minority expression it does not confer such rights in a way that creates a tyranny over the majority yet that is exactly what we have in the initial prayer decision and subsequent court decisions based upon it on thomas jeffersons memorial there are words so profound so moving and yet so simple in their message until it sums up this debate it bears repeating and i quote god who gave us life gave us liberty can the liberties of a nation be secure when we have removed a conviction that these liberties are the gift of god jefferson knew the answer to his question and we know it when we overtly or covertly strike the almighty from the national endeavor we undermine that endeavor and let there be no mistake about it i might add that after thie engel decision was handed down or public schoolswent through a transformation there was constant deterioration in discipline sat scores decreased and drugs became a terrible factor in the development of our youth in short the court opened the pandoras box of secularism in our schools and thoughtful reflective americans are justifiably afraid that it will never be closed the prayer amendment is needed it is needed to rekindle respect for authority in schools it is needed to remind us all that faith devotion and adherence to a higher order is to be desired over adherence to the temporary materialistic whims of the times the court has legislated now it is time for congress to legislate it is time to give democracy a chance to work there can be no valid reason for bottling up the prayer amendment any longer i respect the views of those who are opposed to the amendment but i respectfully disagree with the dilatory tactic employed by them to keep the full house the state legislatures and above all the american people from having an opportunity to fully debate the question its time for the judiciary committee to fulfill the public mandate that has been pronounced over and over in various national polls it is not fair to tell the overwhelming majority of the american people that they have no stake in their destiny as free men and women yet this is exactly what is happening every day the prayer amendment is bottled up in committee no religion is established by this amendment on the contrary it confirms the constitutional neutrality toward specific religions no coercion is caused by this amendment it is voluntary in short it reaffirms the establishment clause of the first amendment by confirming what the forefathers had in mind it represents a return to the legal norm that kept us in good stead until that norm was thrust aside by bad law and bad precedent in short i support the prayer amendment i feel it is good law i feel it is long overdue and i feel

mode was available we were told then that the mx could not be placed in existing silos because it would be vulnerable we were told that the mx was critical for our defense because only the mx could help close the window of vulnerability we were told and we all agree that the unitedstates nuclear arsenal required a weapon that could survive a first strike because that was necessary to deter war we have now received a report which urges us to base the mx in existing silos which are already targeted by the soviet union under close scrutiny the window of vulnerability has disappeared and deterrence is being promised with a basing mode that would invite a first strike by the other side we have been encouraged by some who suggest that because we will require a reduced number of missiles we are saving 10 billion i contend that if this dangerously destabilizing scheme were free it would still cost too much it would cost too much because we will not use it in a first strike and we cannot use it for measured retaliation its vulnerability requires that we launch it within the 30 minutes when an attack is first detected and the first enemy missiles land when the russians see it coming do we really expect them to leave their missiles in hardened sites awaiting the arrival of the mx i listen to the argument that to build the mx and place it in vulnerable silos is a demonstration of our national will and find it lacking our national will is amply demonstrated by our willingness to spend billions of dollars on submarine based ballistic missiles cruise missiles and conventional weapons our national will is demonstrated by our eagerness to end the madness of another round in the arms race and to seek a reasonable negotiation for the reduction of nuclear weapons surely the russians are as perplexed as our european allies at an expression of national will that would lead us to base mx in vulnerable silos the destabilizing nature of a weapon that can only rationally be used for a first strike does not reflect our national willit reflects another step in the direction of disaster the concept of deterrence requires that our adversaries realize that to start a nuclear war will result in unacceptable losses to them of the 9 000 nuclear warheads that the united states now has deployed fewer than 5 percent need be available to retaliate in order to bring about the devastation of the russian industrial capacity indeed their civilization beyond reasonable hope of recovery if this is insufficient to deter our adversaries then surely the addition of 700 nuclear warheads to our already numerically superior arsenal will not increase its power to deter it is time we take stock of our national defense needs rather than attempt to match the strategy tactics and weapons we ascribe to the other side the arguments against the mx are myriad it serves no deterrent function it is vulnerable it is a highly valued target it is expensive and unproven and it has no value other than to blast hardened targets which will surely be empty by the time it arrives the arguments in favor of placing the mx in existing silos are specious it cannot function as a

thee special orders today on the impact of defense spending on the economy the figures are painfully familiar to us all 313 4 billion in budget author ty requested for fiscal year 1985 up 18 percent in current dollars from this years 265 3 billion military outlays for fiscal year 1985 total 272 billion which is 29 4 percent of the entire fiscal year 1985 federal budget but even if one were to accept the sacriflees in our economywith a projected fiscal year 1985 deficit of 180 billionto build up our national security one would have to question how our defense moneys are being spent as a february 9 new york times editorial pointed out how much is less important a question than for what the answer to both questions is quite disturbing for despite the efforts of this congress to eliminate waste in defense spending through warranties competitive bidding and independent testing we are still spending too much and getting too little an analysis of spending priorities shows that the cuts which are being made are coming from operations and maintenance without concurrent cuts in procurement in 1984 for example congress reduced the administrations defense request from 11 percent real growth to a level estimated between 4 and 5 percent in real dollars congress did this not by canceling any major weapons but by a stretch out procurement schedule which will haunt us in the future and by cuts in operations and maintenance and personnel which haunt us already if we look at the chart on priorities within the military budget which illustrates investment versus operations spending the overall picture becomes clear the fact is that most of the spending increases since january 1981 have been concentrated in investment accounts procurement r d and milconat the sacrifice of operations and maintenance and personnel not only do cuts in o m and personnel often lead to future spending pressures but they have led us already to a weakened state of readinessrecent denials by the defense department notwithstanding i would like to enter in the record a summary of a report on spending for a sound defense by the committee for national security and william kaufmann of mit in this report two explanations are given for the unfortunate attractiveness of o m cuts one cuts in these accounts show up as immediate savings while cuts in procurement may stretch over a number of years and two the military services prefer to protect their money for new equipment and instead cut back on training or spare parts inventories bear with me as i read you two quotes from the report which i think are critical this is one of the clearest examples of how the politically easiest cuts can damage unitedstates national security however unglamorous adequate funding for operations and maintenance is absolutely necessary to ensure adequate readiness and the current underfunding of o m means that when the inventories of new weapons begin to accumulate either the defense budget will have to be increased well beyond what the reagan five year defense plan now proposes in order to provide the necessary funds or the unitedstates will end up with forces equipped with new hardware that will not be genuinely combatready what will it take to alert the defense department and as it falls on our shoulders this congress to the dangerous trend that is developing will it take another humiliating episode like the iranian helicopter fiasco with even greater loss of life our course is clear we must send a message to the defense department that the pace of weapons accumulation must be slowed and funding for tedundant weapons systems must be eliminated we cannot afford to fund parallel weaponry so that the army navy and the air force can all independently fight a war the mx missile program must finally be halted not only because it does not have a survivable basing mode but also because the proposed trident ii or d5 missile promises to provide the same accuracy as the mx from a virtually invtilnerable basing mode on trident submarines we cannot afford to continue purchasing navy vessels for a 600ship navy if those ships are going to end up sitting in port without parts and

there in the last congress which only made down payments on many weapons systems in the fiscal year 1983 appropriations legislation but we knew even then the bills would eventually come due the pentagon will not be able to pay all these bills the economy will not be able to support these bills the public cannot afford such bills in a january 1983 oped piece for the new york times i wrote the sad fact is that the administration and the pentagon simply have failed to make choices among these many systems unless congress now insists upon choices there will be serious consequences i concluded

been brought forward with respect to this amendment offered by the gentleman from georgia it is true that compensation under the terms of this bill would be awarded to those exposed to a hazardous substance from a facility or a site and these two terms are as the gentleman from north carolina indicated very very broadly defined in the bill the definition is so broad that compensation would have to be awarded for injuries suffered from exposure to asbestos or to formaldehyde or from drinking water from lead pipes as we know there are many communities such as the city of boston which take their drinking water from lead pipes so that the claims for injuries real or alleged could likely run into the billions the awards procedure in this bill is retroactive for 20 years the awards procedure applies to the dependents of any deceased individuals this opens the fund to an unknown number of claims on behalf of those who are already dead this would also mean a huge drain on the fund which is supposed to be dedicated to the cleaning up of hazardous waste sites it was pointed out earlier that the fund awards payments to those reasonably likely to have been injured by exposure to a facility or site where the disposal occurred disposal is defined very broadly and includes the discharge deposit injection dumping spilling leaking or placing of any solid or hazardous waste into or on any land or water the fund also compensates those reasonably likely to have been injured by exposure from a facility or site where a hazardous substance was treated recycled stored or migrated from this is an incredibly broad array of pathway exposures particularly when coupled with the expansive definition of facility and site being undefined in addition to the hazardous substances which are listed there is also compensation for exposure to any pollutant or contaminant now a pollutant or contaminant is a very broad term and it could be any chemical or compound including salt vinegar or the chemicals used to keep swimming pools clean it would include any suspected carcinogen remember that the standard of proof under the terms of the bill is reasonably likely to contribute to the injury and any substance which cause an acute reaction there is one last point i would like to make on the issue of subrogation i urge my colleagues not to ignore the subrogation provisions in this amendment subrogation allows the government to sue an allegedly respons ae party and collect reimbursement for all of the money paid to a claimant the standard of proof required of the government in

years with taxes we have raised the cost of labor to the point that if any small business man or waman or entrepreneur in this country wants to hire somebody they have to factor into their equation the increase in the futa tax we have doubled the futa tax in the 1982 the federal unemployment tax that went from 3 percent to 6 percent we have drastically increased the payroll tax and that is going to go up and we have even taken the 1989 payroll tax and accelerated that in fact 93 percent of the 1981 tax acts have been offset by tax increases in fiscal year 198188 according to the treasury we are putting another tax on the employment of people and raising the cost of labor by i think going after the 3d year gentlemen and ladies that is a mistake you are putting a wedge between the aftertax income of the working man and woman and the cost of labor to such a point that every employer in america is going to be forced to look for machines and capital intensive ways of replacing the working people of this country i am not against recapitalizing american industry we need to keep up with technology we need to make autos and steel more efficiently and more effectively and use robotics and use technology but what you are doing here is not lowering the cost of capital you are raising the cost of labor in this country to a point where businesses are not going to be able to hire people they are inefficiently goin to have to put a machine in their place you are raising the cost of labor every time you put the tax on working people you widen the gap between their aftertax wages and their pretax income inflation is not caused by too many workers working it is not caused by business doing too much business inflation is caused by the government with a combination of inflation and taxes the government is driving a wedge between labor and management which does not have to be there let me give you a simple example it is not perfect because there is no such thing as an average family but this will give an idea of what is going on in 1970 the median income of american families was 9 750 in 1980 it was 19 950 but if you take away the effect of inflation and take away a tripling of payroll tax rates and take away the automatic increases in income tax rates caused by inflationthe real takehome pay of that family actually dropped by about 912 in 1980 dollars that is a cut in real aftertax wages of about 5 percent but now look at it from the other side from the point of view of the business add on the employers share of the payroll tax the cost of hiring that median wageearner rose from 10 124 to 21 173 that does not include unemployment contributions pension and health benefits and other nonwage costs that is an increase of 8 percent beyond inflation the real cost of hiring the worker went up 8 percent after inflation while the workers takehome pay went down 5 percent after inflation the businessman sees his labor costs skyrocketing and he blames labor for inflation the worker sees his aftertax pay going down and he blames management for making excessive profits but the wedge between was actually caused by the government what would you do if you were representing the worker i mentioned negotiating a 3year contract and you figured inflation would be 10 percent a year your members will need a 33percent increase in takehome pay just to stay even with inflation but you can not ask for 33 percent before taxes because you know that there will be payroll tax increases and automatic increases in the income tax rates it turns out that the family earning the median income of almost 20 000 in 1980 would need a 42percent pay increase over 3 years to keep up with inflation after taxes but the businessman is going to scream this 42 percent pay increase raises his labor costs 7 percent faster than inflation it is a situation in which nobody wins if the business passes on the costs in higher prices it is the worker who loses because the price of goods goes up but if business can not pass on the cost it means it can afford to hire 7 percent fewer workers this is how inflation increases tax rates and how rising tax rates increase unemployment you have got falling real wages rising unemployment a squeeze on profits and not enough investment to increase productivity witness the fact that in buffalo n y where bethlehem steel just shut down their major and primary steelproducing capacity the aftertax wages of the working people was about 50 cents on the dollar every dollar of income that went to the worker gave them 50 cents of purchasing power but it cost the employer a dollar one of the gaps between the unitedstates production of steel and autos and other machine tools and other countries one of the most important things this congress has to do is to rethink tax policy with an eye to getting our tax system restored to a point at which both labor and capital are closer together and not separated by a tax system and of course inflation which exacerbates these conditions let me just conclude by saying that i think this is a wonderful debate i understand my friend the gentleman from michigan who had his concerns and i want him to know even though he cannot offer his budget that i hope henmakes a lot of noise about it we do have differences in tactics but i cannot imagine how anybody could vote for a budget in this
