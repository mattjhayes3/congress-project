president hoover ina turbulent time the campaign that would lead to roosevelts election was just getting underway the terror of economic dissolution was palpable indeed on the day hoover signed the bill the angry remnants of what had been 17 000 members of the bonus armys world war i veterans were camped in washington the house had passed the patman bonus bill less than a month before only to see it defeated in the senate most of the veterans left washington but on july 22 there were still about 2 000 angry and desperate veterans in washington only 6 days after signing the home loan bank act hoover ordered the army to remove the veterans by force in an infamous act troops led by douglas macarthur in whose train was dwight eisenhower evicted the bonus army and burned its camp that was the climate that existed when this country took its first halting steps toward a national housing policy franklin d roosevelt announced the new deal in his nomination acceptance speech less than a month before hoover signed the law creating the federal home loan bank system interestingly enough his new deal platform did not include specific reference to housing it was a program for economic reform designed to bring some order out of the chaos of banking and securities restore some confidence and encourage states to create what later became the social security system in mid1932 when the new deal speech was written the full magnitude of the great depression was still developing needless to say the home loan bank act could not by itself do what needed to be done to house the poor let alone make home ownership possible for the great majority who were at the time tenants less than 40 percent of americans owned their homes then and many who did lost them in the depression in the chaos of the depression it represented little more than a faint flicker of hope when franklin d roosevelt became president in march 1933 he faced utter chaos nothingnot farms not banks not industrieswas working cities and towns had run out of money to feed and clothe the growing army of desperate people thrown out of work and off their farms you must remember that at that time america was mostly rural in that disastrous time urgent action had to be taken and it was within 100 days an incredible amount of legislation was enacted to restore order and begin finding the way to recovery among those acts was a relief program for homeowners the home owners refinancing act signed june 13 1933 this emergency relief act was the second great step toward a national housing program the refinancing act created a corporation capitalized by 200 million to refinance the mortgages of hardpressed homeowners a few months later in april 1934 an additional 1 billion in capital went into the corporation it did more than refinance mortgages the corporation could advance money to pay back taxes and provide for repairs and maintenance these cash advances could be for as much as 50 percent of the appraised value of the loan the whole thing being secured by the value of the property the home owners loan corporation remained in business for only 4 years but in that time it had made loans covering more than 1 million mortgages and it produced a profit fifty years later with the country in a recession as deep as any seen since 1933 notwithstanding to the contrary what we heard a few minutes ago i offered a bill to provide emergency help to hardpressed homeowmers and we called it that the emergency homeowners assistance act in colorado for instance in the city of pueblo where the steel mill was shutting down the sole source of employment the foreclosure rate on homes was 100 a month at that time i took the floor and asked this house to approve the homeowners emergency assistance act the house did indeed pass it the one and the only what my minority members called a new program that has been approved by the house under the reagan administration that is since 1981 it languished in the senate and it died in the senate a senate that in 6 years never once even had so much as a hearing on housing needs or community development needs of our country the senate proposed to do nothing and my proposal did nothing radically more than essentially what we had seen and i had witnessed during the depression in the homeowners loan corporation in fact did the research work on that bill myself and with the able help of the staff and counsel we reshaped it in terms of modern needs all it would do would be the same thing make loans against home equity to prevent those homes from being foreclosed ironically not too long in fact less than a year and a half after that in my home town of san antonio when i walked the line of about 203 fellow americans destitute homeless waiting to make their entry into the homeless shelter that had been provided them by the city i talked to one young relatively young because i consider anybody under 40 very young homeless father of two who had lost his home in pueblo co and had we enacted that program that i had envisioned he would have been enabled to have been assisted and to have remained under the roof and the shelter of his home instead of having to park his wife and kids with his parents in another state and wander through the south thinking that perhaps in the south he could find employment and come to a city such as san antonio where indeed the need was just as great as the city that he left i have never been able to understand why this simple humane eminently workable ideawas so adamantly opposed by the administration why it was willing to let so many thousands of people needlessly suffer the loss of their homes when hundreds of thousands could have been helped at virtually no real cost or risk to the government why not extend help to people who are suffering economic disaster through no fault of their own as a result of forces they cannot control it made sense in 1933 and it should make sense today a little more than a year after the home owners loan corporation bill was signed the national housing act of 1934 became law this law was truly monumental it brought up the capital of the home owners loan corporation to 3 billion but more than that this was the law establishing the federal housing administration at this point i want to render tribute to a man who passed on just last month on august 9 the great leon keyserling and i want to render testimony that it was his architectural hand his designing hand that devised the basic 1934 and 1937 national housing act and whose friendship and counsel i never dreamed i would be able to enjoy years later after those miserable dim days that i recall vividly because i am a depression kid and i was in school at the time and would enjoy his great wisdom and would have shared his last supper literally because he died 4 days after i had enjoyed an invitation to supper at his home here in washington leon keyserling actually is a man that i hope we can memorialize in a more lasting and meaningful way when the time comes but his real monument has been etched into these great acts of humanitarian legislation for he was the architect and the counsel and lawyer that devised and structured the basic fundamental framework of reference for this noteworthy legislation the fha became the engine of housing and home ownership as a matter of fact the miracle of the world in the 20th century was performed here in america because between 1940 and 1980 we reversed where a minority of american families owned their homes to a percentage increase of the overwhelming majority by 1980 the sad thing is that since 1980 we have had an increase in the emergence of this phenomena of modernday homelessness which is in epidemic proportions and for which this congress has passed emergency legislation just this year and all because there is cause and effect you cannot turn back on the basic commitment to housing and the allocation of national credit for construction of affordable housing affordable to the main mass and stream of our families today the average cost of a new singlefamily dwelling unit in the united states is over 175 000 that means that we have priced out all but 6 percent of americans from the dream of owning a brandnew singlefamily dwelling unit for their loved ones it was the fha through its system of mortgage insurance that made home loans a low risk proposition and made it possible for lenders to extend the longterm fixed rate mortgage that was the cornerstone the inspiration and the motivation of mass home ownership in this country under fha tens of millions of people have obtained home loans it has turned a profit its property standards insured a consistent quality of housing and its operations remain at the heart of home ownership in this country today since the national housing act of 1934 home ownership has become the rule not the exception no longer do twothirds of americans rent though we are in a period of regression and headed back to that twothirds live in their own homes thanks to these programs through fha the affordable mortgage became a reality and with it the affordable home the sensation of 1937 was president roosevelts famous fight to transform the supreme court by increasing the number of justices that is the old supreme court vehemently opposed packing charges the president was accused of trying to pack the supreme court in order to have a patsy supreme court which would give him the opportunity to pack the court with justices he believed would not overturn as the conservative court had his industrial recovery act the court fight made the bork case seem utterly tame it mesmerized the country from february to july but the great court fight was not all that was going on that year on september 1 the capstone national housing act of 1937 became law by 1937 the banking system was stable there was deposit insurance the refinancing programs for homes and farms had stemmed loan losses and the home loan bank system was in place the fha had begun its work what remained was to deal with slum clearance and to try and provide decent housing to the millions who could in no way afford to pay market rents the 1937 housing act created the unitedstates housing authority which was empbwered to make 60year loans to local housing agencies the local agencies had to put up 10 percent of the cost of clearing slums and erecting housing projects the authority had the power to grant operating subsidies so that rents could be geared to the incomes of poor families that basic mechanism remains in place to this very day what an honor to be able to rise at the end of this month to memorialize the congress on the fact that on the first day of this month exactly 50 years ago in this month of september the 1937 basic housing act was approved that in that day and time the congresses and their presidents did in fact have faith and confidence in the average american family in the faith that with just a bit of help it could be tided over in dire circumstances over which it had no control that not only would those loans made then under those conditions be repaid but that they would earn a profit to the treasury of the united states as indeed those programs did within a few years slum clearance could be seen and felt within 4 years the unitedstates housing authority had helped create 511 new housing projects for lowincome families with more than 161 000 units in the 50 years since enactment of the landmark 1937 housing act this government has expanded the assisted housing stock to some 4 million units about half of which are publicly owned today we still have in place in being and in operation the same basic housing tools that were created during the cataclysmic years between mid 1932 and mid1937 those tools were revolutionary in their concept and in their effect before this nation set out on what became a bipartisan commitment to a comprehensive housing policy a full third of our people lived in poor sometimes inhuman conditions today the proportion of people in substandard housing is perhaps 10 percent this reflects a monumental achievement and yet the need should not be that great its 5 percent more than 1980 nor would the need remain so great had not the present administration elected to withdraw from housing as far as it could in 1982 the administration even tried to eliminate mortgage insurance for most people it has managed to virtually stop construction of publicly owned housing units it has managed to prevent enactment of an emergency homeowners assistance program but it has failed to kill housing it has failed to stop enactment of this nations first effective emergency shelter program for homeless people and it has failed to prevent members of its party from joining in this years effort to reassert and begin to revitalize the comprehensive housing program that came into being with the housing act of 1937 the nations commitment to a decent and affordable home for every citizen has been fiercely advocated and honestly administered by a small dedicated extremely proficient corps of public servantsvisionaries and practical administrators innovators and financiers regulators and politicians it has worked it works still and after 50 years the dream is as alive as ever after 50 years we still have not reached the goal of a decent safe and affordable home for every americanbut we have come a long way the nation has been transformed the remaining task can be

summers are demanding firm action from this congress this landmark legislation before us would ban tile ocean dumping of sewage sludge and industrial waste after december 31 1992 however 6 months after enactment dumping would no longer occur without the imposition of escalating fees the fees would help accelerate the implementation of safe landbased alternatives to the insidious practice of ocean dumping if dumping were to occur after 1992 the legislation would hit the dumpers where it hurts mostin their pockets clearly congress must assess severe civil penalties in order to take the profit out a practice that heretofore has been profitable at the expense of the economy and the environment in my estimation the fees and the penalties give the dumpers ample incentives to get out of the ocean within the time frame legislation provides let there be no mistake about it my state will pay its fair share of the price for this legislation there are six municipal authorities in new jersey which are presently dumping at the 106 site however the leadership in new jersey stands ready and committed to make the financial sacrifice to protect the ocean for future generations in fact

been much said about how s 858 provides reasonable access to abandoned shipwrecks for our nations 4 million recreational sport divers regrettably the language in the bill is nothing more than a senseofcongress statement it is nonbinding and unenforceable and if past history is any indicatibn sport divers who are overwhelmingly opposed to this bill in its current form have real cause for concern that certain states will deny them access to hundreds of shipwrecks as one of my constituents noted if s 858 is passed there will be no guarantee that spot divers will be allowed to continue enjoying that sport on the shallower less dangerous inshore shipwrecks all shipwrecks within three leagues of shore will become the property of the state which may place access restrictions on any wreck or declare it off limits altogether this amendment is identical to the one offered by our distinguished colleague during the full merchant marine and fisheries committee markup of s 858 at that time no one raised an objection or spoke a single word of opposition to this amendment based on its merits in fact the house sponsor of this bill congressman bennett indicated he not only supported the shuinway amendment but that he would introduce a bill to eliminate this serious flaw in s 858 after it was enacted the only concern expressed by the proponents of this legislation about the shumway amendment was that it would result in this bill being sent back to the senate mr chairman to vote no on this amendment simply because we dont want to send it back to the senate is the wrong way to legislate lets improve s 858 here and now and lets stop worrying about what the other body will or will not do i also think we are making a tragic mistake if we believe that report language dear colleague letters and floor colloquies will safeguard the rights of our sport divers they will not without this amendment i fear the state judges will look at the plain language of s 858 and conclude that a state can legally prohibit any sport diver from access to any shipwreck within a states jurisdiction after all one could logically conclude that if congress intended that sport divers had a guaranteed access right to these shipwrecks then the statute would have said so moreover if this bill is enacted without the shumway amendment we will eliminate all federal jurisdictional involvement with regard to these shipwrecks in essence we will have abandoned the constitutional responsibility for their protection and there will be no way to ensure that a state reasonably manages these shipwrecks we are blindly assuming that states will be good neighbors and that they will manage these valuable underwater resources in a fair equitable and evenhanded manner i believe there is too much at stake and too many americans who could be adversely affected to leave this to chance if you want certainty clarity and a real guarantee that sport divers in your district and mine will have a right of accessthen the only way to ensure that is to vote in favor of the shumway amendment i intend to do just that and i urge my colleagues to join with me the reagan administration the professional association of diving instructors the national association of underwater instructors the national ii 1479 ymca scuba program the florida association of dive operators the national

amendment that should not be made in order at all that the rules of the house should not be waived others have made the very valid point that it also waives the rule requiring a quorum in the committee for legislation to be passed but i want to bring the attention of the house to the fact that there is a worse almost obscure feature of this rule which has been used several times this year frankly this feature of the rule is ire it has not been done routinely in prior scssions it is dangerous it is irresponsible and it is a heavyhanded provision that is the provision in the rule which controls the debate or controls the time on the amendment offered by the gentleman from illinois the gentleman from illinois has a valid amendment it is onethat i do not agree with but he ought to have adequate time to debate the merits of his amendment and the opponents ought to be able to debate their side as against the amendment the house normally operates in the amendment process under the 5minute rule i would say to my colleagues that the 5minute rule works it allows members to share time to yield to one another for time it allows for a full debate it is helpful in understanding information it changes minds and it brings out new information the 5minute rule causes amendments to be considered generally somewhere between 10 minutes of debate and 30 minutes of debate sometimes an hour sometimes 90 minutes or 2 hours depending on the significance of the amendments but the rules committee has erred in this case in attempting to control the debate by a limit on time what this rule does is this it causes members who do secure time to not yield to one another to not share information to not ask questions and to not answer questions because members rightfully have to be
