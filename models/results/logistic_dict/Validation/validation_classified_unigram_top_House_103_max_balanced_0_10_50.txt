by the new taxesthe middle class i specifically recall hearing candidate clinton on the campaign trail claiming he was going to cut taxes for the middle class on october 19 1992 he said i will not raise taxes on the middle class to pay for my programs it seems that since becoming president bill clinton is experiencing memory loss now president clinton is pushing a tax bill complete with an energy tax and new taxes on social securitytaxes aimed at the middle class to pay for more spending programs more taxes more spending and a bigger government thats what president clintons tax bill is

did i get a wrong number tonight i got a mailing at my office within the last couple of days from the speaker of the house not the acting speaker but the real speaker of the house the gentleman from washington and it was headlined how you robert s walker can help president clinton succeed i opened it up and it has got a lot of fascinating stuff in here about how i can help the president mainly how i can help the president by sending money to the democrat congressional committee and also by sending back their survey but i was fascinated by some of what was in this letter it was addressed to me i mean it says dear robert s walker and then it says to me you are one of a select group of democrats from around the nation whom im asking to take part in this important survey now obviously this is a computer glitch that got this to me but it did reveal some very fascinating things for example there is an underlying paragraph here that says unfortunately newt gingrich and his rightwing allies succeeded in cutting our congressional majority in last years election and all i could say was yippee and so that was the right thing i also kind of had the feeling at that point that i ought to start flapping my right wing but the fact is that they are admitting here that the gentleman from georgia has in fact gotten his message across to the american people and that we are in fact beginning to win new majorities but then it goes on and it tells the american people a couple of fascinating things it says here because the success or failure of the clinton administration depends upon which party has control of the congress righto i say to my colleagues if you wanted to have the clinton administration succeed what tom foley is telling you in this letter is you want democrats in the congress if you dont want the clinton administration to succeed with higher taxes and more spending you want to change the congress the gentleman from washington is absolutely right and i am pleased that he sent me this letter then he went on down here this is a fascinating little p s that they put on the letter it says if the republicans gain more control in congress it will severely cripple bill clintons agenda well let me tell you after spending some time at home over the last several weeks and listening to what people are having to say about bill clintons agenda my guess is that this is an admission by speaker foley that the republicans are going to take control of the congress let me repeat that to you it says if republicans gain more control in congress it will severely cripple bill clintons agenda america at this point wants to cripple bill clintons agenda they have decided that this tax and spend is not what they want tom foley is telling you america what you should do tom foley is saying elect republicans to congress because if republicans gain control of the congress we will stop bill clintons agenda thanks speaker foley for this letter this is a very revealing document i appreciate it now i did notice that you asked me to send a contribution i do not think you are going to get one you asked me to return the survey i do not think i am going to do that on a serious note i am a little concerned about the fact that it arrived at my rayburn house office building because solicitations of funding in a federal office building are against the law"],

staff has worked hard all day long but we are getting down to the last days of the first session of the 103d congress i have before me the schedule that was laid out here for republicans on this side it says we are going in at 10 tomorrow we will do youthful offendere what a sad subject that is we will do the intelligence authorization conference report which i just signed off as a member of that very important and sensitive committee that should go through fast and then we may or may not debate adding a 15th cabinet position to the office of the president of the united states that would be another growth executive branch agency and then it says here for us on this side saturday sunday monday meeting times uncertain possible business includes and it mentions four things d c statehood let us see the murder rate is running ahead of last year a little bit behind the year before but it looks like it may break all records we lost nine people dead in the city here last week it is going to blow through 450 again probably this year so we are still the murder capital of the civilized world the population is shrinking from 600 000 to 67 000 my state has 32 million 32 million citizens that is not even counting illegal aliens and we only have two senators and this d c city which is supposed to be a federal mandate district it wants to be a state while its population is dropping and it is the murder capital of the free world i dont think so as our people say then comes campaign finance reform that will be a joke that will be another incumbency protection act then reinventing government the way to reinvent government is to freeze everything but we will waste a lot of time on that and then comes the unemployment conference report which should go through and that is it then it has a footnote that the senate expects to adjourn sine die without any more days they are out of here and then we will probably be driven by that and get out of here sunday even though everybody still is talking monday or tuesday we always have our business finished ahead of the other distinguished chamber so i would say we are out of here saturday that means tonight and tomorrow night are the last times i will have an opportunity to pay homage to the heroes of world war ii and we are going through some incredible anniversaries all this year is the 50th anniversary of 1943 events and if 1942 was the dark year when the issue was in doubt and the great western statesman winston churchill called this year the beginning of the beginning of the end then we should have taken some time because most people are not around for 100th anniveraries especially for those of us who were alive even though we were children we should have taken pause every week at some point in our schedulethey do not seem inclined to do it in the other chamberto pay homage to these people that lived and served and were wounded and in the case of 312 000 of our fellow americans died to drive hitler to suicide in less than 3 years and 5 months mussolini was through by this year and the warlord tojo was in jail in disgrace in japan by next year along with most of his warlords what a time of heroes and that war began with about 134 million americans it ended in 1946 in those days the census did not count armed services people overseas by the time we got all of our men back and all of our army nurses and all of the other women that were serving overseas our population when clinton was born in 1946 in august the july census that year said we were pushing 147 million people we jumped 13 million people from pearl harbor to the end of the war by the time we got our forces home 13 million hardly noticeable was the loss of life of 312 000 hardly noticeable unless you were a gold star mother or a widow or a child without a father just a few momentoes coming home in a footlocker or even worse in a tiny box if they were lost at sea a few items from a ship if they were a prisoner or missing even worse and they did not turn out to have been a prisoner and been released if they were a prisoner under hitler we lost 1 percent in the camps if they were a prisoner under the warlords of japan we lost almost 40 percent of those prisoners what a difference between the evils of japanese imperialism and nazism against our prisoners i stood up in a 1minute this week and mentioned this report that the pentagon had released because of outside family pressure that several hundred i am quoting several hundred united states prisoners in korea were secretly taken to various places in the soviet union mostly by rail in many cases through china and that about 8 140 american servicemen are still officially unaccounted for those were in many cases the same heroes fighting the second war within 5 years i am going to speak on that and probably run out of time doing it but before i do i want to structure my remarks i want to do what is almost a mantra for me and mention that it is not just you and i and when the camera pans the empty chamber so ably manned by our terrific communications team down there it is not an empty chamber here there are 1 200 000 that is a lowball figure 1 200 000 people watching somebody bumped into me in the parking lot today and said gosh i love it when you are speaking i feel so embarrassed for you that there is nobody there none of your colleagues listening some of our members a little secret we keep around here are living in their offices they are not in bed yet they keep the tv on i know that a few watch many of their families are watching at home but the people that i think are in that cspan audience who vote over 95 percent they talk about a survey category of most likely to vote these are some of the best citizens in our country and if they will stay with us and follow the proceedings here while i talk a little history that i love so much thanks to my parents and great teachers then here is the way i want to structure my time tonight first i want to talk about the cultural war because we had some of that on the house floor today i started to write down political war as part 2 and i scratched it out because nothing can equal the cultural war we are going through right now except that part of it when we do ourselves dishonor in this chamber so i retitled it clinton and political skirmishes i think i can go through that in about 5 minutes then i want to get to the heroes like jimmy doolittle who died september 27 of this year pebble beach ca 96 years of age an original donor a man who to me personally is someone i will treasure the rest of my life i photographed his first 250 check because i knew i wouldtreasure it i did not have a chance with the rush of events the last few weeks to other than put things in the extension of remarks but i want to talk about what an inspiration jimmy doolittle was to young americans of my vintage then tarawa that battle is coming up the 50th anniversary in 2 days day after tomorrow on november 20 the story of our young marines and then the army following up on another atoll island in that area i have a good friend who looks probably younger than i do who was there at 19 years of age hitting the beach 50 years ago he is an assemblyman in california gil ferguson big tall tough marine fought in three wars he and his wife anita what great americans what a public servant he is on his way to tarawa right now to be there at the 50th anniversary i was supposed to go with him but we are still in we are supposed to be out but no way i wish i could walk those beaches again but i did get to walk them with one of the distinguished members from the other side who unfortunately was beaten last year steve solarz and i walked the beaches of tarawa and a few days later we walked the battlefield of guadalcanal steve was as moved as i was by the longest battle of american history at this point the solomon battle was in its 15th month we moved up the chain to bougainville there was incredible fighting still new guinea we had been fighting there for pushing on to almost 1 year and 9 months and it was incredible that was one of the leastreported upon battles in the world like burma newguinea was to be constantly always with us but it did not have the romance of the normandy invasion normandy is never far from my mind because not only is the 50th anniversary coming up next june but chris hell one of our reporters of debate you may not know this hit the beach 3 hours before the landing was one of those combat marinearmy guys that had to clear away the tank traps and the barbed wire so our guys could effect that landing today is the 50th anniversary of sir arthur nickname bomber harris starting the battle of berlin it was kind of a revenge title because the battle of britain had almost lost all of great britain to nazism but the battle of berlin lasted until march of next year it started today we lost 600 planes 600 aircraft lost over nazi germany each plane going down and if it was a 4engine bomber 9 10 11 crew members our 17s had been joined by now by b24s we were starting to do our share by this time next year we would have eclipsed the british but they were taking the brunt that battle of berlin turned the air war then i will talk about jimmy doolittle in case i forget i want to say something about doolittle right now as an air force pilot i just love this washington lawyer ramsey d potts a retired air force major general who served in england with general doolittle believes the legendary aviator made one of the critical tactical decisions of the war when he took charge of the 8th air force the 8th air force was mostly bombers but it had its fighter escort the escort was medium bombers and fighters working as fighterbombers pbs has had a special this week two nights in a row about a young pilot at that time a p47 thunderbolt pilot that just absolutely made clear to me that the fight on the ground was more deadly than the fight in the sky and there were no aces down there you flew and fought and tore up german armor until you got blown out of the sky and there was little time for you to get your chute open if you were lucky enough to get out of the flaming cockpit to continue this he says when jimmy doolittle took charge of the 8th air force he ordered allies in p51 mustangs and p47 thunderbolts dont leave out the p38s here mr potts the lightnings to go after the enemy fighters to become aggressive and follow them to their bases after air battles this aggression american and british aggression which meant the german air force became hunted over their own territory was the key to our gaining air supremacy if we had not had air supremacy we could never have invaded europe remember the great zanuck film the longest day only two enemy 109 messerschmidts made it to strafe the beach at normandy as tough as that fight was on the ground our guys only had to worry one short brief 2 minutes when two messerschmidts strafed the beaches one of them a german fighter pilot that just died here a year ago in the film he says contemptuously of goering and his own luftwaffe the luftwaffe has had its day and it was thanks to this young fighter pilot that doolittle said after you are through in the air defending the bombers go get them right in their own scorpions nest a lot of young guys got killed in 1943 doing that i want to talk at length aboutthose heroes then i want to finish on somalia because i am not through with that issue i have only got two more nights to discuss it and i guess i am going to be frustrated and not get the investigation i want on somalia before i go back to the culture war let me read a dear colleague that is going to circulate in the house tomorrow i will read it in toto here so that 1 200 000 americans will know what i am driving for here before the congress goes out it is important jack murtha one of the most respected members of this house chairman of i believe because it involves national security the most important subcommittee of the committee on appropriations the subcommittee on defense went to somalia after that horrible firefight on october 3 and 4 it was a real battle for me to get to hitchhike on air force airplane to get over there he being a chairman wis able to go to frankfurt and commandeer his own gulfstream and get down there on his schedule i had to wait to hitchhike on big galaxy c5s i got there about 3 days after he did 4 days he and i are the only two who have gone over there since these october casualties going from 11 dead to 30 dead in just 3 days killed in cases i think beaten to death and murdered he put out a dear colleague earlier this week the gentleman from pennsylvania jac murtha did he said my colleagues i brought back a letter from major general william garrison he takes all the blame and dont blame anybody in the pentagon for a lot of the democrats and maybe republicans that do not follow this it was like that sets everything to rest and let us press on here is my response to my dear friend that i admire very much a marine major from the vietnam conflict dear colleague earlier this week my good friend and our wellrespected colleague jack murtha sent you a letter concluding that officials at the department of defense were not responsible for the heavy casualties we encountered in somalia on october 3rd and 4th as the only other member of congress to visit our forces there since that operation i must take exception to my friend jacks analysis after personally talking to troops of all ranks involved in these operations i am convinced that additional firepower and better planning from the pentagon in washington would have helped with the october 3d4th ranger special forces raid as well as with other military missions in the horn of africa unitedstates rangers were engaged for nearly 15 hours on the ground i have spoken to special operations 16th special ops aviation regiment aviators who spent 17 to 18 hours in the air during the fight of course they had a gung ho battle cry dont quit i visited with them at their base at fort campbell for over 9 of the 16plus hours during the firefight from hell that is a magazine title aldeeds militia and civilians with automatic weapons pinned down our good guys while the u n forces awaited permission from their specific capitals rome new delhito release their tanks or armored vehicles it is impossible to say that unitedstates ml abrams tanks or m2 bradley fighting vehicles could not have altered the outcome of events there and saved some lives and dozens of others from being wounded during the extraction the exfiltration during my trip to somalia one commander specifically brought up his request for armor that was major general montgomery i didnt have to ask he brought it up the commander of the forces who conducted the october 3d4th operation made no mention to me about not needing armor to effect a rescue and they mentioned nothing to me about a letterhe mentioned nothing to me about a letter to the president that he had sent out with congressman murtha at this point only two people have seen the nowfamous letter other than the writer of course because it has supposedly only been delivered to president clinton lea aspin our former colleague here has not seen it as secretary of defense i believe that in writing the letter general garrisofiwas being a good soldier and trying to take all of the blame upon himself this commander was the last person bob dornai saw in somalia he walked me to the c5 as i left and he said to me and this is a verbatim quote few people in this chamber challenge this members memory he said congressman i must tell you something that was a good mission we completed our mission and then we got in a hell of a firefight on the way out agreed but its this quick reaction force general thomas montogery silver star vietnam rescue aspect that needed armor to break through roadblocks and to blast through the ambushes and i dont have it here but by that time it was in every single corner the only day to clear up contradlotions and prevent such operational problems from ever repeating themselves is for the highly decorated and superbly professional commander of the special ops to personally brief members of congress on the somalia mission i guess i am asking that he brief us in depth the way he appears to have briefed our respected colleague jack murtha he has returned stateside this commander and could easily be made available to congress before thanksgiving i truly have the utmost respect for jack murtha but my own site investigation and my followup leads me to the inescapable conclusion that civilians in the pentagon made serious and deadly errors by pulling out the ao130 specter gunship and i could add my letter on august 23 last summer the rangers arrivedand the special forces guys 2 days later and the gunships were gone that they trained with regularly and then by compounding that error by refusing the request for armor made by combat commanders in the field an error i believe which certainly cost american lives during the exfiltration phase i do not necessarily believe anyone should resign over this single bloody firefight nor have i hinted at it or called for it nor joined with any other effort here in the house along those lines but what is important is that the american people and the families of the wounded and kia get all of the facts about what happened out there and why and how we can prevent it from happening lets get the facts i take to heart that motto with the 160th guys the best pilots in the military and that includes jet pilots these helicopter pilots dazzled me especially when i went and looked at their simulators and flew one of the big simulators for the ch47s and then found out the process that they must go through to get included in that squadron so somalia is important one thing i want to discuss is the ia drang valley november 14 to 18 of 1966 where we had the 28th anniversary last week and i did not get a chance to mention it but there was a lot of talk about the ia drang battle the first battle in vietnam where we came anywhere near losing more than five or six americans in one fight we lost 301 the one was an air force a1 sky raider sandy pilot who went in and crashed and was killed right in front of all of the men almost being overrun by two whole regiments of north vietnamese army soldiers not viet cong and that battle was talked about in the pentagon during the whole month of october maybe still this month because of the parallels over the casualties which were 19compared to 301 killed in action it looked like the events were getting ahead of us just as it did in vietnam so let me come back to this opening theme in the culture war today we have another one of these peculiar debates a kind word on abortion where a lot of members n this house were voting correct instead of what is spiritually correct and i went into my pocket and i pulled out an article by cardinal john joseph oconnor his eminence the archbishop of new york a column that he wrote in the archdiocesan weekly called catholic new york his column is entitled from my viewpoint it appeared in the september 9 issue i have it courtesy of james mcfadden one of the clearthinking catholic laymen in this century who put it into his great newsletter catholic eye and i have been carrying it around for almost a month and a half here waiting to read this into the rboord because it says an awful lot about this culture war that i alluded to so many times in the debate today and particularly meaning the corruption of the beautiful little nation of denmark that story has been rounded various times all across the country on i think i said hard copy today but it is not it is inside edition and they showed these beautiful even mentioned how beautiful these little children are there children are beautiful all over the world anywhere and they do not have to be blondes with blue eyes but they showed these beautiful little tiny children but they are still children 10 11 12 13 smoking drinking they showed a 10yearold boy in a liquor store where he buys a fifth of something buys cigarettes comes out and is smoking and the beautiful little children girls some the same age as my young granddaughter talking about easy sex sometimes they say it was wrong sometimes they did not talking about how they lost their virginity this is 12 13 14yearolds and showing them drunk in public falling down hugging one another and then they cut to an american expatriate an american psychologist saying this was all good and healthy and they did not have the hangups like in america and that is where we should be and then they were also showing how they all have condoms which they get from their school or they get from their parents and none of them have accents it is amazing how english is such a second language in all of the scandinavian countries now and in germany and in switzerland you have to listen to detect an accent so there are these girls who are all being interviewed and when the young boy is asked when his father gave him a condom what did he say and he just said he said be careful that is the slogan of america play russian roulette if you get aids well you tried to be safe or it failed because there is a big failure rate with condoms so here is my good friend and the fighting irish archbishop of new york john cardinal oconnor i was hardly dressed for what was coming in my miter full vestments and hold my staff in hand waiting outside our lady of borrows 125yearld church to begin the anniversary mass her look almost withered my miter her words withered my ears how many kids will die in these streets because you wont give out condoms in the schools i could have shrugged it off as the nowin when are you going to stop beating your wife question i didnt it disturbed me because she meant it and she was sincere nor is she alone in her thinking various school boards throughout the country are saying much the same cheered on by editorials in some of the most important newspapers im told a delegation of assemblymen fom albany want to come to see me to tell me that catholic teaching on condoms is leading to genocide dornan footnote to archbishop oconnor there are going to be a lot of judas iscariot catholics in this group coming to lecture this shepherd of jesus cardinal oconnor says i watched the entire labor day parade from beginning to end a lot of nice people marching including a large contingent of the united federation of teachers some with their own children i spoke with a number and had pictures taken they seemed to me like the kind of teachers who are serious about teaching youngsters in the classroom just as they seemed serious about the care they were giving their own children i didnt get any sense at all that they had become teachers to give out condoms but now it would appear that the federal government itself wants to get behind condoms in a big way i saw young kids on television enthusiastic over the idea heard them say their parents should have nothing to say about lt none of my parents bustgood godl what are we doing to the young they are crying for bread and were giving tbhem stones who is killing them not only physically but morally and spiritually im not going to argue that too many condoms are defective or improperly used or induce a sense of false security so that kids end up with aids or a venereal disease or get pregnant those arguments are absolutely true but theres a much more critical argument about pushing condoms on kids its wrongf its corrupting thousands of kids its telling them they have no personal moral responsibility for their actions its telling them that the only real sinners are those who deny them condoms it says its not your fault if you get aids or give someone else aids its the fault of those who try to push moral values down your throatsthose killerth8ose catholic priest and bishops those protestants and jews and muslims who believe in divine law and personal responsibility william murchison i have had the honor of meeting this gentleman 25 yeas ago 20 years ago in one period of my life when i traveled the country fighting pornography so i am glad the cardinal quotes him william murchison syndicated columnist based at the dallas morning news writes the times for the human life review and i quote from his article in the latest issue summer of 193 an article titled the straight 90s speaking of the striking down of all louisiana sex education curriculum by a state lourt state court murchison writes the curriculum recommends sexual abstinence as one means of preventing pregnancy and sexual disease ah but the court reasons that the promotion of abstinence violates the taboo on interjecting religious beliefs and moral judgments into teaching such a finding is as interesting as it is outrageous what the court has done is concede to religion the high ground of common sense in other words it cannot be argued that abstinence does not work of course it worki avoid sex and you will avoid the consequences of sex but abstinence is also a moral proposition in other words morality equates with common sense to do the right thing is to do the sensible thing the thing that works the courts problem is that moral connection the constitution on the courts showing rules out the interjection of moral and religious beliefs into public discourse this means under the new order that we cannot teach what works best all we can teach is what works second and third best such as condoms which are notoriously ineffective in preventing pregnancy much less aids we rule out the best remedy as unconstitutional we settle for runnerup remedies not on account of their effectiveness but rather to facilitate the worship of ideological propriety in other words political correctness supersedes in an increasingly jaded nation spiritual correctness and common sense back to the cardinal i even hear otherwise intelligence people argue well kids are going to do what they are going to do so at least we should give them some protection and with that wellmeaning proverb they buy into the quick fix stop fighting the real problem give up on any hope of goodness and decency and common sense give up let us face what we are really doing give up on the antiquated notion that there is anything wrong with such normal good clean fun as sex outside of marriage recreational sex inevitable sex everybody is doing it so lets make it safe it is that kind of safety not catholic teaching on sex and marriage on purity and virtue on heaven and hell that kills i have been scorned in some quarters before for saying it but i will say it again and again bad morality is bad medicine i have only heard that ridiculed but never disproved it is a sad sad day when people really believe that the church is engaged in genocide by teaching that condoms are a formula for disaster it admittedly hurts to be called a killer when you are all dressed up for mass with a miter on it hurts even more to know that others share that opinion but it would hurt far worse if i believed it myself sorry lady i think you are dead wrong the church is lucky in these troubled times to have cardinals like oconnor and cardinal bernard law up in boston the bishops have been meeting in this town the only quarrel i have with the bishops i their i guess is in what they call wisdom they are so slow to respond to the attacks upon our culture ind the weakest of the bishops and there are more than a few the gutless ones the ones that try to submerge the most serious issues tearing us apart and mix it up with the central american poverty issues that jesus loved the poor nobody goes to hell for being poor this excuse that people are killing and raping and murdering and slaughtering one another in their own neighborhoods or ghettoes or barrios or poor white trash enclaves they are all killing one another because they are poor what a distortion of the humblest of our human family that are closest to god and my remarks earlier and i want to put that full brochure in now when i joined the gentleman from indiana who said that i had this little bible tract that a protestant young scholar had given me out on the steps i want to read vihat was inside after that front page with the eagle and the jefferson nickel with thomas jefferson looking almost right at the word god and the words in god we trust that are above your head and in the senate they are on the south wall so that the presiding officer in the senate whether it is vice president gorr as the president of that group whoever is sitting in for him they look at in god we trust all day long it is right across from him right above their eyes here is what it says inside i did mention the quote before to the gentleman from indiana of george washington it is impossible to rightly govern the world without god and the bible here is what this beautiful protestant little pamphlet says we have come a long ways from the old days when our government and its institutions openly admitted that we needed god to have this nation work in our public life we either ignore god or are openly hostile to him we live in a culture where the media has made the word christian have almost an insidious if not almost a hostile sound to it they reject the word sodomite but they have made the word homosexual destroying the adjective gay making that out to be a cause as glorious as any cause of human or civil rights in all of history incredible this goes on to say that symbols that remind us of god are not allowed in public places well this is a public place and it is here along the edge of our gallery and it is in the other chamber so they have not stripped it out of these places yet we begin our sessions with a prayer and the same for the supreme court and the same for the unitedstates senate but i am sure those are targeted traditions tv names him frequently him with a capital h but usually as a curse when i watched the

read that prayer earlier and the g three biblical passages one from the a hebrew people from psalms david the shepherd boy who slew goliath and e the other two from the beloved evand gelist john i would put those in the record too s in the cultural war that s we saw played out today again i come d back to this tack by many members o who put a wet finger in the airmarn garet thatcher used to callthem the wets they were so weak afraid of por litical correctness and the police ese pecially in the media the political a thought control people coming down on u him heaping him with insult they do s not understand that the american peoe ple innately like someone who stands on their own convictions i as a catholic i was not about to sell out my principle and become a weak lousy or grubbing catholic caving in to what is trendy in order to hold on to this seat i have never had a seat that did not poll against me on abortion 2 to 1 i represent a democrat seat when i tell my colleagues on the otherside of the aisle they get shocked my seat is 52 percent democrat 40 republican my trendy seat in west l a my first goaround here for 6 years i was a congressman for not just ronald reagan but for jane fonda tom hayden they were organizing against me round the clock year in and year out that is why i won my 51 percent 52 percent 53 65 i have never hit 60 i came close 4 years ago 60 but that was before ross perot organized a lot of people and did not get his target priorities straight enough of the culture war now let me slide into part 2 what i call political skirmishes that was a political and a cultural fight today now i faxed up to rush limbaughand i am going to be sitting in for him christmas week i hope you will forgive this commercial but i will be sitting in that chair talking to every square inch of americaalaska hawaii the great 49th and 50th states every territory then general blazs great island territory out there in guam the area of mr faleomavaeoa a great little area of american samoa puerto rico which i hope will be a state soon the virgin islandsall over there on this incredible phenomenon of rush limbaugh 630 stations now i will be sitting there going over this again but i faxed it up to him it has to do with all the trauma and investigation of the alleged improprieties by my party in new jerseys gubernatorial election now haley barbour the chairman of our republican party was here to talk to some of us today and said that it appears that not a dollar was spent to influence anybody they have not come up with a single human being not only not any black ministersand we should think better of them than to think that they would take money to tell the people not to vote in these troubled times they have not come up with a single person who has heard or who can name with an fbi anonymous name nobody can find anybody that took any walkingaround money so what happened to my friend ed rollins i will tell you what happened what he would call 45 days out in the wilderness out there he was in texas with ross perot he got to what is easy for all of us james carville on the other side has fallen victim to this sometimes a little bragging a little exaggerating in this case it seems to go way beyond exaggerating when you make something up out of whole cloth as rush limbaugh has said on the air hey go for it try to undo the election give more lawyers more money in the political field i do not think it is going to work i think christy whitmans victory will stand but he understands them going after that electoral investigation where nobody was killed nobody was injured and they may not even find 1 of not unethical money because nothing is unethical in new jersey with this walkingaround money but even the unseemly passing of money to any reverends of any denomination of any church but go for it my colleagues in the democrat party but here is what i faxed to rush how about these 10 scandals and i am adding almost one a day as i think about this for my colleagues what about scandals that are dragging on interminably and that would be major huge scandals with independent counsels appointed by this congress with millions of dollars allocated like all these millions were squandered on this frivolous science fiction story called the october surprise where george bush as vice president candidate in 1960 was bobbing around on an sr71 trying to encourage the crazed iranians to hold our hostages beyond election day so that ronald reagan could win that nutty thing cost us taxpayers 3 5 million to 4 million here are the ones that are out there and i will try to make them brief one the house post office i made a note next to that that there is hope that this may come to some resolution two the white house pay scandal that is jacking up peoples pay retroactively jacking up consulting money if that was the white house and we had this gridlock in government believe me congress would be all over the white house like a cheap suit trying to get to the truth of that three the white house travel office what the media call travelgate swept under a rug do not believe for a minute that a tall handsome catholic father of three blew his brains out with an old 1913 pistol speaking of vincent fosterbecause of the travelgate thing there was a white paper swept under the rug you willsee that foster comes up here later now waco and the branch davidians at least there was one m1 tank there newt gingrice thinks this is coming back i do not know it seems to me it was swept under the rug twenty children burned one of my sons said to me dad little kids walk around in the adult world with their head back all the time looking up to the big tall adults for protection inspiration and hope why did those 20 children have to burn to death in day 51 of this standoff when there was so much firepower outside this branch davidlan mt carmel compound where is the full deep investigation and congressional hearings on that one of my colleagues here the gentleman from michigan i was proud of him when he said he was going to get to the bottom of this what happened to my colleagues investigation no 5 vince foster suicide why why is it because of something that is coming up later six ron brown and the vietnamese connection the news magazines are already predicting oh this will ull go away this is the secretary of commerge and he says he never discussed the trade implications of writing off all of our mias and getting in on the action the bottom line dealing with the brutal government in hanoi that is still committing human rights violations every day i am getting like a clinton withthese hands working out there in the air no 7 white house health care task force meetings which were illegally not open to the public no disclosure forms no vouchers no accounting and a federal judge has just said give it to us and there are the toughest confrontational words i have ever seen in ordering the white house to come forward forthcoming with all that stuff no 8 i read this at the opening of my special order the ac130 spectre gunships were moved from mogadishu 2 days before the rangers and the delta guys got there who train with them all the time what was that all about and the denial of the armor i relate back to no 4 the waco death of 80some people not even one m1 tank not even the specially fixed up m1 tank to pump noxious fumes out of the barrel as the abrams systematically went around ripping the whole house apart there are some videotapes around here of some film i question some of the editing but it is fascinating film that i have never seen on the news networks about what happened there outside of waco that is number eight number nine this may be the hottest of all the madison guarantee savings and lean bank in little rock the white water real estate deal where the attorney powerofrecord was in a person named way back the hillary rodhamclinton you see she used her name then sometime she signed it just hillary rodham and then dumped it for the campaign as she took the name clinton back for the first time in her life to win the governors seat back in 1982 there she is on all the documents that is going to be fascinating and was vincent foster involved is this why this christina gentleman blew his brains out or was it just a travelgate thing where all his friends were telling him it is a oneday story put it behind you so that would be a major investigation with an independent counsel and millions of dollars put up by the house then number ten i only added this yesterday this search of personnel files of bush political appointees was this revenge for the socalled search of clintons passport file this week is the 24th anniversary on the 15th or ith of the clinton organizing demonstrations in england against his countrys foreign policy it would be fine if he stayed in the states to organise a big demonstration here on the 15th of 250 000 people but afterorganizing it he left for england to have the complimentary big demonstration in london in grosvenor square horses were stabbed bobbies were clubbed the fight was on clinton could not remember any of it until recently and then he very cryptically said well i presented the casket to the marines at the glass doors of the embassy to stop the doors from all being destroyed and broken as more violent people were threatening then the next day he had the prayer vigil on the 16th so that is 24 years and 2 days ago you know this is one of those weeks where you wonder when you see the president on the news tonight some of you will see it at 11 just wallowing in his victory that my party give him one hundred and thirtytwo of us gave him this huge nafta victory saved him from what our former colleague al gore called a catastrophic dev astating defeat i02 democrats and there are 2 to 1 of those folks over us and 132 republicans including myselfi gave hini this victory so he can go up to seattle with his head held high but i did not hear andre mitchell on the news talk about the republicans gave him this chance to be the cock of the walk up there all i heard was his reference to a bipartisan victory no the majority of his own party was against him on that that can cut several ways here in the political skirmishes i guess oliphant is going to replace conrad in the l a times it has mr rollins with beard sitting on a bench with two little ministers inbetween him and mr clinton mr rollins is saying ha you should have seen me in new jersey i spread half a million of whitman campaign funds around to suppress the black vote just kidding just kidding and the president sitting on the other side of these two little very much in stature smaller ministers he says hey thats what i did with naf1a i spread millions around in promise to congress of course i got these taxpayers money just kidding just kidsding and here is that little oliphant bird or duck he said i take voting seriously just kidding just kidding so the political skirmishes as a subset of the cultural war are fascinating now i knew that i would be left littile time that is why i am asking i think it has already been filed for a 1hour special order tomorrow night where i will stay totally on the heroes of somalia ia drang 196 vietnam italy in 1943 they were bogged down in the mud in the filthiest winter of all 80 years ago the british 8th army the unitedstates 5th army slugging it out the germans fighting desperately they were starting even to counterattack a little bit before the winter set in up in the bloodiest of conflicts in all the history of mankind the eastern front where the soviet union lost in their conflict not 20 but as we were told lately by mr yeltsin 30 million human beings the solomons i want to talk a little bit about the new guinea the bouganville campaign tarawa 1 123 marines sailors and coast guardsmen really taking in the landing barges then i will start off tomorrow with my jimmy doolittle tribute this wonderful man that god gave us for 96 years his wife died on their wedding anniversary what a lovely lady she was their 71st wedding anniversary 5 years ago what a life he led and the humble title of his book his book could have been just the word doolittle and everybody would have known but what it said was i never could be this lucky again if you talk to him what he meant by luck was his guardian angel god watching over him with all the scrapes he was in as a matter of fact let me at least start that tonight to kind of end on a positive note because tomorrow i am also going to talk about these hundreds of americans who disappeared in korea let me give the title of hero according to any dictionary it is roughly this a man of distinguished courage or ability admired for his brave deeds and noble quailties a man who is regarded as having heroic qualities and is considered a model or ideal i can think of yet another definition of a hero a man whose name and accomplishments are synonymous with this one word doolittle general james h jimmy doolittle we all remember him as a threestar general but he was given his fourth star in retirement a full general he died september 27 at the age of 96 in pebble beach ca on friday october 1 he was buried among thousands of other brave american heroes at arlington and in a staff mistake i missed his funeral we were out that day it breaks my heart to see the bis fly over following that beautiful b25 billy mitchell named after another great american hero general mitchell who sacrificed his career he predicted the japanese attack at pearl harbor pushing air power against the battleship admirals let us briefly recount just a few of the many accomplishments of this great aviator combat leader and a truly great american i will just go the end of my special order talking here about mr doolittle he was born december 14 1896 at alameda ca he died just a few miles away at pebble beach in his beloved golden state born 1896 so he was 4 years older than my dad god gave my dad 83 years gave jimmy 96 those 4 years put my dad in the trenches of europe when the war ended november 11 1918 harry dornan was there with three wound chevrons now they call them purple hearts jimmy always hated that he missed that he enlisted in the signal corps in 1917 at just 21 years of age though the war ended before he would see service in france he decided to stay on as an instructor pilot a real compliment to a guy that young that very same year he married his high school sweetheart josephine daniels he keeps plugging away as an instructor and in 1922 he flies from jacksonville fl to rockwell field at san diego ca in the first coasttocoast flight in less than 24 hours he did it in 22hours and 30 minutes that got him the distinguished flying cross we only give that for combat now but in those days we thought there would never be another war that is why we gave the great lindbergh this medal of honor which most people get by giving their lives for their country in 1925 doolittle wine the schneider cup seaplane race with a converted curtiss r3c2 landplane what a gorgeous airplane i got a whole book on these curtiss racers at home because of these and a lot of other races the united states is able to lay the groundwork for the development of highspeed fighters that although we got a late start would later dominate the air in world war i including the lockheed p38 lightning the republic p47 thounderbolt and the rockwell p51 mustang in 1928 he becomes the first pilot ever to perform an outside loop i do not think i have ever done that that is an extremely difficult and dangerous maneuver you know it is one thing to naturally take your airplane along the airflow of its lift into a loop but to bend it forward toward the ground and come up the back side and around i have some friends that have biplanes that can do that but i do not think i have ever taken them up on it in 1929 he flies from takeoff to landing purely by reference to instruments and an early radio navigation set this began what was to become known as instrument flight still today a cornerstone of civilian air commerce and military flying that would have been enough for anybodys career but he plunges on nineteen thirtytwo he wins the thompson trophy at the national air races in a geebee that killed a lot of good racing pilots the r1 geebee racer sets a world speed record at 296 that is still a record for most helicopters nineteen fortytwo he leads the nowfamous raid on tokyo which is hailed as both a strategic and a morale boosting massive success never before had a large bomber aircraft been launched from aircraft carriers the japanese first boats it sighted said theres two of our carriers one of the japanese enlisted men said to one of these captains on these small boats those arent ours he went down below deck and committed harakiri never before had the japanese mainland been attacked from the air of the 80 men on the doolittle raid three died in the raid my staff goofed up on this research four were beheaded we lost eight overall of those courageous doolittle raiders jimmy doolittle sat on his wrecked airplane in china after a rain storm he said to his men well i guess this is the end of my career but the lieutenant colonel was never to serve as an eagle bird colonel he was promoted to brigadier and awarded the congressional medal of honor i will pick up tomorrow his service in world war i and then go from jimmy doolittle into the heroes of what happened what was happening 50 years ago and close again with some mention of ia drang in vietnam how great our veterans are from that war so disgraced and vilified over the years but every bit the equal of the great rangers and delta guys that i saw in somalia and i will do that tomorrow night"], [0.0020516514778137207, 0.9979483485221863, 1, "h r 2921 introduced by congressman clement authorizes appropriations for the preservation and restoration of historic buildings at historically black colleges and universities this bill was introduced on august 6 1993 and was approved by the natural resources committee on november 10 1993 many of the historic structures located on historically black college and university campuses are threatened and a significant effort is needed to preserve and protect them the department of the interior in cooperation with the united negro college fund has launched a project to preserve these structures in 1988 a special survey to identify candidates for inclusion in this program generated responses from 46 hbcus nominating 144 structures for consideration the department and uncf eventually selected 11 of the most historically significant and critically threatened structures on such campuses the department and uncf estimate that it will cost 20 million to preserve these particular structures and uncf has agreed to match a departmental contribution of 10 million for this purpose under the hbcu historic preservation initiative however no funds were requested or appropriated for this purpose for fiscal year 1994 h r 2921 as reported by the committee on natural resources authorizes the use of appropriations from the historic preservation fund to provide grants for the preservation and restoration of historic buildings and structures at eligible hbcus in fiscal year 1995 a total of 20 million would be authorized 5 million of which may be used only for fisk university and 10 million of which may be used only for grants to those hbcus identified for inclusion in the interior departments hbcu historic preservation initiative for each of fiscal years 1996 1997 and 1998 15 million would be authorized federal funding for structures listed on the national register of historic places must be matched equally unless the secretary determines that an extreme emergency exists or that such waiver is in the public interest the bill as amended also stipulates that structures receiving federal funds may be altered later only with the concurrence of the secretary these structures represent the hopes and achievements of a group of people denied equal opportunity and justice and who succeeded despite the imposition of almost insurmountable legal and social obstacles in many cases the buildings were constructed by the students themselves many of them former slaves and came under constant attack particularly during the civil rights struggles of the 1960s and 1970s as symbols of africanamerican pride and progress national park system resources representing africaffamerican themes are notably scarce these institutions provided the only avenue to a better life for many africanamericans and provided this country with some of its greatest leaders including many current members of congress the inadequacy of the africanamerican theme representation in the national park system makes this program to recognize the importance of hbcus to our nation critical the historic preservation fund through which this grant program will be funded is authorized at 150 million each fiscal year through 1997 and the total amount authorized for the fund since fiscal year 1977 remains available until appropriated of the funds appropriated for historic preservation through the hpf the amounts cited in this bill may be used for preservation specifically at hbcus this bill does not authorize new spending but allows already authorized funds to be spent on these significant and underfunded resources the testimony received at the hearing from the many presidents of hbcus provided moving and eloquent affirmation of the significance of these resources and their importance to the africanamerican experience many of our colleagues have expressed strong support for this legislation and several were able to attend the hearing and voice powerful personal confirmation of the education and cultural values represented by these structures with enactment of this legislation we will have taken an important step in recognizing the importance of these institutions to africanamerican advancement in this country and i urge my colleagues to support this bill"],

a future im happy to say that several members of this body have joined me in this call of support for our children the families and children of america are suffering and we cannot rescue one without saving the other as a noted child advocate has said and i quote it a community values its children it must cherish their parents my colleagues the care and nurturing of our families and children must become a national priority it is no longer acceptable to pay lip service to this issue not when 22 percent of all childrenmore than 1 out of 5live in poverty as a woman of color i cannot in good conscience keep silent when i know that more than half of those children 55 percent to be exactare africanamerican or hispanic in this land where the american dream still looms large as the one thing for which we should all strive there are people who toll at hardlabor every day of the week and only to find themselves still below the poverty level almost 12 percent of the families in this rich nation of ours make up the working poor and again for families of color the figure doubles to over 25 percent members of the house it is meanspirited and disgraceful that we continue to allow these conditions to exist there are those members in this body who would vote against any initiatives to help families and children while at the same time professing a deep love and devotion to our nation and this democracy to those members i say this is a shortsighted and hypocritical way to do business if you want to prove your allegiance to america then do it by standing up for those who will lead her into the 21 century members of the conference committee will have the opportunity to do that over the next few days as the budget reconciliation bill takes shape the measure that was approved by the house held four provisions that would put both our children and our families first those programs are childhood immunization earned income tax credit the mickey leland hunger program and the family preservation and support program i ask the members of the house for their continued support for these programs lets start with the immunization program dont let anybody tell you that parents can get their children immunized if they simply would make the effort to do it the numbers dont support that myth right now the rate of immunization against deadly childhood diseases in this country is a measly 55 percent how can we look ourselves in the mirror and say its ok for 55 000 children to be crippled or killed by a preventable disease like measles it happened in 1991 and will most certainly happen again how can we simply stand by and allow polio mumps rubella and meningitis to take this terrible toll on our children i submit to you that we cannot and before you tell yourself that the vaccines are available to everyone so we really dont need to do anything about this problem let me quickly tell you that the cost of immunizing a child jumped from 11 in 1977 to 133 in 1992 its called an economic deterrent many low and middleincome families who lack health insurance simply cant afford the service included in the house reconciliation legislation is a universal vaccine assurance system which would serve 11 1 million children who are now currently uninsured or underinsured medicaideligible or native american in north carolina 290 000 children would receive vaccinations 116 000 more than are currently eligible under medicaid i argue that providing vaccines for children is not only the morally right thing to do it is also fiscally sound let me remind my colleagues that 1 spent on immunizations now saves at least 10 in treatment down the road to sum it up briefly we can pay the bill now or pay it later the choice is ours with the issue of hunger i make the same plea we can provide children with the proper nutrition to grow strong bodies and healthy minds now or pay the consequences later the mickey leland food stamp provisions are critical to addressing the grievous problem of hunger the nationwide community childhood hunger identification project released in 1991 reported that 5 5 million american children under age 12 are hungry this means 1 out of every 12 furthermore an additional 6 million children find themselves in families that are at risk of hunger because sometimes these families in order to pay their utility bills in the winter can not afford to buy food these figures are astonishing in light of the abundance that we find in american agriculture onehalf of the recipients of food stamp benefits are children while 80 percent of the benefits in the program go to families with children put simply the food stamp program is the frontline of defense for preventing hunger in america over 96 percent of the benefits go to people at or below the poverty line most58 percentgo to households that are so poor that their income does not exceed half of the poverty line we must not accept hunger as a standard in this country the mickey leland provisions of the reconciliation bill speak to the problem of hunger by providing basic subsistence to those who are in desperate need i deeply urge my colleagues to support the efforts of individuals like the late mickey leland who died while attempting to address the deplorable conditions faced by the hungry on the african continent after we have fed our children and provided for their health we must help empower their working parents to lift themselves out of poverty that is the goal of the earned income tax credit program currently about 5 million americans work 40hour weeks and still remain below the poverty line it is a disgrace that individuals in america can work full time and never rise out of poverty in the house reconciliation bill families with two or more children that earn up to 8 500 a yearwhat fulltime minimum wage work now pays would receive a wage supplement to bring them to the poverty line i believe that an expanded eitc is essential to reward work and pave the way for welfare reform further the eitc would be of great benefit to low and moderate income working families in north carolina some 485 000 working families with children in north carolina received the fjtc in 1992 the expanded eitc program in the house passed reconciliation bill would have ensured that those workers with families and childless workers were brought up to the poverty line this is especially important in light of the increasing tax burden on the poor without an expanded eitc program which includes childless workers we will be taxing those poorest among us deeper into poverty i urge all members to show their support for this program especially to the finance committee of the senate and the ways and means committee of the house to work for its inclusion in the conference report finally i ask that my colleagues on the conference committee pay special attention to the family preservation and supportprovision contained in the housepassed reconciliation legislation last year 2 9 million children an average of about 8 000 a day were reported abused and neglected more than three children a day died of maltreatment the 1 5 billion included in the house package would help prevent this neglect and abuse and possibly offset more expansive social service programs by providing funds for family support programs that teach parents early how to protect nurture and support their children the funding will help states develop and expand programs for families in crisis to help keep children and parents together and will improve the quality of foster care for those children who cannot be protected at home the senate did not include the family preservation and support program in its version of the budget reconciliation legislation it is my sincerest hope that my house colleagues will prevail with the house provisions today we have the opportunity to tell the world that america values its children and families above all other things that we respect the sanctity of the family unit and will do all we can to support and encourage families to stay together and work for their goals with a vote for the initiatives i have outlined this evening we can begin to erase the social deficits that have plagued our society for more than two decades my dear colleagues let us begin today to secure americas future i yield to the

increase in his white house budget when all is said and done the appropriations committees response funds white house activities at precisely the same level they were funded in 1992 george bushs last year yet as a candidate bill clinton talked about a 25percent cut in the white house staff many anericans are wondering at current levels whether we are not paying too much already particularly in light of the continuing allegations of grave misconduct by members of the white house staff yet bill clinton the man who promised a 25percent cut tb the american people has this year proposed an 8percent increase for the white house budgetv i congratulate my colleague the kdntlelnan from florida who did not see fit to give mr clinton more money but is instead proposing that we hold him to at least some of the spending cuts that he proposed as a candidate in light of what the white house staff has been up to it seems to me they hardly deserve a raise just 18 months ago the clinton white house started out with travelgate it consisted in the firing and smearing of honest career employees in the white house for the benefit of the clintons relatives and campaign workers even the white house press corps were scandalized by such a noxious mixture of cronyism political manipulation of law enforcement and scapegoating the likes of which washington has not seen since the spoils system was first set into motion by andrew jackson all of this certainly set the tone for what we have now come to know as the prototypical clinton scandal the cornercutting the greed cronyism and above all the deceit there has been more serious misconduct by the clinton white house than travelgate but certainly nothing more contemptible than firing and smearing longtime apolitical lowlevel government workers in order to benefit the presidents cousin and his wealthiest friends no less disgraceful was the tampering with the fbi by the white house counsels office the office in which i once served as senior associate counsel to the president the white house counsel is supposed to be preeminently responsible for preventing ethical lapses by the president and senior white house officials instead it was this white house counsels office that was the very source of the scandal including flagrant qbvious misconduct by white house lawyer william kennedy who did not contact the attorney general who did not contact fbi director sessions but interfered directly in the operations of the fbi to target specific individuals yet kennedy remains in the white house two reprimands and several additional scandals later as a seemingly permanent sourceof ethical trouble for this president and the other white house staff as we all know mr kennedy like webb hubble and vince foster and hillary rodham clinton was part ofthe same law firm that represented arkansas wheeler dealers in whitewater and madison savings and loan and dozens of other transactions including the clintons own personal finances one of the most unsavory aspects of this staff arrangement is the cronyism from the first it turned the highest echelon s of the white house legal staff and the justice department into little more than the washington branch office of the kose law firm the predictable result was the president and hillary rodham clinton felt they could treat the white house lawyers as their personal lawyers bu t federal law prohibits government employees including the white house counsels office from performing private services for the president yet shortly before his death vince foster was working in his white house office in the west wing on government time at taxpayer expense at preparing the delinquent whitewater tax returns not only was this improper because it was the personal investment business of the clintons rather than official business but it also covered a period well before the clintons took office most observers who have commented on this fact have speculated on its relevance to mr fosters death as a former member of the counsels office i am at least as struck by its obvious impropriety using a fulltime government lawyer to work on the clinton familys personal business affairs is clearly improper i recall very well the extraordinary pains that for example president reagan took to ensure that none of the white house lawyers worked on his personal business his tax returns were prepared by his own private lawyers and his accountants even his blind trust which unlike the clintons was set up before his inauguration was prepared at his personal expense obviously the clinton white house does not follow the same ethical guidelines what does this mean from a budget standpoint obviously it means today in 1994 we are already paying for too much white house staff yet the size and the composition of the white house staff whose budget we are debating foday is itself another mystery the clintons have repeatedly denied requests from congress for a list of white house

literally they have norecourse to restrict the flow of solid waste coming into their communities from outofstate in 1991 20 percent of the waste disposed of in indiana came from outofstate this amounted to over 500 pounds of outofstate trash for every man woman and childover an extra bag of trash per day for the average family indiana is not a vast pit that can accept unlimited trash from other states we have our own difficulties twelve years ago indiana had 150 landfills today we have 70 by 1996 31 additional landfills will close at that time 54 indianacounties will be left without a

landfill that did receive outofstate waste but does not meet state landfill standards at landfills that are in compliance with state standards the governor may freeze outofstate municipal waste at the actual amounts received in 1991 or 1992 whichever is lower the governor may also restrict the amount of outofstate municipal waste to 30 percent of the amount received in 1991 at large landfills those that received 50 000 tons or more of outofstate waste if it represents at least 30 percent of the total waste received for 1991 in 1998 that amount can be lowered to 20 percent and to 10 percent in

includes all of west virginia and parts of 12 other states encompassing 195 000 square miles and a population of about 21 million the arc is a joint federalstate effort with the majority of the funding coming from the federal government cumulative through 1993 the federal government has spent 6 4 billion on arc development programs most experts agree that it is impossible to say for certain whether the arc has had a real impact there are signs that conditions in the appalachian region have improved according to a february 1993 arc report since 1965 percapita income has risen the percentage of people graduating from high school has more than doubled and the infant mortality rate is now down to the national average perhaps most tellingly the percentage of people living below the poverty line is down from around 30 to 15 2 percentvirtually equal to the national average of 14 5 percent it certainly sounds as if the arc has met its goal of addressing the disparate poverty levels in this region of the united states compared to the rest of the nation but within the federal government there are numerous examples of temporary commissions lasting for decades programs that have outlived their original purpose but continue to survive for political reasons and those that are simply wasteful the arc has not been authorized for over 10 yearssince 1982 and other multistate

that it is time to fold the t ent at the arcat least the federal component of itand move on the remaining economic hardship in the appalachian region is comparable to other areas of the country that do not receive such targeted assistance and in an era where the deft cit is hovering around 200 billion and the debt is 4 3 trillion and climbing we cannot really afford to continue funding programs like the arc cbo estimates that eliminating the arc will save some 1 4 billion in budget authority and 690 million in outlays over 5 years the concord coalition citizens against government waste the heritage foundation and other independent groups all have called for this programs termination while making these cuts alone will not put an end to deficit spending it is a positive first step towards
