access to affordable quality health care since the time of president harry truman h r 3962 represents a critical milestone in the effort to reform our health care system for those who have it health insurance is not something you can take for granted every day 14 000 americans lose their health insurance coverage a recent unitedstates treasury department report noted that approximately half of all americans under the age of 65 will lose their health insurance coverage at some point over the next ten years thousands are denied coverage because of preexisting conditions like asthma pregnancy arthritis or diabetes millions more have no health insurance at all including 54 000 people who live in hawaiis second congressional district in his health care speech before congress and the nation president obama appealed to the best part of usto act unselfishly and to put ourselves in the shoes of others he asked us to imagine what it must be like for those who dont have insuranceto live in a state of helplessness should illness strike you or the ones you love h r 3962 is a bill that will provide for comprehensive health care reform that will protect consumers hold insurance companies accountable rein in health care costs reduce the deficit and cover 36 million uninsured americans in supporting this bill i want to highlight three key points first for hawaii the bill includes the hirono amendment that provides an exemption for hawaiis prepaid health care act of 1974 which is our nations first and only employer mandate law of its kind second the bill will provide health insurance coverage for an unprecedented number of americans while still reducing our deficit and third the bill strengthens and improves the medicare program for our seniors first there is a mistaken perception that everything and everyone in hawaii is exempted under h r 3962 that is not so the hirono amendment only exempts hawaiis prepaid health care act phca and those who come under it certain fulltime employees and their employers phca does not apply to parttime employees seniors on medicare those without health insurance government employees or those covered by collective bargaining agreements therefore h r 3962 would apply to them i know it is easier to talk in terms of the state of hawaii being exempt from the bill but that is wrong the distinction between phca being exempt and the whole state being exempt is a critical distinction to make phca requires employers to contribute at least 50 percent of the premium cost for single health care coverage and the employee must contribute the balance provided the employees share does not exceed 1 5 percent of his or her wages because of rising health care costs hawaii employers on average cover 94 percent of the premium cost because of the second part of hawaiis law limiting employees share hawaii employers may cover the full cost of the health insurance premium and many do cover 100 percent of the cost of single coverage h r 3962 would require employers to cover 72 5 percent of premium costs for single health care coverage hawaii consistently ranks among the highest nationally in terms of insurance coverage and lowest in regard to the number of uninsured this is largely due to phca private and public health insurance cover an estimated 92 percent of our population of 1 3 million people of those with private insurance 93 percent are covered through employmentbased plans lawrence boyd an economist at the university of hawaii estimates that per capita health expenditures in hawaii are seven percent lower than the national average dr boyd believes that wider health insurance coverage and support for preventive health care lead to this outcome the hirono amendment will provide maximum flexibility for hawaii once a federal health care reform bill becomes law hawaii will be able to decide for itself to retain phca or come completely under the new federal law second h r 3962 will ensure that 96 percent of americans will have health insurance coverage the nonpartisan congressional budget office cbo estimates that the cost of enacting h r 3962 will be 894 billion consistent with the 900 billion limit established by president obama the bill is fully paid for about half of the cost of h r 3962 is paid for by targeting waste fraud and inefficiency in the federal medicaid and medicare programs the other roughly half of the cost of the bill is paid for through a surcharge on the wealthiest americansthose with incomes above 1 million for couples and 500 000 for singles therefore 99 7 percent of americans will not be touched by this surtax while h r 3962 will be paid for cbo also estimates that the bill reduces the deficit by over 100 billion in the first 10 years and continues to reduce the deficit in subsequent years leading economists from educational institutions across our nation have concurred with cbos findings and support the idea that health care reform promotes our countrys economic health finally i want to address the importance of health care reform to seniors some of the most damaging misinformation that has circulated over the past several months on health care reform is the use of scare tactics targeted at seniors the cynical irony is that the misinformation targeting seniors is largely perpetuated by the same people who fought the establishment of medicare and wanted to privatize social security the truth is that h r 3962 will lower prescription drug costs for people in the doughnut hole give the secretary of health and human services the authority to negotiate lower drug prices on behalf of medicare beneficiaries and extend the solvency of the medicare trust fund by five years closing the doughnut hole is an especially critical issue for hawaii as we have the nations largest percentage36 percent compared with 26 percentof medicare beneficiaries who fall into this gap of prescription drug coverage in its first year h r 3962 will reduce the doughnut hole by 500 per beneficiary provide a 50 percent discount on brandname prescription drugs and phase out the doughnut hole by 2019 it is remarkable that in just the past two days over 300 groups representing americans from all walks of lifedoctors farmers seniors consumers cancer and diabetes patientshave rejected the unsustainable status quo and have endorsed h r 3962 in its endorsement of the bill consumers unionpublisher of the independent nonpartisan consumer reportscalled the health care status quo a consumer crisis with its crippling costs its unreliability and lack

an effort to strike a balance between extending important lifesaving assistance to laidoff workers and investing in smart spending that will help our economy a significant portion of the bill would go directly to helping our citizens we extend unemployment insurance we invest in summer jobs fund loans for small businesses and make bonds available to states but i am pleased that the bill also cracks down on corporations closing tax loopholes that have encouraged companies to ship jobs overseas a thing i have devoutly desired for a number of years unlike the previous administration we use paygo rules here to make sure that new spending other than emergency spending is fully paid for in fact its worthy to remind my colleagues that the deficit facing the country was created by the last administration which financed two wars a prescription drug plan and a huge tax cut all of which was unpaid for and consequently is responsible for twothirds of the deficit in the recent frenzied back and forth over this bill it is easy to lose sight of the important steps that congress has taken up to this point to help right the economy we passed small business tax relief expanded the firsttime

vote we can help families across the country continue the path we set out on last year to help dig the country out of a terrible recession for small businesses the backbone of the nations economy and the place where most american workers are employed we use this bill to ensure them an easier time getting loans the bill also continues the very successful research and development tax credit a powerful incentive to creating wellpaying jobs the measure extends the ongoing recovery by investing in build america bonds and recovery zone bonds making it less expensive for cashstrapped state and local governments to finance the rebuilding of schools and sewers and hospitals and transit projects the legislation helps american families with sales tax relief property tax relief disaster area tax relief and college tuition deductions the bill wisely invests in important energy provisions such as the biodiesel tax credit while making good on our obligations to black and native american farmers finally the measure also strengthens the oil spill liability trust fund by increasing the amount the oil industry must pay to clean up its disasters i also want to pause for a moment to talk about two pieces of legislation that i personally am happy to see in the bill because i think theyll pay enormous benefits this bill closes a loophole in the tax code that has been used by huge corporations including publicly regulated utilities companies use this loophole to avoid paying millions of dollars in taxes when they spin off a subsidiary these deals cost taxpayers and they hurt consumers especially when the company using the loophole is a phone company that wants to get rid of the older telephone lines in small towns and rural areas with this bill we close that loophole and we will save taxpayers 260 million over the next 10 years on another front the bill also extends funding for the wool trust fund which helps to keep thousands of textile and apparel workers around the country employed i was proud to work on this issue because of the relevance it has to hickey freeman a 100yearold company and maker of fine mens suits located in rochester new york the fund provides funds to makers of wool fabric and yarn producers as well as sheep growers to help maintain the domestic production of wool fabric too many of our industries in the united states have closed up and moved overseas i frequently say that we cant be a great power if our entire manufacturing sector moves to other countries and we are obligated to buy from other countries for our very livelihood congress can rightly take great pride in some very historic work on behalf of our constituents this year but we must remind ourselves that many people are still struggling and we must do everything in our

eight times on the campaign trail that health care negotiations would be televised and transparent unfortunately we havent seen anything that even remotely resembles this rhetoric it is outrageous

causes millions of employers to cancel the health insurance they currently offer and creates a health care czar to impose price controls on private health insurance what is even more disconcerting about this bill is that congress and the administration has decided to plow ahead with this before addressing the tragic employment rate that continues to cripple many communities across the nation

pathlet me just remind you that the con way out of poverty and an opportunity gressional black caucus has histori for all cally been knowa as the conscience of we also unfortunately in the last the congress and we recognize that few years have watched company after the dignity of all human beings is ex company cut their benefits and mil tremely important in our work to close lions more americans now as i said thesesome of us call it these moral earlier have lost their health insurgaps that exist these disparities and ance and their retirement plans and tonight of course were talking about pension plans have fallen unfortujobs employment and unemployment nately off the table the last administration has left us and our nation in shambles and it is really critical that we come together to begin the work of providing opportunities for all in america and ending this spiral of poverty that is spiraling downward unfortunately with millions more people in this situation we have got to expand and extend the proven antipoverty programs that were included in the american recovery and reinvestment act like expanding access to the child tax credit and the earned income tax credit we have to maintain support for the vital extensions of unemployment insurance and cobra health insurance millions of americans need these subsidies while millions of americans continue to face job loss and extended periods of unemployment these are stopgap measures but this has to be seen as necessary just to stop the hemorrhaging and give people some relief so they can survive and sustain them selves until the jobs that we are working so hard to create are created we have got to maintain support for and invest in education and job training programs as congresswoman fudge talked about earlier and fully support initiatives such as the affordable housing trust fund and the neighborhood stabilization program which our colleague congresswoman maxine waters who chairs the housing and opportunity subcommitte6 of the financial services committee worked so hard with the congressional black caucus upport to bring some stability to our hardesthit communities but we all know we have to do more we need to raise and index the minimum wage so that every working person can be assured that they will earn a wage that will lift them up and out of poverty each and every year without having to rely on legislation to keep up with increases in the cost of living yes we increased the minimum wage several years ago but i believe like many of my colleagues believe that we must support and find ways to provide for a living wage raising the minimum wage is not enough we also must ensure access to early childhood education guarantee a quality public education for every american student and make sure thatevery working family has access to affordable quality child care again why is child care so important well we have millions of women millions of single moms and single men who want to work but they cant afford the child care so we cannot look at creating jobs without understanding we must provide for the job training and child care assistance so that they can really afford to get a job and will not have to worry about their young people also and oftentimes we forget this there are millions of men now that we call in my community formerly incarcerated individuals who have been released from jail we know that the recidivism rate is very high and part of h6302 co the reason is because there is very little employment for these individuals so we have to provide support for our reentry initiatives i am very proud of the fact that congressman danny davis a member of the congressional black caucus from illinois continues to work on behalf of those who would not have this second chance we passed the second chance act a couple of years ago but we must fully fund this so that we can provide for that job training and those jobs for fbrmerly incarcerated individuals also our disconnected youth we have young people who need jobs many families now because of the fact that mothers and fathers are unemployed oftentimes young people have to help and they deserve to be able to get a job too so we have to fully fund and support summer job programs for our young people which i am very proud of the fact that president obama speaker pelosi and all of our leadership here our majority whip mr clyburn supported with the economic recovery package to make sure we have funding in there for our summer jobs program for youth also access to health care some of us believe and i know many of us in the congressional black caucus believe that health care should not be a privilege it is a basic right it is a basic right and as we begin health care debate again we cannot forget that closing health care disparities in communities of color must be part of any health care reform package otherwise those communities those individuals who have historically been discriminated against in our health care system and really that is what has happened over the years it has lieen discrimination they deserve to have some of these gaps closed so this has to be part of again a comprehensive approach to job creation and employment so let me just conclude by saying that during this economic crisis we think that we have to see this also as an opportunity to make the changes that we seek some of the systemic changes that we seek to guarantee access to health care to guarantee and ensure fair and adequate housing for all and to provide topflight education for all of our children and support the growth of the new green living wage economy that will carry america into the 21st century we have to support the employee free choice act because many of us in the african american community know if it hadnt been for labor unions many of our families would not have become middle income so the right to organize the right to participate and to be in a union is essential because when we are talking about jobs we are not just talking about a job but we are talking about a job with justice jobs with good pay with benefits with a pension with health care the type of a job that any american deserves so this employee free choice act is an"], [0.00021650483540724963, 0.00021650483540724963, 0, "i rise in support of this bill and actually its one of the very few truly

secondly even as to the tarp heres my difference the minority leader came to the well and said tarp was passed to be an emergency bill and the emergency is over you cannot directly address a member so let me say will someone tell the minority leader it aint over until its over on main street all throughout america maybe when the republicans had that meeting with a group of financial lobbyists they took some time out to celebrate the ending of an emergency but most of us know the emergency is not over i didnt say aint again the emergency continues and heres what the administration has proposed under the bush administrationand i voted for tarp i thought that the lack of regulation created a crisis but the big banks got the first tarp money we are now finally succeeding in getting tarp money for smaller banks who can do community lending and small business lending we voted today to take 3 billion and give it as loans to people who cant pay their mortgages because theyre unemployed not people who got mortgages they shouldnt have gotten not subprime mortgages hardworking people who cant pay a mortgage the 3 billion would go for that to help them avoid foreclosure and they can pay it back when they get the job thats gone so the antisocial parts of tarp are okay and now they want to get rid of the other parts by the way who are they saving money for here their friends the big banks the original tarp legislation said at the end of the day any tarp shortfall will be made up by an assessment on the financial community weve gone further than that the amendment we adopted over republican opposition by the gentleman from michigan instructs the fdic in this bill that they want to kill not surprisingly to assess the financial institutions to make up any shortfall from the tarp they kill that they complained before about our assessment they are very upset that we might levy on jpmorgan chase and morgan stanley and goldman sachs and the others some responsibility financially for whats gone on so heres what they do first of all they kill all reform and their pretense that they are for a different form of it they deliberately left it out of their bill they were just playing it they secondly say now that tarp money has gone to the big banksand they dont have to pay it back by the way under this bill necessarilyand we are trying to use it socially to encourage lending to give it to community banks with some requirement they lend to help people who are unemployed avoid having foreclosure until they get their jobs back now they want to get rid of it and to whose benefit the big banks the question is should we use tarp money to give to the small banks for community banking should we use tarp money to help people avoid unemployment or should we do what they want to do and give it back so that the big financial institutions arent assessed thats whats at risk here not the taxpayers the taxpayers are not on the hook for this tarp money the large financial institutions are and i know what they say it will be a restriction in capital well i think capitals a good thing but to the extent that capital was misused for speculation that it was misused for unleveraged credit default swaps then a little reining in is a good thing but once again heres what you have a bill a motion that says lets not do anything to change the financial system lets let companies go bankrupt and not worry about them lets not have anything about derivatives lets just do nothing and instead lets save the big banks from having to pay their fair share when the tarp is repaid"],

considerable sized businesses i have a sister who runs a small business and my father was an entrepreneur who developed a business not once not once did ever any of them or i my father included ever

million and a half dollars small business person entrepreneur making a million and a half dollars and this bill is enacted now heres the way i look at it somebody comes to me and says im going to make you a deal youre a charitable guy for 30 000 im going to allow you to say that you insured 32 million people that you saved 18 000 lives a year that you prevented 700 000 bankruptcies in this country that you allowed small businesses to provide insurance for your employees and employees of small businesses around the country because they are 60 percent of all the uninsured in the country and id say thats a pretty good deal i make charitable contributions that were a lot less effective than that this is a good deal for small business people and let me tell you why a small businessperson right now is facing premium increases across the country 20 30 40 percent those are the types of things that really impede a small businessnot a small incremental tax increase on their personal income when youre talking about premium increases of 30 and 40 percent youre dramatically changing the way you do business plus youre being put in the position of forcing your employees to pay more for their coverage or else dropping their coverage altogether which means some of those employees arent going to be able to continue to work for you theyre going to have to find a job with a big company that has a group plan no this is the greatest step forward for small businesses in the countrys history i tell you i was in a small business with about 25 employees we had a very young very healthy group of employees except for one person we had a woman who had cancer what happened to our insurance premiums every year 15 20 percent because of her misfortune everybody else in the company suffered thats what we face now i talked to a businessman in my district not too long ago he has 110 employees i said whats going on with your health insurance he said well funny you should ask last year we had two people that had pretty serious illnesses our first quote for renewal was a 75 percent increase we negotiated that down to 38 percent but we had to increase everybodys copays and everybodys deductibles and we had to ask everybody to come out of pocket a little more money so heres the situation two employees get sick and 108 others have their standard of living diminished that shouldnt happen in

innocent victims of medical malpractice one recent study showed that medical malpractice represents less than onethird of one percent of all health care costs and yet the republican substitute seeks to blame our broken health care insurance system on innocent victims of medical malpractice for those victims the bill limits the ability to hire a lawyer complicates the lawsuit shifts the costs of medical malpractice from the doctor to the victims own private insurance and in some cases causes the injured victims to lose the right to sue before they even know theyve been injured id like to share some specific examples of the egregious provisions included in the republican substitute under the republican substitute a young child whose life is forever devastated by medical malpractice can lose all right to sue on his or her eighth birthdaylong before he or she reaches legal age to make his or her own decision under the republican substitute when two or more wrongdoers act together and one of them is able to flee or put their assets out of reach the innocent victim is left short while the other wrongdoer is shielded from full responsibility they call this the fair share rule under the republican substitute it is more difficult for a medical malpractice victim to get a lawyers help to fight against the insurance companies because the bill permits a court to reduce the fee paid to the victims lawyerafter the case has been fought and won this provision penalizes victims with winning cases one would think the purpose of this provision is to save the insurance carrier money and thereby reduce malpractice premiums however insurance carriers are not responsible for the victims lawyers fee insurance carriers are responsible for the defendants lawyers fee so permitting the court to reduce fees paid to defendants lawyers would actually save money and reduce premiums the substitute does not allow that this makes no sense under current practice the victims lawyers already dont get paid if the victim loses now they might not get paid even if the victim wins under the republican substitute if the victim has health insurance that helps pay for the victims care while the victim is waiting for the wrongdoer to be held accountable the wrongdoer can escape legal accountability for that part of the cost entirely the wrongdoer gets to shift the cost onto the victims own health insurance thats the republican approach to health insurance reformsaddling the victims insurer with the cost of someone elses negligence while letting the wrongdoer off the hook under the republican substitute the only time punitive damages would ever be available is when the wrongdoer has maliciously injured the victim that is when the wrongdoer has committed a violent felony and even theneven
