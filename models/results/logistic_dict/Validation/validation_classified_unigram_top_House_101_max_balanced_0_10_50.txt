grains is the product of thousands of hours of public hearings in virtually every comer of this country over the past 4 years i have served as chairman of the subcommittee this title will continue to support feed grain and livestock producers in their efforts to produce for our national wellbeing this title contains the best features of the 1985 food security act and makes refinements the subcommittee deemed necessary to make the programs more responsive to market conditions correct inequities in existing programs and provides new incentives for the production of oats to decrease unitedstates reliance on imports the united states is the worlds largest producer and consumer of corn the leading feed grain in the world equally important to the livestock and food sector are sorghum barley and oats altogether these crops contribute at least 14 billion annually to the economy grown on over 600 000 farms corn production is a 12 billion per year industry each american consumes the equivalent of over 1 100 bushels of corn annually primarily in the form of meat livestock products and corn byproducts eighty percent of all livestock feed for cattle hogs and poultry is corn high fructose corn syrup is one of the fastest growing uses of corn accounting for nearly 15 percent of corn us and are projected to continue growing by as much as 3 percent annually over 1 billion additional bushels of corn are used each year for a variety of industrial purposes beverage alcohol and increasingly for the production of ethanol as an extender and additive to gasoline for motor vehicles which constitutes slightly under 5 percent of all corn usage in addition to the domestic market unitedstates corn growers supply more than 70 percent of the corn traded in world markets the united states produces onethird of all the grain sorghum grown in the word most of it concentrated in the southern and central plains states on some 100 000 farms grain sorghum also known as milo has a farm value of over 1 billion annually unitedstates sorghum exports represent over 75 percent of all world sorghum trade the most prevalent use of mile is as a livestock feed approximately 98 percent of all mile used domestically is for feed primarily for cattle barley production is concentrated in the pacific northwest and northern plains sixty percent of the annual barley crop is used for feed for dairy and beef cattle another 30 percent of the crop is used by malters for the production of beer the remainder of the crop is exported the value of the unitedstates barley crop exceeded 900 million in 1987 ranking barley ninth of field crops prior to the two drought reduced crops of 1988 and 1989 an important feature of the barley market is the distinction between feed barley and malting barley high quality barley used for malting purposes can be produced only from certain barley varieties and the grain itself must also possess certain quality characteristics to be acceptable to malters for example adverse conditions during the growing season can frequently diminish the quality of the grain to the point it is unsuitable for use in beer the principal domestic use of oats is for livestock feed and a specialty feed for race horses recent studies indicating that certain fibrous plant materials such as oat bran may help lower serum cholesterol levels have led to a tremendous increase in human consumption of oatmeal oat cookies oat pancakes and any other food containing oats you can think of in 1989 alone food seed and industrial uses increased by 10 percent 110 million bushels which account for onefourth of total use despite this increase in demand farmers have not increased their plantings of oats which have average around 6 million acres per year since 1986 as a result the united states has become the largest importer of oats importing 60 million bushels in 1989 alone compared to an average of only 3 million bushels for the past 20 years a major cause for downward production trends of oats is the structure of farm programs since 1982 the program acreage bases for oats and barley have been combined into a common oats and barley acreage base on this base a farmer could plant any combination of oats and barley because the target price for barley gave farmers a greater return than did the oats target price barley production has increased at the expense of oats production oats acreage also declined as a result the enrollment of 1 million acres of oats acreage into the longterm conservation reserve program feed grain production in the united states continues to be a highly volatile and variable industry in spite of technological advances which have resulted in more efficient production techniques the production of feed grains continues to be subject to the vagaries of weather macroeconomic variables and changes in international trading patterns this title is designed to provide the feed grains industry the economic stability and predictability it will need to meet domestic and international demand in years to come the legislation does so in three ways first by continuing a system of stable income supports for feed grains producers second by amending the operation of the feed grains program to balance between food security needs and feeding needs export demand and price supports and third by providing for a closer relationship between supplies and demand for feed grains and production adjustment provisions of the feed grains programs as my subcommittee on wheat soybeans and feed grains traveled across the country last year most of the farmers we talked to agreed that the 1985 farm bill should be continued to a large extent it was a bill that provided stability and predictability to farmers suffedng through the most difficult decade since the dustbowl days in response to their request the committees legislation extends through the 1995 crops the same level of income support as in place for the 1990 crop of corn milo and oats unlike the 1985 act which provided for a gradually declining amount of income support for feed grains producers over 5 years the committees legislation stabilizes income support levels some contend that income supports should be phased out with price supports but as senator hubert humphrey said 14 years ago we cannot leave food security to chance farmers need to know that they will make some return on their investment so that they will be able to renew their investment in the land next year some will argue that the income support provided under this bill is not sufficient well time will tell but a least it provides them with more stability than what is offered at the market place a stable agricultural sector means a stable supply of food at reasonable prices for all americans farmers who agree to participate in the annual program for feed grains will be eligible to receive payments equal to the difference between 2 75 for corn andfor milo feed barley and oats comparable amounts based on the feed value relationships of those crops to cornthe higher of the average market price for the crop during the first 6 months of the marketing year or the amount per bushel of price support loans farmers are eligible to receive for the crop in response to the barley problem that was brought to the subcommittees attention over the past year the committees legislation corrects inequities due to the melding together of feeding and malting bariey prices in income support calculations prices for malting barley generally run about 20 cents per bushel over feeding barley but in some years such as 1988 the spread between malting barley and feed barley increased to as much as 2 per bushel the 1985 act established an income support level derived from the feed energy value of barley to com accordingly all barley received equal income support in spite of the distinct end uses of malting and feed barley however actual income support payments under the 1985 act were computed based on a sales weighted average market price which included both types of barley as a result as spreads between malting barley and feeding barley increased as they did during the drought years of 1988 and 1989 feed barley growers were at a distinct disadvantage so much so that growers had to repay some income support payments even though market prices for feed barley never reached target price levels to eliminate the possibility of such inequities in the future the committees bill applies a target price for the 1991 through 1995 crops of barley equal to the level of income support in place for the 1990 crop 2 36 per bushel in addition the bill eliminates the average market price of malt barley in the determination of income support payments ensuring the feed barley producers are not treated adversely due to market price movements for malt barley which may be totally unrelated to market prices for feed barley to help curb the trend of importing oats and to spur production the committees legislation continues provisions of the 1985 act which permit farmers to devote all of a farms crop acreage base to oats production without penalty or eilgibility for future program benefits planting oats as a cover crop on acreage idled under other annual commodity programs is a good way to protect idled land so it is not surprising that may farmers practice this however over the past 5 years farmers have been prevented from harvesting those oats for grain in spite of the fact that the united states imports approximately 50 to 60 million bushels of oats annually to address this problem h r 3950 bill allow farmers to harvest oats planted on idled acreage in those years the secretary determines that domestic oats production will not meet expected domestic demand as a further incentive to increase domestic production the secretary is given the authority to make oats program payments on oats planted on idled acreage another concern that farmers around the country wanted the committee to address was the calculation of nonrecourse loan rates known as price supports under the annual programs farmers mayreceive from the department of agriculture a loan equal to the amount of feed grains produced on the farm multiplied by the loan rate in effect for that crop the 1985 act established the level of the loan rate between 75 and 85 percent of the average market price of corn for the preceding 5 years except that the year to year reduction could not exceed 5 percent however the bill also permitted the secretary to lower that rate an additional 20 percent if such an adjustment were necessary in the eyes of the secretary to maintain the competitiveness of unitedstates corn and other feed grains in world markets this loan rate calculation which has lowered loan rates to to unprecedented levels was created to curb several problems associated with very high loan rates which existed between 1981 and 1985 to a certain extent these high loan rates caused unitedstates producers to lose market share very quickly between 1981 and 1985 com exports dropped by nearly onehalf from a high of 2 4 billion bushels per year to just over 1 billion bushels as foreign production and foreign exports expanded also high loan rates encouraged farmers to forfeit their grain which resulted in the ccc owning by the end of the 1985 marketing year nearly 5 billion bushels of corn in response congress directed the secretary in the 1985 farm bill to drop price support loan levels but in no way encouraged him to drop them the maximum extent possible for each crop year 1990 the reduction in loan rates resulted in lower prices for unitedstates feed grains in the world market produced greater risk for foreign farmers and was partly responsible for the ability of unitedstates farmers to recapture approximately 70 percent of the world corn market by 1990 however at the same time reduction inthese loan levels placed additional financial pressures on farmers who use the loans to defary production and harvesting costs and as marketing tools to enable them to market their crops later in the marketing year following harvest season price lows i want to emphasize this latter point producers all over the country i believe understand why it is so important to have reasonable loan rates to be competitive in important export markets however farmers expressed to me that current loan rates are too low because they do not provide them with enough upfront cash to meet immediate operational expenses during post harvest price lows the only reason loan rates were established in the first place was to provide low interest loans to farmers waiting for market prices to improve if they are not meeting this basic objective then something is wrong in response the legislation the committee has developed brings better balance between price support levels and supply and demand under the committee bill the primary determinant for establishing the loan rate for corn and other feed grains continues to be the average market prices of the crops this level is set at 85 percent of the average market price for the preceding five crops excluding the highest and lowest annual prices thus ensuring that feed grains loan levels will be set at rates fair and reasonable to market prices and not interfere with the competitiveness of unitedstates crops in addition the secretary is given authority to make further adjustments in the loan rates based on stocks on hand providing for further refinements in the price support level for feed grains based on annual market conditions if the supply of corn will exceed 25 percent of use the secretary may lower the effective loan level by 10 percent if the stockstouse ratio is below 25 percent but 12 percent or more the loan rate may be adjusted downward by 5 percent and if the stockstouse ratio is under 12 percent the loan rate may not be adjusted further in addition the secretary may further adjust the loan level for feed grains downward an additional 5 percent without regard to the level of stocks on hand if he determines that such a further reduction is needed to keep unitedstates feed grains competitively priced in the world market to ensure the judicious use of this authority the legislation requires that if the secretary determines to make such reductions in the loan level then the secretary must transmit to congress notice of such action for review by the agriculture committees and must certify that the reductions are warranted based on market conditions in addition the legislation provides that if loan levels are reduced under these circumstances the secretary compensate by making payments based on the average market price for the entire marketing year feed grains producers for the reductions and such reductions are not factored into the setting of loan levels for subsequent crops accoriing to projected market prices at the time of h r 3950s development the effect of this change to the loan rate calculation is to increase projected loan levels as much as 25 percent over the life of the legislation from the levels at which they would be set if the formula of the 1985 act were continued for another 5 years while this change will ensure that loan rates are determined with greater consideration for market conditions and the financing needs of farmers the changes made in the legislation will not interfere with the cornpotitiveness of unitedstates feed grains the stability of the production of teed grains is further enhanced under the committees action on changing the annual acreage limitation requirements in developing the legislalion just as the comrttee revised the determination of annual loan levels to be more sensitive to market conditions the committee revised the calculation of annual acreage timitation factors under the legislation the amount of feed grains acreage participating produces must idle will be determined by the amount of corn projected to be on hand if stocks are projected to exceed 25 percent of use the secretary would be required to establish a limitation of not less than 12 percent nor more than 20 percent for each farm for years when corn stocks ae projected to be under 20 percent the acreage limitation factor may not exceed 12 percent i feel confident that the changes the committee has made in this title will benefit farmers and consumers alike i am confident that it will provide farmers with the predictability and stability they need to produce for a nation so reliant on them also i think that this title provides predictability and stability to the livestock sector so that it may continue providing meat to us at reasonable prices"], [0.0002613365650177002,

in el salvador and in particular the brutal murder of the jesuit priests last week we cannot pass the foreign appropriations bill as if nothing has happened since that bill was first markedup in committee as several members have pointed out today we may not have all the facts to properly assign blame for every individual crime and atrocity committed in el salvador over the past few weeks but it is abundantly clear by the sheor level and severity of the carnage that there are no saints in this conflict that there are no heros in el salvador except the longsuffering salvadoran people caught between extremists of the right and the left it is extraordinarily clear that there is no side in this conflict deserving of our unreserved support this is a modest amendment to gile us some control over the enormous sums we are pouring into el salvador in support of the government forces i would have preferred to see far stronger action by the house and at ari earlier date we should have fenced el salvador aid in response to the rising human rights violations by the government and the increasing death squad activity that has been extensively documented by respected human rights organizations thfs year instead it has taken the sickening death of six priests and two women to galvanize support for some very limited aid restrictions americans underwrite a larger portion of el salvadors budget than we do for any other country we have a right to know how our aid is spent at a minimum it is incumbent upon us to demand that human rights violators largely funded by the unitedstates foreign aid

were trying to ask for here about a week2 weeks ago from the committee on rules was a degree of fairness we went to the committee on rules with a package that had 410 billion worth of deficit reduction over 5 years so there never was any real question about whether it was enforceable because we did not put any new taxes in and we were denied the opportunity to bring this to the house floor it was not a money package it was a package that was printed out and costed out by the cbo and the omb and it had 410 billion in cuts we were told that we would not have an opportunity to offer that package for the simple reason that we did not reach the 500 billion in deficit reduction tonight we are going to vote on a package that is also not going to reach the 500 billion package but yet this package is made in order i understand that it is very diffcult when time comes to try to move something sometimes we cannot get caught by the details however this is really a question of fairness here we have a group of people who worked together for a long period of time on this side of the aisle who produced a responsible alternative that did not raise the taxes on the american people we stood up to the plate and we made the hard cuts that were demanded of members we reached 410 billion and they said no however tonight just a short week later we come to the floor and now the 500 billion has been changed baseball season is over but if this was baseball season last week we only got 2 outs and this week they get 4 outs that just is not fair now why are we operating here at 2 oclock in the morning first of all the reason we are operating here at 2 oclock in the morning is because those who support this package are fighting a war of attrition basically they just hope every person will fall asleep or fall over before the time comes to vote and there will be enough people standing who will vote for their package i will not fall asleep i will vote against the package if for no other reason than the fact that we did not have an opportunity to offer our alternative however what the gentleman from pennsylvania pointed out a few minutes ago is mindboggling in the first year 109 billion in additional spending paid for by 106 billion in additional revenues with a deficit of 34 billion if the american people knew this and knew that we were doing it at 2 oclock in the morning
