couple where both the husband and wife are both in the workforce a married working couple with a twoincome household pay higher taxes under our tax code than an identical couple with identical income who choose to live together outside of marriage is it right is it fair is it fair that under our tax code that 25 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married of course not the goal of this legislation i am proud to say is to wipe out the marriage tax penalty almost entirely for 25 million married working couples i think it is pretty fiscally responsible to take onehalf of 1 percent of a 2 2 trillion surplus to eliminate the marriage tax penalty to listen to my friends on the other side of the aisle you think we would be breaking their piggy bank to take onehalf of 1 percent of a 2 2 trillion surplus to help 25 million married working couples who pay higher taxes jut because they are married i for one and i am pleased to say that 222 republicans and we were joined by 48 democrats who broke with their leadership who believe it is time to eliminate the narriage tax penalty that this house has voted to send to the senate today we are voting on theagreement between the house and the senate we hope the president will join with us to eliminate the marriage tax penalty let me introduce a couple of constituents from the south suburbs of chicago which i represent shad and michelle hallihan they are public school teachers shad is at joliet high school and michelle is at manhattan junior high school their combined incomes are about 62 000 they pay just around 1 000 in marriage tax penalty just because they are married under our tax code now this photo was taken when they were married it was about the time we introduced our legislation about 2 years ago since then shad and michelle have had a little boy little ben and little ben of course is this little guy we hope some day he does not have to pay the marriage tax penalty our hope is for his parents we can eliminate it this year i would point out under this legislation we provide middleclass tax relief for middleclass couples like shad and michelle hallihan this year because our legislation is effective january 1 of 2000 so if the president would join with us to eliminate the marriage tax penalty for 25 million married working couples shad and michelle hallihan would see their marriage tax penalty eliminated this year now under our legislation we do several things we double the standard deduction for those who do not itemize to 8 800 twice that for single filers we also widen the 15 percent bracket to help those who do itemize shad and michelle hallihan are also homeowners and because they are homeowners they itemize their taxes and the only way to help people middleclass families who own a home or give to church or charity or their synagogue is to widen the 15 percent bracket so that they too can receive marriage tax relief under our proposal we eliminate the marriage tax penalty suffered by shad and michelle hallihan think about it in joliet illinois the marriage tax penalty of 1 400 the average marriage tax penalty is one years tuition at our local community college it is 3 months of day care for little ben at a local child care center in joliet it is 3 000 diapers for little ben but it is also if we also think about it if shad and michelle had that money that they currently pay in the marriage tax penalty were able to set it aside in an education savings account for little ben by the time ben is 18 they would have been able to set aside almost 20 000 that they currently send to uncle sam they could put in little bens college fund that is what marriage tax relief means for the hallihans now we have heard a lot of excuses from our good friends on the other side let us do just a little bit so we can say we have done something we have other priorities we want to spend it on but think about this one half of 1 percent of a 2 2 trillion surplus is being given back to middleclass working married couples like shad and michelle hallihan so they can take that marriage tax penalty that currently goes to washington gets spent on other things and use it to take care of their families needs little ben in particular so let us do the fiscally responsible thing let us help middleclass workingmarried couples who suffer the marriage tax penalty there are 25 million of them that is almost 50 million taxpayers who pay higher taxes just because they made the choice of getting married my hope is the

budget now he takes credit for it he was opposed to welfare reform now he takes credit for it my hope is the president will join with us and sign the elimination of the marriage tax penalty the

opportunity to balance the budget without spending one penny of seniors social security trust fund for nearly 4 decades the raid on social security has gone on taking over 850 billion in social security funds and spending them on unrelated government programs 168 days ago just over 5 months this house passed my social security lockbox legislation by an overwhelming 416 to 12 vote the passage of this social security lockbox legislation showed that house republicans and democrats agree that social security dollars should not be spent on programs unrelated to social security congress made the commitment to stop the raid on social security shortly later however president clinton joined our bipartisan effort and committed the administration to protecting social security that was over 5 months ago unfortunatelyv i am afraid today is a different story while house republicans are continuing to honor our steadfast commitment to protect seniors social security i have great concerns about the recent actions of the clintongore white house and congressional democrats the current budget situation requires that every increase in spending be offset currently if spending is not offset it is drawn directly from seniors social security dollars over the past few weeks president clinton has vetoed five appropriations bills because he says they do not spend enough yet the president has not offered a single solid proposal to pay for those spending increases it appears the president may be willing to spend social security dollars to pay for his spending projects congress and the president are faced with a very clear choice ask federal agencies to save one penny just one penny of a dollar in waste fraud or abuse so we can protect social security or give in to the big washington spenders and raid seniors social security dollars amazingly enough there are still people in washington that do not believe the federal government can tighten its belt by just 1 percent but the american people know the truth a recent poll conducted by the national taxpayers union revealed let me show my colleagues this poll revealed that over 84 percent of americans believe that there is not just 1 percent waste in government but they felt there was at least 5 percent of waste in unneeded spending in the federal spending surely if 84 percent of the american people believe that there is at least 5 percent of waste the president and the congress can work together to find just 1 percent or one penny of waste in order to protect social security dollars so many seniors so many seniors rely upon let me present my colleagues with some examples of waste fraud and abuse that we have found in the federal government the national park service spent 1 million to build an outhouse at glacier national park in montana the expense was explained by the outhouses remote location the outhouse is located nearly 7 miles from the nearest road and it took hundreds of horse trips and more than 800 helicopter drops to get the construction materials to the site another one erroneous medicare payments that waste over 20 billion annually another the department of education maintains a 725 million slush fund which it cannot account for the department of housing and urban development hud estimated it spent 857 million in 1998 in erroneous rent subsidy payments in fiscal year 1998 about 5 percent of the entire program budget let me close with this for a moment and that is delays in disposing of more than 41 000 hud properties cost taxpayers more than 1 million per day these are all examples of how congress and the president can find one penny 1 percent out of a dollar in waste fraud and abuse in the federal government we are all in this together we want to work with the president and vice president gore to find this 1 percent so that we can protect social security dollars we will not however under any circumstances allow the clintongore administration to dip into the social security

dakota has said is right the majority has never felt good about medicare as my friend has said in 1965 when medicare came into being there really wasnt a need for prescription drugs because prescription drugs were in their infancy and it didnt matter the vast majority of the time whether someone was going to live or die be comfortable or not now how can we the only superpower in the world a nation that is leading the world in research and medical products how can we have a medicare program a program for health care for senior citizens that does not include the prescription drug benefit we cant do that i also say to my friend the reason we are here is this morning a senator came over and gave this presentation and said what my friend from north dakota said sure we want to do something about medicare but i have gotten letters from my constituents saying im against the big government plan this is exactly what we hear on the radio advertisements and the television advertisements that are paid for by the health care industry they want the american people to think that the program the democrats are propounding is a big government plan there could be nothing further from the truth what does this have to do with big government a woman by the name of gail rattigah from henderson nv writes i am a registered nurse who recently cared for an 82yearold woman who tried to commit suicide because she couldnt afford the medications her doctor told her were necessary to prevent a stroke it would be much more cost effective for the government to pay for medications that prevent more serious illnesses and expensive hospitalizations these include but are not limited to blood pressure medications antistroke anticoagulants and cholesterol medications the governments current policy of paying for medications only in the hospital is backward get into health promotion and disease promotion and save money this is a registered nurse from henderson nv i want everyone on the majority side to know they are not going to be able to come over and make these statements as if there is no opposition to it what my friend from tennessee says is wrong he states he has gotten all of these letters saying i am against the big government plan that is because of the radio and tv advertisements from the powerful health insurance industry but the real people are like the 82yearold woman who wanted to commit suicide because she couldnt get medication also i want to spread across this record that my friend from tennessee who came and said we need the republican plan makes the statement that he wants to involve senator breaux in this the majority cant have it both ways they either support the bush plan the plan of the person running for the president of the united states on the republican ticket or they dont support the nominee it appears what my friend from tennessee is doing is trying to have it both ways because the senator from louisiana does not support governor bushs plan the majority realizes that their medicare plan simply can not work because of their nominees 1 6 trillion tax cut proposal senator breaux pointed this out quite clearly today my point is i say to my friend from north dakota people who come here and make statements on the floor need to have substantiation i say the senator from louisiana does not support the bush medicare plan i also say the majority has introduced a proposalso we understand it but it is a medicare prescription drug benefit in name only a new york times writer states all indications are that this plan is a nonstarter insurance companies themselves are very skeptical there havent been many cases in which an industrys own lobbyists tell congress that they dont want a subsidy but this is one of them i take just another minute or two of my friends time the gop plan subsidizes insurance companies not medicare beneficiaries health insurance companies continue to say the republican plan is unworkable the majority tries to give this to the insurance industry but the insurance industry doesnt want it because it wont work charles kahn president of the health insurance association of america has stated we continue to believe the concept of the socalled drugonly private insurance simply would not work in practice i dont know of an insurance company that would offer a drugonly policy like that or even consider it mr president i say to my friend from north dakota we know there needs to be something done about the high cost of prescription drugs no 2 we know there has to be something done with medicare to help senior citizens of this country be able to afford prescription drugs that is all we are saying and we want everyone to know the program put forth by the minority is a program that helps senior citizens it is not something that is means tested but a program that helps all senior citizens not people who make less than 12 000 a year it is a program that is essential it is essential because people as we speak such as gail rattigan who is a registered nurse who wrote to me write that people are considering suicide if they are to take one pill a day they are splitting

rightsmeaning ours it is fascinating to me that we now have a circumstance where the republican campaign committee is saying that the patients bill of rights we proposed was the real one we will have more to say about that and have a more aggressive debate about that in the days ahead my expectation is that there will be a tie vote when another vote occursand it will happen again we fully intend it to happen again fortunately we will have a vice president to break that tie the patients bill of rights issue is very important let me mention a couple of other issues and then i will conclude we also have a responsibility to deal with the farm crisis and we have not done so very well we have a farm bill that doesnt work the freedom to farm bill does not work it has been a failure since it was enacted in 1996 the promise was produce what you want we will sell it overseas and get rid of the farm program and things will be better off since that time prices have collapsed and family farmers have had an awful time trying to make ends meet in most cases they are receiving far less now in real terms than they received during the great depression for their product these are not people who are slothful these are not people who arent being productive they are economic allstars they produce in prodigious quantity the food the world needs so desperately yet the market says by the way your food has no value while people climb trees to pick leaves to eat in countries around the world where there is not enough food family farmers driving a 2ton truck to a country elevator are told by the grain trader your food has no value something is wrong with that what really has no value is the current farm program it doesnt work it is long past time to fix it we are within three or four votes of doing that i encourage help from the other side to give us the votes needed to pass a farm program that provides real assistance for family farmers while we are on the subject of freedom those who wrote the freedom to farm billi didnt and i voted against itshould understand there is something called the freedom to sell the freedom to sell means if you want to give family farmers the freedom to produce whatever lets also give them the freedom to sell their products in markets such as iran iraq cuba north korea and others that have been off limits to them because this country has imposed economic sanctions against countries whose behavior we dont like i am fine with economic sanctions slap them with sanctions but dont ever include food as a part of those sanctions using food as a weapon is unbecoming to this country a country as big and as good and as powerful and as important as this country ought never use food as a weapon the freedom to sell is a pretty important principle whichwe ought to care a bit about there is an amendment that i put in the appropriations bill now in conference and i know there are a couple of house leaders who are intending to try to kill that as we get to conference i am hoping with the bipartisan support we received in the senate that we wfll prevail on this issue finally one of the other important issues we face as we wrap up this congress is trying to do something to strengthen the education system in our country we have the opportunity to do that it is just that we have all of this bickering back and forth we have things that we know need to be done everybody here understands that if you are in a classroom of 15 people there is more learning going on than if there is a classroom with 1 teacher and 30 kids class size matters we have proposals to reduce class size which will dramatically improve education we also understand you cannot learn in schools that are in functional disrepair no wonder there is disrepair in the schools they were built 50 or 60 years ago after world war ii when we had soldiers coming back having families and building schools for their children all across the country many of these schools are still in use today and are in desperate need of repair and remodeling if anyone doubts that take a trip to the ojibwa school on the turtle mountain indian reservation or the cannon ball elementary school south of bismarck nd take a look at those schools and ask yourself whether those schools need help the third grader who walks through the classroom door in the cannon ball school ought to be able to expect the same opportunity for a good education as all kids in this country yet these children dont have the same opportunity we know that yet legislation to improve and modernize our schools languish in this senate because some people dont believe it is important or some people believe they cannot do it because if they did somebody would declare victory for a public policy that makes sense lets declare victory for a little common sense in all of these areas education health care agriculture there are so many areas the agenda in this congress is the agenda we establish if we are a congress of underachievers that is our fault not something we blame on anybody else i wish i were in the majority here but i am not the majority establishes a schedule we dont i accept that we have a right and insist on the right between now and the 5 weeks when this congress wraps up its business to try to bring to the floor of the senate once again a real patients bill of rights and have another vote we have a right to try to push these policies to get them done we have a right to try to push education policies that we think will enhance and improve education in this country we have a right to try to push policies that say we want to add a prescription drug benefit to the medicare program we have a right to insist that the american consumer pay prices for prescription drugs that are fairnot the highest prices of anyone in the entire world we have a right to address all of those issues and we should there is time it is just a matter ofwill will the members of the senate who do the scheduling who plan the agenda exhibit the will to do what is right in the final 5 weeks and pass this kind of legislation as i said when i started when people sit down at the dinner table and talk about their lives they are talking about things that matter to them all of the things i have talked about are things that matter to them are our kids going to good schools do grandpa and grandma have the opportunity to get decent health care when they are sick are the neighborhoods safe do i have a decent job does it pay well does it have security all of those are things that are important to the amer ican people all of those are things they should expect this congress to address in the coming 5 weeks i yield the floor"], [0.9764817357063293, 0.9764817357063293, 0, "i rise today to salute our

than 5 percent of all businesses in the united states by 1997 that figure jumped to 36 percent over the last decade the number of womenowned firms increased by 89 percent nationwide employment nearly tripled and sales nearly doubled who are todays women business owners and how can we help ensure that they are free to grow and prosper there are more than 8 5 million womenowned businesses in the united states employing nearly 24 million people that is more than all of the fortune 500 companies combined where do we do business everywhere today women own businesses in all sectors of the economy not just in the service sector or the socalled traditional womenowned business areas in fact the top growth industries for womenowned businesses in recent years has been in construction wholesale trade transportation communications agribusiness and manufacturing what is it that motivates women to start their own businesses the national foundation for women business owners surveyed women across the country and found that nearly half stated one of two reasons a great idea for a product or service or the realization that they could do for themselves what they had previously done for an employer frustrations with the corporate environment including feeling unchallenged and experiencing a glass ceiling were also cited as motivation for women to become entrepreneurs the foundation also asked women why they stay in business not surprisingly the greatest reward of business ownership for women is gaining control over their own fate and the greatest challenge of business ownership for women is being taken seriously in my home state of illinois the largest and most comprehensive womens business assistance center has thrived for 14 years the womens business development center has served over 30 000 women through counseling training financial assistance and new marketing opportunities thanks in part to the help of the center in illinois there are now over 336 000 womenowned businesses employing 23 percent of all illinois workers and generating 15 percent of the states business sales but despite the explosive growth in womens business ownership in the united states we still generate only 18 percent of all business revenues so there is still much work to be done and congress can help accelerate the growth and success of womenowned businesses women need new and more access to market opportunities and to contracts at all levels of government women need access to technical assistance to develop and grow their businesses most importantly like all businesses in the

gentleman from colorado for yielding me time and i appreciate his giving me the opportunity tonight to be able to make some comments of my own on such an important subject but first i want to thank him for his giving the attention to such a complex sensitive and yet important subject that it deserves and also thank the gentleman from colorado for his expertise and for his knowledge of immigration which i think provides a great contribution to those of us here in the house who certainly can benefit from his personal knowledge firsthand knowledge of immigration as it impacts his state of colorado i would like to call the attention of my colleagues to the destructive effect of our current immigration policy it is having a destructive impact on recent immigrants and black and hispanic citizens and also how a more enlightened immigration policy would benefit american minorities and in fact the overall american economy each year close to 900 000 legal immigrants enter the united states of these about 300 000 have less than a high school education and their competition forscarce jobs does have a destructive impact on the opportunity of american workers with no more than a high school diploma who are disproportionately and unfortunately recent immigrants and black and hispanic citizens among reports of a growing prospering economy are other more troubling reports on a growing gap between the welltodo and the working poor the national unemployment rate is about 4 percent where for those with less than a high school education it is more than twice as high over 8 percent in many cities where there are high recent immigrant populations the unemployment rates are in double digits for those with less education where is opportunity for these individuals and their families numerous polls indicate that black and hispanic americans know this only too well this is no surprise given that they are hurt disproportionately by our immigration policy today we cannot pretend that the adverse impact of mass immigration on minorities does not exist we can and should find solutions to protect the jobs and wages of recent immigrants and black and hispanic citizens how often do we read about the longterm unemployed or the working poor or single mothers with no mention of the serious impact of immigration on their employment wages and working conditions how often do we hear comments about the growing gap between the welltodo and the working poor that do not mention that almost half the relative decline in wages of those who do not finish high school is caused in fact by competition from immigration think of a single mother barely surviving in a minimum wage job who sees her annual wages depressed by 2 000 because she must compete with more and more unskilled immigrants she very well might be a recent immigrant herself seeking a better life for herself and her children or she might be able to trace her roots in this country back generations and is simply seeking the american dream that has been denied her ancestors think what she can do for herself and her children with that lost money buy a used car so she does not have to take a bus to work put a down payment on a modest home or even fix the furnace before winter comes worse think what would happen if she actually loses her job because of the neverending competition from new arrivals it is certainly not the immigrants themselves who are to blame and who understandably want to come to america it is our immigration policy that is to blame but who knows how many people have been hurt by the unintended consequences of our outdated immigration policy a series of recent studies have all documented the effects of immigration policy on lowskilled american workers and recent immigrants the national research council of the national academy of sciences concludes that immigration was responsible for about 44 percent of the total decline in relative wages of high school dropouts between 1980 and 1994 the rand corporation reports that in california the widening gap between the number of jobs available for noncollegeeducated workers and the increasing number of new noncollegeeducated immigrants signals growing competition for jobs and hence a further decline in the relative earnings at the low end of the labor market the unitedstates commission on immigration reform chaired by congresswoman barbara jordan finds that immigration of unskilled immigrants comes at a cost to unskilled unitedstates workers the hudson institute states that unitedstates immigration policy serves primarily to increase the number of unitedstates residents who lack even a high school degree america must stop recruiting workers for jobs that do not exist or exist only at the lowest wages the brookings institute published a paper concluding that immigration has had a marked adverse impact on the economic status of the least skilled unitedstates workers the center for immigration studies calculates that immigration may reduce the wages of the average native in a lowskilled occupation by over 1 900 a year cis also found that the poverty rate for persons living in immigrant households of 1997 was 22 percent almost double the 12 percent rate for persons in native households it concluded that reducing the flow of less skilled immigrants who enter each year would have the desirable effect of reducing job competition between more established immigrants and new arrivals for lowwage jobs reducing the supply of this kind of labor would create upward pressure on wages and benefits for the working poor including immigrants already in the country over time this should reduce poverty among immigrants who work these studies reinforce what common sense already tells us in addition add three other facts together first immigrants will account for half of the increase in the workforce in the 1990s second the skilled level of immigrants relative to americans has been declining for years thirtyfive percent of immigrant workers who have arrived since 1990 do not have a high school education compared to only 9 percent of nativeborn workers some 300 000 illegal immigrants without high school educations arrived last year and will total 3 million this decade third close to 90 percent of all future jobs in america will require more than a high school education the mismatch is clear nearly half of all immigrants today are not prepared for the jobs of the future current immigration policy has many americans and recent immigrants competing with hundreds of thousands of newcomers without high school degrees for a fixed number of lowskilled jobs this is a recipe for disaster for millions of bluecollar workers and their families no one should complain about the plight of the working poor or the persistence of minority unemployment or the levels of income inequality in america without acknowledging the unintended consequences of our present immigration policy of course immigration is neither all good nor all bad immigrants benefit america in many ways but we should design our immigration policies so that it enhances rather than diminishes opportunity for american workers we should protect the jobs of working americans and we can make a better life for all americans wherever they were born just as american minorities would benefit from a reduced number of lowskilled immigrants the american economy and american firms trying to prosper in this era of global competition would benefit enormously from an increased flow of more educated immigrants american industry is pleading for more skilled and educated workers the chairman of the national association of manufacturers recently stated that the shortage of skilled employees is not a distant threat anymore the skills gap is now catching up to us and could threaten the amazing growth and productivity gains of the past decade finding an adequate supply of qualified employees is the number one issue for american industry today nam found that 88 percent of manufacturers are experiencing a shortage of qualified workers 60 percent find that current workers lack basic math skills and that 55 percent find serious deficiencies in workers basic writing and comprehension skills these problems can be solved with more educated workers and because immigration accounts for such a high percentage of workforce growth almost onehalf an emphasis on more educated immigrants would be an important part of the solution the result would be a more productive american economy and more productive american businesses as the productivity of the american economy increases so will the prosperity of all americans american citizens and legal residents will benefit in another way from more educated immigrants to borrow a line from a new book by george borjas skilled immigrants earn more pay higher taxes and require fewer social services than less skilled immigrants the national academy of sciences states that over his or her lifetime each immigrant with less than a high school education will cost american taxpayers 89 000 that is the government benefits consumed by each immigrant will exceed taxes they paid by 89 000 to citizens concerned about how we are to rebuild our schools and protect and preserve social security in the next century these numbers should set off alarms more than 300 000 immigrant workers with less than a high school education entering our country this year will require 27 billion more in government services and benefits than they will contribute in taxes that is 27 billion for example that will not be available to rebuild our schools and protect and preserve social security and medicare next year another 300 000plus immigrants will enter the country with less than a high school education over their lifetimes they will claim another 27 billion that could provide education and training to recent immigrants and black and hispanic citizens who have less than a high school education and who are disadvantaged in our economy common sense tells us that we should align our immigration policy with the needs of america the economy is crying out for more educated workers and one of the easiest and most costfree ways of providing these workers is through immigration reform doing so would mean more economic opportunity for all americans now

expressed the need for change she originally wrote in support of h r 671 however her comments are just as applicable to 102 miss ashby is a social worker in my district she writes dear representative tubbsjones it has come to my attention that the house resolution is being debated concerning abused and neglected children who are aging out of foster care i would strongly urge you to support this bill i work in an independent living program in cleveland the children i work with are 18 years old and are exactly the children for whom this resolution is aimed i know from firsthand experience that these kids need your help ten years ago i kept watching children leave our residential center or even our group home to the street because they had nowhere else to turn once they turned 18 they were too old for the child welfare system to take care of them anymore and they were unprepared to manage job school bills relationships drugs sex and all the other things that go with adult life they ended up back with the same parents who abused or neglected them or in relationships that mirrored those poor parental relationships often this resulted in them becoming homeless abusing drugs or becoming either victims or perpetrators of crime there were many good programs out there and my agency gave me the freedom to look at these programs and find a model that worked for these kids and start it five years ago three staff and myself began the independent living program we had our share of troubles the scenarios above still happen for some kids but i can tell you more kids now graduate from high school more kids than before learn what it takes to be a good worker and how to keep a job and more kids know that they can never go home at least not to stay again and they do have other choices the sad thing is that sometimes all those revelations happen after they have been kicked out of the childrens welfare system being homeless jobless or overcome by drug abuse are powerful lessons that many kids could be helped with when they ask for it but the system doesnt allow for reentry into the childrens system once they are 18 the adult system here in cleveland although better than most doesnt cater to the specific problems of young adults consequently young people who are belligerent present poorly and are reluctant to follow through without a good deal of followup by the case manager wont get services let me give you an example linda spent her whole life in foster care from foster care home to foster care home even a failed adoption all she wanted was to be able to live with her mother for whom she knew was parenting her other three siblings reunification was tried and failed one home after another couldnt tolerate her belligerent attitude skipping school and her sexual acting out out of frustration certainly not because she was mature enough the child protection worker recommended an independent living program linda loves the idea finally she has a home of her own and for the first month of the program she does wonderfully she is compliant eager to learn and has made a nice connection with the staff school starts to fall apart she was behind in school so now she starts cutting classes she has allnight parties with all her friends in her apartment and now her counselor thinks she is using marijuana the program tries intervention after intervention linda states she wants out out of the system and out on her own her wish gets granted mostly because there are so few services to offer an adult who is unwilling to comply with basic rules so linda goes back with mom which is where she always wanted to be but lindas fantasy of having mom waiting at the door with open arms is quickly dashed by the reality of a mom who now has other children to attend linda and mom never worked out the problems of the past so the past repeats itself and linda at some point either leaves moms house or gets kicked out linda now ends up either going from friends house to friends house if she is lucky to have friends or on the street now linda is calling the program back saying gee i learned my lesson you were all right all along take me back ill be better and the social worker says sorry we would love to have you back i really believe you have learned your lesson but youre not a kid any more youre an ablebodied adult and you should get yourself a job and make a life for yourself after reading this you might say tough love is the best medicine and for some a good dose is but how many 18 years old do you know who have had sometimes 20 caregivers over the course of their young life and who have to decide where they are going to live how they are going to support themselves what theyre going to do without anyones support all by their 18th birthday it is tough when you have no one to rely on this kind of funding that the house resolution offers is a chance to give a child like linda help at a time when she can really use it the letter goes on but i think it specifically states what we are all talking about here on the floor she says i have 20 more stories like this her words can better express based on her experience

nation these young people learn also what it means to live as a free people to understand and appreciate more what democracy and freedom is all about but what impressed me even more was that as part of the opening ceremony three candies were brought forth and placed on the head table the candies were lit and then the young cadet started explaining that these three candles represented staff

had a difficult time trying to say with some sense of certainty how the current debate now pending before the house floor is going to endthe options on whether congress is going to officially declare war against the republic of yugoslavia or whether congress is simply going to pull the plug and tell the president of the united states to take our military presence completely out of yugoslavia or that the president is not to move an inch until and unless the congress says otherwise these options do not paint a very pretty picture for our nation and to our nato allies let alone the lives of the three american soldiers that are now being held at risk and whether it be three american soldiers 30 000 or 300 000 this begs the question how does america value the lives of our men and women in uniform whether it be three 3 000 or more i consider the life of any american soldier just as important as 3 000 or more how is it possible for this congress to declare war against yugoslavia and then decide to take our armed forces out of that country the fact of the matter is we already have committed our soldiers to yugoslavia by keeping the peace in the state of bosnia and already has cost our government some 9 4 billion to maintain the peace in this area of yugoslavia there have been some arguments made that our nation is not the policeman of the world that this matter of bosnia and kosovo is not in our national interest my colleagues may have already forgotten the fact that we did say that the balkans is a european issue and it should be handled by the europeans in fact as i recall president chirac of france was quite specific about this matter saying to the effect you americans stay out of this controversy we in europe will handle this well we did after 3 years of utter failure by france england germany and other leading european countries to solve the crisis in bosnia our president was then asked to step in and the dayton negotiations resulted in where we are now maintaining the peace in bosnia it is not easy to be king of the mountain the leader of the free world and the most powerful nation on this planet i remember once mentioning to a foreign diplomat here in washington that the united states is getting tired of being the worlds policeman this gentleman turned to me and said so you would prefer china and russia filling the vacuum you would now prefer that we negotiate with china or russia the global issues that will affect the life and death struggles of many nations that look up to america as their last hope for freedom and for economic and political stability i had to think again about what this diplomat said to me and wondered what would this world be like if america was not the premier leader of the free world if america was to take the third or fourth seat down the line and allow china or russia to lead the world on issues that affect the lives of every human being living in this world i ask my colleagues to stay the course let the president lead this nation and that we should support his efforts to resolve the crisis in kosovo and if it becomes necessary that we utilize whatever force of arms to bring milosevic to properly

we ought not do because we do not know what we are talking about we think things on the fly like we have been taking a lot of these amendments so more study we cannot be hurt by more studies the problem with this amendment however is the sunset provision because not only would it sunset some funding it would sunset some protection for juveniles if we are late in reauthorizing the bill 4 years from now we are always late in reauthorizing it therefore we ought not have the sunset provision in there for that reason i oppose the amendment i reserve the balance of my time"],

and trade expansi6n opportunities for countries in the caribbean basin after peace had arrived now more so than ever economic revitalization is needed and this is particularly true of the many countries that were ravaged by hurricanes mitch and george a little more than a year ago as many of my colleagues know my wife and i have been involved with various humanitarian and charitable activities in central america and the caribbean for the better part of 30 years and during this time it has become increasingly clear to me that what these countries need most in the way of economic stabilization is investment in free trading opportunities providing more open trade access to our markets would not only aid the ailing economies of these countries but would help ensure greater political stability as well the most controversial aspect of h r 434 has revolved around textiles and apparel being from north carolina these industries are particularly important to me as are the jobs that make up these industries my particular concern regarding this legislation has been to ensure that textiles and apparel produced in countries in africa and the caribbean basin region are made of unitedstates materials if they are to receive favorable trade benefits without these protections i voted against this bill last summer according to most textile and fiber manufacturers that i have heard from the conference report on h r 434 takes necessary steps to ensure that unitedstates fiber yarn and cotton manufacturing industries are sufficiently protected i believe this bill would greatly benefit the economies of the caribbean basin and africa while protecting domestic jobs and i urge its passage"], [0.0009647905826568604, 0.49903520941734314, 1, "i thank my friend for his
