when it comes to escalating the occupation of iraq it has coldheartedly insisted on denying the children of struggling working families with health insurance in the name of fiscal discipline once again the values of the administration are glaringly out of step with the values of the american people the administration will not stand for accountability transparency or dissent when it comes to ending the occupation of iraq they will however support another blank check resulting in more lives lost and more of our priorities left unfunded earlier today the house voted on overriding the presidents veto of the childrens health insurance reauthorization or schip when the president vetoed schip he argued that the appearance of fiscal responsibility was more important than the health of 10 million of our children in this nation but when we learned that insuring 10 million children in america for 1 year costs the same as 40 days in iraq it is clear that the administration does not have its priorities straight supporting our service men and women is certainly our absolute responsibility our nation has an obligation to those who sacrifice and defend us during times of war however our servicemembers in iraq were sent into combat without adequate training without stateoftheart body armor and equipment and without assurances that their tours of duty will not be overextended the glaring failures in iraq show that not only is the bush administration defunding our nations priorities to continue the occupation but that it is allowing much of that money to be wasted the inspector general has reported that 8 8 billion appropriated for iraqs reconstruction cannot be accounted for media sources have recently reported that the administration is constructing a 600 million american embassy located in the green zone in iraq this embassy which is the largest in the world in fact it is larger than the vatican this embassy will include grocery stores a movie theater tennis courts and a social club it will require 1 billion a year to keep it up and to be maintained instead of our childrens health care the priorities of the bush administration seem to be waste fraud and abuse when the administration vetoes a bipartisan investment in health insurance for our nations children it rejects the priorities of the american people when the administration spends billions on constructing and maintaining an embassy in iraq while iraqs infrastructure collapses around them it compromises the safety of our troops abroad and when the administration refuses to end the

we need a new direction in america we need a plan one we never had 4 years 5 months ago as this country struck a sovereign nation iraq we need a plan i would say a new plan but we never had an old plan so a plan is what this country must have president bush wants the same no plan to go forward it is time for change over 3 800 americans dead over 28 000 americans wounded in battle members of the congressional black caucus 43 members from 21 states we represent over 40 million americans and to a person all over our districts they want a change they want a new direction with this war in iraq

our country 40 million represented by the members of our caucus we represent latino americans native americans asian americans european americans indian americans and africali americans the entire multiethnic society are represented by members of the congressional black caucus so when we start our special order tonight to talk about the war in iraq a war we never should have fought a war that has lasted longer than world war i world war ii the civil war and the war continues you might remember america last spring they were all saying wait until september we sent a bill with benchmarks to the senate to the house passed the house went to the senate the president vetoed it we sent him another one they say okay we wont do another one we will wait until september well now general petraeus is saying not september 2007 lets now give them until march 2008 no new plan they are going to ask for 200 billion in the next several weeks already have spent 565 4 trillion of your tax dollars on a war we never should have fought america wants a change we want a new direction mr president we want to bring our troops home in the most orderly possible plan that we can put together and i hope and the american people hope this administration as well as our military leaders will come up with a plan it is your responsibility to do that we support our troops we support the veterans all over this country as well as those veterans who are fighting this war the mental health needs that our country will have as a result of this war we yet do not know there will be significant needs for mental health services this supplemental has very little money that is coming through and this is a supplemental that we spent this year 2007 and 2008 understanding again we have already spent 565 4 trillion repeat that 565 trillion in this war we must bring our troops home we must have a new direction and as members of the congressional black caucus we will say it over and over again set a plan in motion change direction for our country benchmarks you heard also benchmarks what about these benchmarks that congress the president and president maliki put together earlier this year it is really between president bushs administration and the administration in iraq 18 benchmarks that they said they would meet by september the general accounting office reported to this congress last week they have met three of them they are not sustaining their own government they go on vacation and they want us to fight their war our people tell us to bring our soldiers home we hear it across the country republicans and democrats as weli as independents bring our troops home it is unconscionable that this congress would consider as an appropriator and as a member of this body as well as a citizen of this country 200 billion new dollars for this illadvised war in the next several months rise up america thank you for protesting over this lastweek keep the protests up if you cant come to washington have them in your own state in your own city let us hear your voices it is too silent out there this is a better country than that so as we come to you tonight as members bf this united states house of representatives 110th congress where there have been 110 african americans elected and voting inf this chamber over these many years we are proud to have that responsibility and we will remain the conscience of the congress bring our troops home end this illadvised war rebuild america from the ground up our children deserve more our seniors who built this country need more there is no reason why we cant have topquality education good health centers good environment good infrastructure bridges that dont collapse but you see you cant spend 565 trillion of your money in a war that we should not be fighting and at the same time invest in americas future so as one of 43 members of the congressional black caucus we say to you america become engaged speak out ask that we bring our troops home ask for a new plan ask for a change of direction our theme for 2007 and 2008 is change course do something different join volunteer work for a better america confront the crisis of the war of education of health care of infrastructure needs and then for us to continue the legacy not just members of the caucus but all americans continue the legacy of people who have built this country who have laid down their lives and for us so many of our ancestors and forebears who fought the civil rights movement who speak out today for a just america so my brothers and sisters american citizens rise up change course fight to end this war today so that your grandchildren will have a better america tomorrow mr speaker one of the costs of the war in iraq that is often overlooked is the waste of tax dollars that could be used to fund programs and facilities that would improve our quality of life americas families want access to wellpaying jobs affordable health care and quality education the war in iraq presents a threat to our military readiness and the development of communities across our country we must reinvest in programs that address the priorities of americas families to preserve

would transfer billions of dollars in mortgagebacked securities to the federal government and provide no roadmap for what comes next if these properties are foreclosed the federal government is not

live here today we need to invest in this country and its infrastructure for the future of this nation and for the children of this generation and those yet to come we have a responsibility as well as a right the gentleman from washington mr dicks also mentioned we are here to help each other out i would conclude by stressing that point while i have a great deal of respect for the gentleman from the fifth district of texas i happen to represent the first district in indiana and the last time i looked society and the purpose of us joining together in a free government is to help each other out and to look out for each others interests it is not the government that is paying this money as the gentleman indicated it is the people of this country who are paying for this project in rensselaer indiana that has value which is the same reason why i think it is absolutely appropriate that taxpayers in places like east chicago indiana and hobart indiana expend some of their tax moneys as individuals to help the city of dallas for example with their floodway to ensure that there is not property damage in the future that there is not loss of life that there is not injury to others in this country it is why i think there is a noble reason to ask people who live in lowell indiana and chesterton indiana and gary indiana to help fund research taking place at oak ridge in tennessee at first blush why should we have an interest in makingthat investment because it inures to the benefit of not only everyone who lives in the united states but everyone worldwide we should get over this concept that we have to be parochial in what we do and get over this concept that we should be selfish about what we are about we are here to make an investment and as the gentleman from washington rightfully pointed out to help each other out so i strongly oppose the gentlemans amendment i absolutely think it is bad policy and i would ask my colleagues support i yield back the balance of my time"], [0.0005142390727996826, 0.4994857609272003, 1, "when i was part of this congressional delegation a few weeks ago and maybe last week you heard the same thing it was the israeli government that was promoting providing resources for the palestinians they want the american government to support abu mazen they want us to prop up the palestinian people because they know this might be the last opportunity they have for peace and you brought up a really good point i cant say that the egyptians and the israelis love each other and sing kumbiya by the camp fire the same thing with the jordanians this is not a warm peace it is a peace you dont have to love thy neighbor but you can live side by side in peace i think that is what we should be going for if i thought for a minute these indiscriminate attacks on sderot and other border towns was an effort to create a palestinian state maybe i could understand that as addled as that is but this has nothing to do with creating a
