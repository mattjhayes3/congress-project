i truly have not said that very often i came here as part of the class of 1995 we came here because we were like many people in this country we were sick and tired of the tax increases we were sick and tired of promises of a balanced budget whose words just plain rang hollow because they had no meaning we had heard so many times it was going to happen and it did not happen then there were new promises made and it did not happen again and then taxes were raised what a great day it is here to bring the news of what has happened out in washington and how different it is from 1995 looking at 1997 i am here today to talk about what has happened in washington it is the budget is balanced we reach a bipartisan agreement credit to the republicans to the gentleman from ohio to the gentleman from georgia to the leadership here in the house and to the senate also to the president who could have threatened veto could have put his feet in the ground and said we are not going to do any of this stuff we are not going to listen we are going to continue infighting but credit should be spread all around it is important we start with the fact that the budget will be balanced by 2002 or sooner i would like to go on record here and now this evening saying that if we do not go into a major recession in the next 12 months the budget is balanced not in the year 2002 but the budget is balanced in 1998 it is very important to begin with that discussion because with that discussion in mind we will understand how reasonable it is to talk about providing tax relief tax relief without a balanced budget effectively means we are borrowing more money from our childrens future and letting people keep it and spend it today and not being responsible for what is happening but when we understand that in all probability the budget will be balanced probably in 1998 1998 at the latest short of a major recession we can also provide tax relief to the american people and do it in good conscience i would like to spend a little bit of time talking about that tax relief tonight and going through some of the different aspects of it some of them are pretty well known some of them are not very known at all i would like to start perhaps with the most wellknown part of the tax cut package and that is the 500 per child tax cut let me be very clear on this it starts january 1 of next year it is 400 per child in the first area and 500 in the years after that what does this mean to a working family out there in america well if you are earning less than 110 000 a year for a couple and you have got two kids or let us say you have got three kids in your house if you are earning less than 110 000 a year and you have got three kids what you need to do is next year on january 1 you need to walk into your employers office and tell your employer you want 100 more in your paycheck starting january of next year and you want to keep that money that they were sending out to washington before this is not washington jargon or washington nonsense this is actually what happened out here today in washington dc so a family with three kids should walk in the door next january 1 to their employer and tell their employer they want to keep 100 a month that is 400 per child times three is 1 200 a year or 100 a month that they should keep in their own paycheck instead of sending it down here to washington dc is it not a great day in washington when we can talk about that instead of the 1993 discussion about which taxes we should raise and how high we should raise them things have changed out here in washington dc and again i emphasize that this discussion is going on in light of and in addition to a balanced budget probably 3 maybe even 4 years ahead of schedule what a great day it is here to be talking about these issues so again for a family of three kids earning less than 110 000 a year january 1 next year you walk into your employer and you tell him that you want to keep a hundred bucks more of the money they have been sending out here to washington dc because the job that they sent us here to do in 1995 is in fact done and it is good news for the american people i want to go on to some of the other things that are in here the other one that has been well publicized is the capital gains tax reduction i would like to be pretty explicit on this there are some different details of this that are necessary for the american people to know about if you are a senior citizen and you have a pension that accumulated while you were in the work force and you are now in a position where you are taking money out of that pension and the money of course you put in during the past years has raised in value you will be paying capital gains on that money before for every 100 you made in that pension fund for every 100 of capital gains washington took 28 away from you starting now they will only take 20 so you keep an extra 8 of your own money it is not washingtons money it is your money you keep an extra 8 for every 100 of profit that you made for every 100 of profit you made you keep an extra 8 in your own home instead of sending it on out here to washington dc let me be very clear about that the capital gains tax rate is going from 28 percent that it currently is down to 20 percent for virtually all investments the only exception to that rule and if you own real estate you want to pay particular attention to this exception if you own real estate and you purchased a building let us say for 50 000 and you have depreciated the building 10 000 and then you go and sell the building and let us hope you made a profit let us hope you sold it for 65 000 well the money you depreciated from the purchase price the 50 000 down to 40 000 that is called recapture on the recapture portion you will be paying a 25percent tax that tax is lower than it used to be too i wish it was 20 percent across the board if i had my way it would be but the bottom line is that portion of the tax is going from 28 to 25 the rest of the tax the appreciation in the propertyvalue is going from 28 percent down to 20 so good news for capital gains if you bought stocks and your stocks have appreciated in value if you bought a piece of real estate and your real estate has appreciated in value and you sell that real estate then when you report your capital gains when you report your profit you pay 20 percent tax instead of the 28 percent that you used to pay there are a couple more portions of this that have not been very well publicized that are important to an awful lot of people and again i will go to the real estate portion of this because there is a very significant change that has occurred in the real estate portion as far as the capital gains tax cut is concerned before if you owned your own home and you were under the age of 55 and you sold that home for whatever reason job transfer or you decided to live in an apartment and save money instead or your kids have grown and gone away and you are 45 and your last child just left home and the home is now too big for you so you decide to sell it and own a smaller home but at any rate you own this home and you sell it but you are under the age of 55 in the past you paid capital gains if you bought a home 15 years ago for 30 000 and you are selling it today for 90 000 that wvould be a 60 000 appreciation and in the past if you were not 55 years old you would have paid capital gains tax on 60 000 let me make it very clear this tax code changes that even if you are not 55 years old you will no longer pay capital gains on the profit of the sale of your principal residence this is very very significant to a lot of folks if you are in a highpriced area in the country and you move to a lowerpriced real estate area you may not take all the money out of the higherpriced real estate that you own in one job you take a job promotion into an area where home prices are lower there may be a difference between what you sold and what you keep you no longer pay taxes on that under this bill as long as you have been in your home for 2 years and you sell the home you do not pay taxes on whatever the appreciated value was very very significant change for a lot of people one other group of people that this affects that i have been hearing from off and on during the day i have heard from some empty nesters whose kids are either grown and gone or folks that have not had kids for whatever reason they decided not to or have not had them yet this empty nester provision or this provision where you can be in your principal residence and sell it 2 years later and not pay taxes on the profit affects lots and lots of those people for what we call empty nesters those people whose kids are grown and gone but have not yet reached the age of 55 that empty nester can now sell their home and move into a smaller home if that is what they want to do they can then put some of the money the profit away for retirement instead of sending it on out here to washington d c a very significant change in the tax code for a lot of people in this country another portion of the tax code that is changed and some people have been hearing about it the estate tax has been changed the exclusion for family businesses and family farms being passed on if you are a farmer out there in our district and your farm has been in your family for generations as many of them have in southeastern wisconsin all across wisconsin and you wish to pass that farm on to the next generation the exclusion has been raised now to 1 3 million and if there are two people in the family you could pass on up to 2 6 million total to the next generation that goes for a small business and that goes for the farms the 600 000 exclusion is going up to 1 million over a period of time i want to jump from there to another provision that has been talked about but i am not sure the details have been very well described on it and that is the education tax credit i happen to be very familiar with the cost of education i have one who is going to be a junior in college this year another one going to be a freshman in college another one is a freshman in high school when i think about these provisions and i think about making the payments every year on these college tuition bills i know this provision is going to be important to many many mdny people across this country let me start with your first 2 years of college in your first 2 years of college you get a deduction this is a tax credit of up to 1 500 per year provided you spend 3 000 total on your college costs if your college costs are over 3 000 you will get a 1 500 tax credit it is very important that we talk about the difference between a tax deduction and a tax credit a tax credit means that if your taxes were 10 000 before and you get a 1 500 credit that means your taxes go down to 38 500 it literally is a dollarfordollar deduction in your taxes so the good news is as we look at college students in your first 2 years it is up to 1 500 per year in additional help to go to college some people do not like this provision in the bill and i guess i have to look at this and say well anything that we can do here in washington to allow the people to keep more of their own money instead of sending it on out here to washington i think is a good provision and i think about all the families across wisconsin and across america that this provision is going to help allowing those students to go off to college and i just think it is a good move in the right direction i want to add one more thing in the college tuition part here in our house before my kids talk to me about my helping them by signing a note or whatever for them to go to college they first have to earn 3 000 and bring it to the table so in our house before we start talking about help from other sources whether it be the government or mom and dad or wherever first the kids are expected to do something to provide for themselves if there is one thing i would encourage every parent in the united states of america to do who has students who are either in college or thinking of going to college i think the best thing that we can do as parents for our kids is to ask them to pay part of the cost of college themselves because it will teach them many of the things they need to know after college and in some ways it will provide an education that is equally as important as college i have found in america today at least in wisconsin where we are from that it is very possible for a student to earn 3 000 over the course of a year during the summer where there are 10 12 14 weeks available and during the school year it does not hurt to work a few hours a week if necessary to make up for the addition so i would encourage the parents to ask the students first to do something on their own to provide for their own education but after they reach that point i am happy to say that washington is going to let parents keep more of their own money to apply some of that money to a college education let me kind of sum up where we are so far if you are a family with three kids you have got one of those children in college and you have got two of them still at home you are earning less than 110 000 a year january 1 next year i am back to that magic date again january 1 of next year if you have got one in college two still at home you should go into your employer and not ask for 100 extra a month to keep in your own paycheck instead of sending it to washington you should at that point walk in the door and ask to keep 200 a month extra because you would get the 31 500 for the college help in addition to that you would get 3800 more 400 mper child in the first year so just under 3200 a month you keep instead of sending it on out here to washington i smile when i say this i have a lot of confidence in the people in this great nation i know they can do a better job spending their own money than the people here in washington this is a great day in washington dc i want to go on to a couple of other things that are maybe not quite as well publicized out there one is the individual retirement the ira the expansion of the availability of iras under the new provisions for individuals if you earn 60 000 and up to 100 000 you will be eligible to start your own ira i think that is very important i heard a lot from the young couples with no children that somehow the tax code did not affect them i would like those people to know that you can open an ira now and you will be permitted under this american dream ira to withdraw money that you have saved up tax free for purposes of purchasing a home you will be permitted to put money into this american dream ira aftertax dollars but the accumulation of interest and all the rest on those aftertax dollars that you have put in there that money stays in there untaxed and if you are saving to buy your first home you can take that money out tax free to buy your first home a great provision for young folks who are looking forward to living the american dream purchasing their first home i think it is a very important part of this overall tax package the one other part that i want to just mention is the home office deduction availability for a lot of people has been increased in the day and age that we live in it is time that we recognize that there are many parents single parents in particular who are learning to make their living out of their own home so that they can both be home with their children see their kids off to school and at the same time earn some of that money the home office deduction that has been so hard to claim in the past has been put back and there have been some significant changes in that area to help people be able to accept that i have been summarizing what has happened out here today it truly is a great day in washington dc i think this is the first time i have ever been on the floor that i said it is truly a great day in washington i have to admit when i came here 2 years ago i was not sure that i would ever stand on the floor of the house of representatives and say that it has been a great day in washington dc but to be able to stand here and talk about accomplishing so many things that we were sent here to do the balanced budget and we are not talking about 2002 now although that is the outer bounds of when it may be balanced the reality of this picture is that if we can finish what is in this budget agreement and hold those spending caps we are looking at the balanced budget in 1998 in 1999 at the latest on track ahead of schedule what a magnificent change we have had since 1995 and what a magnificent change it is for the future of this great nation we live in having said that i would like to talk a little bit about the past and then how we got to where we are today and then where we are going in the future let me start just briefly with a little bit about the past i almost hate to talk about this on a great day like today because when i do talk about the past we get a picture of what has been going on out here before the american people rejected what was happening in 1994 and sent a new group out here to control washington dc it is important we understand the difference between a checkbook and borrowing money to buy a house between federal deficit spending which is the checkbook and federal debt which is the amount of money that gets borrowed every year since 1969 this government has spent more money than it had in its checkbook it reached into your pockets the pockets of the american people it collected tax dollars it put those dollars in a checkbook then it started writing out checks but they have not been paying very close attention to how many checks they write out because at the end of the year they overdrew their check book each year that is called the deficit when they talk about balancing the budget in washington what they mean is they are going to stop overdrawing their checkbook every year but when you think about overdrawing your checkbook every year since 1969 it is not hard to figure out that the debt has started to explode the debt is when they go and borrow money to cover their overdrawn checkbook it is no different than sitting around your own kitchen table writing out checks to pay your bills and overdrawing your checkbook well that does not work you have to get the money from somewhere what washington has been doing is they have been borrowing it this chart shows the growth of the federal debt it shows how year after year after year as they overspent their checkbook they borrowed more and more and more money i would point out that around about 1980 is when this thing really started climbing i know all the democrats out there go thats the year that republican president reagan took over and all the republicans go yeah thats the year the democrat congress spent way too much money we blame each other out here it is time we get past blaming each other and it is time we accept the fact that this is a problem facing our nation and do something about it and in fact that is what has happened since 1995 i would also point out that we are about here on this chart right now the debt facing our nation has grown to huge proportions remember this is the part that is like borrowing money to buy your house i have brought another chart that shows how big this number actually is i am a former math teacher we used to do these problems in my math classrooms the debt currently stands at 5 3 trillion even when we are through the euphoria of today the good news that we have reached a balanced budget and we are lowering taxes we still have this 5 3 trillion debt hanging over our heads 5 3 trillion divided up amongst the people in the country if every person were to pay just their share of the federal debt it would be 20 000 for every man woman and child in the united states let me put this another way this government the people in washington dc especially before 1995 saw fit to spend 20 000 of our childrens money more than what they collected in taxes from our generation for a family of five like mine they spent 100 000 they have literally borrowed 100 000 on behalf of every group of five people in the united states of america here is the kicker a family of 5 in america today is paying 580 a month to do nothing but pay their share of the interest on this federal debt a lot of people say well i dont pay 580 a month in taxes so how could i possibly be paying 580 a month to pay our share on that federal debt the reality is when you walk in a store and you buy a new pair of jeans or when you walk in a store and you buy a loaf of bread the store owner makes a small profit on the sale of that loaf of bread to the person that walked in and bought it part of that profit gets sent out here to washington dc when you add up all the different parts of the taxes that you pay through society every family of five in america today or every group of five people is paying 580 a month to do nothing but pay the interest on the federal debt it is staggering in spite of the fact we had a great day we are getting to a point where we are at least balancing our budget we are not going to keep adding to that federal debt as we go forward in spite of the fact that we have had a great day out here today and we have moved in the right direction this debt is still hanging over our head after we reach a balanced budget it would seem logical to ask how in the world did we get into this kind of a mess how did we get to a point where a family of five is in debt on behalf of their government 100 000 i think that is the next logical thing that should be looked at to do that i would like to refer back to what was going on in the late 1980s and the early 1990s in washington dc this is before what i call the revolt of the american people in 1994 because remember it was 1994 where the american people said enough is enough weve had it with the tax increases the broken promises were going to try a new party in control in the house of representatives and in the senate first time in 40 years they did that this is the late 1980s and the early 1990s this is the gramrudmanhollings promises first of 1985 to balance the budget by 1991 the blue line shows the promises that they made the red line shows the actual deficits it is not hard to see in this picture that the promises made were not what they did out here in washington dc so even though they made these promises to the american people they broke them when they found out they could not hit these targets they did what all good people in washington do they made a new set of promises it is no wonder the american people got so cynical about what is being said out of this city they made a whole new set of promises the blue line shows what they promised the second time and the red line shows the broken promises again it is not hard to figure out why the american people are so cynical when i call home to my district and i say hey guess what the budgets balanced probably next year maybe the year after at the latest but certainly before 2002 sometimes people do not believe us it is not hard for me to figure out why they do not believe it because when i look at the track record of what went on out here in washington before 1995 it is very easy to see these broken promises so what happened well they broke the promises 1993 came and went there was no balanced budget but in 1993 a very significant happening occurred the people in washington said were going to get serious about balancing the budget we know how to do it were going to raise taxes on the american people because if we just collect enough money out of the pockets of the american people if we get enough money out here in washington well know how to spend it best for the people and then we can balance the budget that was 1993 the tax increase passed by a single vote in the house of representatives the tax increase passed by a single vote in the senate not a single republican in either body voted for the bill the tax increase went through that was the best thing that ever happened in a lot of ways let me explain why the american people looked at this picture and the broken promises and they looked at the tax increases of 1993 and they said enough is enough were going to change what isgoing on in washington dc and in 1995 an amazing thing happened they elected a new group to control it they put the republicans in control of both the house and the senate and interesting things happened things changed the republicans got here and much like the people that were in control in the past they gave a set of promises to the american people too they said we are going to balance the budget by the year 2002 and not only that we are going to cut your taxes while we are doing it and they laid a plan out i think it is more than fair that at this point the american people should say look 1995 is 2 years ago youre really in the third year of your 7year plan to balance the budget how you doing and i think that is a fair question and i think it deserves an answer because it helps people see how different things are from how they were before the red in this chart the red columns show the promises made in 1995 by the republicans when they took over this is our plan to balance the budget by the year 2002 and in this chart you will notice that in the year 2002 it zeros out that it is a balanced budget this is our promises that we made back in 1995 we are now in the third year let us see how we are doing well the first year came and went we promised the deficit would be lower than 154 billion it came in at 107 billion first year on track ahead of schedule think back to those grammrudmanhollings charts i had up here a minute ago what a change on track ahead of schedule second year came second year we promised deficits below 174 billion this shows 57 billion the good news is this is probably going to be 30 billion this is great news for america we are over a 100 billion ahead how in the world did that happen well it is pretty straightforward we had this working model that we put into place back in 1995 here is our theory our theory was that if we curtailed the growth of the american spending we left the money in the pockets of the people we did not want to hear about tax increases instead we curtailed the growth of government spending if we curtailed the growth of government spending that meant washington was going to spend less so they would borrow less when they borrowed less that meant more money available in the private sector well if there is more money available in the private sector more money available moans lower interest rates lower interest rates would mean people would buy more houses and cars and if they bought more houses and cars other people would have to go to work building the houses and cars and that would be a long ways toward solving the welfare problems because of course they would leave the welfare rolls go to work and start paying taxes the bottom line is that theory that working theory of curtailing the growth of government spending so washington borrows less leaving more available in the private sector keeping the interest rates down so people will buy more houses and cars so others will have job opportunities building those houses and cars the model worked and that is why we are so far ahead of schedule here in the second year it led to a booming economy and we hear in the news now that the economy is booming and making us all work absolutely part of this is the booming economy that is making it work part of the reason the economy is booming is because the interest rates have stayed down and here is part of the picture why well that was the second year on track ahead of schedule we are now in the third year the third year we promised a deficit below 139 billion and i would like to make a projection here now tonight my chart shows 90 billion deficit next year or in the fiscal year we are now working in i would like to predict that that number is going to read zero i would like to suggest that in fact we are going to find out in the next few months that the budget is going to be balanced in fiscal year 1998 fiscal year 1999 at the latest if we just stay with the economy the way it is now no big boom no massive downturn if it just stays just the way it is right now and we continue to hold spending in check we will have a balanced budget as soon as next year folks we are not only on target we are in the third year of a 7year plan to balance the federal budget and we are not only on track but we are significantly ahead of schedule to the point where we can both balance the budget and provide tax relief for the american people great news for america and like i said it is just great to look at these numbers and be able to talk positive about what has happened out here in spite of all the rest of the stuff if you were tuned in earlier and you saw the bickering that went on on this floor just before we got here and took over for this hour all of the partisan bickering aside everything else that has happened out here the bottom line is if we look at the war the war to balance the federal budget and preserve this nation for the future generations we are winning the war right now and it is almost over now i have heard a lot in the news media that the only thing going on is the economy is booming and in fact there is a lot of folks that would like to say well washington is still so fouled up and the only thing going on is the economy is booming well i brought a chart with me to help see that in fact there are two parts to this thing working one is the economy and certainly we do not want to take anything away from that but the other one is again things have changed since 1995 in the 7 years before republicans took over in 1995 the average growth in spending for the federal government was 5 2 percent since republicans have taken over and in the first 7 years of the republicans including the balance of 4 years have not yet occurred growth is 3 2 percent so under the first 7 years of republican control 3 2 percent growth under the last 7 years democrat control 5 2 percent growth now what does this really mean there is a couple of things that are pretty significant in this chart first the american people have been told repeatedly that there are draco nian cuts in washington well the first thing i would point out is that there are no cuts spending in washington is still going up by 3 2 percent but the growth in government spending has been curtailed by 40 percent that is about a 40percent reduction in the growth of government spending that is good news and that is part of what has led us to success on the other side we see in real dollars or inflationadjusted dollars before we got here was going up about 1 8 percent per year and it is now going up about 0 6 so it has been about a twothirds reduction in the growth of government spending the idea that there are massive draconian cuts in washington programs is nonsense in fact do we still have a long ways to go to get the growth of government spending completely under control yes is the answer to that question we still have a way to go there is a lot of very conservative republicans who are saying the budget agreement is no good because and you can fill in the blank for what they put in they would like this blue area to read zero they would like absolutely no growth in government spending and if i were perfectly honest about it i probably fall into that category i would prefer less growth in government spending and let the people keep more of their own money and decide how to spend it themselves but i do not think that means we should look away from the progress that has been made and there clearly has been progress made reducing the growth in government spending putting us in the third year of a 7year plan to balance the federal budget and being on track and ahead of schedule that is not all bad that is good and we are on the right track we have turned a very significant corner for the future of this great nation that we live in i would like to put this all in perspective another way if when we came to washington dc instead of doing our jobs we played basketball and golf what would have happened and that is what this chart shows this is what we found when we got to washington in 1995 when the american people made that change the revolt of 1994 rejecting the tax increases of 1993 rejecting the broken promises of the early 1990s and late 1980s this is what we found the deficit was about 175 180 billion at that point and this red line shows you what would have happened had we decided to play basketball and golf and not done our job out here but instead of doing that in the first 12 months we made some progress and it wasthere was no bullets fired but it was just short of a war some folks remember what was called a government shutdown and all the negative cutting medicare stuff and all of the negative misinformation that was put out of this city we did go through a war at the end of 12 months this yellow line shows how far we would come if we quit at that point we could not quit at that point because the job was not done the green line dhows the plan that we laid in place to balance the federal budget and again thinking back to the grammrudmanhollings and how they never hit their targets the blue line shows you where we actually are today this is how much progress has been made this is what would have happened if we did nothing this is what did happen in the first 12 months progress that was made we did not quit this is the plan and this is where we are what great news for america we are winning this war we are winning the war to preserve the future of this nation what other nations could not do with military power we almost did to ourselves by running up such a huge debt that we would have no ability to repay it this ii not the end of the picture and again i point out where we had this discussion a little bit after the budget is balanced when we reach zero when we are no longer overdrawing our checkbook the job is not done we still have a 5 3 trillion debt staring us in the face and the logical question is what are you going to do about that well before we answer that question i think we ought to pause long enough to applaud the progress that has been made there has not been a balanced budget in this community since 1969 there has not been a tax cut in this community since 1982 there has been a lot of tax increases but no tax cuts so before we go on to what is next let us at least pause long enough to recognize that from 1995 forward things have changed in this community and i would encourage anyone watching tonight and i would encourage my colleagues to congratulate each other on what has happened out here in washington and the change that has occurred since 1995 it should be a tribute to the american people is who it should be a tribute to because had they not changed what was going on in washington by electing different people the same stuff would be going on again there is no reason to believe anything different what is next well we still have a 5 4 trillion debt staring us in the face we introduced last week a bill called the national debt repayment act and what the national debt repayment act does is it recognizes that we are soon going to have a balanced budget and after we balance the budget it caps the growth in government spending at a rate 1 percent lower than the rate of revenue growth by capping the growth in government spending 1 percent lower than the rate of revenue growth that creates a surplus the surplus is taken twothirds to pay down the debt and onethird to further reduce taxes it is the national debt repayment act i am happy to say there is currently about 100 cosponsors in the house of representatives newt gingrich john"], [4.96457505505532e-05, 4.96457505505532e-05, 0, "i turn our attention now to the question that i get asked quite regularly after i get done talking about the tax cuts and they are very concerned that we are not destroying this nation to do it i start tonight by talking about how we got into the situation we are in today where we have a 5 3 trillion debt staring us in the face this chart i brought with me shows the growth of the debt and how from 1960 to 1980 it did not really grow very much but from 1980 forward it has grown a lot the chart ends in 1995 and we can see how fast the debt climbed in particular from the late seventies and the early eighties on through the year 1995 it has led us to a point where we are 5 3 trillion in debt by the way a lot of people look at this and say well if i am a democrat i go 1980 that is ronald reagan it must be reagans fault if i am a republican i go the democrats controlled congress during all those years and they spent out of control so it is the democrats fault the facts of the matter are that it is an american problem it is time we put our partisanship aside and figure out how to solve the problem for the good of the future of this great nation that we live in it is a very real problem and i think it is clear from looking at this picture that this problem cannot be allowed to continue this picture is the reason i left the private sector a very good job in a very good business providing job opportunities for people as a homebuilder i left the profession and ranfor office because i knew this would bring us down as a nation if we did not do something about it i brought a board along that shows the number because a lot of folks have never seen how big this number is we are currently 5 3 trillion in debt as a nation this next line shows if we divide that debt up amongst all the people so everybody pays just their share of the debt 5 3 trillion divided by the people in the country is 20 000 for every man woman and child in america let me say that another way this government the people that have been here in washington since 1980 saw fit to spend 20 000 more than they collected in taxes for virtually every single american man woman and child in the whole country for a family of five like mine this nation has borrowed on our behalf 100 000 we are in debt 20 000 for every man woman and child in america and 100 000 for a family of five like mine and the real problem with that is this is a real debt interest is being paid on it a family of five like mine this year will pay 580 a month every month to do nothing but pay the interest on that federal debt as a matter of fact one dollar out of every six that the federal government spends i e one dollar out of every six that they collect out of your pocket in taxes one dollar out of every six does nothing but pay the interest on this federal debt it is not just income taxes where they are paying that 580 a month if you do something as simple as walk into the store and buy a loaf of bread the store owner makes a small profit on that loaf of bread and of course when the store owner makes a small profit part of that profit is taxed and it gets sent out here to washington to pay interest on that federal debt this is a very very serious problem that must be addressed in this nation how did we get here well each and every year since 1969 this government has overdrawn its checkbook it is not a lot different from your checkbook or any other family in america when they will do their bills and figure out their checkbooks each month the government takes in a certain amount of money and writes out checks when they write out checks for more money than they have in their checkbook what they do is borrow the money and of course that adds to the debt each and every year since 1969 we have not had one single year where the federal government did not spend more money than it had in its checkbook that is a pretty staggering statement since 1969 we have not had one single year where washington did not spend more money than it had in its checkbook if that were our home or any home of any of the families across america the banks would certainly have foreclosed and stopped the checking account before now but in washington they have just kept borrowing and borrowing and borrowing and that is what has led us to the 5 3 trillion debt i think it is very significant to talk about what happened during the 1980s and the 1990s that led us to this position and before 1995 what happened to get us into this mess well time and time again washington laid into place a plan to balance the federal budget and how many times did the american people hear that phrase balance the federal budget the grammrudmanhollings bill of 1995 and i have the 1997 one up here this blue line shows what they promised the american people they promised they would get to a balanced budget by 1993 the red line shows what they actually did when they promised the people they were going to have a balanced budget and did this the american people became critical of washington and it is very understandable that criticism that was leveled against washington because they promised one thing and did something different entirely and that is why that is what led up to the change in congress in 1994 that is what brought the american people to change control of the house of representatives and change control of the senate i mean in all fairness what they did is turn the house of representatives from democrat control into republican control and they changed the senate into republican control and in all fairness they left a democrat president in this mix so what the american people saw fit to do was say we have rejected this idea we have rejected this group of people that have promised us repeatedly to get to a balanced budget but did something different every time so we got to 1993 and we were looking at this picture where in fact they had not met their promise and the budget was not balanced so washington made a decision about what to do it is very different than 1997 in 1993 when they looked at this picture and saw that they wanted to balance the budget they raised taxes they concluded that they could not control washington spending so the only alternative if they were serious about getting to a balanced budget was to raise taxes so they raised the social security taxes on senior citizens they raised the gasoline tax by 4 3 cents a gallon but they did not spend the money for extra roads or infrastructure or to provide a better mechanism to get product from one place of production to the marketplace they raised it by 4 3 cents a gallon and did not spend the money on building roads on top of that they tacked on another 2 5 percent that would have expired and that money is not actually getting spent to build roads either social security taxes went up marginal tax rates went up i think a are getting a pretty clear picture here we have broken promises because washington could not curtail its spending and we have raised taxes as the logical solution they concluded back in 1993 as the right way to get to a balanced budget the american people in 1994 said wrong that is not what we want we do not want these broken promises and we do not want tax increases we want washington to control its spending appetite and they elected a new group to congress in 1995 we laid out a plan and we promised the american people again that we were going to balance the budget and the american people were skeptical to say the least but our plan is this blue line this is the deficit stream that we promised to the american people we are now in the third year of this 7year plan to balance the federal budget and i think the american people should be asking how are they doing they are 3 years in do they warrant our consideration to allow them to stay or should we throw them out and get a new group in there too we are in the third year to balance the federal budget we are not only on track to balancing the federal budget but we are so far ahead of schedule from what we promised that we will probably have our first balanced budget in fiscal year 1998 4 years ahead of what was promised this picture down here on track ahead of schedule fulfilling the promises made to the american people is very different than this picture up here i would add that in the face of this picture in the face of washington finally curtailing the growth of washington spending so that we can actually stay on track and get to a balanced budget sooner not later sooner than promised we have also laid this tax cut package that i was explaining earlier in the hour on the table so we are not only reducing taxes we are reaching a balanced budget ahead of schedule so the answer to the constituents question when they ask me are we wrecking america by cutting taxes the answer is definitively no if washington just curtails the growth of spending we reach a point where we can both balance the budget and reduce taxes at the same time and when we say reduce taxes it is very simple that means let the people keep more of their own money instead of giving it out here to washington that means we understand that the people can do a better job spending their money than the people out here in washington i have another way to show this same thing and it is a similar statement here but it is another way to look at it to understand how it is that we have been able to both balance the budget and cut taxes at the same time this red line shows how fast spending was growing before 1995 before the american people put a new group in control of the house of representatives in 1995 this red line started going up a little slower the spending growth of washington started going up at a slower rate it is still going up and to all our constituents that are concerned that medicare medicaid or some of those important programs are going away well no spending is as a matter of fact still going up faster than some of us would like to see at the same time the blue line kept going up as fast or faster so when spending started going up at a slower rate and revenue started going up at a faster rate it is easy to see that we are going to start running a surplus in the near term again the good news is we will have the first tax cut in 16 years we have the first balanced budget since 1969 and medicare has been restored for our senior citizens there is another important chart to take a look at here because it really emphasizes how different things are i had a lot of my constituents say well you know mark you guys are actually lucky the economy is doing so good that you all are going to look good no matter what you do out there while there are a couple of things to think about in response to that first the economy has done good between 1969 and today and it has never led to a balanced budget every time the economy has performed well in the past washington saw the extra revenues coming in and acted very quickly to spend the extra revenues on every program they could think of this congress has acted very differently in the face of a very strong economy we curtailed the growth in spending this chart shows how fast spending was going up before we got here 5 2 percent annual growth rate this shows how fast it is going up under the new house of representatives under republican control and it is important to note that at the same time the economy has been very strong the growth of washington spending has been curtailed this chart is important for another reason a lot of folks say well mark when you are curtailing or cutting washington spending and they call it cuts it is important to note that washington spending is still going up again i emphasize too fast for some of our likings myself included but washington spending is still going up but it is going up at a much slower rate than it was before when washington spending growth is curtailed that means washington spends less money if washington spends less money that means they borrow less money they overdraw their checkbook by less when they borrow less money out of the private sector that leaves more money available in the private sector and from here it gets pretty easy more money available in the private sector means the interest rates will stay down with the interest rates down of course people buy more houses and cars and they have a better chance of living the american dream and when they buy more houses and cars i get excited when i talk about this part when they buy more houses and cars of course that means that there will be job opportunities for our kids because somebody has to build those houses and cars and that means that my kids can have the hope and dream of living the american dream right here in our nation they will not have to go to a pacific rim country china or someplace else to live the american dream when we see this sort of thing happening washington borrows less money more money available in the private sector means lower interest rates people again have the chance of living the american dream when they buy those houses and cars that is job opportunities and that is what is going to keep our kids right here home in america where they belong this chart i cannot emphasize the significance and importance of understanding that we have two things going on out here at the same time that has allowed us to get to our first balanced budget since 1969 and lower taxes at the same time the strong economy coupled with curtailing the growth of washington spending has led us to this point and it is a very nice spot to be at the next question i typically hear at my town hall meetings is who gets credit for all of this stuff the first answer to that question is very straightforward i learned in washington that there is absolutely no end to what we can accomplish if we are willing to give the credit for doing it to someone else so my first answer to our constituents is i do not care who gets the credit this is so good for america it does not matter who gets the credit it is the right thing for our country a balanced budget lower taxes medicare restored those are the right things so it does not matter who gets credit i also brought documentation here as to what was going on when we came here in 1995 and what would have happened if we had come and played golf tennis basketball and did not do our jobs on this chart we can see where the deficit was heading when we got here in 1995 this red line shows what the deficit would be as we move toward the year 2002 had we done nothing this is what would have happened the yellow line shows what would have happened after our first 12 months in the first 12 months we made progress and again i think it is important to remember those first 12 months that was the 100 days that was the contract with america where we did all kinds of things in the first day and those 100 days were many many hours out here lots of disagreement from side to side as to what should be done but what it did do is it brought this projeated deficit line down to this yellow line well we boldly laid the green line into place and we boldly promised the american people that even though we were looking at this picture we were going to make this happen i am happy to report that when we got done with it we are now 3 years into the plan and we not only achieved our target the green line but we are far ahead of schedule from what was promised again when we understand all of these pieces of pie put together curtailing the growth of washington spending more money available in the private sector which keeps the interest rates down people buy more houses and cars that is more job opportunities so they leave the welfare rolls when we see all of these pieces fitting together it is pretty clear how we can be here talking about the first balanced budget since 1969 in addition to the first tax cut and medicare being restored i have one more thing that i think is important to talk about because i have talked about the past and the present i talked about how it was before 1995 with broken promises and tax increases and how it is now in the third year of a 7year plan to balance the budget where we are on track and ahead of schedule and we are also providing the first tax cut in 16 years and medicare restored i think the logical question is what next where do we go from here and what kind of problems do we still have facing america well first even after we get to a balanced budget we still have a 5 3 trillion debt staring us in the face i can see in the gallery above me here this evening some young people if we do not do anything about that 5 3 trillion debt it would be like the parents that are sitting up there simply passing this debt on to their children so the first thing we need to think about after we get to a balanced budget is get on a payment plan so we repay that 5 3 trillion debt we have drafted legislation in our office that is called the national debt repayment act that effectively puts us on a home mortgage repayment plan it is not a lot different than the people who used to build homes with us and when they got the home done went to the bank borrowed the money and put it on a 30year repayment plan that is effectively what we have done it goes like this after the budget is balanced we cap the growth of washington spending at a rate at least 1 percent below the rate of revenue growth i have a picture here that shows what happens if the red line the spending line is going up at a slower rate than the blue line again if the revenue line the blue line is going up faster than the red line the spending line that creates a surplus it creates a little gap between those two lines it creates a surplus here is what our bill does it says recognizing that simply by controlling washington spending growth we can create this surplus we are going to take twothirds of the surplus and make a house payment we are going to make that payment on the 5 3 trillion debt so we are going to start making mortgage payments on this debt that has been run up over the last 15 to 20 years if this plan is followed twothirds of the money twothirds of this surplus will literally repay the entire federal debt by the year 2026 it does something else that is very important as well when we are repaying the debt we are putting the money back into the social security trust fund that has been taken out over the last 15 years it is important to understand that social security today is taking more money out of paychecks of people than what it is giving back out to our senior citizens in benefits that extra money that is coming in is supposed to be set aside in a savings account so that when the baby boom generation gets to retirement there is enough money there that they can go to the savings account get the money and make good on the social security promises it should come as no surprise so anyone that has followed washington that the money that has come in for social security that is supposed to be in the savings account is not there it has been spent on all kinds of washington programs and the social security trust fund is now all part of the 5 3 trillion debt the national debt repayment act repays the entire federal debt so when we are repaying the federal debt we are putting the money back into the social security trust fund so the national debt repayment act restores the social security trust fund for our senior citizens the other third of the surplus twothirds is going to make these payments on the national debt the other onethird is being used to reduce taxes each year for our working families in america so the good news is we look to the future with the national debt repayment act our seniors can rest assured that their social security will be safe because the national debt repayment act puts the money back in that has been taken out of the social security trust fund our children can be assured that the entire federal debt would be repaid think of this legacy we could pass this nation on to our children absolutely debtfree for people in the work force today they can count on additional tax cuts lord only knows i have heard enough different ideas of which taxes to cut next my personal preference is that we eliminate the marriage tax penalty and maybe have some acrosstheboard tax cuts beyond that but the good news is think of the wonderful fight we are about to have which taxes should we reduce and how far down should we take those taxes and how different that fight is from 1993 when the debate was which taxes shall we raise and how high we should raise them this is a good debate to have to all the folks upset about any portion of the tax cut plan because it should have been a different way i would simply remind us how different this fight is from 1993 where how high we should raise taxes and which one was the debate as opposed to 1997 where we are having this debate about which taxes to cut so the national debt repayment act provides surpluses as we go forward use twothirds of those surpluses to make a mortgage type payment on the federal debt the other onethird goes to tax cuts if enacted it guarantees our children a debtfree nation a legacy of a debtfree country our senior citizens social security would be restored and the people in the w6rk force today can look forward to additional tax cuts as we move forward not a bad plan for 3 years into this new congress we have gone away from the broken promises of the past and the raising taxes to the first balanced budget since 1969 and the first tax cut in 16 years and we are now moving forward to the next step which is repaying the federal debt we can look forward to passing this nation on to our children debtfree i yield to the

would talk about why it is so important that we follow through on that commitment and follow through on that commitment with a series of simple questions that i hear in the south suburbs and the south side of chicago the area that i have the privilege of representing that is do americans feel that it is fair that our tax code imposes a higher tax on married working couples do americans feel it is fair that 21 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married do americans feel that is fair that this couple pays higher taxes than an identical couple that lives together outside of marriage do americans feel it is fair that our tax code actually provides an incentive to get divorced because the only way today to avoid the marriage tax penalty is to get divorced and to file that paperwork that is wrong it is unfair frankly really it is immoral that our tax code punishes societys most basic institution for 21 million married working couples that is 1 400 in higher taxes let me give an example of a south suburban couple from illinois that suffers the marriage tax penalty the gentleman in the couple is a machinist at caterpillar that is where they make the big heavy earthmoving equipment in joliet this machinist makes 35 500 if he is single under our tax code he files and of course with the standard exemption and deduction he is in the 15 percent tax bracket he meets a schoolteacher a schoolteacher in the public schools she has an identical income of 35 500 if she stayed single just like her machinist fiance she would be in the 15 percent tax bracket under our tax code if they choose to get married they will file jointly when they file jointly because they combine their income and their combined income is 61 000 that pushes them into a higher tax bracket they are now taxed in the 28 percent tax bracket just because they are married producing an almost 1 400 marriage tax penalty just because they are married that is wrong that this couple just because they choose to get married pay higher taxes if we think about it what is the bottom line here we propose the marriage tax elimination act which puts a working married couple like our machinist and schoolteacher on parity with an identical married couple that lives outside marriage in 1996 this house of representatives led the way by working to provide an adoption tax credit to help families provide a loving home for a child in need of adoption in 1997 this house led the way in convincing the president and the senate that we should provide a 500 per child tax credit which will benefit 3 million illinois children that helped families of course this year we can help families again by strengthening marriage and no longer punishing marriage let me share how we propose eliminating the marriage tax penalty the marriage tax elimination act h r 3734 is very simple it is legislation which essentially doubles relief for working married couples by doubling the standard deduction from its current level of 4 150 to 8 300 and also doubling the income tax threshold which of course you file in the 15 percent if you are single and just over 24 000 doubling that to a little over 49 000 so when you are single and you choose to get married your tax essentially doubles your rates are double the income that brings fairness to the tax code that is a very simple way of eliminating the marriage tax penalty under the marriage tax elimination act doubling the standard deduction doubling rates so married taxpayers are not punished just because they are married that is a simple solution this house of course made a commitment about 2 months ago to address and eliminate the marriage tax penalty our friend the president he has a proposal of his own which he says is a better idea he says we should just expand the child care tax credit for families that are lowerincome and of course happen to have children so i thought i would compare for this machinist and this schoolteacher in joliet illinois which is really better under the presidents proposal under the presidents proposal for a child tax credit those couples or families that have qualified for the presidents expanded tax credit and they already have one he just wants to make it a little bigger they would see about a 350 net increase on takehome pay money to spend on child care i looked into this and asked some local day care providers in joliet what does that mean they said that the average weekly day care cost is about 127 in joliet so under the presidents proposal for a working married couple with a child who goes to day care they would see just less than 3 weeks of day care financed by the presidents proposal if we compare this with this machinist and schoolteacher eliminating the marriage tax penalty 1 400 with the same weekly day care costs for this machinist and schoolteacher if they have a child in day care it is almost 3 months worth of day care so which is better 3 months or 3 weeks mr speaker i ask members to make a bipartisan commitment to eliminate the marriage tax penalty this house of representatives made a commitment earlier this summer to address the marriage tax penalty and make elimination the centerpiece of this years budget let us follow through on that commitment let us help working families let us eliminate the marriage tax penalty for 21 million couples 1 400 that is real money for real people let us help married couples and eliminate the marriage tax penalty now i rise today to highlight what is arguably the most unfair provision in the unitedstates tax code the marriage tax penalty i want to thank you for your long term interest in bringing parity lo the tax burden imposed on working married couples compared to a couple living together outside of marriage in january president clinton gave his state of the union address outlining many of the things he wants to do with the budget surplus a surplus provided by the bipartisan budget agreement which cut waste put americas fiscal house in order and held washingtons feet to the fire to balance the budget while president clinton paraded a long list of new spending totaling at least 46 48 billion in new programswe believe that a top priority should be returning the budget surplus to americas families as additional middleclass tax relief this congress has given more tax relief to the middle class and working poor than any congress of the last half century"], [0.00040842898306436837, 0.00040842898306436837, 0, "today we continue a discussion that began in 1996 it deals with this city this is a picture of washington dc and it deals with what we really can expect washington to do and the kind of balance that we need to strive for in this country between what we expect from washington what we expect from the private sector what we expect from individuals and perhaps what we can expect from faithbased and religious and volunteer organizations in america in many cases i believe we have moved too much power to this town we have asked washington to do all kinds of things that perhaps it is not best equipped to do we saw some of this last week when we heard the president articulate a vision for education a vision that i believe moves power authority and control from the local level from the parental level back to this community back to this town and it says the way we improve education in america is we empower washington and we empower the bureaucrats in washington to make decisions we used this chart for the first time or this picture for the first time in 1996 when we talked about the crisis that this nation was facing in welfare because what we had done in welfare is we had moved decisionmaking away from the local level where we were best equipped to help those in need and we moved it to washington we moved it to buildings here in washington so that when the state of michigan or when the state of wisconsin wanted to design a program that they felt best met the needs of their citizens they had to come to a building over here and a bureaucrat in washington who had maybe never been in wisconsin maybe never been in california maybe never been in michigan and say can i do this in my state and the bureaucrats in washington were empowered to make the decisions yesterday i had the opportunity to meet with a new program in the state of michigan where in my home county they are working on what they call project zero which is to move everybody off of welfare it is a partnership it is a partnership between local agencies it is a partnership with the state and it is a partnership in a volunteer way with faithbased institutions to reach out and embrace those families that need help and to lift them up in a permanent and in a meaningful way off of welfare those are the kinds of programs that i expect we will see over the next 12 18 24 months that will have a dramatic improvement in the welfare situation in this country now after we have made that change in welfare which moves power back from washington back to the states and more important back to the local communities where we can have these creative mergers of people coming together to help others in the community we find that the president does not really believe that the era of big government is over he now believes that the era of big government has moved from a failure in welfare and it is kind of like we did not learn our lesson we are going to take that bureaucracy now and create and expand the department of education over the last 9 months we have had hearings around the country and we know that that model does not work we know that the model of moving power to washington and moving power to bureaucrats in washington is not the answer these bureaucrats are knowledgeable talented people but they cannot address the problems at the local level in hearings that we have had in new york city that we have had in chicago that we have had in cleveland that we had a couple of weeks ago in los angeles and phoenix the answer is very clear the way that we improve education is we empower parents we move decisionmaking back to the local level we focus on basic academics and we drive dollars back into the classroom and not into a bureaucracy and into bureaucrats as wellmeaning as they may be the system today is fairly clear and what the president proposes is fairly clear it is the myth it is the myth of the magical president who believes that by having good intentions in washington and outlining wonderfulsounding programs and moving dollars to washington and moving responsibility to washington we can actually solve the problems that we have in education there is no doubt that in certain parts of our country education is in crisis if we take a look at some of the statistics this is not a debate about whether we need to improve education or whether we need to put a focus on education the statistics are clear onehalf of all adult americans are functionally illiterate two weeks ago we had a hearing in california think about it twentyfive percent of the students that enter higher education in the state of california need remedial education this is kids in 8th grade this is kids in 10th grade these are kids going into higher education twentyfive percent of them when they enter the institution of higher education need remedial education what does that mean that means that they are entering into college and they cannot read or write at an 8th grade level sixtyfour percent of 12th graders do not read at a proficient level in international comparisons unitedstates students scored worse in math than any other country except for jordan if we take a look outside of this building in washington dc it is also not an issue of money we spend about 8 300 per child in the city of washington dc and we have some of the lowest test scores in the country in the state of michigan we spend about 5 400 per student so it is not let us pour more money into these programs or into these cities it is let us focus on the basics when we have gone around the country the exciting thing that we have noticed is that we can go into many areas that we would identify as having atrisk kids the kids that maybe when we take a look at their environment and a whole series of factors we might be saying they are at risk and they are at risk because maybe they are in an environment where it is most difficult for them to learn the exciting thing about this is as we go into these areas we see schools we see teachers and we see parents and most importantly we see some of the greatest kids in this country and they are learning and they are learning successfully but it is because of the schools and it does not make a difference whether it is a public school or a private school or whether it is a charter school we have seen examples of all of these but when the schools make a commitment to involve the parents where they have been freed from the rules and regulations from washington and from the state so that the teachers and the administration can focus on the kids rather than the rules and regulations it works when the dollars go into the classroom rather than into paperwork it works and when the schools are focusing on basic academics it works j 1430 here is the system today and here is why i am leery about sending more money to washington and why i believe it is a myth and why i believe that in the area of education at least in washington more does not mean better remember what we have in washington today when we say education washington has been trying to help in the area of education for the last 20 years twenty years of work 760 different programs running through 39 different agencies spending about 120 billioh per year washington has been going after this problem but we have not been doing it very successfully why what is the process well we start with parents which is where we should start we should have focus on parents and kids but when we move the education system and the focus of education to washington we end up getting a whole bunch of layers in between parents kids and teachers and local school boards in washington in this model that some want to expand we have parents paying into washington about 120 billion into washington programs into washington bureaucracies 760 different programs we are worried about reading and writing washington a couple of years ago had 32 different literacy programs we still have more than 14 literacy programs 120 billion into 760 programs 39 different agencies then the washington bureaucracy all the arrows point one way in terms of putting rules and regulations and dollars back on state and local school boards but what happens when we create a program if you create a program somebody has to find out about it so we spend dollars communicating to a school board or to a state saying weve got these dollars available for these kinds of programs so we invest dollars in a communications effort school boards find out about it they do not automatically get it they have to now say i wonder if we qualify for this what do we need to do to qualify for this how do we apply they then fill out applications and it goes back to the bureaucracy the bureaucrats in washington say well you know weve got x amount of dollars weve got so many school districts applying were going to have to go through a sorting process to decide who gets this money and who does not so they go through a decisionmaking process in the awarding of grants the vice presidents national performance review outlined that in one of these grant applications in the department of education the process went through 487 different steps to move dollars from washington actually back to a school board back actually to the kids washington then sends money to a school board or to a local school district of course we cannot trust the people at the local level to do what we ask them to do so of course we have rules and regulations and we have reporting structures back into washington that says yes we received your money and yes here is proof that we spent it exactly the way you wanted us to we in washington of course cannot believe those so we have to put in place an auditing program that says make sure you keep your records because we may want to come back and audit that you actually spent the money the way we intended you to spend it the bottom line is when parents send 120 billion to washington and they funnel it through the 760 programs that we lose at least conservatively we lose at least 15 cents of the federal dollar if you take a look at how much we lose at the state and the local level as they go through the process of applying and meeting the rules and regulations in the local cost we probably lose somewhere in the neighborhood of 35 to 40 cents of each and every education dollar that goes to washington to funnel it back we are not getting the money into the classroom most of this money or a good portion of it probably 35 to 40 percent of the dollars that we think we are investing in education gets sucked up into the bureaucracy and into the paperwork and what happens is rather than school boards focusing on and working with parents as to what they need to do in their local district what we have created is a model that says kids are important but i need to meet the rules the requirements and the regulations from washington so their focus goes to a bureaucracy in washington and not to parents and not on kids we have got to break the cycle we have to focus on what ij important the basics local and parental control and getting dollars into the classroom we need to focus and we need a model where the people who are involved in education and setting the direction for education for our kids are parents kids and local leaders in the community i can say that with conviction because of the success we have seen around the country we visited the vaughn charter school in l a 2 weeks ago south central los angeles one of the lowest performing schools when it was part of the unified los angeles school district it is now a charter school it is still a public school it is still accountable to the taxpayers but what they did when they became a charter school they cut the strings of bureaucracy dr chan who is heading that school saved the school district and the number is a little bit disputed but somewhere in the neighborhood of 1 5 million but more importantly talking to the parents talking to the kids going into the classrooms sitting around a table and talking about what makes this school different today the parents dr chan and the students are all saying it is because this is the model the model is one where the school the principal and the teachers have a partnership with the parents and they are focused on the kids parents talk about we got our school back as a matter of fact it is now a neighborhood school the kids in this neighborhood were being bused all over the kids now have the choice of where they want to go to school they are now going back to this school they not only took control of the school back for the parents but it is now a neighborhood school and in a very rough part of los angeles it is kind of like a bright beacon in that community about what a local community can do when it cuts the strings from a bureaucracy and is empowered to take over a small part of its own community and it is empowered to take over a very important part of its community which is the schools there are a couple of other interesting statistics when we talk about what happens when dollars go into washington we know we lose at least 15 cents here in washington and we know that we lose at least another 20 cents when you go to the costs incurred by the local schools and the state but it is kind of interesting how these dollars get distributed dollars do not follow kids dollars go all over the place if you are in alaska sending dollars to washington and increasing the washington bureaucracy is a good deal because even though you maybe lose 40 cents of every dollar you send to washington with alaska when you send 1 in you get 3 12 back so the dollars coming in the share back to you is very positive it is a disproportionate share back to alaska if you are in connecticut it does not really pay connecticut gets all of 39 cents back to that state if you are in mississippi you get 2 41 if you are in new mexico you get 2 34 if you are close to new mexico in nevada too bad you only get 39 cents back so it is a huge shell game in washington that is not focused on kids it is not focused on improving education it is focused on bureaucrats and politicians trying to do something that really parents and local school districts can do a whole lot better as we take a look at this this system does not work when we take a look at what is going on and some of the proposals that the president has to improve learning to improve education it is interesting one of the proposals he has and i have oversight over this area is the president proposes 809 million for the corporation for national and community service national and community service it sounds great our volunteers through the corporation for national service cost us as taxpayers about 27 000 apiece or as high as 27 000 they are going to go out and they are going to get tutors i think that is a laudable objective schools are doing this today community groups are involved and i amnot sure what the federal government can do to help and assist in that process we fund and send money through the corporation for national service and it would be one thing if we knew where now another roughly 1 billion going into this model we know we are going to lose some of that in the structure and in the hierarchy and in the bureaucracy we also know that at least for the corporation for national service and for many of these other agencies we are not actually going to know where the money goes the corporation for national service this is an agency that spends about 600 to 700 million per year the books still are not auditable think about it sending taxpayer dollars to an agency that was set up and was going to be the model for a government agency and how government should run but cannot have an independent accounting firm come in and audit its books that is one example the heritage foundation cites a number of other examples that says these 760 programs do not have the kind of oversight necessary to determine whether they work and where the dollars are going and whether they are efficient or not is it not interesting that we know we have a problem in reading we know that our kids are not reading at competitive standards that in certain states a high percentage of them need remedial education and rather than focusing on the real problem as to why kids are not learning in the classroom the response in washington is to create another program we have known that this has been an issue we have got 14 literacy programs and now what we are doing is we are funding an overlay of perhaps volunteers reading 2 hours per day or 2 hours per week with students but we are not asking the fundamental questions as to why are kids not learning to read in the classroom is there something going on in the classroom that is prohibiting kids from learning why do we not take a look at what is going on in the classroom before we do anvthing else and maybe moving dollars into the classroom is a more effective way of addressing this problem than putting another bandaid on an open wound maybe we ought to go back and take a look at the 14 literacy programs that are already spending over 8 billion per year from a washington level and saying why are those 14 literacy programs not driving the kinds of results that we would like to have if they are good programs and they are working why are we not putting more money into those programs if those programs are not working and we do not feel we should be putting more money into them but we should be going in this new route or in a different route why do we not take a look at eliminating those programs and getting true effectiveness into the system but no the proposal that we have in front of us is more bureaucracy in washington not critically evaluating the programs that we have in place well that is not going to work in this congress we do have in place a program which we call crossroads in education the crossroads in education project that is coming out of the committee on education and the workforce is going to do and is in the process of doing a critical analysis of these 760 programs we want to find out where the dollars go are they getting results or are they not getting results how can we make them more effective and what is working and what is wasted in education today so what does that mean it means that the first step is last year we asked the question how many programs are there nobody had ever asked that question before we did some work we did some research some other outside organizations some parts of the executive branch helped us they said 760 programs 39 agencies actually the 760 is a little old since that point in time they have identified about a hundred more programs that we have so it is somewhere in the neighborhood of 850 to 900 programs that we really have in washington but we are now going through and we are asking what is the process how is this money distributed what are the actual links back and forth between a bureaucracy and the state and a local school board how are people awarded and granted dollars what is the largest grant request you get or that you gave out what is the smallest we found a grant request for safe and drugfree schools the school district went through all of the work a very thick application and i will tell you they got their moneys worth they got a grant for 13 the government cannot even write a check for 13 but that is what the school district got maybe that went out and would have paid for lunch for the person who spent considerable time putting this grant request together 13 for a school district to develop their safe and drugfree school program think of the costs that went in we are doing that what is the largest and the smallest grant request you got what do these grant requests look like are they 2 pages are they 50 pages in some cases we found that they may be a thousand pages how much time and energy what happens to the grant requests when they come to washington how are they sorted through who reads them you then go back and you take a look at when the grants go out how much paperwork the statistics i believe that we had in our hearing in arizona 2 weeks ago was that of the 6 percentlet me find the exact quotethis was from lisa graham keegan who is arizonas superintendent of educationsaid i will say that the 8 percent arizona receives from the federal government easily accounts for more than 50 percent of the work in my department and school districts the paperwork they receive 8 percent of their moneyremember this 120 billion is only about 5 or 6 percent of what any school district gets but on a national average some get more some get less here in arizona it is about 8 percent of their total dollars come from washington and about 50 percent of their paperwork is that a good investment what do bureaucrats in washington really know about what needs to be done in arizona so what is the paperwork that goes back and forth we have had meetings and we asked superintendents to tell us about their paperwork and one of the things that they keep coming back with is we appreciate the money we get from washington in some cases it does some good and we can work in those areas but the real problem is when we take a look at our local school district and we take a look at the needs that we have if we had more flexibility to use that money in different ways we would spend it in different ways than what you are mandating that we spend it on so we know that this process is not an ideal process fifty billion dollars of more spending in washington is not the way to improve education spending 50 on education may be a worthwhile effort it is probably a good exercise spending it at the state and the local level where you have more control and direction about what you need in your community and actually getting the dollars into the classroom probably makes a lot more sense recognize that when we spend and say we are going to spend 50 billion in washington maybe only 25 to 30 billion will actually make it back into the classroom twenty billion is going to get lost somewhere else in the process a couple of other proposals that the president is talking about that i think need serious consideration talking about school construction as soon as we put in federal dollars any amount of federal dollars into a local school construction washington will come in and mandate what contractors need to be paid on an hourly basis for the work that they perform in your school district it is called davisbacon mandated from washington what you will pay we have an elaborate system in the department of labor that is not very good but that tries to track wages in thousands of different communities around this nation in a number of different construction categories and that is what you have to pay in other projects where you do not have davisbacon we go through this kind of complex way of determining how mucha project will cost it is called competitive bidding school districts cannot competitively bid they have to pay davisbacon wages so in effect when you go on a construction project with federal dollars or partially funded with federal dollars you lose again about 15 percent of your purchasing power by being required to pay the wages established here in washington versus what you may be able to get in a competitive bid i enjoy the discussion about the hope scholarships making education available to more students on a longer basis i think is a worthwhile goal saying that washington is now going to provide scholarships for those that maintain a b average the irs today cannot track our income tax system our income tax code just think of what wonderful work they are now going to have also tryingto match tax deductions with information from schools indicating that yes these people did maintain a b average and that b averages across the country are consistent so that the same b that you get in michigan is equivalent to a b that you get in arizona it is going to create a lot more work for bureaucrats and it is going to move a lot less money into the classroom the evidence is clear we need to focus on education but more compelling is the case that rather than increasing and building and expanding this city in washington the keys to improving education is moving dollars and power away from this city and moving it back to parents moving it back to local school boards and empowering teachers it is not only school boards it is teachers that want control of their classroom it is the parents that want their schools back they do not want to come to washington to take a look or to fight for what they want to do in their classroom they want control of their schools they know specifically what they need for their kids and their community the needs of this country are so diverse we need to be able to have the flexibility to tailor the programs for our kids from one city and one community to the next and we need to empower parents that is not a concept or a theory we know that it works take a look at the schools that are working take a look at the schools that are excelling and that is the bright spot in the picture in education yes there is some bad news there is some information that says we ought to be worried about this and that in some parts of the nation education may be in a state of crisis but the good news is that we can look at models of success and we can learn from those models of success we can learn what the characteristics are and we can then tailor federal policies and rules and regulations or whatever to empower that kind of change and reform to happen at the local level and what we learn is very simple parents basics and getting dollars into the classroom empowering parents instead of empowering bureauctats dollars to kids not to bureaucracy fundamental basic education not the latest education fads it is a key issue it is an important issue it is going to be a vigorous debate i think in the end kids and parents will win and politicians and bureaucrats in washington will lose that is the system that works

americans feel that it is fair that our tax code imposes a highertax penalty on marriage do americans feel that it is fair that 21 million married working couples suffer a tax penalty of 1 400 more in taxes just because they are married do americans feel that it is right that our tax code actually provides an incentive to get divorced the answer is pretty clear not only is the marriage tax penalty unfair but it is wrong that our tax code punishes a married working couple with two incomes with higher taxes than an identical couple that chooses to live together outside of marriage twentyone million married working couples suffer an average marriage tax penalty of 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married some would say why does that happen under our current tax code a married working couple with two incomes usually files jointly when they do their combined income pushes them into a higher tax bracket let me give an example here of a south suburban couple i represent the south side of chicago the south suburbs in illinois as well as a lot of bedroom communities and rural areas let me give ahn example of a couple that lives in joliet say you have a machinist who is working at the joliet caterpillar manufacturing plant where they make heavy industrial equipment like bulldozers and cranes and earth movers this machinist is making 30 500 a year in average income if he is single after standard deductions and exemptions he is in the 15 percent tax bracket being taxed at the 15 percent rate say he meets a gal and she is a public school teacher in the joliet public schools she has an identical income this machinist who works the caterpillar and this joliet public school teacher decide to get married she has an income of 30 500 as well when you combine their income when they file jointly it produces a 1 400 average marriage tax penalty is that fair just because this machinist at caterpillar and this joliet public school teacher decide to get married that they should pay higher taxes just because they are married i think it is wrong that our tax code punishes this machinist and this school teacher i believe we should make it a priority to eliminate the marriage tax penalty if we think abdut it in joliet illinois in the district i am proud to represent for this machinist and public schoolteacher 1 400 is a lot of money that is one years tuition at joliet junior college it is 3 months of day care at a local day care center it is several months worth of car payments and a significant portion of a down payment on a new home the marriage tax elimination act which now has 235 cosponsors would eliminate the marriage tax penalty and eliminate it now because we would give married working couples with two incomes the power of choice to choose to file as two singles or jointly whichever is to their financial advantage the bottom line is each individual this machinist and this schoolteacher under the marriage tax elimination act would be able to enjoy the lower tax rate and would be at the 15 percent rate allowing them to keep that 1 400 there are a number of ideas out there for tax relief this year president clinton talkd about the need for child care in fact he talks about expanding the current child care tax credit let us compare what that means under the presidents child care tax credit which only families with children with incomes less than 50 000 would qualify for the presidents plan would provide 358 in extra takehome pay at the end of the year for the average couple that would qualify the marriage tax elimination act as an alternative to the presidents plan would actually provide 1 400 if we think about that at a joliet day care center for this machinist and schoolteacher living in joliet that is 3 weeks worth of day care under the presidents proposal or 3 months worth of day care under the marriage tax elimination act the question is which is better 3 weeks under the presidents plan or 3 months under elimination of the marriage tax penalty act the bottom line is we should be working to eliminate the marriage tax penalty it is wrong that our tax code punishes marriage with higher taxes we should make it the centerpiece of our budget discussions i am pretty proud that this congress our new majority which has been in place for 3 years has provided more tax relief for middleclass families than any congress in recent history in 1996 we of course provided for the adoption tax credit to help families provide a loving home for children in 1997 we provided a 500perchild tax credit which for illinois families for 3 million illinois kids would allow 1 5 billion in higher takehome pay for illinois families this year let us stop punishing marriage let us make elimination of the marriage tax penalty the number one mustdo let us make it the centerpiece let us eliminate the marriage tax penalty and do it now i rise today to highlight what is arguably the most unfair provision in the unitedstates tax code the marriage tax penalty i want to thank you for your long term interest in bringing parity to the tax burden imposed on working married couples compared to a couple living together outside of marriage in january president clinton gave his state of the union address outlining many of the things he wants to do with the budget surplus a surplus provided by the bipartisan budget agreement which cut waste put americas fiscal house in order and held washingtons feet to the fire to balance the budget while president clinton paraded a long list of new spending totaling at least 46 48 billion in new programswe believe that a top priority should be returning the budget surplus to americas families as additional middleclass tax relief this congress has given more tax relief to the middle class and working poor than any congress of the last half century i think the issue of the marriage penalty can best be framed by asking these questions do americans feel its fair that our tax code imposes a higher tax penalty on marriage do americans feel its fair that the average married working couple pays almost 1 400 more in taxes than a couple with the almost identical income living together outside of marriage is it right that our tax code provides an incentive to get divorced in fact today the only form one can file to avoid the marriage tax penalty is paperwork for divorce and that is just wrong since 1969 our tax laws have punished married couples when both spouses work for no other reason than the decision to be joined in holy matrimony more than 21 million couples a year are penalized they pay more in taxes than they would if they were single not only is the marriage penalty unfair its wrong that our tax code punishes societys most basic institution the marriage tax penalty exacts a disproportionate toll on working women and lower income couples with children in many cases it is a working womens issue let me give you an example of how the marriage tax penalty unfairly affects middle class married working couples for example a machinist at a caterpillar manufacturing plant in my home district of joliet makes 30 500 a year in salary his wife is a tenured elementary school teacher also bringing home 30 500 a year in salary if they would both file their taxes as singles as individuals they would pay 15"], [0.0006328253075480461,

and president reagan pushing for a tax bill for a new tax reform act we would not have had this that is the worst thing in my opinion that has hit this congress since i have been up here today we have an obligation to our constituents to let them know that we are listening to what they say and that we are willing to take some responsibility by endorsing a very concrete step toward slowing the rate of growth in spending and moving closer always toward the goal of what we have all been seeking what the president says he wants what the house and senate say they want and that is a balanced budget

and excise taxes it does not cover tariffs user fees voluntary premiums and other items which are not part of the internal revenue laws currently just such a rule is in place in the house to make certain that we all go on record when a tax increase is proposed however this rule does not apply to the unitedstates senate it only applies this term to the house we are just asking to bring some

close socalled loopholes because tax increases below a small amount are not subject to the twothirds requirement those of us who are working toward fundamental tax reform will not be impeded either because so long as the end result does not increase the tax burden tax reform bills will not be subjected to the supermajority requirement the tax limitation amendment makes good sense it restores discipline on a system which has spun out of control our constituents are overburdened now by a system which has for years left the doors wide open for tax increases to be slipped in as riders to all kinds of legislation we have to reverse our course and restore a sound business approach to the government by passing the tax limitation amendment thereby committing ourselves to going on record so that our constituents can see us vote either yes or no when their pocketbooks are at stake i am proud to be the lead democrat on this bill along with the gentleman from mississippi gene taylor and i urge all my colleagues to deliver some relief to the overtaxed and disenfranchised constituents today by voting the passage of the tax limitation amendment we have people from all walks of life who support this we have the american conservative union the americans for tax reform we talk about senior citizens the senior coalition united seniors association unitedstates chamber of commerce the national tax limitation committee and i could go on and on people want us to bring some discipline to this house and discipline to the taxation that takes away the money that they work so hard for i

and very little action of the sort which will dramatically change peoples lives later in an interview mr gingrich said he hoped to meet with the presidents commission soon and that he would urge its members to focus their attention on what he termed barriers to minority advancement i think that is also a very ambitious goal a very ambitious statement by the speaker i applaud that i certainly would like to do everything to help him accomplish that he wants to meet with the commission just as i would like to meet with the commission a lot of other people and i hope we will have the opportunity and pour out our recommendations to the commission but the speaker is there first i applaud his timeliness to continue quoting from the new york times article this is a quote from speaker gingrich himself what they really should design over the next year is let us look at the specific pragmatic real changes and real barriers to participation he said if we could then knock down the barriers as people participate concerns about race will dramatically decline i am reading from the new york times article that was the speakers statement to continue to quote the speaker from the article what i saidlast year was that we have to put in the context of a broader solution of affirmative outreach to individuals any effort to eliminate quotas and setasides he said and i spent the past year frankly working to develop a program that was comprehensive in other words mr gingrichs 10point program is his alternative to affirnative action his alternative to affirmative action and his proposal to do things i am sure beyond affirmative action so the speaker is to be applauded he is on board the president is to be applauded for initiating this activity let us all run to catch up with the speaker welfare reform is on the speakers list of 10 points he proposes in his 10point program that we should take the next step in welfare reform by fostering and promoting innovative local job training welfaretowork and entrylevel employment programs to move welfare recipients into the work force we have talked about welfare reform for this is our third year of discussion unfortunately we passed the congress passed i voted against it but congress passed welfare reform legislation and the president unfortunately signed it we are off and running we are off and running now and i do not find anywhere any details of any innovative local job training program the assumption was there are jobs out there you move people from welfare to work if you are moving them to work then work is there we have a great debate now here in the house and in the capitol about whether these people who are moved from welfare to work are really employees can you imagine we have talked for years about they should go to work once they go to work we say well they are not really employees are we moving them from welfare to work or are we moving them from welfare to some other category something in between work and welfare we did not know there was anything that existed if they are going to work they are employees why are certain people insisting that they not be considered employees because if they are employees in the united states of america there is a law called the fair labor standards act fair labor standards act says if you are an employee you have to be paid the minimum wage if you are an employee there are certain working conditions that you are entitled to you fall under the osha provisions occupation safety and health administration if you are an employee you have certain rights with respect to discrimination in the workplace you have certain rights with respect to sexual harassment employees in america have certain rights part of the definition of being an employee in america is that all that is there to help protect you the workplace is a place of privilege the workplace is a place as a result of the new deal and all of the legislation that we formulated over the years the workplace is not just a plantation the workplace is something we try to make a place of fairness a place where workers have a chance to earn a living without being oppressed and without being in any danger or harm and also being paid some kind of reasonable wage so welfare reform is off and running large numbers of people in new york city are on workfare they are being moved out of welfare they are already working people who are adults without children have been forced into a program called wep the work experience program the work experience program refuses to pay minimum wage this is a program that marsha motipersad was in before she died marsha motipersad a secretary of the childrens aid society until she had two heart attacks she had to leave her job in 1994 and eventually she had no resource except to go on welfare so she died working in the work experience program 22 hours a week the requirement was that she work 22 hours a week to cover her cash and food stamps benefits the cash and food stamps benefits that she received are equivalent to 250 a month according to the new york times article of tuesday june 24 i have not calculated this myself i find it hard to believe i find it hard to believe that we would require a person to work 22 hours a week for 250 a month 22 hours a week means that is 88 hours for the month 88 hours for the month to earn to be eligible for 250 so marsha motipersad who dropped dead on her job was being required towork 22 hours a week for food stamps and her cash benefits which totaled 250 a month according to the new york times this is the welfare reform that we have at present the speaker proposes in his 10point program that we have a real program innovative job training entrylevel employment programs where are they mr speaker how fast can we move how rapidly can we put them in place how many more marsha motipersads are out there how many people have died already is there something wrong with requiring a person who has had two heart attacks to go to work for her food stamps in the richest country that ever existed on the face of the earth can we not have some provision to avoid having a woman who has had two heart attacks go to work for her food stamps let me read to you from this article of june 24 in the new york times quote a 50yearold workfare participant with heart problems died on the job prompting questions about the citys ability to determine whether some of its workfare laborers might be too sick to work the worker marsha motipersad whose heart disease had forced her to leave her job in 1994 as a secretary with the childrens aid society after 17 years died of a heart attack on june 17 ms motipersad who had first been categorized as not employable she had first been called nonemployable by the human resources administration because of her health problems but she was recently recharacterized as employable and ordered into the citys work experience program here is one reason we need to hurry and get a real system in place so we are not brutalizing people and making these kinds of mistakes what we have is makeshift things happening out there we rushed the welfare reform program into place so rapidly it could have been made effective a year after the date of enactment it could have been all kinds of things to phase it in but we cared so little about the people on the very bottom poorest people in america that we rushed into a program that was bound to generate blunders and hardships of this kind henry stern the city pkrks commissioner reading from the article that appeared in the new york times henry stern the city parks commissioner said that ms motipersad has been assigned to light duty and had worked as a timekeeper in the office but that he had ordered an investigation into what work she had actually been doing in a blundering makeshift system maybe somebody did do the right bureaucratic thing and note that she should not be given the hard work but it is a blunderirlg new system people are thrown into the parks department where workers who are there paid civil servants are resentful of the fact that workfare people are being brought in to replace their colleagues the parks department has been downsized from 7 000 jobs to 4 000 jobs 3 000 people who were fulltime civil servants at one time are no longer there and they have these thousands of people coming in as workfare participants welfare recipients working for almost nothing so some of the people who are there they resent these people so she probably was deliberately not assigned a light job because there was resentment there that she was even there he ordered an investigation the commissioner into what work she had actually been doing others including the womans son and some of the workers that she worked with said ms motipersad had talked of having to occasionally pick up garbage on the beach and the boardwalk and she said she told them she feared for her health as a result she had to go out and work like the other workers in terms of picking up trash on the beach and the boardwalk even though there was a notation in her file that said she should be assigned light duty her son said i told her not to do it that i would help pick up the slack with the money and she said she could not stay at home because she had to pay her rent evelyn selby a neighbor and wep worker with ms motipersad in coney island said that they both had to rise at 4 30 each morning and they used to take three buses to get to their assignment quote i would have to wait for her as she climbed the steps and such she was always behind this is what her friend and companion says about ms motipersad who had had two heart attacks she had to get up at 4 30 in the morning by the time she gets to work catching three buses she is already so stressed out until it is amazing that she did not die in the first few days with this kind of forced activity officials with h r a said that ms motipersad had within the last several months been reevaluated by a doctor with health services systems a privatized agency that had a contract from the city agency to evaluate these people to see if they were really sick when they said they were sick the official said that ms motipersad had been denied federal disability benefits known as supplemental security income ssi because she was not deemed disabled now what is our supplemental security income for if a person who is 50 years old has had two heart attacks is not eligible for disability then who is a person who is a secretary and was forced to give up her job as a secretary because of a heart condition if she is not deemed disabled then who is so the federal bureaucracy has a role in failing ms motipersad also she had some health problems but was deemed stable says renelda higgins a spokeswoman for the human resources administration life and health issues are not static i am quoting the bureaucrat ms higgins life and health issues are not static individuals are reevaluated she was on medication and she was taking her medication she had two heart attacks and she was taking her medication and they sent her out on the beach to pick up trash i had heart bypass surgery and i do not want to go out on the beach and pick up anybodys trash i know what would happen to me i never had a heart attack but i had a situation where i had heart bypass surgery and i would not risk my life on a beach on a hot day picking up trash but she was evaluated by this bureaucrat who said she is taking her medication let her go to work others including her family and lawyers representing workfare participants and acorn a nonprofit group that is working with unionized workfare laborers called into question both the adequacy of the health evaluation done by the citys contractor the private contractor as well as the wisdom of forcing mrs motipersad to work for her benefits mrs motipersad according to mr stern worked 22 hours a week for her cash and food stamp benefits and they total about 250 a month the city requires welfare recipients up to age 60 to work for their benefits it says medical evaluations are done of all recipients in workfare who have a history of health problems part of the rationale for making such people work for benefits city officials have said is to obtain a straightforward return for their expenditure the city in fact has created a subcategory of welfare worker it is called employable with limitations such recipients are supposed to be assigned office work what recipients of workfare have said from its inception they have complained that the city has hired doctors who did not seriously investigate real and formidable health problems people with asthma have been told of being put to work in office basements and others talk of 3minute examinations by this cityemployed health evaluation agency without any acknowledgment of their own doctors evaluations the legal aid society has filed suit on behalf of recipients who were categorized as employable with limitations but nonetheless they were sent to sanitation garages and the like mrs motipersad was forced to give up her job at the childrens aid society as i said before in 1994 after two heart attacks she briefly collected disability benefits and her son yesterday produced notes from doctors recommending that she not work because she had coronary artery disease here is an individual whose photo would never have appeared in the new york times otherwise a plain and simple person a member of the middle class worked 17 years as a secretary in a reputable agency and because of circumstances related to her health wound up in the workfare program she was kicked off she was told she would be kicked off of welfare she would not get her 250 a month if she did not go out and work for the parks department so point no 1 welfare reform take the next step in welfare reform by fostering and promoting innovative local job training welfare to work and entrylevel employment programs to move welfare recipients into the work force a systematic wellstructured program to deal with trying to help poor people move from welfare to work we are all in favor of that but the job has not even begun i urge you to use your power to implement your recommendation it is here it is part of your 10point program this is based on a list of the 10 points in the new york times as excerpts of the prepared text of a speech by the speaker point no 2 civil rights the speaker says we should clear the existing backlog of discrimination cases at the equal employment opportunities commission by enforcing existing civil rights laws rather than trying to create new ones by regulatory decree i wholeheartedly agree with you we should clear the existing backlog of discrimination cases at the equal employment opportunities commission you have the power you have the power over the appropriations process the fact that they have a backlog is due to the fact that they have been downsizing the number of employees have been cut a proposal from this house could help to solve this problem right away i agree with the gentleman from georgia we do not need to talk about race relations let us go ahead and do something practical to promote race relations clear up the backlog at the equal employment opportunities commission it is a statement of the second most powerful person here in washington dc the gentleman from georgia speaker newt gingrich get on with the business we will support the speaker 100 percent the speaker says we should have more home ownership ease the path toward home ownership by giving local communities and housing authorities the flexibility and authority to more effectively efficiently house lowincome americans we must also expand faithbased charities such as habitat for humanity which grow families as well as build homes i agree with the speaker a hundred percent we would like to ease the path toward home ownership by giving local communities and housing authorities the flexibility that they need they also have to have increased funding to take care of the repairs renovations of existing public housing and we also have a shortage of housing in many cities the fact that large numbers of people are homeless can be related to the fact that we have built very little public housing over the last 10 years as the rate of construction of public housing and the availability of opportunities and publicly subsidized housing went down the number of homeless people increased it is also more expensive in many areas to obtain a home either by rental or home ownership so this is on target let us get on with it you have the power recently we passed a bill here on the floor of this house related to public housing which went in the opposite direction they reduced the funds available for public housing and it gave a lot of power away to local housing authorities but it gave them no new tools to work with no new appropriations to help with the appropriation you proposed to dump the problem on localities that are already burdened and could not provide any funding to deal with plugging the gaps in housing in their localities another point the fourth point made by the speaker violent crime make our cities safe and secure places to live and work through community policing through tougher sentences for violent criminals and innovative anticrime programs dramatically expand the communitybased antidrug coalition efforts and create a victory plan for the war on drugs we are a thousand percent behind you innovative anticrime programs many members of the republican majority have ridiculed any discussion of crime prevention programs we call them crime prevention programs you call them innovative anticrime programs i think that in the final analysis those people that have expertise in this area would tell you they come pretty close to each other if you are talking about innovative anticrime programs you are going to end up with programs that focus on young people because that is where the greatest volume of crime is the crime prevention programs that we proposed focused on young people let us have a meeting of the minds right away if you want to move forward you have the power to deal with violent crime in the way you stated should be handled here you have our full support a fourth point made by the speaker economic growth expand economic opportunities for all americans by promoting continued economic growth with low inflation and rising takehome pay through tax cuts tax simplifications litigation reform less regulation overhaul burden of government and small businesses all in all for welfare to work to be successful work needs to be available that is the point we made on this floor over and over again work needs to be available expand economic opportunities for all america by promoting continued economic growth with low inflation rising tax takehome pay et cetera we are all in favor of that let us go forward urban renewal is another point the speaker says create 100 renewal communities in impoverished areas through targeted program tax benefits regulatory relief lowincome scholarships savings accounts brownfields cleanup and home ownership opportunities that sounds very similar to a program that the president talked about a few days ago when he talked about helping to revitalize our cities the speaker and the president seem to be using the same language i hope they are on the same wavelength they as the two most powerful people in washington ought to be able to make things happen in the area of urban renewal i certainly hope that in this area of 100 renewal communities in impoverished communities we can move off dead center and get an economic empowerment zone for central brooklyn we are busily at work trying to focus on putting together all the necessities to make an application for a new urban economic empowerment zone but the economic empowerment zone has been left out of the budget agreement at the white house we were brokenhearted disappointed to find out when that agreement was completed there was no discussion of any additional economic empowerment zones economic empowerment zones experiments that were proposed by my colleague from new york mr rangel many years ago after he and jack kemp had worked on it for years and some other people had worked on it it finally got down to a package that was passed finally which had nine empowerment zones only six in urban areas and three in rural areas so we have right now in america nine empowerment zones six on urban areas and three on rural areas most of them are deemed to be successful i know of no great failure if there is a failure it is not being discussed so if the economic empowerment zones have been successful then why do we hesitate let us go forward the president now in his speech a few days ago proposed an additional 15 economic empowerment zones i heard legislation that was proposed and many more was being drafted by certain people on the committee on ways and means but all of it has been put on hold nothing is happening at this point an idea that combines government grants with private sector involvement seems to be the ideal that both republicans and democrats can agree on if republicans and democrats agree that economic empowerment zones are good for the nation then why can we not have more of them why can we not in brooklyn have one in central brooklyn which encompasses my district have an economic empowerment zone we have 2 million people at least half are poor we have the space we have need to revitalize commercial areas industrial areas all of the conditions that are necessary that are required for economic empowerment zones are there but there is no legislation here the nine that were created are all given away we want to compete for whatever new number there is i hope it is more than 15 but if there are 15 then no neighborhood no community needs an economic empowerment zone more than central brooklyn it is one of the speakers points he has the power let us make certain that the presidents 15 economic empowerment zones are combined with the speakers 100 renewal communities and together we ought to all who live in big cities be able to get something out of the two packages that are proposed what i am talking about is the 10point proposal of the speaker designed to deal with race relations he made the speech on june 18 and i am quoting from an article in the new york times which talked about his speech the speaker proposes to move ahead of the president he just does not want to talk about these things he has a program the president has appointed a commission what he calls an advisory board an advisory board will come back within a year with recommendations the speaker says you do not need to move so slowly he sketched out a 10point program to promote racial healing and black achievements and he says he relies more on specific steps and less theory he relies less on talk and less on affirmative action and his 10 points i have talked about welfare reform that he proposed innovative job training is part of his welfare reform it is not happening but he proposed he can make it happen he has the power the economic growth attacking violent crime promoting home ownership promoting civil rights promoting urban renewal and he has learning here as one of his 10 points learning and i will read that part of his speech create better opportunity for all children to learn by breaking stranglehold of teachers unions and giving urban parents the financial opportunity to choose the public private or parochial school that is best for their children i am quoting the speakers speech i want to do justice to what he had to say whereas i have agreed with all the points i mentioned before basically i have agreed with him i do not agree with his proposal as to how we should promote learning i applaud the fact that he has put learning on the list creation of better opportunities for all children to learn the way he proposes to do it is of course what the republican majority keeps insisting has to be done that you have to have vouchers and private school choice i am not going to even discuss that at this point let me just challenge the speaker if he wants to create better opportunities for all children to learn why not go in the direction where both democrats and republicans agree why not promote charter schools both the president the democrats in the house the democrats in the senate the republicans in the house and republicans in the senate all agree that charter schools are a good idea so while the great debate about vouchers goes on why do you not accentuate the positive mr speaker why do you not come forward with an innovative meaningful program to promote charter schools the idea is out there but we only have a handful of charter schools in the country only half the states have laws which allow charter schools and in those states that have charter schools we have very few actual charter schools it is a very embryonic kind of experiment that is going on it will take another 20 years to evaluate whether it has any significance or not there are a lot of innovations that need to take place i have been on the committee on education and the workforce now for 15 years the institutional history of what we have tried what is proposed what the researchers say is all very much ingrained in my mind there are a lot of innovative approaches to education which make sense a lot should be going on right now i say across the board we should have a comprehensive overwhelming attack on tlle problems related to education reform and efforts to improve our schools ought to go forward on a massive basis maybe in 5 years we can look and sort out what really works best and begin to institutionalize what really works best to develop a firstclass system not a national system but systems which have similar components across the country of things that work but if we are going to take an idea like charter schools where everybody agrees that we should have charter schools and then we are going to have only minuscule testing of it only a few here and a few there in many states which allow charter schools there are so many restrictions placed on them until we will not have many developed at all over the next 10 years there is a need for somebody and the federal government probably is the only entity that could do it to break it loose and try to give incentives for experimentation on a scale large enough to be significant we need a critical mass charter schools cannot be evaluated as to what impact they can have on the overall education situation unless we have a critical mass we need enough one of the versions of charter schools is supposed to be that they will give competition to the traditional public schools what is the difference between charter schools and traditional public schools it is not the funding base because they both are supposed to be funded by taxpayers money fully funded charter schools are to receive a per capita amount which is the same as the local education agency pays for their children the only difference between charter schools and the local education agencys traditional schools would be in the governance and management they would have to abide by all the rules and terms of any state requirements requirements for integration requirements for curriculum everything would still be there for the charter schools it is a matter of how they are governed and who is in charge of the management and what kind of things can you do if you are out from under the local bureaucracy and how much freedom for innovation will lead to real improvements real change and how much your freedom to govern as you see fit and manage as you see fit can allow you to do the things that have to be done to improve the schools without the burden of having to get approvals from people in the hierarchy on top of you the great challenge is governance and management let us go on at the federal level to create some incentives let us have a piece of legislation which provides incentives for charter schools if the speaker wants to do something about creating better opportunities for all children to learn there is one area which there is agreement charter schools why do we not do something about it opportunities to learn also involve of course children having a decent place to study it is most unfortunate that the speaker is concerned about creating better opportunities to learn for children and yet in the budget agreement that was made with the president at the white house the initiative for construction of new schools and renovation of unsafe schools was taken out 5 billion over a 5year period that is all they proposed 5 billion over a 5year period to help to renovate and repair and actually construct new schools it would make a big difference in terms of opportunity to learn for all children because across america according to the general accounting office the gao 120 billion is needed for school construction in the next 10 years to rebuild the infrastructure of public schools we are not talking about colleges and universities just elementary and secondary schools why can we not have in a situation where we are adding billions to the defense budget and yesterday we voted to continue the b2 bomber while we refused to reduce the budget for the cia even though the cold war is over why can we not have 5 billion over a 5year period for school repair renovation and construction if the speaker agrees and if he has on his list of 10 things that need to be done to promote race relations to provide opportunities for individuals then why can we not have an agreement to put back into the budget the 5 billion initiative for school construction another point and i want to finish the speakers points and do justice to his points small business set a goal for tripling the number of minorityowned small businesses i agree let us triple the number of minorityowned small businesses he wants to bring successful small business leaders together to identify and then eliminate the government imposed barriers to entrepreneurship that is what he says is the cause of the paucity of small businesses in the minority community i agree with the goal we need to triple the number of minorityowned small businesses i do not agree with his concern about governmentimposed barriers i live in a community where small businessmen struggle all the time i do not get any complaints about government barriers the government does more to help than anything else the complaint is against the private sector capital they cannot get capital or they have to pass scrutiny that other businesses do not have to pass all kinds of problems i hear about i do not hear that the government has imposed barriers that is an ideological blind spot that the speaker is off into it is not a minority business problem that we have too much regulation or government barriers i have heard the speeches a thousand times about what is wrong with america that has nothing to do with what is really impeding small business development in the minority community in summary i think i have covered all the speakers points his 10 proposals to improve race relations are to create better opportunities for all children to learn to develop more minority businesses to create 100 renewal communities to clear the existing backlog of discrimination cases at the equal employment opportunity commission he wants to make america a country and i missed this one he wants to make america a country with equal opportunity for all and special privileges for none by taking away all preferences setasides and government contracts we disagree on that one that is clearly one we disagree on i do not have time to explain why the background of the history of the descendants of africanamerican slaves has to be considered when we talk about setasides and special government programs for minorities racial classification is another he added here which i find very strange in this set of proposals racial classification a first step should be taken to add a multiracial category to the census he thinks that is very important to improve race relations in america i have no problem adding a multiracial category to the census i do not know how it is going to improve race relations because in the history of america they have always insisted that anybody who hadone drop of black blood was africanamerican if you had one drop of black blood you were deemed africanamerican so these race classifications seem to me to be no solution in conclusion i applaud speaker gingrich for his rapid response to the presidents challenge we need more discussion on race relations we certainly need powerful people like speaker gingrich to make proposals as to what it is we should do what we should do concretely there are people out there who are dying because we are not acting fast enough the death of marsha motipersad is just one example of how there is needless suffering because we have rushed into public policies dnd programs that are harmful to people it is more than race relations it is human relations it is human rights it is concern for human welfare all this goes together i want to end on a positive note overall i applaud the speaker i hope he will continue the dialogue and he will go and meet with the commission the president has set up and i will come right behind him i think that there are many areas that we agree on and that the presidents initiative has shown that it has paid off already the dialogue has begun"]], "top_unsure": [[0.0002428889274597168, 0.4997571110725403, 1, "i want to express my deep respect to the gentleman from california for bringing this before the

is deployment with combat equipment and that does not permit his resolution under 5 c and that leads me to oppose him finally i believe the administrations policy is a good policy with worthy purposes

future work force today we are behind other nations in educational achievement forty percent of our children are not reading at the level they should be 20 percent of our 8th graders are not even taking algebra we know these statistics because we recently conducted studies comparing the achievement of our students with those in other countries this analysis is a valuable tool for educators and the administration is trying to conduct a similar analysis to determine how local school districts compare nationally it is the same kind of approach to find out what we need to be doing to better serve our students despite what proponents of this amendment argue no such mechanism for analysis currerltly exists to compare and find the information we need on a national basis the national assessment of educational progress for example is a sample test for a variety of subjects the tests are not universally administered and are administered as a blind study telling us only national trends the new national test would be administered uniformly it would provide a scale by which standards and progress can be measured and it will help all of our local educational authorities assess the areas in their curriculum that need improvement another critical difference in the new test is they would be available to parents and teachers who can chart their own childrens progress and more easily assess their childs individual educational needs if johnny is the worst reading student in the 4th grade it may help the teacher to know that he is actually way above the national standard we need to know this kind of information many of the discussions relating to education in this bill have focused on getting parents more involved in their childs education these steps are a major part of that process experts in education including the national education association the national association of elementary school principals the national school boards association they all support the proposal to administer a voluntary national test i am sure i will be corrected if i am wrong in addition the proposal has overwhelming support from the business community including the unitedstates chamber of commerce and the presidents and ceos of hundreds of technology manufacturing service firms throughout the country the goodling amendment would prohibit the use of educational improvement funding for the development of a national testing program in reading and mathematics it is shortsighted because the ability to compare educational outcomes nationally is the critical first step necessary to improve our educational standards this proposal is only in its infancy but its potential is enormous while i understand the committee chairmans interest in securing jurisdiction over this testing program this is too important to be stopped because of that kind of territorial dispute in fact former secretary lamar alexander used similar authority to develop voluntary national tests we

california and the interruptions that we have seen in here but i think everybody ought to be heard on this and i think everybody ought to have the opportunity to make their arguments what we have seen when somebody gets a buy of cocaine or heroin to be able to inject they really do not care they need that narcotic they do not care whether they are going to go out and be able to buy a needle or trade a needle or steal a needle they are going to get a needle to get their fix and that is the consequences sowhen we really get back to what we are talking about in the use of drugs i think the first premise is we should not be handing out a utensil or tool to allow people to break a law that is pretty simple the second issue is commitment if we are talking about trying to show that we are going to reduce demahd in this country on drug use and we are going to try and also persuade countries south of our border to stop and try to reduce the supply we have to be honest and genuine about trying to stop demand i think it certainly isa wrong message to say that oh by the way we are going to try to stop demand in our country but here we are handing out free needles to drug users what happens when you hand out free needles to drug users the incidence of drug use goes up it was proved in the montreal study and proved in the vancouver study it was also proved in the chi cago study as a matter of fact the chicago study showed that hiv increased 8 4 percent per 100 people when there are free needles and there was a drop without free needles of 71 percent of hiv in that community when there were no free needles we need to have a commitment to stopping drugs in this country giving away free needles is not part of that we also have to have local solutions to national problems and the best way to start those local solutions is to help people clean up their neighborhoods handing away free needles or giving away free needles in peoples neighborhoods does not stop the drug

words i rise in strong opposition to the skaggs and moran amendments year after year we have defeated the attempts to eliminate funding for tv marti and to deny over 40 000 cubans viewership of this important independent news even those who disagree with our policy on cuba and that is not what is in debate here must believe in the opportunity for an open window of information to the cuban people if they do not believe in that then they must take the same position on a whole host of other tv broadcasting that we do to other parts of the world that cannot meet the audience share that tv marti meets supporters of the amendment would have us believe that no one in cuba is seeing tv marti quite the contrary the broadcasting board of governors reports that cuba has a 1 5 percent audience share in cuba that is greater than the audience share in 37 other countries where we have broadcast through yoatv and world net tv what are some of those countries china north korea pakistan somalia indonesia parts of africa if we accept this standard that a 1 5 share is not enough then clearly for all of those other countries for which we have an interest in sending a message from the united states about our intentions visavis those countries about our position visavis those countries about what we stand for in our foreign policy then we must also seek to eliminate those because if not we have a double standard in the process that means that 1 5 percent more people in cuba are watching tv marti broadcasts than there are viewers in china in north korea in somalia in turkey in cameroon and 30 other nations in fact audience share in north korea is less than 1 percent and the audience share for cantonese broadcasts in china is a mere 1 percent why do we not see amendments eliminating funding for broadcasts to those by this standard these broadcasts should be eliminated forthwith the question that i think some have failed to ask themselves is why does castro seek to abolish tv marti why does he care if tv marti does not penetrate cuba because it does tv marti does penetrate cuba and it does reach some cuban households if we think about that if we think about the messages that go to the cuban government and the cuban military who do have access to tv marti and our ability to send messages at that level of the government if we think about the ability to be ready in a time of transition when jamming may not done when there is a movement internally in the country our ability to talk to those people by the power of images such as cnn it will be important we will not be able to do that transmission if we do not have tv marti at that time in our own interest section tv marti is played over 75 000 cubans enter our interest section every year what are they doing while they are waiting to see a counselor or officer they are seeing tv marti and the broadcasts that are recorded yes cuba does jam tv marti some of the time but america has never responded to a recipient countrys jamming of programming by simply giving up that is the standard the members will set if jamming is the reason why members will not permit tv marti to go forward then understand that if any other countries are jammed we do not have the audience share and the same situation will be sought to apply for others the cuban people have not given up on their hope of democracy i do not think we in america who are a fountain and beacon of light to people throughout the world in terms of information that we should be giving up on them and creating a different standard even joe duffey of the united states information agency the director in letters to the gentleman from kentucky chairtnan rogers and others have said that they in fact believe that tv marti can be effective we need to make sure that at this point in time we in fact stand with the free flow of information let me close on that so many of my colleagues who have a disagreement about our policy talk about a free flow of information we have heard in the past both radio and tv marti attacked on this floor now it is limited to tv marti forty thousand cubans the ripple effect 75 000 who see it at the unitedstates
