can count trying to jiggle her wheelchair through a door that should have been wider than it was or trying to lug a wheelchair up a set of stairs where there should have been a ramp but there was not so i believe very deeply that we must do everything in our power to give reasonable access to the disabled in this country of ours having said that i must reluctantly state that i have serious problems with certain provisions of this legislation first and foremost there is not one penny in this bill to implement the tremendous costs of the various mandates and provisions which we are laying on the american people on public transit systems for example across america and indeed during the 1980s the federal commitment to public transit in real dollars has been reduced by 50 percent so here we are today talking about mandates on the american people which are going to add up to several billions of dollars in fact the american public transit association says that over the next two decades the increased cost of just the transportation provisions in this legislation on public transit will be at least 7 8 billion on rail and fixed route buses and 13 billion on paratransit so we are looking at a 20 billion price tag that we are laying on the american people and not providing one penny to pay for it i say that is wrong indeed we are setting ourselves up to put into place what might be called the law of unintended consequences we mean to do right we mean to do good and yet we find ourselves addressing this issue without a willingness to pay for any of these new requirements that we are putting on the american people let me discuss just one such mandate and that is the lift mandate we are saying that we must put on every public transit bus in america a lift now the cost of that lift will increase the cost of that bus by 10 000 to 15 000 a 10 to 15percent increase in the cost of the bus we are telling that to our transit operators to our communities across america and we are not giving them a penny we are telling them they must do it yet what has been our experience with the lift thus far in seattle wa where about 80 percent of the buses have been liftequipped for the last couple of years they find that they only have one user of that lift every other day per bus in new york city which is about 50 percent liftequipped they have discovered that they only have one user each day for every 19 buses so here we are in washington dc laying a mandate on public transit operators and on communities across these united states when indeed in my view we should be giving them some flexibility we should be saying yes we want you to provide accessibility for the disabled but we want you to do it in the manner that you feel is best in consultation with the disabled in your local communities beyond that let us consider the implications of paratransit paratransit being the small buses the doortodoor service that we provide to thousands of disabled across america by saying we are going to mandate that every transit bus have a lift and by not providing one penny to do it and then saying we also expect you to provide paratransit doortodoor transportation but putting a loophole in there saying that they do not have to do this if they have an undue financial burden what are we logically doing we are saying if you have got to cut somewhere you cant cut on the lift requirement so you are going to have to cut on paratransit or you are going to have to cut on your general service to your community that is what we are setting up here to force communities to do and it is wrong and it is unnecessary we should be very clear on this point that 100 percent lift accessibility is zero accessibility for hundreds of thousands of disabled americans who cannot get to the bus stop hundreds of thousands of disabled americans who must have doortodoor service so if we are saying we are going to have 100 percent lift accessibility by creating a situation where we are going to force a reduction in service to paratransit and to general service we are setting up a situation of the law of unintended consequence a situation where we are going to hurt many citizens both able and disabled and most particualray in rural america and small cities because here the cost of the lift is the same but of course the ridership is much lower so my colleagues and it seems to me we have an opportunity here to pass a good piece of legislation if indeed we can deal with some of these serious problems we will have an opportunity over the next several days to correct some of these problems and i would urge all of us to seriously consider the amendments which are going to be offered because we want to do good but we want to do good in a way that we are not injuring other people in an unintended fashion so i urge all my colleagues to seriously consider the amendments which we are bringing before us so that we can clean up this bill so that indeed we can provide better transportation accessibility not only for the disabled across america but for all americans"], [0.0002637505531311035, 0.4997362494468689, 0, "this member rises in

in interest we have a real deficit reduction of 33 billion the issue in our day this year in congress is to regain control of our economic destiny to be able to control our interest rates and we are only going to be able to do that by reducing the size of the federal deficit so that we are no longer dependent upon tokyo upon the japanese upon the big japanese insurance companies coming in month after month and buying 30 percent of our longterm debt that is the major issue facing this congress this year and the chairmans mark makes significant progress in narrowing this budget deficit and it is the only plan before us that can be passed hence it is time we get on with the nations business i would urge my colleagues to support the chairmans budget"], [0.0004730820655822754,

challenge we are facing as a nation and especially as representatives of the larger urban areas and hopefully it will underscore why we are doing this all night here in the unitedstates congress in attempting to urge our colleagues to move on a very important crime package perhaps the biggest victims are the littlest sufferersthe crack babies the imapct of these tragic victims has yet to be felt upon the big cities as the new york post revealed in a heart wrenching four part serles the city is about to suffer another crippling blow from crack the emergence of tens of thousands of the physically and mentally impaired children of crackusing mothers by the year 2000 the federal government estimates there could be anywhere from 1 to 4 million crackexposed chidren in the united states as many as 100 000 may be living in new york city currently at least 3 000 crack babies are born in new york city every year but it may be closer to 10 000 a year because hospitals do not test every newborn for drugs and most mothers donot admit their drug use we do not know about thousands of crack babies and we will not until they are old enough to go to school the majority of the crack kids will be difficult to educate some will be impossible to control and the fiscal strain will be even greater on our schools hospitals social service agencies and jails the expense to taxpayers will be astronomical a federal study indicates that it could cost 220 000 per child to provide medical care foster care and special education in a crackimpaired childs first 5 years sadly or maybe not up to 50 percent of the crack babies will end up in foster care the projected pricetag for new york citys foster care system is 1 1 billiondouble that of 3 years ago our special education system as we know it today will not be able to handle the problems these children will bring into the schools we need to find these children now so we can get them to programs such as head start otherwise they will cripple our school system according to a recent study by the national center for state courts crackexposed children are more than twice as likely to commit crimes as children without learning disorders unless we find these children and give them the proper attention they need they will probably end up in jail unfortunately the same crackusing mother is having another baby every 7 to 9 months we are in a race against time to find these children because there are thousands out there who have not been identified otherwise they will be a greater burden to our cities later mother clare of the hale house calls them the ruined generation the new york post called them the children of the damned heartbreak babies frightingly we will never find all the crack babies an experts give them virtually no chance of making it without intensive therapy long before kindergarten some never make it to see 5 potters field at rikers island is the sad and cold repository for these children who die before they know the world and before the world knows their name as you can see from this shocking picture the innocent victims of crack are stacked up in tiny coffinsidentified not with a name or a headstone but with a number in a mass grave"], [0.0005251467227935791, 0.4994748532772064, 1, "i thank the gentleman for yielding the time and congratulate him and the gentleman from ohio for their intense work and working as a team i think the country thought that this was a house divided at times but in this bill that was not true i also want to congratulate the ranking members including the gentlewoman from new jersey for doing such a great job and the administration for realizing that we needed a housing bill safe and decent housing for all americans ought to be our goal and this bill promotes affordable housing for firsttime buyers it promotes hope for home ownership for moderateincome people and the home program supports state and local strategies for achieving more affordable housing and increased home ownership in addition this bill has community development block grant money in it that is very important for our areas throughout the country including my own hometown of cleveland oh the bill has the mckinney homeless assistance moneys as well and that is so important it addresses the issue of new production which is very important to older areas like cleveland oh which has some of the oldest housing stock in the nation in order to stabilize many inner city neighborhoods we need to build new homes homes that are attractive to moderate income buyers the conferees also addressed the problems of fha and while i have some skepticism about parts of it it was a compromise in order to get a housing bill i would also like to thank the chairman and my colleagues for supporting my amendments promoting energy efficiency in housing which were included in the housing bill one organizations research revealed that we can help more than 2 million households with their housing affordability problems if we had mortgage policies that gave a proper credit to energyefficient homes we could qualify it to 250 000 more families to buy their first home if we reduced energy bills by 25 percent in existing rental housing we could help almost 2 million families afford to stay in their homes i think this provision is important it paves the way for our country to be energyindependent and to do a better job in terms of promoting energy efficiency it is a new outlook but i was delighted that my colleagues embraced the concept additionally my amendments concerning section 202 housing for the elderly and the handicapped home repairs for the elderly and an amendment on appraisal services were included in the bill i know that members have individual problems with one or two provisions in the bill but this is really a monumental bill in my judgment i think it is the first time since i have been here in over 14 years that we have had new and creative ideas and maintained programs that work i want to pay tribute to the leadership of the gentleman from texas the gentleman from ohio and others"], [0.0005808472633361816,

nebraska for their work on this amendment i am proud to be an ardent supporter of the role credit unions play in the nations financial marketplace i know that most members of this body recognize the special mission which the nations credit unions carry outnamely to provide basic lowcost financial services to nearly 60 million americans many of whom would be denied such services if it were not for credit unions there is one thing which i would like to mention to my colleagues which each of you should be aware of in this time of economic uncertaintyand that is the safety and soundness of the nations credit union community we should note that since the voluntary 1984 recapitalization of the national credit union share insurance fundlegislation which i am pleased to have helped steer through congressit has been by far the strongest of the three federal deposit insurers furthermore while the fdic and fslic were busy closing down a record high number of banks and savings and loans last year the ncusif closed down a record low number of credit unions to my colleagues who are wondering why we are talking about credit unions in this emergency legislation i want to state for the

support of the rule and the conference report in a time when congress has decided to draw partisan lines on practically every issue let us join together in a bipartisan effort to put environmental policies ahead of environmental politics on this issue and perhaps this issue alone we can go home during the august recess and tell our constituents that we took a real step forward to protect our environment our beaches our wildlife and our waterways will be safer and cleaner with the passage of this conference report i urge you to support the rule the conference committee has worked very hard to provide a bill that addresses the devastating problems caused by oilspills it does so by the creation of a federal oilsplll liability trust fund that provides up to 1 billion in oilspill response and cleanup the money for this fund will come from a 5centabarrel fee on domestic and imported oil i am most pleased that the conference committee includes ray double hull mandate for oil tankers later today i will speak more about the double hull provision adopted by the conference committee in addition to these accomplishments the bill forms regional response teams within the coast guard to assist in cleaning up spills for the first time a national response center will be formed computers will be set up with lists of equipment and personnel that can be called upon to clean up spills that foul our waterways also for the first time the federal government will be charged with the responsibility to direct the cleanup procedures of a spill i commend the decision by the committee to make spillers liable for cleanup costs and damages up to specified liability limits it was decided to raise the current liability ceiling from 150 per gross ton to 1 200 the agreement requires owners and operators to guarantee their payment by purchasing insurance moreover the report sets unlimited liability limits for those spills caused by gross negligence willful misconduct or if the spillers failed to report the spill in these cases the spiller will be required to pay the entire cost of the spill other provisions include a requirement to check driving records for alcoholrelated offenses prior to issuing licenses to operate oil tankers increased research on oil pollution control and development of technologies to assist in cleanup and a requirement for presidential approval of all conteingency plans before vessels or facilities can transport or handle oil this agreement goes a long way in responding to the prevention and cleanup of oil spills for this reason i support the passage of this report"]]}
