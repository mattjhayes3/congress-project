thank the gentleman for yielding me this time in 1977 the united states cut off aid to the somoza government in 1979 the overthrow of president somoza was broadbased popular it had the support of labor business professional groups and the church and most segments of nicaraguan society the oas passed a resolution of support for the revolution and this was extraordinary it was extraordinary because they supported the overthrow of one of its members but a condition of the overthrow by oas was requiring a democratic pluralist and nonaligned nicaragua these conditions were accepted by the sandinistas in a cable on july 12 1979 now after that we had an acrimonious debate in the house of representatives and i remember it vividly the gentleman from florida mr dante fascell the chairman of the foreign affairs committee who spoke so eloquently a few minutes ago talked about the gentleman leading the battle to get the money for the sandinistas i remember being convinced that even though i did not think the communists were going to change their minds i remember people saying youve got hard line communists youve got people who have got money from outside the country coming into the country and youre not going to do anything at all by giving them money but i voted for the money because i felt it was the right thing to do and it was about the same amount of money we are talking about today we offered to send peace corp volunteers into nicaragua and instead what they acceptedwere military advisers and economic advisers from cuba they did not accept any aid from the united states and the repression that was so prevalent under the somoza regime was back under the communist regime that is now ruling as i said the amount of aid t hat we gave to the sandinistas at thattime was about the same amount of aid that we are talking about today now the carter administration had to withdraw that aid because they violated the very agreement that they made the sandinistas violated the agreements that they mjade as a matter of fact during that period of time the costa rican national assembly investigators estimated that at least 1 million pounds of material entered nicaragua from cuba in the 6 to 8 weeks before the somoza government was overthrown so they established very clearly the link between cuba and the nicaraguan government which took over now going down to the philippines not long ago i saw what the church can do when it supports a free election what international observers can do the thing that nicaragua worries about the most are free elections you saw the farce that they called a free election not long ago you know that if there is a free election in nicaragua what will happen you know very well even though you see on tv the people say well i support the government well if i lived in nicaragua i would say i support the government also because obviously it is not to the benefit of the people to not support the government on tv but i remember vividly going to el salvador as an observer to the elections the press reported there would be a very low turnout and it would be a free election many people here were criticizing us for giving aid to the el salvador government and that the guerrillas were inside guerrillas not being directed from the outside and the people would not vote and would not support an election i remember flying out over on election day and seeing the long lines of people and talking to some of the people who were voting standing in those lines for hours and saying to us after being threatened by the guerrillas and walking for miles they can kill me they can kill my family but they cant kill us all they were threatened with cutting their fingers off because they were going to vote and when they make a threat in el salvador it is a serious threat there is no question about it because of the violence that goes on in that country but they ighored that and 80 percent of the people in el salvador voted and you saw the turnout and they have i freely elected government and even though we got all kinds of criticism in the united states for giving them aid they had another election they elected a freely elected government and they are doing well some of the very same people who criticized what we are doing in el salvador now try to take credit for the legislation that we passed a couple years ago so if in this country can give aid to places like the philippines which is 8 500 miles away zaire 4 million 6 500 miles malaysia 9 000 miles away gabon oman portugal thousands of miles away hundreds of millions of dollars to countries that are so far away it seems to me that there can be bipartisan support for a compromise which has been worked out so that we can send a message to them that they should have free elections and the people of nicaragua can select a majority party in that country to run that country and get rid of the repressive regime which is in nicaragua today i just want to say this in my feeling there is no way we are going to have a chance in government down there unless the united states has military aid in order to stimulate a change in that government there is no way the other democracies will survive unless the united states supports what is going on down there so i very strongly urge this house to support the aid recommended by the president under the

an everincreasing share of the tax burden to those who can least afford itthe middle class and working poor the ways and means committee bill will provide genuine tax relief to americas middle class half the benefits of this measure will go to families with incomes between 20 000 and 70 000 a year for those makihg between 20 000 and 50 000 a year this will mean an 810 percent decrease in their

in all this measure is the most important piece of legislation we have considered in the past decade to provide tangible benefits to the mainstream of the american people the republican substitute made in order under this rule is on the other hand a retreat from the basic commitment to genuine tax reform in this substitute tax relief will benefit the corporate sector at the expense of individuals and families if it passes individuals will pay 30 billion more in taxes over the next 5 years than they would pay in the ways and means or the presidents original proposal corporations in turn will pay 30 billion less the republican substitute asks the middle class to pay for the benefits of the corporate world every itemized deduction over 1 000except for home mortgages and charitable

do what we set out to have it do when the carter administration began this program it did so because of the vulnerability of the minuteman missile in the minuteman silos today we are going to put the mx in those same silos and they are even more vulnerable today not only because the soviets have increased the accuracy of their icbms but also because or we know they are starting on a similar program with respect to their submarinelaunched ballistic missiles this resolution today makes no sense from the point of view of procurement the funds in question relate to procurement in 1987 and 1988 it makes no sense to be obligating those funds at this time that is particularly true because of the state of the testing on the mx and for this i rely on recent testimony of the general accounting office before the senate defense appropriations subcommittee at the present time only 7 of the 20 scheduled tests for mx have been completed or 35 percent and while the administration tells us that those tests have gone well we should understand that there are major changes in major components of the system that will occur on future tests among those are changes prior to flights 9 to 11 to the stage iv propellent storage assembly tank the ground and flight software the warhead fusecrucial for accuracyand the reentry vehicle substructure indeed a fully operational configuration of the guidance and control system will not be flow before flight test 14 in the third quarter of 1986 the gao also testified that retention of the current range capability which in the tests is running only 1 percent above that needed is dependent on successful repair of the stage iii extendable nozzle exit cone which failed on the third and seventh flights a 29percent failure rate this is an expensive program about which we are talking there is not only the 1 5 billion today but 12 5 billion more already requested and lord knows how many billions beyond that at this time of deficits we should not be squandering money on a weapon that does not do its job do not be sold by the idea that just because these are current appropriations this vote does not affect the deficit the fact of the matter is that these funds will outlay in 1987 and 1988 so that it is indeed the 1987 and 1988 deficits that we are talking about and if your first priority is not deficits but defense understand that if you squander defense money on the mx you are not going to have it for some programs we really need in defense like improving the ability of our nato forces to fight without resort to nuclear weapons the recent report on our nato capability makes it clear that the large sums we are diverting to dubious weapons systems is costing us dearly in terms of the readiness and sustainability of our conventional forces finally let me address what i think is the only argument that anyone has seriodsly presented on behalf of this missile the geneva argument the argument that somehow we have to vote for the mx because we are sitting down with the soviets in geneva do understand that we are going to be with the soviets in geneva for several years the salt i talks took 3 years we have been going since the mid1970s on the mutual balanced force reduction talks i have to ask you because virtually all our weapons are on the table at geneva particularly in the mutual balanced force reduction talks which concern conventional as well as nuclear weapons if today you are going to vote for 21 mx missiles only because we are at geneva what are you going to do later this year when you are going to be asked to vote for 48 more mx missiles and we are still at geneva what are you going to do when you are asked to vote for antisatellite weapons and we are still at geneva what are you going to do when you are asked to vote for space defense weapons and we are still at geneva what are you going to do when you are asked to vote for binary chemical warfare weapons and we are still at geneva if you buy the geneva argument for all intents and purposes you are saying that the congress of the united states has lost control over the defense budget if you buy the geneva argument you might as well disband

let the contractor proceed today dod has a choice about how it is going to modernize and computerize its hospitals the choice is to control its own system as the veterans administration has done or turn it all over to a contractor the veterans administration has successfully automated 169 of its 172 hospitals at a cost to date of less than 130 million it is a dynamic and effective system which the va has developed and the va controls it because its own employees run it it is capable of serving medical computer needs well into the 21st century compare that with the experience of the defense department theyve already spent over 200 million and not one of their hospitals is fully automated there is a good chance that by the time the procurement process is all finished the price tag will be well over 1 billion i think that the dod should look very closely at the vas decentralized hospital computer program edhcp before it contracts with a subsidiary of general motors or some other large defense contractor and loses control of the cost were talking about a system with a life cycle cost which is very likely going to be three or four times that of the vas dhcp here is what this

mercedes well the average taxpayer doesnt want dod to buy a mercedes in 5 years when military hospitals need computers today and the vas system can be tailored to suit their needs the va is the primary backup to department of defense hospitals in the event of a major conflict weve authorized all kinds of sharing of resources between the va and dod a framework exists for dod to take the vas
