and i truly have not said that very often i came here as part of the class of 1995 we came here because we were like many people in this country we were sick and tired of the tax increases we were sick and tired of promises of a balanced budget whose words just plain rang hollow because they had no meaning we had heard so many times it was going to happen and it did not happen then there were new promises made and it did not happen again and then taxes were raised what a great day it is here to bring the news of what has happened out in washington and how different it is from 1995 looking at 1997 i am here today to talk about what has happened in washington it is the budget is balanced we reach a bipartisan agreement credit to the republicans to the gentleman from ohio to the gentleman from georgia to the leadership here in the house and to the senate also to the president who could have threatened veto could have put his feet in the ground and said we are not going to do any of this stuff we are not going to listen we are going to continue infighting but credit should be spread all around it is important we start with the fact that the budget will be balanced by 2002 or sooner i would like to go on record here and now this evening saying that if we do not go into a major recession in the next 12 months the budget is balanced not in the year 2002 but the budget is balanced in 1998 it is very important to begin with that discussion because with that discussion in mind we will understand how reasonable it is to talk about providing tax relief tax relief without a balanced budget effectively means we are borrowing more money from our childrens future and letting people keep it and spend it today and not being responsible for what is happening but when we understand that in all probability the budget will be balanced probably in 1998 1998 at the latest short of a major recession we can also provide tax relief to the american people and do it in good conscience i would like to spend a little bit of time talking about that tax relief tonight and going through some of the different aspects of it some of them are pretty well known some of them are not very known at all i would like to start perhaps with the most wellknown part of the tax cut package and that is the 500 per child tax cut let me be very clear on this it starts january 1 of next year it is 400 per child in the first area and 500 in the years after that what does this mean to a working family out there in america well if you are earning less than 110 000 a year for a couple and you have got two kids or let us say you have got three kids in your house if you are earning less than 110 000 a year and you have got three kids what you need to do is next year on january 1 you need to walk into your employers office and tell your employer you want 100 more in your paycheck starting january of next year and you want to keep that money that they were sending out to washington before this is not washington jargon or washington nonsense this is actually what happened out here today in washington dc so a family with three kids should walk in the door next january 1 to their employer and tell their employer they want to keep 100 a month that is 400 per child times three is 1 200 a year or 100 a month that they should keep in their own paycheck instead of sending it down here to washington dc is it not a great day in washington when we can talk about that instead of the 1993 discussion about which taxes we should raise and how high we should raise them things have changed out here in washington dc and again i emphasize that this discussion is going on in light of and in addition to a balanced budget probably 3 maybe even 4 years ahead of schedule what a great day it is here to be talking about these issues so again for a family of three kids earning less than 110 000 a year january 1 next year you walk into your employer and you tell him that you want to keep a hundred bucks more of the money they have been sending out here to washington dc because the job that they sent us here to do in 1995 is in fact done and it is good news for the american people i want to go on to some of the other things that are in here the other one that has been well publicized is the capital gains tax reduction i would like to be pretty explicit on this there are some different details of this that are necessary for the american people to know about if you are a senior citizen and you have a pension that accumulated while you were in the work force and you are now in a position where you are taking money out of that pension and the money of course you put in during the past years has raised in value you will be paying capital gains on that money before for every 100 you made in that pension fund for every 100 of capital gains washington took 28 away from you starting now they will only take 20 so you keep an extra 8 of your own money it is not washingtons money it is your money you keep an extra 8 for every 100 of profit that you made for every 100 of profit you made you keep an extra 8 in your own home instead of sending it on out here to washington dc let me be very clear about that the capital gains tax rate is going from 28 percent that it currently is down to 20 percent for virtually all investments the only exception to that rule and if you own real estate you want to pay particular attention to this exception if you own real estate and you purchased a building let us say for 50 000 and you have depreciated the building 10 000 and then you go and sell the building and let us hope you made a profit let us hope you sold it for 65 000 well the money you depreciated from the purchase price the 50 000 down to 40 000 that is called recapture on the recapture portion you will be paying a 25percent tax that tax is lower than it used to be too i wish it was 20 percent across the board if i had my way it would be but the bottom line is that portion of the tax is going from 28 to 25 the rest of the tax the appreciation in the propertyvalue is going from 28 percent down to 20 so good news for capital gains if you bought stocks and your stocks have appreciated in value if you bought a piece of real estate and your real estate has appreciated in value and you sell that real estate then when you report your capital gains when you report your profit you pay 20 percent tax instead of the 28 percent that you used to pay there are a couple more portions of this that have not been very well publicized that are important to an awful lot of people and again i will go to the real estate portion of this because there is a very significant change that has occurred in the real estate portion as far as the capital gains tax cut is concerned before if you owned your own home and you were under the age of 55 and you sold that home for whatever reason job transfer or you decided to live in an apartment and save money instead or your kids have grown and gone away and you are 45 and your last child just left home and the home is now too big for you so you decide to sell it and own a smaller home but at any rate you own this home and you sell it but you are under the age of 55 in the past you paid capital gains if you bought a home 15 years ago for 30 000 and you are selling it today for 90 000 that wvould be a 60 000 appreciation and in the past if you were not 55 years old you would have paid capital gains tax on 60 000 let me make it very clear this tax code changes that even if you are not 55 years old you will no longer pay capital gains on the profit of the sale of your principal residence this is very very significant to a lot of folks if you are in a highpriced area in the country and you move to a lowerpriced real estate area you may not take all the money out of the higherpriced real estate that you own in one job you take a job promotion into an area where home prices are lower there may be a difference between what you sold and what you keep you no longer pay taxes on that under this bill as long as you have been in your home for 2 years and you sell the home you do not pay taxes on whatever the appreciated value was very very significant change for a lot of people one other group of people that this affects that i have been hearing from off and on during the day i have heard from some empty nesters whose kids are either grown and gone or folks that have not had kids for whatever reason they decided not to or have not had them yet this empty nester provision or this provision where you can be in your principal residence and sell it 2 years later and not pay taxes on the profit affects lots and lots of those people for what we call empty nesters those people whose kids are grown and gone but have not yet reached the age of 55 that empty nester can now sell their home and move into a smaller home if that is what they want to do they can then put some of the money the profit away for retirement instead of sending it on out here to washington d c a very significant change in the tax code for a lot of people in this country another portion of the tax code that is changed and some people have been hearing about it the estate tax has been changed the exclusion for family businesses and family farms being passed on if you are a farmer out there in our district and your farm has been in your family for generations as many of them have in southeastern wisconsin all across wisconsin and you wish to pass that farm on to the next generation the exclusion has been raised now to 1 3 million and if there are two people in the family you could pass on up to 2 6 million total to the next generation that goes for a small business and that goes for the farms the 600 000 exclusion is going up to 1 million over a period of time i want to jump from there to another provision that has been talked about but i am not sure the details have been very well described on it and that is the education tax credit i happen to be very familiar with the cost of education i have one who is going to be a junior in college this year another one going to be a freshman in college another one is a freshman in high school when i think about these provisions and i think about making the payments every year on these college tuition bills i know this provision is going to be important to many many mdny people across this country let me start with your first 2 years of college in your first 2 years of college you get a deduction this is a tax credit of up to 1 500 per year provided you spend 3 000 total on your college costs if your college costs are over 3 000 you will get a 1 500 tax credit it is very important that we talk about the difference between a tax deduction and a tax credit a tax credit means that if your taxes were 10 000 before and you get a 1 500 credit that means your taxes go down to 38 500 it literally is a dollarfordollar deduction in your taxes so the good news is as we look at college students in your first 2 years it is up to 1 500 per year in additional help to go to college some people do not like this provision in the bill and i guess i have to look at this and say well anything that we can do here in washington to allow the people to keep more of their own money instead of sending it on out here to washington i think is a good provision and i think about all the families across wisconsin and across america that this provision is going to help allowing those students to go off to college and i just think it is a good move in the right direction i want to add one more thing in the college tuition part here in our house before my kids talk to me about my helping them by signing a note or whatever for them to go to college they first have to earn 3 000 and bring it to the table so in our house before we start talking about help from other sources whether it be the government or mom and dad or wherever first the kids are expected to do something to provide for themselves if there is one thing i would encourage every parent in the united states of america to do who has students who are either in college or thinking of going to college i think the best thing that we can do as parents for our kids is to ask them to pay part of the cost of college themselves because it will teach them many of the things they need to know after college and in some ways it will provide an education that is equally as important as college i have found in america today at least in wisconsin where we are from that it is very possible for a student to earn 3 000 over the course of a year during the summer where there are 10 12 14 weeks available and during the school year it does not hurt to work a few hours a week if necessary to make up for the addition so i would encourage the parents to ask the students first to do something on their own to provide for their own education but after they reach that point i am happy to say that washington is going to let parents keep more of their own money to apply some of that money to a college education let me kind of sum up where we are so far if you are a family with three kids you have got one of those children in college and you have got two of them still at home you are earning less than 110 000 a year january 1 next year i am back to that magic date again january 1 of next year if you have got one in college two still at home you should go into your employer and not ask for 100 extra a month to keep in your own paycheck instead of sending it to washington you should at that point walk in the door and ask to keep 200 a month extra because you would get the 31 500 for the college help in addition to that you would get 3800 more 400 mper child in the first year so just under 3200 a month you keep instead of sending it on out here to washington i smile when i say this i have a lot of confidence in the people in this great nation i know they can do a better job spending their own money than the people here in washington this is a great day in washington dc i want to go on to a couple of other things that are maybe not quite as well publicized out there one is the individual retirement the ira the expansion of the availability of iras under the new provisions for individuals if you earn 60 000 and up to 100 000 you will be eligible to start your own ira i think that is very important i heard a lot from the young couples with no children that somehow the tax code did not affect them i would like those people to know that you can open an ira now and you will be permitted under this american dream ira to withdraw money that you have saved up tax free for purposes of purchasing a home you will be permitted to put money into this american dream ira aftertax dollars but the accumulation of interest and all the rest on those aftertax dollars that you have put in there that money stays in there untaxed and if you are saving to buy your first home you can take that money out tax free to buy your first home a great provision for young folks who are looking forward to living the american dream purchasing their first home i think it is a very important part of this overall tax package the one other part that i want to just mention is the home office deduction availability for a lot of people has been increased in the day and age that we live in it is time that we recognize that there are many parents single parents in particular who are learning to make their living out of their own home so that they can both be home with their children see their kids off to school and at the same time earn some of that money the home office deduction that has been so hard to claim in the past has been put back and there have been some significant changes in that area to help people be able to accept that i have been summarizing what has happened out here today it truly is a great day in washington dc i think this is the first time i have ever been on the floor that i said it is truly a great day in washington i have to admit when i came here 2 years ago i was not sure that i would ever stand on the floor of the house of representatives and say that it has been a great day in washington dc but to be able to stand here and talk about accomplishing so many things that we were sent here to do the balanced budget and we are not talking about 2002 now although that is the outer bounds of when it may be balanced the reality of this picture is that if we can finish what is in this budget agreement and hold those spending caps we are looking at the balanced budget in 1998 in 1999 at the latest on track ahead of schedule what a magnificent change we have had since 1995 and what a magnificent change it is for the future of this great nation we live in having said that i would like to talk a little bit about the past and then how we got to where we are today and then where we are going in the future let me start just briefly with a little bit about the past i almost hate to talk about this on a great day like today because when i do talk about the past we get a picture of what has been going on out here before the american people rejected what was happening in 1994 and sent a new group out here to control washington dc it is important we understand the difference between a checkbook and borrowing money to buy a house between federal deficit spending which is the checkbook and federal debt which is the amount of money that gets borrowed every year since 1969 this government has spent more money than it had in its checkbook it reached into your pockets the pockets of the american people it collected tax dollars it put those dollars in a checkbook then it started writing out checks but they have not been paying very close attention to how many checks they write out because at the end of the year they overdrew their check book each year that is called the deficit when they talk about balancing the budget in washington what they mean is they are going to stop overdrawing their checkbook every year but when you think about overdrawing your checkbook every year since 1969 it is not hard to figure out that the debt has started to explode the debt is when they go and borrow money to cover their overdrawn checkbook it is no different than sitting around your own kitchen table writing out checks to pay your bills and overdrawing your checkbook well that does not work you have to get the money from somewhere what washington has been doing is they have been borrowing it this chart shows the growth of the federal debt it shows how year after year after year as they overspent their checkbook they borrowed more and more and more money i would point out that around about 1980 is when this thing really started climbing i know all the democrats out there go thats the year that republican president reagan took over and all the republicans go yeah thats the year the democrat congress spent way too much money we blame each other out here it is time we get past blaming each other and it is time we accept the fact that this is a problem facing our nation and do something about it and in fact that is what has happened since 1995 i would also point out that we are about here on this chart right now the debt facing our nation has grown to huge proportions remember this is the part that is like borrowing money to buy your house i have brought another chart that shows how big this number actually is i am a former math teacher we used to do these problems in my math classrooms the debt currently stands at 5 3 trillion even when we are through the euphoria of today the good news that we have reached a balanced budget and we are lowering taxes we still have this 5 3 trillion debt hanging over our heads 5 3 trillion divided up amongst the people in the country if every person were to pay just their share of the federal debt it would be 20 000 for every man woman and child in the united states let me put this another way this government the people in washington dc especially before 1995 saw fit to spend 20 000 of our childrens money more than what they collected in taxes from our generation for a family of five like mine they spent 100 000 they have literally borrowed 100 000 on behalf of every group of five people in the united states of america here is the kicker a family of 5 in america today is paying 580 a month to do nothing but pay their share of the interest on this federal debt a lot of people say well i dont pay 580 a month in taxes so how could i possibly be paying 580 a month to pay our share on that federal debt the reality is when you walk in a store and you buy a new pair of jeans or when you walk in a store and you buy a loaf of bread the store owner makes a small profit on the sale of that loaf of bread to the person that walked in and bought it part of that profit gets sent out here to washington dc when you add up all the different parts of the taxes that you pay through society every family of five in america today or every group of five people is paying 580 a month to do nothing but pay the interest on the federal debt it is staggering in spite of the fact we had a great day we are getting to a point where we are at least balancing our budget we are not going to keep adding to that federal debt as we go forward in spite of the fact that we have had a great day out here today and we have moved in the right direction this debt is still hanging over our head after we reach a balanced budget it would seem logical to ask how in the world did we get into this kind of a mess how did we get to a point where a family of five is in debt on behalf of their government 100 000 i think that is the next logical thing that should be looked at to do that i would like to refer back to what was going on in the late 1980s and the early 1990s in washington dc this is before what i call the revolt of the american people in 1994 because remember it was 1994 where the american people said enough is enough weve had it with the tax increases the broken promises were going to try a new party in control in the house of representatives and in the senate first time in 40 years they did that this is the late 1980s and the early 1990s this is the gramrudmanhollings promises first of 1985 to balance the budget by 1991 the blue line shows the promises that they made the red line shows the actual deficits it is not hard to see in this picture that the promises made were not what they did out here in washington dc so even though they made these promises to the american people they broke them when they found out they could not hit these targets they did what all good people in washington do they made a new set of promises it is no wonder the american people got so cynical about what is being said out of this city they made a whole new set of promises the blue line shows what they promised the second time and the red line shows the broken promises again it is not hard to figure out why the american people are so cynical when i call home to my district and i say hey guess what the budgets balanced probably next year maybe the year after at the latest but certainly before 2002 sometimes people do not believe us it is not hard for me to figure out why they do not believe it because when i look at the track record of what went on out here in washington before 1995 it is very easy to see these broken promises so what happened well they broke the promises 1993 came and went there was no balanced budget but in 1993 a very significant happening occurred the people in washington said were going to get serious about balancing the budget we know how to do it were going to raise taxes on the american people because if we just collect enough money out of the pockets of the american people if we get enough money out here in washington well know how to spend it best for the people and then we can balance the budget that was 1993 the tax increase passed by a single vote in the house of representatives the tax increase passed by a single vote in the senate not a single republican in either body voted for the bill the tax increase went through that was the best thing that ever happened in a lot of ways let me explain why the american people looked at this picture and the broken promises and they looked at the tax increases of 1993 and they said enough is enough were going to change what isgoing on in washington dc and in 1995 an amazing thing happened they elected a new group to control it they put the republicans in control of both the house and the senate and interesting things happened things changed the republicans got here and much like the people that were in control in the past they gave a set of promises to the american people too they said we are going to balance the budget by the year 2002 and not only that we are going to cut your taxes while we are doing it and they laid a plan out i think it is more than fair that at this point the american people should say look 1995 is 2 years ago youre really in the third year of your 7year plan to balance the budget how you doing and i think that is a fair question and i think it deserves an answer because it helps people see how different things are from how they were before the red in this chart the red columns show the promises made in 1995 by the republicans when they took over this is our plan to balance the budget by the year 2002 and in this chart you will notice that in the year 2002 it zeros out that it is a balanced budget this is our promises that we made back in 1995 we are now in the third year let us see how we are doing well the first year came and went we promised the deficit would be lower than 154 billion it came in at 107 billion first year on track ahead of schedule think back to those grammrudmanhollings charts i had up here a minute ago what a change on track ahead of schedule second year came second year we promised deficits below 174 billion this shows 57 billion the good news is this is probably going to be 30 billion this is great news for america we are over a 100 billion ahead how in the world did that happen well it is pretty straightforward we had this working model that we put into place back in 1995 here is our theory our theory was that if we curtailed the growth of the american spending we left the money in the pockets of the people we did not want to hear about tax increases instead we curtailed the growth of government spending if we curtailed the growth of government spending that meant washington was going to spend less so they would borrow less when they borrowed less that meant more money available in the private sector well if there is more money available in the private sector more money available moans lower interest rates lower interest rates would mean people would buy more houses and cars and if they bought more houses and cars other people would have to go to work building the houses and cars and that would be a long ways toward solving the welfare problems because of course they would leave the welfare rolls go to work and start paying taxes the bottom line is that theory that working theory of curtailing the growth of government spending so washington borrows less leaving more available in the private sector keeping the interest rates down so people will buy more houses and cars so others will have job opportunities building those houses and cars the model worked and that is why we are so far ahead of schedule here in the second year it led to a booming economy and we hear in the news now that the economy is booming and making us all work absolutely part of this is the booming economy that is making it work part of the reason the economy is booming is because the interest rates have stayed down and here is part of the picture why well that was the second year on track ahead of schedule we are now in the third year the third year we promised a deficit below 139 billion and i would like to make a projection here now tonight my chart shows 90 billion deficit next year or in the fiscal year we are now working in i would like to predict that that number is going to read zero i would like to suggest that in fact we are going to find out in the next few months that the budget is going to be balanced in fiscal year 1998 fiscal year 1999 at the latest if we just stay with the economy the way it is now no big boom no massive downturn if it just stays just the way it is right now and we continue to hold spending in check we will have a balanced budget as soon as next year folks we are not only on target we are in the third year of a 7year plan to balance the federal budget and we are not only on track but we are significantly ahead of schedule to the point where we can both balance the budget and provide tax relief for the american people great news for america and like i said it is just great to look at these numbers and be able to talk positive about what has happened out here in spite of all the rest of the stuff if you were tuned in earlier and you saw the bickering that went on on this floor just before we got here and took over for this hour all of the partisan bickering aside everything else that has happened out here the bottom line is if we look at the war the war to balance the federal budget and preserve this nation for the future generations we are winning the war right now and it is almost over now i have heard a lot in the news media that the only thing going on is the economy is booming and in fact there is a lot of folks that would like to say well washington is still so fouled up and the only thing going on is the economy is booming well i brought a chart with me to help see that in fact there are two parts to this thing working one is the economy and certainly we do not want to take anything away from that but the other one is again things have changed since 1995 in the 7 years before republicans took over in 1995 the average growth in spending for the federal government was 5 2 percent since republicans have taken over and in the first 7 years of the republicans including the balance of 4 years have not yet occurred growth is 3 2 percent so under the first 7 years of republican control 3 2 percent growth under the last 7 years democrat control 5 2 percent growth now what does this really mean there is a couple of things that are pretty significant in this chart first the american people have been told repeatedly that there are draco nian cuts in washington well the first thing i would point out is that there are no cuts spending in washington is still going up by 3 2 percent but the growth in government spending has been curtailed by 40 percent that is about a 40percent reduction in the growth of government spending that is good news and that is part of what has led us to success on the other side we see in real dollars or inflationadjusted dollars before we got here was going up about 1 8 percent per year and it is now going up about 0 6 so it has been about a twothirds reduction in the growth of government spending the idea that there are massive draconian cuts in washington programs is nonsense in fact do we still have a long ways to go to get the growth of government spending completely under control yes is the answer to that question we still have a way to go there is a lot of very conservative republicans who are saying the budget agreement is no good because and you can fill in the blank for what they put in they would like this blue area to read zero they would like absolutely no growth in government spending and if i were perfectly honest about it i probably fall into that category i would prefer less growth in government spending and let the people keep more of their own money and decide how to spend it themselves but i do not think that means we should look away from the progress that has been made and there clearly has been progress made reducing the growth in government spending putting us in the third year of a 7year plan to balance the federal budget and being on track and ahead of schedule that is not all bad that is good and we are on the right track we have turned a very significant corner for the future of this great nation that we live in i would like to put this all in perspective another way if when we came to washington dc instead of doing our jobs we played basketball and golf what would have happened and that is what this chart shows this is what we found when we got to washington in 1995 when the american people made that change the revolt of 1994 rejecting the tax increases of 1993 rejecting the broken promises of the early 1990s and late 1980s this is what we found the deficit was about 175 180 billion at that point and this red line shows you what would have happened had we decided to play basketball and golf and not done our job out here but instead of doing that in the first 12 months we made some progress and it wasthere was no bullets fired but it was just short of a war some folks remember what was called a government shutdown and all the negative cutting medicare stuff and all of the negative misinformation that was put out of this city we did go through a war at the end of 12 months this yellow line shows how far we would come if we quit at that point we could not quit at that point because the job was not done the green line dhows the plan that we laid in place to balance the federal budget and again thinking back to the grammrudmanhollings and how they never hit their targets the blue line shows you where we actually are today this is how much progress has been made this is what would have happened if we did nothing this is what did happen in the first 12 months progress that was made we did not quit this is the plan and this is where we are what great news for america we are winning this war we are winning the war to preserve the future of this nation what other nations could not do with military power we almost did to ourselves by running up such a huge debt that we would have no ability to repay it this ii not the end of the picture and again i point out where we had this discussion a little bit after the budget is balanced when we reach zero when we are no longer overdrawing our checkbook the job is not done we still have a 5 3 trillion debt staring us in the face and the logical question is what are you going to do about that well before we answer that question i think we ought to pause long enough to applaud the progress that has been made there has not been a balanced budget in this community since 1969 there has not been a tax cut in this community since 1982 there has been a lot of tax increases but no tax cuts so before we go on to what is next let us at least pause long enough to recognize that from 1995 forward things have changed in this community and i would encourage anyone watching tonight and i would encourage my colleagues to congratulate each other on what has happened out here in washington and the change that has occurred since 1995 it should be a tribute to the american people is who it should be a tribute to because had they not changed what was going on in washington by electing different people the same stuff would be going on again there is no reason to believe anything different what is next well we still have a 5 4 trillion debt staring us in the face we introduced last week a bill called the national debt repayment act and what the national debt repayment act does is it recognizes that we are soon going to have a balanced budget and after we balance the budget it caps the growth in government spending at a rate 1 percent lower than the rate of revenue growth by capping the growth in government spending 1 percent lower than the rate of revenue growth that creates a surplus the surplus is taken twothirds to pay down the debt and onethird to further reduce taxes it is the national debt repayment act i am happy to say there is currently about 100 cosponsors in the house of representatives newt gingrich john"], [0.0001788872032193467, 0.0001788872032193467, 0, "i turn our attention now to the question that i get asked quite regularly after i get done talking about the tax cuts and they are very concerned that we are not destroying this nation to do it i start tonight by talking about how we got into the situation we are in today where we have a 5 3 trillion debt staring us in the face this chart i brought with me shows the growth of the debt and how from 1960 to 1980 it did not really grow very much but from 1980 forward it has grown a lot the chart ends in 1995 and we can see how fast the debt climbed in particular from the late seventies and the early eighties on through the year 1995 it has led us to a point where we are 5 3 trillion in debt by the way a lot of people look at this and say well if i am a democrat i go 1980 that is ronald reagan it must be reagans fault if i am a republican i go the democrats controlled congress during all those years and they spent out of control so it is the democrats fault the facts of the matter are that it is an american problem it is time we put our partisanship aside and figure out how to solve the problem for the good of the future of this great nation that we live in it is a very real problem and i think it is clear from looking at this picture that this problem cannot be allowed to continue this picture is the reason i left the private sector a very good job in a very good business providing job opportunities for people as a homebuilder i left the profession and ranfor office because i knew this would bring us down as a nation if we did not do something about it i brought a board along that shows the number because a lot of folks have never seen how big this number is we are currently 5 3 trillion in debt as a nation this next line shows if we divide that debt up amongst all the people so everybody pays just their share of the debt 5 3 trillion divided by the people in the country is 20 000 for every man woman and child in america let me say that another way this government the people that have been here in washington since 1980 saw fit to spend 20 000 more than they collected in taxes for virtually every single american man woman and child in the whole country for a family of five like mine this nation has borrowed on our behalf 100 000 we are in debt 20 000 for every man woman and child in america and 100 000 for a family of five like mine and the real problem with that is this is a real debt interest is being paid on it a family of five like mine this year will pay 580 a month every month to do nothing but pay the interest on that federal debt as a matter of fact one dollar out of every six that the federal government spends i e one dollar out of every six that they collect out of your pocket in taxes one dollar out of every six does nothing but pay the interest on this federal debt it is not just income taxes where they are paying that 580 a month if you do something as simple as walk into the store and buy a loaf of bread the store owner makes a small profit on that loaf of bread and of course when the store owner makes a small profit part of that profit is taxed and it gets sent out here to washington to pay interest on that federal debt this is a very very serious problem that must be addressed in this nation how did we get here well each and every year since 1969 this government has overdrawn its checkbook it is not a lot different from your checkbook or any other family in america when they will do their bills and figure out their checkbooks each month the government takes in a certain amount of money and writes out checks when they write out checks for more money than they have in their checkbook what they do is borrow the money and of course that adds to the debt each and every year since 1969 we have not had one single year where the federal government did not spend more money than it had in its checkbook that is a pretty staggering statement since 1969 we have not had one single year where washington did not spend more money than it had in its checkbook if that were our home or any home of any of the families across america the banks would certainly have foreclosed and stopped the checking account before now but in washington they have just kept borrowing and borrowing and borrowing and that is what has led us to the 5 3 trillion debt i think it is very significant to talk about what happened during the 1980s and the 1990s that led us to this position and before 1995 what happened to get us into this mess well time and time again washington laid into place a plan to balance the federal budget and how many times did the american people hear that phrase balance the federal budget the grammrudmanhollings bill of 1995 and i have the 1997 one up here this blue line shows what they promised the american people they promised they would get to a balanced budget by 1993 the red line shows what they actually did when they promised the people they were going to have a balanced budget and did this the american people became critical of washington and it is very understandable that criticism that was leveled against washington because they promised one thing and did something different entirely and that is why that is what led up to the change in congress in 1994 that is what brought the american people to change control of the house of representatives and change control of the senate i mean in all fairness what they did is turn the house of representatives from democrat control into republican control and they changed the senate into republican control and in all fairness they left a democrat president in this mix so what the american people saw fit to do was say we have rejected this idea we have rejected this group of people that have promised us repeatedly to get to a balanced budget but did something different every time so we got to 1993 and we were looking at this picture where in fact they had not met their promise and the budget was not balanced so washington made a decision about what to do it is very different than 1997 in 1993 when they looked at this picture and saw that they wanted to balance the budget they raised taxes they concluded that they could not control washington spending so the only alternative if they were serious about getting to a balanced budget was to raise taxes so they raised the social security taxes on senior citizens they raised the gasoline tax by 4 3 cents a gallon but they did not spend the money for extra roads or infrastructure or to provide a better mechanism to get product from one place of production to the marketplace they raised it by 4 3 cents a gallon and did not spend the money on building roads on top of that they tacked on another 2 5 percent that would have expired and that money is not actually getting spent to build roads either social security taxes went up marginal tax rates went up i think a are getting a pretty clear picture here we have broken promises because washington could not curtail its spending and we have raised taxes as the logical solution they concluded back in 1993 as the right way to get to a balanced budget the american people in 1994 said wrong that is not what we want we do not want these broken promises and we do not want tax increases we want washington to control its spending appetite and they elected a new group to congress in 1995 we laid out a plan and we promised the american people again that we were going to balance the budget and the american people were skeptical to say the least but our plan is this blue line this is the deficit stream that we promised to the american people we are now in the third year of this 7year plan to balance the federal budget and i think the american people should be asking how are they doing they are 3 years in do they warrant our consideration to allow them to stay or should we throw them out and get a new group in there too we are in the third year to balance the federal budget we are not only on track to balancing the federal budget but we are so far ahead of schedule from what we promised that we will probably have our first balanced budget in fiscal year 1998 4 years ahead of what was promised this picture down here on track ahead of schedule fulfilling the promises made to the american people is very different than this picture up here i would add that in the face of this picture in the face of washington finally curtailing the growth of washington spending so that we can actually stay on track and get to a balanced budget sooner not later sooner than promised we have also laid this tax cut package that i was explaining earlier in the hour on the table so we are not only reducing taxes we are reaching a balanced budget ahead of schedule so the answer to the constituents question when they ask me are we wrecking america by cutting taxes the answer is definitively no if washington just curtails the growth of spending we reach a point where we can both balance the budget and reduce taxes at the same time and when we say reduce taxes it is very simple that means let the people keep more of their own money instead of giving it out here to washington that means we understand that the people can do a better job spending their money than the people out here in washington i have another way to show this same thing and it is a similar statement here but it is another way to look at it to understand how it is that we have been able to both balance the budget and cut taxes at the same time this red line shows how fast spending was growing before 1995 before the american people put a new group in control of the house of representatives in 1995 this red line started going up a little slower the spending growth of washington started going up at a slower rate it is still going up and to all our constituents that are concerned that medicare medicaid or some of those important programs are going away well no spending is as a matter of fact still going up faster than some of us would like to see at the same time the blue line kept going up as fast or faster so when spending started going up at a slower rate and revenue started going up at a faster rate it is easy to see that we are going to start running a surplus in the near term again the good news is we will have the first tax cut in 16 years we have the first balanced budget since 1969 and medicare has been restored for our senior citizens there is another important chart to take a look at here because it really emphasizes how different things are i had a lot of my constituents say well you know mark you guys are actually lucky the economy is doing so good that you all are going to look good no matter what you do out there while there are a couple of things to think about in response to that first the economy has done good between 1969 and today and it has never led to a balanced budget every time the economy has performed well in the past washington saw the extra revenues coming in and acted very quickly to spend the extra revenues on every program they could think of this congress has acted very differently in the face of a very strong economy we curtailed the growth in spending this chart shows how fast spending was going up before we got here 5 2 percent annual growth rate this shows how fast it is going up under the new house of representatives under republican control and it is important to note that at the same time the economy has been very strong the growth of washington spending has been curtailed this chart is important for another reason a lot of folks say well mark when you are curtailing or cutting washington spending and they call it cuts it is important to note that washington spending is still going up again i emphasize too fast for some of our likings myself included but washington spending is still going up but it is going up at a much slower rate than it was before when washington spending growth is curtailed that means washington spends less money if washington spends less money that means they borrow less money they overdraw their checkbook by less when they borrow less money out of the private sector that leaves more money available in the private sector and from here it gets pretty easy more money available in the private sector means the interest rates will stay down with the interest rates down of course people buy more houses and cars and they have a better chance of living the american dream and when they buy more houses and cars i get excited when i talk about this part when they buy more houses and cars of course that means that there will be job opportunities for our kids because somebody has to build those houses and cars and that means that my kids can have the hope and dream of living the american dream right here in our nation they will not have to go to a pacific rim country china or someplace else to live the american dream when we see this sort of thing happening washington borrows less money more money available in the private sector means lower interest rates people again have the chance of living the american dream when they buy those houses and cars that is job opportunities and that is what is going to keep our kids right here home in america where they belong this chart i cannot emphasize the significance and importance of understanding that we have two things going on out here at the same time that has allowed us to get to our first balanced budget since 1969 and lower taxes at the same time the strong economy coupled with curtailing the growth of washington spending has led us to this point and it is a very nice spot to be at the next question i typically hear at my town hall meetings is who gets credit for all of this stuff the first answer to that question is very straightforward i learned in washington that there is absolutely no end to what we can accomplish if we are willing to give the credit for doing it to someone else so my first answer to our constituents is i do not care who gets the credit this is so good for america it does not matter who gets the credit it is the right thing for our country a balanced budget lower taxes medicare restored those are the right things so it does not matter who gets credit i also brought documentation here as to what was going on when we came here in 1995 and what would have happened if we had come and played golf tennis basketball and did not do our jobs on this chart we can see where the deficit was heading when we got here in 1995 this red line shows what the deficit would be as we move toward the year 2002 had we done nothing this is what would have happened the yellow line shows what would have happened after our first 12 months in the first 12 months we made progress and again i think it is important to remember those first 12 months that was the 100 days that was the contract with america where we did all kinds of things in the first day and those 100 days were many many hours out here lots of disagreement from side to side as to what should be done but what it did do is it brought this projeated deficit line down to this yellow line well we boldly laid the green line into place and we boldly promised the american people that even though we were looking at this picture we were going to make this happen i am happy to report that when we got done with it we are now 3 years into the plan and we not only achieved our target the green line but we are far ahead of schedule from what was promised again when we understand all of these pieces of pie put together curtailing the growth of washington spending more money available in the private sector which keeps the interest rates down people buy more houses and cars that is more job opportunities so they leave the welfare rolls when we see all of these pieces fitting together it is pretty clear how we can be here talking about the first balanced budget since 1969 in addition to the first tax cut and medicare being restored i have one more thing that i think is important to talk about because i have talked about the past and the present i talked about how it was before 1995 with broken promises and tax increases and how it is now in the third year of a 7year plan to balance the budget where we are on track and ahead of schedule and we are also providing the first tax cut in 16 years and medicare restored i think the logical question is what next where do we go from here and what kind of problems do we still have facing america well first even after we get to a balanced budget we still have a 5 3 trillion debt staring us in the face i can see in the gallery above me here this evening some young people if we do not do anything about that 5 3 trillion debt it would be like the parents that are sitting up there simply passing this debt on to their children so the first thing we need to think about after we get to a balanced budget is get on a payment plan so we repay that 5 3 trillion debt we have drafted legislation in our office that is called the national debt repayment act that effectively puts us on a home mortgage repayment plan it is not a lot different than the people who used to build homes with us and when they got the home done went to the bank borrowed the money and put it on a 30year repayment plan that is effectively what we have done it goes like this after the budget is balanced we cap the growth of washington spending at a rate at least 1 percent below the rate of revenue growth i have a picture here that shows what happens if the red line the spending line is going up at a slower rate than the blue line again if the revenue line the blue line is going up faster than the red line the spending line that creates a surplus it creates a little gap between those two lines it creates a surplus here is what our bill does it says recognizing that simply by controlling washington spending growth we can create this surplus we are going to take twothirds of the surplus and make a house payment we are going to make that payment on the 5 3 trillion debt so we are going to start making mortgage payments on this debt that has been run up over the last 15 to 20 years if this plan is followed twothirds of the money twothirds of this surplus will literally repay the entire federal debt by the year 2026 it does something else that is very important as well when we are repaying the debt we are putting the money back into the social security trust fund that has been taken out over the last 15 years it is important to understand that social security today is taking more money out of paychecks of people than what it is giving back out to our senior citizens in benefits that extra money that is coming in is supposed to be set aside in a savings account so that when the baby boom generation gets to retirement there is enough money there that they can go to the savings account get the money and make good on the social security promises it should come as no surprise so anyone that has followed washington that the money that has come in for social security that is supposed to be in the savings account is not there it has been spent on all kinds of washington programs and the social security trust fund is now all part of the 5 3 trillion debt the national debt repayment act repays the entire federal debt so when we are repaying the federal debt we are putting the money back into the social security trust fund so the national debt repayment act restores the social security trust fund for our senior citizens the other third of the surplus twothirds is going to make these payments on the national debt the other onethird is being used to reduce taxes each year for our working families in america so the good news is we look to the future with the national debt repayment act our seniors can rest assured that their social security will be safe because the national debt repayment act puts the money back in that has been taken out of the social security trust fund our children can be assured that the entire federal debt would be repaid think of this legacy we could pass this nation on to our children absolutely debtfree for people in the work force today they can count on additional tax cuts lord only knows i have heard enough different ideas of which taxes to cut next my personal preference is that we eliminate the marriage tax penalty and maybe have some acrosstheboard tax cuts beyond that but the good news is think of the wonderful fight we are about to have which taxes should we reduce and how far down should we take those taxes and how different that fight is from 1993 when the debate was which taxes shall we raise and how high we should raise them this is a good debate to have to all the folks upset about any portion of the tax cut plan because it should have been a different way i would simply remind us how different this fight is from 1993 where how high we should raise taxes and which one was the debate as opposed to 1997 where we are having this debate about which taxes to cut so the national debt repayment act provides surpluses as we go forward use twothirds of those surpluses to make a mortgage type payment on the federal debt the other onethird goes to tax cuts if enacted it guarantees our children a debtfree nation a legacy of a debtfree country our senior citizens social security would be restored and the people in the w6rk force today can look forward to additional tax cuts as we move forward not a bad plan for 3 years into this new congress we have gone away from the broken promises of the past and the raising taxes to the first balanced budget since 1969 and the first tax cut in 16 years and we are now moving forward to the next step which is repaying the federal debt we can look forward to passing this nation on to our children debtfree i yield to the

budget and increased spending for some social programs nothing is further from the truth this balanced budget deal was achieved primarily by drastic cuts 115 billion from icarethe major health program for the elderly and 13 billion in savings from medicaidthe major federal program providing health care for poor people the budget gets balanced by cutting medicare payments to doctors hospitals and other health care providers the budget deal freezes medicare payments to hospitals at the fiscal year 1997 level even though we all know that the demand and costs are rising and this deal reduces medicare and medicaid payments for hospitals that serve a disproportionate number of lowincome patientsthe very poorthe uninsured these include public hospitals like cook county hospital in chicago and the university of chicago hospital in the first congressional district and the cuts also hurt those whose very breath depends on home oxygen the budget cuts payments for oxygen and oxygen

percent of these cuts go to the top 1 percent of income earners with due respect to the president and my colleagues on both sides of the aislethis budget does contain some hardwon provisionsbut lets not forget they were fought for and wonby poor people working people and advocates for children and immigrants this bill does include expanded health insurance for poor children the bill restores

0.0003871722728945315, 0, "today we continue a discussion that began in 1996 it deals with this city this is a picture of washington dc and it deals with what we really can expect washington to do and the kind of balance that we need to strive for in this country between what we expect from washington what we expect from the private sector what we expect from individuals and perhaps what we can expect from faithbased and religious and volunteer organizations in america in many cases i believe we have moved too much power to this town we have asked washington to do all kinds of things that perhaps it is not best equipped to do we saw some of this last week when we heard the president articulate a vision for education a vision that i believe moves power authority and control from the local level from the parental level back to this community back to this town and it says the way we improve education in america is we empower washington and we empower the bureaucrats in washington to make decisions we used this chart for the first time or this picture for the first time in 1996 when we talked about the crisis that this nation was facing in welfare because what we had done in welfare is we had moved decisionmaking away from the local level where we were best equipped to help those in need and we moved it to washington we moved it to buildings here in washington so that when the state of michigan or when the state of wisconsin wanted to design a program that they felt best met the needs of their citizens they had to come to a building over here and a bureaucrat in washington who had maybe never been in wisconsin maybe never been in california maybe never been in michigan and say can i do this in my state and the bureaucrats in washington were empowered to make the decisions yesterday i had the opportunity to meet with a new program in the state of michigan where in my home county they are working on what they call project zero which is to move everybody off of welfare it is a partnership it is a partnership between local agencies it is a partnership with the state and it is a partnership in a volunteer way with faithbased institutions to reach out and embrace those families that need help and to lift them up in a permanent and in a meaningful way off of welfare those are the kinds of programs that i expect we will see over the next 12 18 24 months that will have a dramatic improvement in the welfare situation in this country now after we have made that change in welfare which moves power back from washington back to the states and more important back to the local communities where we can have these creative mergers of people coming together to help others in the community we find that the president does not really believe that the era of big government is over he now believes that the era of big government has moved from a failure in welfare and it is kind of like we did not learn our lesson we are going to take that bureaucracy now and create and expand the department of education over the last 9 months we have had hearings around the country and we know that that model does not work we know that the model of moving power to washington and moving power to bureaucrats in washington is not the answer these bureaucrats are knowledgeable talented people but they cannot address the problems at the local level in hearings that we have had in new york city that we have had in chicago that we have had in cleveland that we had a couple of weeks ago in los angeles and phoenix the answer is very clear the way that we improve education is we empower parents we move decisionmaking back to the local level we focus on basic academics and we drive dollars back into the classroom and not into a bureaucracy and into bureaucrats as wellmeaning as they may be the system today is fairly clear and what the president proposes is fairly clear it is the myth it is the myth of the magical president who believes that by having good intentions in washington and outlining wonderfulsounding programs and moving dollars to washington and moving responsibility to washington we can actually solve the problems that we have in education there is no doubt that in certain parts of our country education is in crisis if we take a look at some of the statistics this is not a debate about whether we need to improve education or whether we need to put a focus on education the statistics are clear onehalf of all adult americans are functionally illiterate two weeks ago we had a hearing in california think about it twentyfive percent of the students that enter higher education in the state of california need remedial education this is kids in 8th grade this is kids in 10th grade these are kids going into higher education twentyfive percent of them when they enter the institution of higher education need remedial education what does that mean that means that they are entering into college and they cannot read or write at an 8th grade level sixtyfour percent of 12th graders do not read at a proficient level in international comparisons unitedstates students scored worse in math than any other country except for jordan if we take a look outside of this building in washington dc it is also not an issue of money we spend about 8 300 per child in the city of washington dc and we have some of the lowest test scores in the country in the state of michigan we spend about 5 400 per student so it is not let us pour more money into these programs or into these cities it is let us focus on the basics when we have gone around the country the exciting thing that we have noticed is that we can go into many areas that we would identify as having atrisk kids the kids that maybe when we take a look at their environment and a whole series of factors we might be saying they are at risk and they are at risk because maybe they are in an environment where it is most difficult for them to learn the exciting thing about this is as we go into these areas we see schools we see teachers and we see parents and most importantly we see some of the greatest kids in this country and they are learning and they are learning successfully but it is because of the schools and it does not make a difference whether it is a public school or a private school or whether it is a charter school we have seen examples of all of these but when the schools make a commitment to involve the parents where they have been freed from the rules and regulations from washington and from the state so that the teachers and the administration can focus on the kids rather than the rules and regulations it works when the dollars go into the classroom rather than into paperwork it works and when the schools are focusing on basic academics it works j 1430 here is the system today and here is why i am leery about sending more money to washington and why i believe it is a myth and why i believe that in the area of education at least in washington more does not mean better remember what we have in washington today when we say education washington has been trying to help in the area of education for the last 20 years twenty years of work 760 different programs running through 39 different agencies spending about 120 billioh per year washington has been going after this problem but we have not been doing it very successfully why what is the process well we start with parents which is where we should start we should have focus on parents and kids but when we move the education system and the focus of education to washington we end up getting a whole bunch of layers in between parents kids and teachers and local school boards in washington in this model that some want to expand we have parents paying into washington about 120 billion into washington programs into washington bureaucracies 760 different programs we are worried about reading and writing washington a couple of years ago had 32 different literacy programs we still have more than 14 literacy programs 120 billion into 760 programs 39 different agencies then the washington bureaucracy all the arrows point one way in terms of putting rules and regulations and dollars back on state and local school boards but what happens when we create a program if you create a program somebody has to find out about it so we spend dollars communicating to a school board or to a state saying weve got these dollars available for these kinds of programs so we invest dollars in a communications effort school boards find out about it they do not automatically get it they have to now say i wonder if we qualify for this what do we need to do to qualify for this how do we apply they then fill out applications and it goes back to the bureaucracy the bureaucrats in washington say well you know weve got x amount of dollars weve got so many school districts applying were going to have to go through a sorting process to decide who gets this money and who does not so they go through a decisionmaking process in the awarding of grants the vice presidents national performance review outlined that in one of these grant applications in the department of education the process went through 487 different steps to move dollars from washington actually back to a school board back actually to the kids washington then sends money to a school board or to a local school district of course we cannot trust the people at the local level to do what we ask them to do so of course we have rules and regulations and we have reporting structures back into washington that says yes we received your money and yes here is proof that we spent it exactly the way you wanted us to we in washington of course cannot believe those so we have to put in place an auditing program that says make sure you keep your records because we may want to come back and audit that you actually spent the money the way we intended you to spend it the bottom line is when parents send 120 billion to washington and they funnel it through the 760 programs that we lose at least conservatively we lose at least 15 cents of the federal dollar if you take a look at how much we lose at the state and the local level as they go through the process of applying and meeting the rules and regulations in the local cost we probably lose somewhere in the neighborhood of 35 to 40 cents of each and every education dollar that goes to washington to funnel it back we are not getting the money into the classroom most of this money or a good portion of it probably 35 to 40 percent of the dollars that we think we are investing in education gets sucked up into the bureaucracy and into the paperwork and what happens is rather than school boards focusing on and working with parents as to what they need to do in their local district what we have created is a model that says kids are important but i need to meet the rules the requirements and the regulations from washington so their focus goes to a bureaucracy in washington and not to parents and not on kids we have got to break the cycle we have to focus on what ij important the basics local and parental control and getting dollars into the classroom we need to focus and we need a model where the people who are involved in education and setting the direction for education for our kids are parents kids and local leaders in the community i can say that with conviction because of the success we have seen around the country we visited the vaughn charter school in l a 2 weeks ago south central los angeles one of the lowest performing schools when it was part of the unified los angeles school district it is now a charter school it is still a public school it is still accountable to the taxpayers but what they did when they became a charter school they cut the strings of bureaucracy dr chan who is heading that school saved the school district and the number is a little bit disputed but somewhere in the neighborhood of 1 5 million but more importantly talking to the parents talking to the kids going into the classrooms sitting around a table and talking about what makes this school different today the parents dr chan and the students are all saying it is because this is the model the model is one where the school the principal and the teachers have a partnership with the parents and they are focused on the kids parents talk about we got our school back as a matter of fact it is now a neighborhood school the kids in this neighborhood were being bused all over the kids now have the choice of where they want to go to school they are now going back to this school they not only took control of the school back for the parents but it is now a neighborhood school and in a very rough part of los angeles it is kind of like a bright beacon in that community about what a local community can do when it cuts the strings from a bureaucracy and is empowered to take over a small part of its own community and it is empowered to take over a very important part of its community which is the schools there are a couple of other interesting statistics when we talk about what happens when dollars go into washington we know we lose at least 15 cents here in washington and we know that we lose at least another 20 cents when you go to the costs incurred by the local schools and the state but it is kind of interesting how these dollars get distributed dollars do not follow kids dollars go all over the place if you are in alaska sending dollars to washington and increasing the washington bureaucracy is a good deal because even though you maybe lose 40 cents of every dollar you send to washington with alaska when you send 1 in you get 3 12 back so the dollars coming in the share back to you is very positive it is a disproportionate share back to alaska if you are in connecticut it does not really pay connecticut gets all of 39 cents back to that state if you are in mississippi you get 2 41 if you are in new mexico you get 2 34 if you are close to new mexico in nevada too bad you only get 39 cents back so it is a huge shell game in washington that is not focused on kids it is not focused on improving education it is focused on bureaucrats and politicians trying to do something that really parents and local school districts can do a whole lot better as we take a look at this this system does not work when we take a look at what is going on and some of the proposals that the president has to improve learning to improve education it is interesting one of the proposals he has and i have oversight over this area is the president proposes 809 million for the corporation for national and community service national and community service it sounds great our volunteers through the corporation for national service cost us as taxpayers about 27 000 apiece or as high as 27 000 they are going to go out and they are going to get tutors i think that is a laudable objective schools are doing this today community groups are involved and i amnot sure what the federal government can do to help and assist in that process we fund and send money through the corporation for national service and it would be one thing if we knew where now another roughly 1 billion going into this model we know we are going to lose some of that in the structure and in the hierarchy and in the bureaucracy we also know that at least for the corporation for national service and for many of these other agencies we are not actually going to know where the money goes the corporation for national service this is an agency that spends about 600 to 700 million per year the books still are not auditable think about it sending taxpayer dollars to an agency that was set up and was going to be the model for a government agency and how government should run but cannot have an independent accounting firm come in and audit its books that is one example the heritage foundation cites a number of other examples that says these 760 programs do not have the kind of oversight necessary to determine whether they work and where the dollars are going and whether they are efficient or not is it not interesting that we know we have a problem in reading we know that our kids are not reading at competitive standards that in certain states a high percentage of them need remedial education and rather than focusing on the real problem as to why kids are not learning in the classroom the response in washington is to create another program we have known that this has been an issue we have got 14 literacy programs and now what we are doing is we are funding an overlay of perhaps volunteers reading 2 hours per day or 2 hours per week with students but we are not asking the fundamental questions as to why are kids not learning to read in the classroom is there something going on in the classroom that is prohibiting kids from learning why do we not take a look at what is going on in the classroom before we do anvthing else and maybe moving dollars into the classroom is a more effective way of addressing this problem than putting another bandaid on an open wound maybe we ought to go back and take a look at the 14 literacy programs that are already spending over 8 billion per year from a washington level and saying why are those 14 literacy programs not driving the kinds of results that we would like to have if they are good programs and they are working why are we not putting more money into those programs if those programs are not working and we do not feel we should be putting more money into them but we should be going in this new route or in a different route why do we not take a look at eliminating those programs and getting true effectiveness into the system but no the proposal that we have in front of us is more bureaucracy in washington not critically evaluating the programs that we have in place well that is not going to work in this congress we do have in place a program which we call crossroads in education the crossroads in education project that is coming out of the committee on education and the workforce is going to do and is in the process of doing a critical analysis of these 760 programs we want to find out where the dollars go are they getting results or are they not getting results how can we make them more effective and what is working and what is wasted in education today so what does that mean it means that the first step is last year we asked the question how many programs are there nobody had ever asked that question before we did some work we did some research some other outside organizations some parts of the executive branch helped us they said 760 programs 39 agencies actually the 760 is a little old since that point in time they have identified about a hundred more programs that we have so it is somewhere in the neighborhood of 850 to 900 programs that we really have in washington but we are now going through and we are asking what is the process how is this money distributed what are the actual links back and forth between a bureaucracy and the state and a local school board how are people awarded and granted dollars what is the largest grant request you get or that you gave out what is the smallest we found a grant request for safe and drugfree schools the school district went through all of the work a very thick application and i will tell you they got their moneys worth they got a grant for 13 the government cannot even write a check for 13 but that is what the school district got maybe that went out and would have paid for lunch for the person who spent considerable time putting this grant request together 13 for a school district to develop their safe and drugfree school program think of the costs that went in we are doing that what is the largest and the smallest grant request you got what do these grant requests look like are they 2 pages are they 50 pages in some cases we found that they may be a thousand pages how much time and energy what happens to the grant requests when they come to washington how are they sorted through who reads them you then go back and you take a look at when the grants go out how much paperwork the statistics i believe that we had in our hearing in arizona 2 weeks ago was that of the 6 percentlet me find the exact quotethis was from lisa graham keegan who is arizonas superintendent of educationsaid i will say that the 8 percent arizona receives from the federal government easily accounts for more than 50 percent of the work in my department and school districts the paperwork they receive 8 percent of their moneyremember this 120 billion is only about 5 or 6 percent of what any school district gets but on a national average some get more some get less here in arizona it is about 8 percent of their total dollars come from washington and about 50 percent of their paperwork is that a good investment what do bureaucrats in washington really know about what needs to be done in arizona so what is the paperwork that goes back and forth we have had meetings and we asked superintendents to tell us about their paperwork and one of the things that they keep coming back with is we appreciate the money we get from washington in some cases it does some good and we can work in those areas but the real problem is when we take a look at our local school district and we take a look at the needs that we have if we had more flexibility to use that money in different ways we would spend it in different ways than what you are mandating that we spend it on so we know that this process is not an ideal process fifty billion dollars of more spending in washington is not the way to improve education spending 50 on education may be a worthwhile effort it is probably a good exercise spending it at the state and the local level where you have more control and direction about what you need in your community and actually getting the dollars into the classroom probably makes a lot more sense recognize that when we spend and say we are going to spend 50 billion in washington maybe only 25 to 30 billion will actually make it back into the classroom twenty billion is going to get lost somewhere else in the process a couple of other proposals that the president is talking about that i think need serious consideration talking about school construction as soon as we put in federal dollars any amount of federal dollars into a local school construction washington will come in and mandate what contractors need to be paid on an hourly basis for the work that they perform in your school district it is called davisbacon mandated from washington what you will pay we have an elaborate system in the department of labor that is not very good but that tries to track wages in thousands of different communities around this nation in a number of different construction categories and that is what you have to pay in other projects where you do not have davisbacon we go through this kind of complex way of determining how mucha project will cost it is called competitive bidding school districts cannot competitively bid they have to pay davisbacon wages so in effect when you go on a construction project with federal dollars or partially funded with federal dollars you lose again about 15 percent of your purchasing power by being required to pay the wages established here in washington versus what you may be able to get in a competitive bid i enjoy the discussion about the hope scholarships making education available to more students on a longer basis i think is a worthwhile goal saying that washington is now going to provide scholarships for those that maintain a b average the irs today cannot track our income tax system our income tax code just think of what wonderful work they are now going to have also tryingto match tax deductions with information from schools indicating that yes these people did maintain a b average and that b averages across the country are consistent so that the same b that you get in michigan is equivalent to a b that you get in arizona it is going to create a lot more work for bureaucrats and it is going to move a lot less money into the classroom the evidence is clear we need to focus on education but more compelling is the case that rather than increasing and building and expanding this city in washington the keys to improving education is moving dollars and power away from this city and moving it back to parents moving it back to local school boards and empowering teachers it is not only school boards it is teachers that want control of their classroom it is the parents that want their schools back they do not want to come to washington to take a look or to fight for what they want to do in their classroom they want control of their schools they know specifically what they need for their kids and their community the needs of this country are so diverse we need to be able to have the flexibility to tailor the programs for our kids from one city and one community to the next and we need to empower parents that is not a concept or a theory we know that it works take a look at the schools that are working take a look at the schools that are excelling and that is the bright spot in the picture in education yes there is some bad news there is some information that says we ought to be worried about this and that in some parts of the nation education may be in a state of crisis but the good news is that we can look at models of success and we can learn from those models of success we can learn what the characteristics are and we can then tailor federal policies and rules and regulations or whatever to empower that kind of change and reform to happen at the local level and what we learn is very simple parents basics and getting dollars into the classroom empowering parents instead of empowering bureauctats dollars to kids not to bureaucracy fundamental basic education not the latest education fads it is a key issue it is an important issue it is going to be a vigorous debate i think in the end kids and parents will win and politicians and bureaucrats in washington will lose that is the system that works that is the model that we will build on and that is the direction that we need to go"], [0.0005501502309925854, 0.0005501502309925854, 0, "earlier this summer this house made a commitment to eliminate the marriage tax penalty i thought this morning that i would talk about why it is so important that we follow through on that commitment and follow through on that commitment with a series of simple questions that i hear in the south suburbs and the south side of chicago the area that i have the privilege of representing that is do americans feel that it is fair that our tax code imposes a higher tax on married working couples do americans feel it is fair that 21 million married working couples pay on average 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married do americans feel that is fair that this couple pays higher taxes than an identical couple that lives together outside of marriage do americans feel it is fair that our tax code actually provides an incentive to get divorced because the only way today to avoid the marriage tax penalty is to get divorced and to file that paperwork that is wrong it is unfair frankly really it is immoral that our tax code punishes societys most basic institution for 21 million married working couples that is 1 400 in higher taxes let me give an example of a south suburban couple from illinois that suffers the marriage tax penalty the gentleman in the couple is a machinist at caterpillar that is where they make the big heavy earthmoving equipment in joliet this machinist makes 35 500 if he is single under our tax code he files and of course with the standard exemption and deduction he is in the 15 percent tax bracket he meets a schoolteacher a schoolteacher in the public schools she has an identical income of 35 500 if she stayed single just like her machinist fiance she would be in the 15 percent tax bracket under our tax code if they choose to get married they will file jointly when they file jointly because they combine their income and their combined income is 61 000 that pushes them into a higher tax bracket they are now taxed in the 28 percent tax bracket just because they are married producing an almost 1 400 marriage tax penalty just because they are married that is wrong that this couple just because they choose to get married pay higher taxes if we think about it what is the bottom line here we propose the marriage tax elimination act which puts a working married couple like our machinist and schoolteacher on parity with an identical married couple that lives outside marriage in 1996 this house of representatives led the way by working to provide an adoption tax credit to help families provide a loving home for a child in need of adoption in 1997 this house led the way in convincing the president and the senate that we should provide a 500 per child tax credit which will benefit 3 million illinois children that helped families of course this year we can help families again by strengthening marriage and no longer punishing marriage let me share how we propose eliminating the marriage tax penalty the marriage tax elimination act h r 3734 is very simple it is legislation which essentially doubles relief for working married couples by doubling the standard deduction from its current level of 4 150 to 8 300 and also doubling the income tax threshold which of course you file in the 15 percent if you are single and just over 24 000 doubling that to a little over 49 000 so when you are single and you choose to get married your tax essentially doubles your rates are double the income that brings fairness to the tax code that is a very simple way of eliminating the marriage tax penalty under the marriage tax elimination act doubling the standard deduction doubling rates so married taxpayers are not punished just because they are married that is a simple solution this house of course made a commitment about 2 months ago to address and eliminate the marriage tax penalty our friend the president he has a proposal of his own which he says is a better idea he says we should just expand the child care tax credit for families that are lowerincome and of course happen to have children so i thought i would compare for this machinist and this schoolteacher in joliet illinois which is really better under the presidents proposal under the presidents proposal for a child tax credit those couples or families that have qualified for the presidents expanded tax credit and they already have one he just wants to make it a little bigger they would see about a 350 net increase on takehome pay money to spend on child care i looked into this and asked some local day care providers in joliet what does that mean they said that the average weekly day care cost is about 127 in joliet so under the presidents proposal for a working married couple with a child who goes to day care they would see just less than 3 weeks of day care financed by the presidents proposal if we compare this with this machinist and schoolteacher eliminating the marriage tax penalty 1 400 with the same weekly day care costs for this machinist and schoolteacher if they have a child in day care it is almost 3 months worth of day care so which is better 3 months or 3 weeks mr speaker i ask members to make a bipartisan commitment to eliminate the marriage tax penalty this house of representatives made a commitment earlier this summer to address the marriage tax penalty and make elimination the centerpiece of this years budget let us follow through on that commitment let us help working families let us eliminate the marriage tax penalty for 21 million couples 1 400 that is real money for real people let us help married couples and eliminate the marriage tax penalty now i rise today to highlight what is arguably the most unfair provision in the unitedstates tax code the marriage tax penalty i want to thank you for your long term interest in bringing parity lo the tax burden imposed on working married couples compared to a couple living together outside of marriage in january president clinton gave his state of the union address outlining many of the things he wants to do with the budget surplus a surplus provided by the bipartisan budget agreement which cut waste put americas fiscal house in order and held washingtons feet to the fire to balance the budget while president clinton paraded a long list of new spending totaling at least 46 48 billion in new programswe believe that a top priority should be returning the budget surplus to americas families as additional middleclass tax relief this congress has given

has been going on here on the floor so far i think as we see the floods all across america and the ice storm certainly that hit up in maine i know the folks in our district are willing to lend a hand as well as in a lot of the other parts of the country but as we begin this debate about a supplemental spending bill that is spending outside the normal spending in washington i think it is very important that we do not just go and blow in the taxpayers money that we do not spend money without thinking where it is coming from i would encourage my colleagues who are involved in this conversation that they find other areas of government that are less important and in order to provide the funds the very needed funds there in maine and in some of these other places across the country i would like to encourage my colleagues to find other parts of the budget that are less important and lord knows there is plenty of wasteful spending in this budget find some of that wasteful spending knock out the wasteful spending and let us redirect those savings the dollars we do not spend into the programs that are necessary to help some ofthese people around the country but for goodness sakes let us not just go spend more money without knowing where it is coming from the only thing many folks like myself would ask is that we reprioritize our spending to take care of some of these areas that are in need of help in view of some of the floods that have occurred whether it be california or florida or the ice storm up in maine let us do what they need but certainly let us find other programs where we do not have to spend the money in order to make up for it as opposed to just going out and spending more of the taxpayers money i would like to turn our attention to what i think is the most important issue facing america today or at least one of the most important issues and that is social security i would like to dedicate a good portion of this hour to social security how it fits into the big budget and where we might be going to solve some of these problems facing our nation today as it relates to social security first off i think it is important that we understand the social security system and what is going on for anybody out there in america or my colleagues they are all paying taxes into the social security system i think it is important that we understand how many dollars are coming into the social security system each year what i brought is a chart that shows the total revenues in the social security system this year is 480 billion the total amount that we are sending back out to our seniors in benefits is 382 billion if you think about this like your checkbook and just for a second forget the billions on the end if you have 480 billion in your checkbook and you only spend 382 billion or 382 that works out pretty well in fact you still have money left in your checkbook the social security system today is working that is it is collecting more money than what it is actually paying back out to our senior citizens in benefits the idea in this system is that they collect this extra 98 billion they put it into a savings account they put that savings account money aside and it grows and grows and grows because eventually and it is not very far down the road the baby boom generation gets to retirement when the baby boom generation gets to retirement this top number the revenues becomes smaller than the bottom number the expenses when the expenses are greater than the revenues the idea was we were supposed to be able to go to this savings account get the money out and make good on our promises to pay social security to our senior citizens that is how the system is set up and that is how it is supposed to work every year since 1983 the situation has been much like this one where there is more money being collected out of the taxpayers paychecks than what is being paid out to our senior citizens in benefits as a matter of fact since 1983 we were supposed to accumulate this kitty or this savings account of about 700 billion that is how much is supposed to be in that trust fund right now today when i am out in wisconsin and i ask the question does anybody want to take a shot in the dark what washington has done with the 98 billion i always get a snicker in the audience it does not seem to be any big surprise when we talk about what is going on here in this city that 98 billion that is supposed to be going into a savings account to preserve and protect the social security system here is what is actually going on they take the 98 billion they put it into the governments general fund you can think of that like the big government checkbook that they pay all their bills out of it so they take the 98 billion they put it in the big government checkbook then they write checks out of the big government checkbook and there is no money left at the end of the year as a matter of fact until this year every year they overdrew even this checkbook that is what you have been hearing about is the deficit it is important to understand that when washington says they are going to balance the budget that that 98 billion that has been put in here from social security has been spent out of that checkbook so the facts are the government is taking the 98 billion putting it in the big government checkbook spending all the money out of the big government checkbook of course that means that at the end of the year there is no money left to go down here into the social security trust fund as a result what washington does is they simply write an iou to the social security trust fund when you hear washington talking about whether or not the budget is balanced that is this circle out here and it is using that social security money that is supposed to be down here in the trust fund in the private sector if anybody tried to do this with pension funds if anybody was running a pension where 98 billion or 9 800 was supposed to go into the pension fund but instead they put it into their regular checkbook they would be arrested this would be illegal in the private sector in washington d c this is a practice that absolutely must be stopped before we are too hard on the people out here let us understand that this idea of balancing the budget in this circle even though it uses the social security money even that has not been done since 1969 so what has happened in the last 3 years is a good step forward at least they have got that part balanced but it absolutely does not solve the problem as it relates to social security now some have been hearing the presidents state of the union and some of the things that have be en said since the state of the union where they are now saying that that they are going to take all of these surpluses and dedicate those surpluses to social security it is important to understand exactly what they are saying and what they mean first off the surplus is whatever happens to be left over in this checkbook at the end of the year we will put 98 billion of social security money in there and they call it a surplus if there is anything left over at the end of that 12month period of time what they are saying is that leftover is going to be used to preserve social security in and of itself that does not sound bad it sounds like a good step at least in the right direction albeit not what we ought to be doing the problem is they are not even doing that you see this social security debt this 700 billion of ious that are down here in the social security trust fund that is part of the much larger debt the 5 5 trillion debt that has been run up for our nation 5 5 trillion is about 5 500 billion seven hundred of that billion dollars belongs here but when you actually look at what is being proposed they are not actually saying they are going to pay off some of these ious and put real money down in the trust fund what they are actually saying is they are going to pay off some of that other outstanding debt in fact not even the surplus gets down here to the social security trust fund so the fallacy that somehow the surpluses are going to solve the social security trust fund problem is just baloney at this point in time it is just plain baloney i cannot think of any better way to describe it again what is going on today there is more money coming in than what is going back out to seniors in benefits 98 billion is being put in the big government checkbook all the money is being spent out of the big government checkbook and they are simply putting ious down here in the social security trust fund now lest anybody think that nobody in washington is paying any attention some of us are we introduced legislation in our office it is called the social security preservation act it is h r here is what it does it is very very simple it simply takes the 98 billion and directs it straight to the social security trust fund it prevents it from going into the general fund it prevents it then from being computed in the overall budget computations it simply takes the pension money and puts it in the pension fund when i am out in wisconsin and say how many people think this is a good idea i have not found a single audience anywhere where every single hand does not go up you see when we are working with the young people like for example my son who is 15 years old and mowed lawns last year he earned 2 000 mowing lawns he paid 300 roughly into the social security system out of his 2 000 of earnings now for a 15yearold to be paying 300 into social security that is pretty tough and a lot of people think we ought to be doing something about that but my point would be until we actually get some real dollars down here in the social security trust fund so that our present seniors are safe and secure and the people that are in their forties and fifties get to a point where they can actually count on the money being there in social security i do not think you can make the other changes in the system that many people out here in this city think are necessary and logical i think most americans would agree that it does not make a lot of sense for a 15yearold to be required to pay 300 into the social security trust fund but the problem with making that change today is it puts seniors in jeopardy because there is no money currently in the social security trust fund so where are we going with this social security issue and what do we really need to do to solve it the first thing we need to do is pass the social security preservation act the social security preservation act would take the surplus funds that are coming in this year and put those funds correctly into the social security trust fund i want to be a little bit technical for my colleagues as to exactly how this would happen today those ious are nonnegotiable nonmarketable treasury bonds and all we are suggesting is that instead of buying nonnegotiable nonmarketable treasury bonds we simply buy negotiable treasury bonds the same thing that any american citizen can walk into the bank and buy why would you do it that way as opposed to any other way well a treasury bond is a safe secure investment when the shortfall occurs when those numbers we looked at on the other chart turn around and there is not enough money coming in and too much money going out when that shortfall occurs we need to be able to sell the assets a negotiable treasury bond can be sold at any bank in america so the idea is you put a negotiable treasury bond into the social security trust fund now you have real assets in there so todays seniors are safe and secure then we can begin the discussion of the young people in this great nation having some other options if they so desire again i point to my 15yearold who went out and worked his tail off earned 2 000 and found out he owed 300 to the social security trust fund but first we need to make sure that we have real assets in that account so todays seniors are safe and secure the bill again that i have introduced is the social security preservation act it is h r 857 i would strongly urge my colleagues to join us in this it is something that people from all over the country have called and talked to us about and i am sure that is going to continue as we move forward we have got about 90 cosponsors on it right now and we would hope to see that number grow as this debate goes forward i have one other chart here that again illustrates the presidents discussion and what we are starting to hear out here i encourage my colleagues not to be misled by the smoke and mirrors that has been put out of this city for years out of this city for years we have been telling people there is a social security trust fund that is wrong day one when i got here i knew that was wrong and we started fighting to end this practice today the new smoke and mirrors game has put the 98 billion into the general fund spend all the money you want to out of the general fund and whatever is left over they say is going to social security but remember it is not coming into the trust fund it is really simply going to pay additional revenues i would just like to point out that even under this system any spending that goes out of this account effectively reduces the amount of money that is left over for social security the reason i point that out is because when we look at the prgposal that is coming forward and i am now talking about the presidents budget but let us make no mistake this is not like it is a partisan thing that obviously one side proposes new spending any new washington spending program effectively reduces the availability offunds for social security i have a list here of new spending that is being proposed currently in washington d c these all happen to be in the presidents plan but i guarantee you will see people from both sides of the aisle supporting this new spending their new child care program 12 2 billion new schools 6 billion new teachers 5 1 billion i know a lot of folks out there are going hey mark those things look like good things new schools more teachers child care for working families i mean gosh those are all good things do we not want to do those things in this country we need to understand what is being proposed what is really being proposed and let us just take the new schools that is a classic example what is really being proposed is that washington the united states government reaches into the taxpayers pockets they bring the money out here to washington and then the people here in washington decide where it is that we should build new schools in america would it not be better if instead of washington getting that money out here spending 40 cents on the dollar in the bureaucracy and then washington making the decision of which school district is going to get help would it not make a lot more sense to leave the money out there in the hands of the people in the first place so they get a dollars worth of new schools for the dollar that they are paying in taxes if a community needs a new school then the parents and the teachers and the school board and the folks in the area ought to get together and build a new school i know in the district that i am from that a lot of our school districts have done exactly that in our home district janesville i know they just built a new middle school burlington built a new school the folks in our district care about education and so do i what i do not want to see happen is washington the government reaching into the pockets of people bringing the money out here to washington and spending 40 cents on the dollar inthe bureaucracy and then washington making the decision as to who is going to get help and who is not going to get help that is not the way it ought to work it ought to be that the people make those decisions for themselves and the people in their local communities make a decision as to how many teachers they wanted or how many new schools they want let us just look at child care let us look at another way to deal with the child care issue would it not be much better if instead of washington taxing people and getting the money to washington that instead of that getting that money out here and spending 40 cents on the dollar in the bureaucracy would it not be a whole lot better if washington just said we are going to tax all of our families less the government says we are going to tax our families less leaving more money in their homes in fact that is exactly what happened last year last year in the tax cut package the decision was made that rather than develop some new program called washingtonrun child care that we would instead leave 400 per child under the age of 17 out there in the homes and in the families so instead of washington collecting the money spending it on a bureaucracy and deciding where it should go back to washington simply said to the working families for every child under the age of 17 keep 400 out there and you decide whether that 400 is best spent for new shoes or whether it is best spent for child care instead of washington making the decision after losing lots of the money in the bureaucracy the people are making the decision the families are making the decision is that not a much better way i guess it all depends on who you believe is best prepared to spend the peoples money the people here in this city or the people out there in america with that i am going to switch i want to stay focused just a little bit on what washington means by a balanced budget because that is absolutely essential in terms of understanding the problems that we have here in this city as it relates especially to social security washingtons definition of a balanced budget is that the total dollars being collected from the taxpayers is equal to the total dollars that washington spends remember some of those dollars we are collecting from the taxpayers are for things like building roads so when you fill your gasoline tank up and you pay a federal tax on that gas tank part of that money is dollars coming into washington those dollars arent even being spent to build roads part of that money is social security money so when they add up all the dollars coming in and they look at all the dollars going out if those two numbers are equal that is called a balanced budget in washington now as this relates specifically to social security remember that part of those dollars in is 98 billion extra coming in for social security so we need to be very concerned that we do not get confused of what we mean by a balanced budget or a surplus i again am going to show the presidents numbers since the other budgets have not been produced this year but the other budgets are basically the same the presidents budget says in the next fiscal year that we are going to have revenue of 1 743 billion and we are going to have expenses of 1 733 billion that of course leaves a 10 billion surplus but i want to show you the fallacy in talking to the american people this way the fallacy is that if you take social security out of the picture the revenues are now 1 241 billion and remember the difference in these two pictures is that we have set social security aside when we take social security out the revenues are 1241 billion the expenses are 1337 billion and instead of talking about a surplus we actually have a shortfall of about 96 billion the facts are that today when we talk about dollars in equal dollars out that is the washington definition of a balanced budget and before we are too hard on them remember they have not even balanced the budget that way since 1969 but let us also remember that we have a long ways to go before we start accepting this concept of new washington spending programs let us remember that whenever there is a new washington spending program initiated that it is simply going to make that bottom line worse we have a long ways to go in this great country of ours i have brought with me a few more pictures here i always believe a picture is worth a thousand words whenever i am out in wisconsin they would much rather have a picture than a thousand words most people do not want to listen to a politician give them a thousand words these pictures help us understand some of the seriousness and severity facing our country when i talk about this next chart i get very serious about it because this is a serious problem facing america what i have on this next chart is how the debt facing our nation has grown from 1960 through 2000 including the projections through 2000 one can see looking at this from 1960 to 1980 that the debt facing our country did not grow very fast but from 1980 forward it has grown off the wall if we hope to have a future in this great nation that we live in if we even hope to have a future in this country we have got to stop this growing debt we are here on this chart right now today it is a very serious problem facing our country now i said 1980 i know all the democrats out there are going sure that was the year ronald reagan the republican took office and it is the republicans fault i know all the republicans out there are going those democrats spent like crazy in the 1980s and because they spent so much money it is the democrats fault that we have this picture to look at i would like to point out that it does not matter whose fault it is at this point and whether you are democrat or republican i think it is our responsibility as americans to solve these kinds of problems facing this country if we hope to preserve this nation for future generations looking at this picture knowing that we are way up here on this chart should encourage us to do the right thing as we look at the budgetary matters going forward i also wanted people to see the actual number that is involved because it is a pretty staggering number the united states government is now 5 5 trillion in debt that is they have spent 5 5 trillion more than what they were willing to collect from the american taxpayers in taxes basically over the last 15 years let me translate that number since that number is so big into something that makes a little more sense if we take that 5 5 trillion and divide by the people in the united states we would find that every single american man woman and child is now responsible for 20 400 of debt for a family of 5 like mine i have 3 kids and a wife at home for a family of 5 like mine the united states government has borrowed 102 000 again basically this has all occurred over the last 15 years it is a staggering staggering sum of money the kicker in this whole picture is that we are paying real interest on this money the real interest that we are paying amounts to 580 a month for every group of 5 people it is being paid it is being paid by collecting taxes from the american people every month every group of 5 people in america pays 580 to do nothing but pay interest on the federal debt it is an absolutely staggering number when we think about it a lot of people do not think they pay that much in taxes but the fact is every time you walk in the store and do something as simple as buy a pair of shoes every time you do something as buy a pair of shoes for your kids the store owner makes a profit on that pair of shoes and part of that money actually gets sent to washington d c in taxes one dollar out of every 6 that washington spends does absolutely nothing but pay the interest on this debt it is interesting to look at and to think about how it is that we got to this particular situation when we look back on the past most americans remember the grammrudmanhollings act of 1985 and the grammrudmanhollings revision of 1987 and folks remember the budget deal of 1990 they remember hearing all these different promises how washington was finally going to balance the federal budget every time they heard the promise their hopes got up then they found out washington the government did not balance the budget they got another promise and their hopes went up again they got another promise their hopes went up again they kept getting this demoralizing news that in fact washington our government had not done what it promised to do i have a picture here of one of them this is the grammrudmanhollings act of 1987 but they were all the same the 1985 one the 1990 deal they were all the same this shows where the deficit was going to go to zero in this particular bill the promise was by 1993 the red line shows what actually happened to the deficit these promises were broken and broken and broken and the american people got very cynical myself included one of the reasons i ran for office in 1994 is because of this picture but this is not all of the picture the folks looked at this picture and they saw that gap out there that deficit of 200 billion and the people in washington said we have got to solve this problem this problem is serious the only way they knew how to solve the problem was reach in the pockets of the american people and raise taxes that is what they did in 1993 some people remember social security taxes went up the money was not even put in social security gasoline taxes went up by 4 3 cents a gallon the money was not even spent on building roads the bottom line is they reached into the pockets of the american people and they brought more money out here to washington with the idea that if they just got more money out here in washington they could maintain the washington spending programs and still balance the budget what happened in 1993 the american people got very very upset in this country they said we did not want you to raise our taxes to balance the budget what we wanted you to do is get spending under control in washington d c so in 1995 they elected a new group of people in fact at that point for the first time in a long time we have republicans controlling the house of representatives republicans controlling the senate and a democrat president that is the situation we had in 1995 the first time in 40 years that we had that situation the problem was this stuff in the past with all these broken promises that made the people so upset the problem was convincing the folks in washington d c that the rigt thing to do was control washington spending as opposed to reaching into the taxpayers pocket and taking out more money so we laid out a plan the plan was to control washington spending and get us to a balanced budget we laid out a blue line like they had done before saying we are going to get to a balanced budget in 2002 we made our promise what did the american people do when they made that promise they yawned they said it cant happen weve been promised before why should we believe this group is any different we are now in our third year of that plan completed the third and into the fourth year the facts are that we have not only hit our targets and projections but we are far ahead of schedule for the last 12 months running the united states government for the first time since 1969 did not spend as much as money as it had in its checkbook think about this the first time since 1969 it is in the books for the last 12 months running our government did not spend more money than it had in its checkbook what an amazing accomplishment 3 short years in and i would point out 4 years ahead of what was promised to the american people there is a significant change in washington d c i know there are problems with social security that we talked about earlier there are bad problems and they need to be solved but to not recognize the difference in these two pictures using the same definitions using the same social security money to not recognize how much this city has changed in 3 short years would be a mistake this is a monumental accomplishment to be at a point where we have actually reached a balanced budget and are running a small surplus albeit under a definition that i do not like very well the point is it is still the first time since 1969 that this has been accomplished i know that out there in america every time i say this i have all kinds of people say to me in our town hall meetings you politicians are taking credit for our hard work in fact the economy is doing so good and it is doing good because we are out here busting our tails as we bust our tails we make more money which is good that is the american way that is good we make more money then we pay more taxes and with washington having all that extra revenue how could you have possibly messed it up partly that is true in fact people are working very hard out there they are being more successful i am happy to say there are stories all across this country where people have lived the american dream and they are being successful when they are successful they do pay more taxes and revenues are up in washington d c so a lot of the credit for this is because people have done the right thing worked very hard and in fact are paying more taxes more revenue to washington d c which is why we can also reduce taxes i might add but there is another side to this picture that i think is important between 1969 and today there have been strong economies before every time there was a strong economy and extra revenues came into washington washington very simply spent the money they did not balance the budget they have had this opportunity before we have had strong economies between 1969 and today and every single time we had a strong economy washington simply raised the spending to match up with the extra revenues that is where this congress should deserve some of the credit for changing that this red column shows how fast washington or government spending was growing before we got here in 1995 this blue column shows how fast washington spending is growing today in fact the growth rate of washington spending has been slowed from a 5 2 percent to a 3 2 percent let me even go one step further when we look at the growth rate of washington spending last year for the first time in eons with one exception washington spending grew at a slower rate than the rate of inflation translation washington actually got smaller in real dollars last year the growth rate of washington or government spending was lower than the growth rate of inflation that is not the picture we had before we got here what we really have going on right now today is we have two things happening simultaneously we have a very very strong economy which generates additional revenues to washington d c that is the american people and they deserve the credit for it coupled with a washington a government that has understood that what the american people want us to do is control washington spending w6 are bringing washington spending under control in the face of this extra revenue i want to challenge each one of my colleagues today to do something i would like them to look back in our 1995 budget plan and i would like them to look at the projection as to how much money we were going to spend in fiscal year 1997 i always do this in a fun way out at my town hall meetings i ask the folks which one do you think is most likely to happen do you think it is more likely for a martian spaceship to land in your backyard they come in have coffee and head back to mars or washington got 100 billion of unexpected revenue and did not spend a nickel of it what happens is a lot of our folks go to the coffee pots to welcome the martians because they do not think it is possible but if my colleagues would take the time to look back at our budget plan that we laid out in 1995 we laid out our projected spending for fiscal year 1997 we actually underspent that number by over 20 billion at the same time the revenues that we expected were up by 104 billion so washington got more than 100 billion of expected revenue and reduced spending from the plan by 20 billion it is a minor miracle what has happened in this city where does that really leave us it seems to me that leaves us with 3 very significant problems facing our nation today after we get the budget balanced taxes are still too high i find very very few people out in wisconsin and i see my colleague from south dakota has joined me i do not know what he finds in south dakota does the gentleman find there are a lot of people that think taxes are not too high out in

this past week we got a more detailed description about some of his ideas for new washington spending i harken back to 1994 and what happened at that point in time and after the big government agenda was annihilated at the polls in 1994 in the state of the union address in 1995 the president came forward and said the era of big government is over i think a lot of people in this country took consolation in that statement that was just a few short years ago well now a couple of years later we are talking about a potential surplus which is something that is remarkablethe first in our countrys history in some 30 years yet i am reminded of the fact i think about whenever we start talking about a surplus in this particular environment in washington d c it is like a liberal politicians dream but a taxpayers nightmare i think as we look at the statement in 1995 about the era of big government being over and then look at where we are today in terms of potential surplus and what that means for the future of this country and what that means for our countrys budget i think we have to make some important decisions we are truly at an historic crossroads in terms of the future of this country now when the president laid out his budget i think there were some 150 billion in new washington spending included in that budget and with respect to his goals i think most of us probably were in agreement on the importance of priorities like caring for and educating our children as well as providing health care for an aging population these are important issues and on that i think all of us agree however the differences are very clear in trying to determine how best to achieve those goals and particularly in the context of a potential revenue surplus the presidents programs are an incredibly expansive reach by the federal government into the lives of most americans it is remarkably inconsistent on the one hand to talk about using a potential surplus to pay down the debt and to pay back social security and on the other hand to talk about increasing the size and reach of the federal government by some 150 billion in new washington spending and bigger government many people myself included have been very confused by the mixed signals that the president is sending now i happen to believe that there is a responsible public policy approach to dealing with a potential surplus for that reason i am cosponsoring legislation offered by the gentleman from wisconsin which is consistent with a number of important policy objectives simply put the neumann legislation would apportion any potential surplus in three ways first it would allocate twothirds of any surpluses to paying off debt and restoring the govern mental trust funds social security transportation environmental the final third would go toward reducing taxes on hardworking americans it goes a step beyond that in a very important way by putting a systematic plan in place to retire our countrys 5 5 trillion debt in the course of the next 30 years spending 1 percent less than what we take in in revenue every year and applying that 1 percent to paying down the debt again assuming modest or moderate economic growth rates we can be completely debt free by the year 2026 in addition to winning the war on drugs i cannot think of anything else that would be more important for the future of our children and our grandchildren it would also free up the 250 billion annually that the congress appropriates every year just to pay the interest on our 5 5 trillion debt that is an important point we go through the budgetary process every year before we spend anything on roads and bridges or highways before we spend anything on any other social programs we have to appropriate the 250 billion in round numbers that is necessary and essential to pay for the interest on the 5 5 trillion debt just as important the neumann legislation would allow us actually to give something back to the taxpayers after all it is their money i happen for one to believe that if the president is able to build 150 billion into his budget for new washington spending in the alternative he ought to be able to come up with that amount of money to give back to the taxpayers i believe that the best way that we can help working families deal with tough issues like child care is to give them some money back and to allow them to make the best decision about how to address this very important need the presidents proposal tends toward installing uncle sam as your nanny his plan would have washington determine which children and which child care providers get washingtons assistance the bottom line question i think we have to ask ourselves as members of this country is who would we rather have raising our kids would we rather have the federal government do it or would we rather have the american family for me that is a nobrainer but if we give people inside the washington beltway long enough they will try to create a riskfree society big government will eventually guarantee you child care education health care guarantee a job probably guarantee a fixed income guarantee a retirement possibly a big screen television and the list goes on and on but the cost will be high because in doing all that there will be a corresponding decrease in the freedom that we enjoy in this country and more and more taxes to pay for all that security ultimately we end up with a bureaucrat in the crib a bureaucrat at day care a bureaucrat in the classroom a bureaucrat in the workplace and a bureaucrat in your living room we may in fact even have a bureaucrat in the coffin with us just to make sure that we do not in fact take anything with us the question i think we have to ask is where does it all end there is a better way and that is to say to the people of this country that we trust their judgment we believe that they are capable of caring for their children and making good decisions about their future we believe that as a matter of principle america is infinitely better off when families are making decisions rather than bureaucrats in the same way we believe that america is infinitely better off when parents are teaching values rather than bureaucrats i know thatkmay shock the yuppy intellectuals who operate government institutions but that is all part of the debate that we are having in this country today if there is anything in president clintons budget or in his state of the union speech that troubles me more than anything else it is this obsession with targeting from spending federal dollars to providing tax relief the president desperately wants to create winners and losers everything is targeted now since when have we become so differentiated as a culture so as to require this sort of governmental micromanagement i think at times we have all been guilty of it but if we are truly striving as he said toward a more perfect union we ought to look for ways in which we allow all americans irrespective of whether they are married or single with or without children young or old whatever their national heritage is to participate in the benefits of greater freedom that comes with lower taxes we should not discriminate among taxpayers based upon marital status we should on the other hand strive to make all taxpayers equal in the law furthermore we ought to consistently look at ways to make the tax code simpler and less complicated for the american people almost every tax relief proposal that i have heard of to date further complicates the tax code this is the absolute wrong direction in which to head if our underlying objective is making government less intrusive and more userfriendly it is for these reasons that i am proud today along with my friend the gentlewoman from washington to be introducing two pieces of tax relief legislation that i believe will serve as alternatives to the new washington spending in the presidents budget and at the same time these bills are consistent with the dual goals of one distributing tax relief broadly and evenly and secondly of simplifying an already inordinately complicated tax code members of congress both democrats and republicans if they are sincere about helping to lower the tax burden on working families should be 100 percent behind these bills there is no targeting there is no gimmickry there are no loopholes just plain and simple common sense the first bill the middle class tax relief act of 1998 addresses the issue of bracket creep by allowing working families to make more money before they fall into the higher tax bracket it lowers taxes by raising the income threshold at which the 28 percent tax bracket would apply very simply put more and more of the income of working americans would be subject to the 15 percent tax bracket rather than the much higher 28 percent tax bracket this legislation will help americans who are doing better and therefore making more and as a consequence have graduated from the 15 percent tax bracket to the higher 28 percent tax bracket due to bracket creep 28 cents of each additional dollar they earn now goes to the federal government talk about a disincentive to improving your lot in life under our legislation many of these hardworking people will have an incentive to continue to be hardworking people because they will have been liberated from the higher tax rate on each additional dollar that they earn now the real beauty in this legislation is it gives no preference based upon status marital or otherwise presently the higher 28 percent tax rate begins to apply to a single person making 25 350 our legislation would raise that threshold to 35 000 for heads of household the 28 percent rate starts at 33 950 we would raise that to 52 600 for married couples the 28 percent rate starts at 42 350 we would raise that in our proposal to 70 000 according to the tax foundation over 29 million filers ipi this country would see their taxes lowered under this proposal with the average savings of nearly 1 200 per filer in fact over 10 million filers would actually move out of the 28 percent bracket the higher tax bracket into the lower 15 percent bracket once again let me say and repeat that this is an infinitely better approach to assisting families with their child care needs than is the discriminatory washington knows best approach embodied in the presidents plan a 1 200 tax cut could pay for 16 weeks of child care 4 car payments and up to 3 months of housing bills or 14 weeks of grocery bills that is real help for working families our other bill the taxpayer choice act of 1998 would raise the personal exemption from the current 2 700 to 3 400 again this simple change will help hardworking americans by allowing them to reduce their taxable income by an additional 700 per dependent thereby lowering their overall tax burden this legislation will deliver broadbased tax relief to taxpayers in the lower and middleincome ranges in fact under this legislation 95 percent of the people particularly those in the lower income categories would benefit it really delivers relief to low and middleincome taxpayers and that is something i think we desperately need that is helping people who are your w2 wage earners the people that oftentimes get left out of many ofthe discussions furthermore the change is straightforward and easy to calculate for someone in the 15 percent tax bracket the bill would result in a savings of 100 or for a family of four when you multiply that 400 or the possible equivalent of 5 weeks of child care a car payment housing payment or 5 weeks of grocery bills again i would restate that this is real relief for someone in the 28 percent tax bracket that would amount to 200 in tax savings per individual or 800 per family of four that again is the possible equivalent of 10 weeks of child care almost 10 weeks of grocery bills three car payments or a couple of housing payments and as is true today the deduction would phase out for wage earners whose incomes exceed 124 500 let me again reiterate one point that is that we agree with the president that working families in america need relief however the president to coincide with hisneed for a relevant agenda has mistakenly interpreted that need as a request for more washington spending we on the other hand know that what working families are really asking for is not more federal government but relief from more federal government we have heard american families we agree with you that your family should not have to sacrifice one more dime of your hardearned money to build new government bureaucracies that will further undermine your ability to care for yourself and your family we will stand with american families and the bills that we have introduced today make it abundantly clear that no surplus government revenue should go to more washington spending rather they should go into your pocketthrough tax relief and restoring the trust funds that is commonsense government the legislation we have introduced today also should fit in nicely with what i believe ought to be a reality before the turn of the century and that is a brand new tax code that is simple and fair americans waste too much time and money filling out tax returns it is a dream for lobbyists for lawyers and for tax preparers it is a nightmare for the american taxpayer ultimately the only way we will get real reform is to kill the beast and start all over every time congress starts chipping around the edges like we did last summer we make the code even more complicated than it is today some 480 different forms 6 000 pages and 34 pounds it is time to say enough already it will not be easy because there is a lot of internal resistance in this city to changing the status quo but it has to be done i had some accountants from south dakota in my office just this last week they agreed they are probably in the best position to benefit from the complexity of the code as it exists today they agree that the current code is an abomination the two bills that we have introduced today are consistent with a simpler fairer approach to the tax code i hope they will serve as the beginning of a discussion about replacing the code with a view of taxation that finds its foundation and its basis in the policies of former presidents john kennedy and ronald reagan and that is a policy and a view that invites all americans to participate in the benefits of a growing economy that will spur investment and create jobs by limiting taxes and by minimizing the burden of tax compliance these are our goals i look forward to working with this congress to making them become a reality to that end i would ask the

has hit this congress since i have been up here today we have an obligation to our constituents to let them know that we are listening to what they say and that we are willing to take some responsibility by endorsing a very concrete step toward slowing the rate of growth in spending and moving closer always toward the goal of what we have all been seeking what the president says he wants what the house and senate say they want and that is a balanced budget today we are asked to vote for or against the tax limitation amendment house joint resolution 62 this proposal would amend the constitution so as to require a twothirds supermajority vote in both chambers of congress as a prerequisite for passage of any legislation which would raise taxes by more than a de minimis amount this resolution covers income taxes estate and gift taxes payroll taxes and excise taxes it does not cover tariffs user fees voluntary premiums and other items which are not part of the internal revenue laws currently just such a rule is in place in the house to make certain that we all go on record when a tax increase is proposed however this rule does not apply to the unitedstates senate it only applies this term to the house we are just asking to bring some discipline into the process we are asking to make it a little bit harder to tax the american people this is a day to make it a little bit harder to tax the american people the day when they are parting with their money 40 percent upper or lower depending on their bracket or their area of all the money they have made all of last year the many good people in my district the 4th congressional district have been unified and very clear in communicating to me their desire to see congress balance the budget the tax limitation amendment would simply challenge congress to balance the budget without gouging hardworing individuals with regular tax increases contrary to some arguments made by prospending opponents of this resolution the tax limitation amendment does not hamper efforts to close socalled loopholes because tax increases below a small amount are not subject to the twothirds requirement those of us who are working toward fundamental tax reform will not be impeded either because so long as the end result does not increase the tax burden tax reform bills will not be subjected to the supermajority requirement the tax limitation amendment makes good sense it restores discipline on a system which has spun out of control our constituents are overburdened now by a system which has for years left the doors wide open for tax increases to be slipped in as riders to all kinds of legislation we have to reverse our course and restore a sound business approach to the government by passing the tax limitation amendment thereby committing ourselves to going on record so that our constituents can see us vote either yes or no when their pocketbooks are at stake i am proud to be the lead democrat on this bill along with the gentleman from mississippi gene taylor and i urge all my colleagues to deliver some relief to the overtaxed and disenfranchised constituents today by voting the passage of the tax limitation amendment we have people from all walks of life who support this we have the american conservative union the americans for tax reform we talk about senior citizens the senior coalition united seniors association unitedstates chamber of commerce the national tax limitation committee and i could go on and on people want us to bring some discipline to this house and discipline to the

patients can choose their own doctor gain access to emergency care communicate openly with health care providers and independently appeal decisions made by managed care companies this bill also contains a number of proconsumer provisions that the other proposals do not this legislation increases patient access to affordable care by expanding health care coverage options for workers and their

up and talk about the patient protection act which passed the house this year we made enormous progress in the direction of ensuring that people get the care that they need and that their physician has prescribed when they need it and that we could do that without big government it was a great bill it passed the house unfortunately it got caught up in politics and some partisanship both in the other body and on the other end of pennsylvania avenue and that is unfortunate we have all heard some specimens of that this afternoon but that should not keep us from talking about this bill and what it would do for people because as i said before we have made an enormous amount of progress we need to make progress in this area when i go around my district and talk with people about health care they are concerned it is less about the reach of the coverage that they are promised in their insurance there is some concern about that the concern is that if they get sick they will not get the care they have been promised they will not get the care that their physician has prescribed they have some reason for that concern we have all heard about these horror stories around the country they are not just horror stories they are horrible stories people losing their children because an hmo turned down the care that their physician had recommended pregnant women not being allowed to go into the hospital when they have highrisk pregnancies seniors being denied chemotherapy on the grounds that it was supposedly experimental these are horrible stories we should not have that we do not have to have that we can have a system that refocuses the health care system and the power in the system on the patient and on their physician that is what the patient protection act does the gentleman from illinois has talked about some of the good things in it i am going to be yielding to people in a few minutes to go into greater depth on that let me just say the bill does two things that are very important and it is the only bill that was before the house this year that did these two things the first thing it expanded the coverage that was available good private sector coverage available to people around the united states at any given time about 42 million people do not have health insurance coverage working people but they work for employers typically small employers who typically cannot afford to provide the coverage to them our bill had a feature in it that no other bill had that we have needed to do for decades here that makes perfect common sense and would make good solid private sector health care available to millions of those people who currently do not have it the gentleman from illinois is going to discuss it later but briefly it is the concept of association health plans all that means is that these small businesses who cannot afford them they may only have 5 6 or 10 employees and cannot afford to go through all the administrative costs and the hassle of offering health insurance can pool together as associations then the association is a sponsor of a health plan and the small business can send its employees to that health plan can put up some money for the employees they put up some money on their own and they are able to buy health insurance from a plan that can offer them all the choices that currently employees of big companies have why should an employee just because he or she happens to work for a restaurant have no health insurance offered to him or her or have fewer choices offered to him or her than somebody would if they worked for ibm or they worked for emerson electric or they worked for boeing or any other of the big employers in the country this provision in the bill when we pass it out of here and i think we will get it early next ~ because it is an idea whose time has come will make health care available to millions who currently do not have it it is the only bill that does that i will say we were enlightened on that issue when at a press conference a reporter asked a very important member of the other body what the administration bill does for the uninsured he thought about it and said with his typical candor not much that is true it did not do anything for the uninsured this bill would make health care available to millions of people who currently do not have it it is part of the whole idea behind this bill to provide health care to people when they need it when their physician prescribes it without big government but the feature i am up here to talk about and i am going to be yielding to other

provisions and my own bill start from a fundamental and wellestablished premise that the nations airwaves belong to the american people the measure would require broadcast stations as a condition of licensing to provide free television time in modest amounts for political candidates the reasoning behind the free television time is simple in the past election season spending levels for federal elections shattered all previous records and broadcast advertising is the single most expensive factor in federal elections house candidates spend more than a quarter of their total campaign funds on broadcast advertising the figure last year was closer to twothirds in 1972 political candidates spent 25 million on television commercials in 1996 they spent 400 million an astonishing increase these dramatic increases in the price of advertising time are the major cause of the spiraling cost of running for office inour country and the ensuing money chase given the vast sums of money required to run for office wealthy individuals have a significant advantage over the ordinary citizen candidate that is hardly representative government the cost of running for political office in america has simply become too high the time for this legislation has come last year broadcasters received a windfall in the form of a whole new spectrum of digital tv channels in light of this gift and the huge

trade representative last week the other body approved her nomination and the waiver legislation before us today by overwhelming votes of 991 and 982 respectively during her nearly 4 years of service at the office of the ustr first as deputy ustr and since april of last year acting ustr ambassador barshefsky has compiled an impressive record opening foreign markets for unitedstates exporters and defending unitedstates trade interests for example she recently concluded successful multilateral agreements which will reduce or eliminate tariffs worldwide on trade in information technology products and which will open foreign markets for basic telecommunications services last december she concluded a bilateral agreement with japan on insurance which opens that market for unitedstates insurance providers last year she also struck an agreement with china providing for stronger enforcement of unitedstates intellectual property rights in that country clearly ambassador barshefsky has shown that she is a tough and skillful negotiator internationally more importantly however ambassador barshefsky understands that international trade and our nations trade policies have an impact on the lives and futures of americans for that reason she consults closely with members of congress and the public at large on her actions she clearly recognizes that trade policy is a shared responsibility of the executive and legislative branches and carries out her responsibilities accordingly for those who may have questions or concems about this waiver it must be noted that congress has previously passed legislation to waive a statutory requirement on who may serve in a particular government position with respect to a specific nominee it should also be noted that as deputy ustr ambassador barshefsky was specifically exempt from the provisions in question in the lobbying disclosure act the senate finance committee carefully studies her record in the private sector and agreed unanimously that a waiver was entirely appropriate for ambassador barshefsky in the past several years i have come to know and admire ambassador barshefskys work and tireless dedication on behalf of
