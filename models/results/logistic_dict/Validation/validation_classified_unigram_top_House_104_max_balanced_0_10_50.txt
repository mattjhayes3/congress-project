tax break for the wealthy despite the fact that the medicare cuts are 3 times greater than what the trustees recommended in order to make medicare solvent the medicare premiums for seniors are doubled

9 billion more than the housepassed bill and upon the date of enactment of this legislation medicaid is repealed and 36 million americans will lose guaranteed health insurance and longterm care the

the american people examined the republican proposals to cut medicare to pay for tax breaks for the privileged few for wealthy americans and the american people said these are not our values these are not our priorities this is not what we want to see we dont want to see the funding for education for environment for medicare andmedicaid slashed and because the american people really spoke out they rose up against this budget last year congress in the end passed a budget that protects our nations priorities yesterday when the congressional majority when their leadership unveiled their new budget it was as yogi berra once said deja vu all over again we see the same skewed priorities the same skewed values and a willingness to do harm to working middleclass families in this country one of the most disturbing parts of this budget is the way that it undercuts medical protection for our nations seniors republicans propose cutting 168 billion from medicare once again they propose and their proposals and these medicare cuts will result in less choice for seniors in choosing their doctors thepotential for closing down hospitals in this country and for creat ing a second rate health care system for seniors in the united states of america the 168 billion they want to cut from medicare is not do not let them fool you is not necessary to make the medicare system solvent they may say that but again do not let them fool you and do not buy it the way you did not buy it in the last goround the money that is being cut is not going to be put back into the medicare trust fund once again it is going to pay for tax breaks the president proposed extending the solvency of medicare for the same amount of time without making the same deep cuts in the medicare system they are using the money from these medicare cuts to fund 176 billion in unnecessary tax breaks if you want to know the real agenda of the republican leadership on medicare all you need to do is to recall the words of house speaker newt gingrich on medicare not too many months ago not years ago but not too many months ago the speaker said now we dont get rid of it in round one because we dont think that is the politically smart thing to do and we do not think that is the right way to go through a transition but we believe it is going to wither on the vine because we think people are voluntarily going to leave it the majority leader of the other body said that he was proud to have voted in 1965 against medicare because it is a system that does not work these people truly believe that medicare is a wrong system a bad system and that it needs to be destroyed do not let them kid you in the direction they want to take the medicare system that is what the republicans really want to do to medicare they want it to wither on the vine the republican assault on health care for seniors does not stop with medicare in their budget they also propose cutting medicaid by 72 billion that cut combined with the block grant approach will jeopardize the guarantee of coverage for folks who are in nursing homes most people do not understand what medicaid is about it is seniors who are in nursing homes that medicaid covers in addition to cuts in medicare and medicaid they propose including risky medical savings accounts in the medicare system a system that would allow wealthy seniors to operate out of the medicare system thereby weakening the program allowing those who are most ill most frail to stay in traditional insurance programs driving those premiums up and not allowing people to be able to get health care to sum up what this new republican budget amounts to is yet another assault on the health care system for our nations seniors unless they withdraw this budget and rework their

that american workers are property rewarded for their efforts to achieve the american dream while a bipartisan majority in the congress stands ready to give minimum wage earners a raise the house republican leadership instead wishes to deprive potentially millions of american workers of any minimum wage increase in what should have been a simple widelysupported victory for millions of hard working americans the republican majority has demonstrated not only its aversion to any increase in pay for american workers but also its intention to eliminate entirely the protections of the minimum wage for millions of lowincome earners in fact quoting speaker gingrichs righthand man majority leader dick armey the republican majority will not only fight any minimum wage increase with every fiber of his being a majority of the republicans would like to do away with the minimum wage altogether this is yet another example of the extremist agenda of the republican leadership while the average american worker labors day in and day out just to support his or her family the new congressional leadership has worked just as hard to prevent these americans from earning a fair liveable wage should speaker gingrich and his foot soldiers be successful in their efforts to prevent a pay raise for american workers the real purchasing power of the minimum wage will soon be at the lowest it has been in over 40 years far too many hardworking americans are not adequately rewarded for their efforts in recant years many middleand lowincome american families have faced an incredb e economic squeeze since 1979 the wealthiest 20 percent of this country has seen its incomes grow my roughly 767 billion during the same period middleincome families have seen their wages stagnate and in certain cases decrease but the last 10 years of wage stagnation has had a particularly hard impact on the lives of the lowincome working families since 1979 the value of the current minimum wage for lowerincome workingclass fami ies has dropped by almost 29 percent and in fact has declined over 50 cents alone in constant value since its last bipartisan increase only 5 years ago today the majority of working american families are struggling to provide their families with a decent standard of living this livingwage increase of over 1 800 in additional earnings per year is an essential first step in assisting many of the most vulnerable american families obtain the ability to provide their families with proper homes a good education and a chance to improve their economic situation i am very disappointed that the majority leadership chose to exact a price for the consideration of the most important and widely accepted issue for millions of american workers by attaching amendments which would not only deny many americans the benefit of a pay raise but also completely eliminate the protections of the minimum wage for millions of small business workers the firstof the republican majoritys proposed amendments would repeal the protections of the minimum wage for small businesses this amendment to the minimum wage increase would be a dramatic leap backward from current law effectively exempting virtually all new employees of twothirds of all firms from major worker protection provisions of the fair labor standards act including minimum wage and overtime pay millions of workers who are employed by businesses with gross annual sales under 500 000 would be completely exempted from the protections of the minimum wage law it is not bad enough that many hardworking americans would be denied a welldeserved payraise under the republican minimum wage proposal but this proposal goes even further exempting millions of american workers from any minimum wage standard effectively allowing employers to pay their employees whatever wage they desire the gops second proposal would go further in undermining worker protections by resurrecting and making permanent a youth subminimum socalled opportunity wage this subminimum training wage likely result in age discrimination in hiring practices and could lead to americas youngest workers undermining older workers for subminimum entrylevel positions under the republican proposal american employers would be able to hire young people for a training period at a subminimum wage only to replace them with additional young people before they would be required to pay the full minimum wage amount we should be passing a simple clean minimum wage increase for every american worker despite the unbelievable claims of

have ignored the warnings of the medicare trustees and instead demagogued this issue waging a campaign of fear and misinformation when the republicanled congress sent a bill that passed the house and the senate to the president which would have saved medicare from bankruptcy and preserved it for future generations the president vetoed the bill yet 3 weeks ago yesterday new evidence revealed that medicare is indeed going bankrupt faster than the clinton administration admitted three weeks ago yesterday there was an article in the new york times not exactly a conservative publication that said the medicare insurance trust fund lost money in 1995 this little article reads medicares hospital insurance trust fund lost money for the first time since 1972 2 years earlier than officials in the clinton administration had predicted that is what the new york times reported again 3 weeks ago yesterday we had projected that 1997 would be the first fiscal year with a deficit said richard s foster chief actuary of the federal health care financing administration which runs medicare once the trust fund starts losing money the losses are expected to grow the new york times reported then the next day the washington post reported the following the white house confirmed a report yesterday that suggested the medicare hospital trust fund may be hemorrhaging even faster than previously expectedending fiscal 1995 with a balance that was 4 7 billion lower than predicted in april 1995 the medicare board of trustees including three clinton cabinet officials and the commissioner or the director of the social security administration warned congress and the president that medicare would be bankrupt by the year 2002 unless it took steps to preserve medicare from bankruptcy and to reverse the soaring spending rate the exponential spending rate path medicare was on to bankruptcy the clinton administration of course tried to sweep these findings under the rug when the president spoke to the white house conference on aging just a month later in may of 1995 he never mentioned the medicare trustees report instead the president and the liberal house democrats spent most of last year and again the early part of this year blasting republican plans to save medicare but as i mentioned earlier according to the new york times the clinton administration had data as far back as last october that indicated that the situation was far worse than predicted while the administration had estimated a projected surplus in the medicare trust fund of 4 7 billion for 1995 in fact the balance in the trust fund fell by 35 7 million as i mentioned the first time since 1972 that the trust fund has lost money so clearly we now know medicare is headed for bankruptcy even earlier than 2002 and the president and the liberal house democrats have no plan to save it in fact they have done virtually nothing to address the problem for 10 months the president an the liberal house democrats have ignored the warnings of the medicare trustees regarding the systems impending bankruptcy and instead they have played politics with medicare exploiting and twisting the issue to deceive and scare senior citizens which is particularly i think despicable given the fact that so many of our senior citizens are frail and elderly and vulnerable and the president has submitted a string of budget plans that all fail to again deal with medicares financial crisis unlike the president and the liberal house democrats republicans listened to the medicare trustees warnings and we passed a plan that would have saved medicare for another generation our plan increases medicare spending per beneficiary per medicare recipient each year from 4 800 last year to more than 7 100 by the year 2002 that is a total medicare spending increase of 62 percent so we increased medicare spending increased medicare health care choices by introducing the concept of managed care physician service organizations and of medical savings accounts while saving the program from bankruptcy unfortunately as i mentioned this is the legislation that the president vetoed last november in addition to saving medicare from bankruptcy we republicans are taking steps to aid senior citizens despite the president and the liberal house democrats as part of our contract with america we repeal the tax increase by the clinton democrats on social security benefits a tax increase that takes affect on social security beneficiaries earning as little as 3 400 per year we offer tax relief for longterm health care insurance premiums and a 1 000tax deduction for elder care as part of the gop balanced budget act again these are proposals the president vetoed we have passed legislation to increase the social security earnings test so that older americans can continue to work without punitive taxation and we passed a law that the president did sign protecting the rights of seniors to live in senioronly housing clearly colleagues and saving medicare is not one of the presidents priorities getting reelected is rather than preventing or joining with us to prevent medicares bankruptcy the president and the liberal house democrats prefer to play politics they seized on this issue to try to win back control of the house of representatives they are only interested in using this issue exploiting it for

period i had the opportunity to have a number of forums both general forums with my constituents or specific forums or town meetings on the senior issues on environmental issues and also on education issues what i heard over and over again from my constituents was that they were very upset and they were very much opposed to the republican leadership agenda that we have seen in the congress over this last session now almost 2 years what my constituents were telling me over and over again was that they did not want to cut medicare they did not want to cut medicaid they did not want to see massive cuts in higher education programs and they certainly did not want to turn the clock back on the last 25 years of environmental protection that has been implemented by this congress and by presidents on a bipartisan basis my constituents could not have been any louder or any clearer on this issue they felt very strongly that the republican leadership in this case speaker gingrich and the rest of the republican leadership have the wrong priorities that when it comes to balajncing the budget and when it comes to the priorities that have to be implemented in order to balance that budget that medicare medicaid education and the environment were not the areas where cuts should be made essentially what i was getting was the impression that the gingrich congress if you will is out of touch with the american people and their concerns i just wanted to review because i think many times now we are getting very close to the election and a lot of times the public hears things that are very different from the actions that have been taken in this congress by the republican leadership in the last 2 years i just want to remind my colleagues about some of the initiatives that we have seen in this 104th congress we have seen an unprecedented republican record of voting for extreme cuts in medicare medicaid education and the environment essentially to finance tax breaks for the wealthy since the speaker newt gingrich first pounded the gavel in january 1995 medicare has essentially been under siege in this congress the gingrich congress again and again has tried to destroy medicare threatening to inflict major hardships on millions of senior citizens and their families also this has been the biggest antieducation congress in history the gingrich congress has continually goneafter education funding as a piggy bank again for their tax breaks for the wealthy targeting student loans in particular what i was hearing from my constituents at the various forums that i had was that right now the cost of higher education is prohibitive and whether you are going to a public school public university or a private college or university the costs continue to skyrocket the only way that most americans that the average middle class american can afford a college education today is if they have some combination of scholarship or grant or student loan or workstudy program and yet what we have seen here is the republican leadership constantly go after those very student loan programs or those very federal grant programs or even the workstudy programs that make it possible for many people most people if you will right now to go and to continue with their higher education and essentially if the gingrich congress gets its way students and their parents would pay thousands of dollars more for a college education at a time when tuition is already spiraling out of reach for many working families so either they are going to pay more or they are not going to be able to afford to go to college or to graduate school and they simply forgo that because they will not be able to get the help that is now afforded by the federal government on the environment basically the gingrich congress rolled into town in january 1995 determined to roll back major environmental protections in order to pay back the special interest polluters who finance their campaigns what we saw was that from the very beginning the polluters were sitting down with the republican leadership at the table and writing or rewriting if you will environmental laws i do not think that is in the best interests of americas families obviously people feel very strongly that they should be able to breathe clean air drink clean water and eat safe food and rolling back the environmental protections which we have seen put in place on a bipartisan basis by congress for the last 25 years since earth day is clearly not the way that my constituents and i think that most americans feel that we should be going let me just give you an example you know one of the things that we keep hearing is that this congress has changed that somehow the republican leadership now understands that they cannot roll back environmental protection and they are starting to do a few things here and there that maybe show that but you know if you look at the budget that was adopted earlier this year in the spring of 1996 you see that it still contains all these poison pills from the old budget extreme proposals that go against americas values it still eliminates the medicaid guarantee of meaningful health benefits for millions of americans it still threatens medicare with excessive cuts and damaging policies it still cuts education and it still takes the environmental cop off the beat what i mean by that is it cuts enforcement and i have said over and over again here in the well that it is very nice if you have good environmental laws on the books but if you do not have the money to enforce those laws to send out the investigators to have the environmental cop on the beat so to speak you might as well not have the laws on the books at all and this is what we are seeing a budget that basically disregards americas values i wanted to go into some of the points on this budget but i see that the gentlewoman from connecticut who has been so much a leader on making some of these points has joined me and if she would like to have some time yielded at this point"], [0.0011721253395080566, 0.9988278746604919, 1, "this weekend the new york daily news made some disturbing

for minority broadcasters but hidden in the conference report was one special provision that would allow rupert murdoch to reap tens of millions of dollars in tax benefits according to sundays new york daily news and i qu6te republicans dropped their opposition to the tax break after learning murdoch was the beneficiary of the legislation and consulting gingrich according to six sources involved in the negotiations in fact according to an earlier new york daily news story on saturday a senate staffer is reported as saying the republicans were going to kill the deal until they found out that murdoch owned the station then they almost magically approved it keep in mind the republicans claimed they opposed this kind of tax break and in 18 other pending cases they refused to allow these deals to go forward only the case involving rupert murdochs tv station in atlanta was allowed to go through with a special tax break i am here today to call on speaker newt gingrich to explain exactly why his own publisher got special treatment and exactly why this multimilliondollar tax break for rupert murdoch was allowed to secretly slip through for the speaker to claim that he had to agree to a special provision that was put in by a senator is ludicrous just last week when democrats tried to keep a senate provision that would stop billionaires who renounce their citizenship from avoiding their taxes the speaker said no and following lockstep with his lead every republican but five voted against closing this loophole for billionaires now we find that hidden in this same bill was a special provision that would allow one billionaire who just happens to be the speakers publisher to reap a multimilliondollar windfall does anybody really believe that the speaker could not do anything to stop this it seems to me that the lesson here is no matter which way you cut it if you are a multimillionaire or if you are a billionaire republican tax bills are going to look out for you

with murdoch on his role in this special tax break and on the tangle of special interests that are tainting all his dealings this is precisely the kind of thing we warned about when newt gingrich entered his 4 5 million book deal with rupert murdoch and this is why now more than ever we need a professional nonpartisan outside counsel to come in and sort out this whole mess it is looking more

the majority has not been listening to the consistent and concerned voices of the american people which have expressed opposition to these proposals the majority is once again proposing fundamental changes in medicare and medicaid which i might say helps and empowers over 70 million americans gain access to health insurance their plan is to change the medicare and medicaid from programs which assure health care for those who need it to programs which limit federal spending to a defined amount in other words they are changing them from defined benefit programs to defined contribution programs congress should be acting to expand health care coverage and rein in escalating health care costs but instead republicans in this congress are focused on tearing our nations health safety net potentially adding millions more to the ranks of the uninsured at the same time the republican plan includes tax breaks from 124 billion to 175 billion over the 6 years and leaves the option open for even additional tax breaks such as the costly capital gains tax break the majority would not need to make such drastic cuts and changes in medicare and medicaid if they did not insist on providing tax breaks for the wealthy their plan will jeopardize health care for 623 000 minnesotans who are enrolled in medicare and 443 000 minnesotans that receive help from medicaid half of those are children in other words 220 000 children receive medicaid in minnesota in fact about 1 in 5 minnesotans relies on medicaid or medicare over a million people the republican medicare plan continues to essentially include the same policy proposals as last years plan drastically cutting payments to the providers restructuring the current programs and heavily relying upon untested medical savings accounts the medical savings accounts proposal has been predicted to cost at a loss to the medicare trust fund an estimated 15 billion because medicare funds would be given to healthier wealthier people who most often do not need medical care the claim of extending medicare solvency is only a pretext for the out of context policy the gop pursues the medicare part a program needs changing but the republican plan goes too far and in the wrong direction changing medicare from a reliable health care insurance for our seniors to a secondclass health care system for medicare recipients under the medicare plan seniors will pay more and get less the plan would allow doctors and hospitals to charge seniors above and beyond the established medicare reimbursement rate balancebilling will bottom the norm as providers shift more cost to the seniors the proposed cuts by the republican congress will show up as bills on the backs of the medicare elderly who earn an average of 10 000 or less yearly perhaps even more damaging than the medicare cuts are cuts and program changes planned for medicaid under the republican plan seniors people with disabilities and lowincome families who receive help from medicaid would be at risk of losing their coverage in addition states will be allowed to reduce their own share of funding for medicaid making the actual cuts more severe than they first appear twothirds of all nursing home residents receive help from the medicaid system to pay their nursing home bills the republican plan will allow states to target the assets of seniors children to help pay nursing home bills which average 38 000 per year again the plan is really nothing less than a form of costshifting the plan cuts federal expenditures but does not limit consumer costs in fact these programs were put in place to permit families to take care of themselves when a health care crisis occur now the changes being proposed would pull the plug on the 30year commitment to medicare and medicaid republicans have shown that they are indifferent to the elderly and willing to send the american working families and seniors the bill for tax breaks for the wealthy but these are not responsible or fair priorities for our nations future the american people expect shared sacrifice not cuts for people programs and tax breaks for wealthier individuals but there they go again hoping

individuals and corporations while hurting the elderly the children and the working families of america we have heard for solong now the rhetoric of the republican majority promote the false notion that their mission to dismantle the federal government is based on a mandate of the american people my constituents however do not want to dismantle the federal governmentthey want smaller government that works better and is more efficient the american people want wasteful functions and programs eliminated they want programs that work to be left alone and they want fairness and equity in the allocation of limited federal resources the former democratic majority had been working to meet this mandate for at least the 4 years prior to last novembers elections it passed historic deficit reduction legislation in 1990 and 1993 that set a course for a stable budget and massive deficit reduction in 1990 the democratic majority broke the partisan logjam that prevented unified deficit reduction action on the part of a democratic congress and republican president in 1993 despite not one republican vote the democratic majority passed legislation that has brought our deficit down to its lowest level as a percent of the economy since 1979 these successes however were understandably not enough for a public weary of politicians and the status quo the american people said in last years elections they want change faster than democrats provided it is my belief therefore that the new republican majority had a tremendous opportunity to help enact much important and needed change it now appears that such an opportunity is lost it is lost because the republican majority not only targeted the wrong people and programs in their budget but because the party is mired in an ideology that promotes getting rid of critical federal programs and which demands tax cuts for the wealthy this ideology is driving the republican budget decisions to cut medicare and medicaid for the elderly cut education for our children cut job training for our workers cut economic development for needy communities and provide new tax loopholes to multinational corporations and individual millionaires and billionaires in this budget resolution republicans have chosen to target middleclass america without at least also targeting the hundreds of billions of dollars lost to this country from corporate welfare and tax loopholes which benefit the wealthy both liberal and conservative interest groups have recently put forth detailed and comprehensive studies of corporate welfare that should be eliminated but most proposals have been completely ignored by this budget resolution tax loopholes and corporate welfare are not the only things left untouched the resolution also leaves in plae wasteful defense spending and interational programs like the national endowment for democracy that have clearly outlived their usefulness in the postcold war era the republican majority is saying in this budget it wants a balanced budget by the year 2002 and provide tax cuts to the wealthy to fulfill a campaign promise no matter what the cost republicans claim that they are not cutting medicare and medicaid but they are saving a total of 475 billion in the two programs over 7 years that amount of money can be saved only through program cuts it is just that kind of doublespeak that has fostered the high level of cynicism and distrust of our government the cost of this budget resolution is certainly tremendous cuts in medicare and medicaid could increase outofpocket costs to the elderly by as much as 1 000 per year business would be forced to cut health insurance to workers because of higher premiums from costshifting by medical care providers more working families will be forced to drop health insurance altogether for hospitals who have a disproportionate amount of medicare and medicaid patients many will be forced to close in my district there are a number of hospitals where the percentage of patients served by medicare and medicaid exceeds 60 percent a full 61 percent of palmerton hospital patients 69 percent of patients at mercy hospital in nanticoke and a staggering 84 percent of shamokin area community hospital patients are served by these programs i do not think it is realistic to believe we can impose a 25 percent cut on these hospitals and have them still remain viable many hospitals will be forced to shift costs to persons who have insurance because of these cuts as a result more small businesses will be forced to cut or eliminate insurance altogether for employees more and more working families will be forced to chose between buying insurance and paying rent i already have more than 53 000 persons in my district without health insurance coverage how many more of my constituents will lose health care coverage because of shortsighted federal policies and inaction on health care reform sadly even with the largest budget cuts coming in the medicare program under the republican plan we do not even know in what direction they want to take the program under normal budget processes it would be the job of the committee on ways and means to decide precisely how to make the necessary changes to the program to achieve savings yet the republican leadership is trying to pass legislation that would require someone else to do their dirty work they are trying to pass the buck to a group of unelected medicare trustees who never until this republican congress was thought to have the responsibility to make decisions on preserving the solvency of the medicare trust fund in another critically important budget area republicans are proposing to eliminate most of the meager amounts this country spends directly on economic development the budget proposes to eliminate two agencies that play a critical role in economic development the economic development administration and the appalachian regional commission we spend less on these two agencies combined than we do on one b2 bomber what have these two agencies done recently for northeastern pennsylvania the eda has provided money to help build new buildings in nanticoke wilkesbarre and hazleton that serve as essential anchors for economic development and revival in these struggling towns substantial eda assistance is in the pipeline for expansion of an industrial park in luzeme county the eda and the arc help northeastern pennsylvania and other regions of the country that are struggling to attract scarce private economic development assistance without this type of public assistance smaller areas will either have to raise money themselves which many cannot or seek assistance from states where budgets are already stretched thin if we eliminate the eda and the arc along with cutting community development block grants and local housing assistance small economic markets will be at an even greater disadvantage tomorrow than they are today instead of saving economic development funds from cuts republicans provide more tax cuts and loopholes to the wealthy billions of dollars in new tax writeoffs are being offered to rich corporations people making more than 100 000 a year are being provided the opportunity to invest in taxfree retirement accounts and receive massive tax reductions on capital gains from the sale of stocks and bonds in all the wealthiest americans will receive a tax break of 20 000 under the republican tax proposals while the average tax break for middleincome families will be only 555 that meager 555 will be offset by

choices that the republicans have made for millions and millions of americans it is about the choice that they made to cut medicare by 270 billion it is about the choice they made in those medicare cuts medicaid cuts to remove nursing home standards for the protection of our elderly to remove our elderly from the entitlement of having nursing home care paid for if they and their families cannot afford it in the twilight of their lives it is about the choices that they made to cut 10 billion from student loans so that now americas students their families are deeper in debt to pay educational costs than any time in the history of this country it is about the choices that they made to cut the school lunch program and to cut back on nutrition programs for those who are the most vulnerable in our society those are the choices of the republican party in this budget reconciliation bill those are the choices that they made about this generation of americans those are the choices they made about that generation of americans that fought the world wars that fought the korean conflict that fought in vietnam who fought hard for democracy who fought hard to save western civilization in its time of need but the republicans are not prepared to fight for their medicare we should fight as hard for their medicare as they fought on the beaches of normandy or the beaches of iwo jima or okinawa or in korea but we are going to cut that medicare 270 billion why because the republicans did not want to make other choices they chose not to have highincome americans continue to pay their fair share in fact what they chose was what the wall street journal points out the choose to give them a tax cut as the wall street journal said to the rich of this country dont do anything yet but start salivating why should they start salivating because the tax bill passed on wednesday by the house of representatives could turn out to be the biggest tax saving bonanza in years for upperincome americans so we have 270 billion in cuts in medicare to pay for 245 billion in cuts to some of the wealthiest people in this country as we see under the republican plan 64 percent of the wealthy families in this country get a tax break but 86 percent of middleincome families get a tax increase or they pay the same those are choices that the republicans have made in this proposal they have chosen to give the wealthy the rich those who do not need a tax cut a tax cut they chose to pay for it by cutting the health care to our elderly by cutting the health care to our poor by cutting the health care to millions of americans children they chose to pay for it by cutting student loans and they chose to pay for it by cutting school lunches they chose to create millions of desperately poor americans so that they could take care of the wealthiest in this country they also chose to hold the defense department harmless everybody else has to contribute to balancing the budget but not the department of defense they also chose to hold harmless corporate welfare the large timber companies the large mining companies the large oil companies on which this bill lavishes billions of dollars in subsidies to those who do not need it to some of the most profitable companies in this country but those were the choices that the republicans made they chose to lead those people out of the sacrifice that millions of americans will be making in the coming years to balance the budget to balance the budget so we can have a prosperous economy but they chose that some would not have to enlist in that fight i say to my colleagues if youre very wealthy you wont have to enlist in that fight if youre a defense contractor you wont have to enlist in that fight if youre on the corporate welfare dole you wont have to enlist in that fight but if youre aged or if you are a student seeking an education or a child seeking nutrition or a family seeking a safe a safe and healthy nursing

come thanks to the clinton administration and the 103d congress efforts to reinvent government the american peoples faith in government is at a historic low recent surveys show that only 17 percent of americans believe in the ability of their government outcries for change in both the 1992 and 1994 elections speak for themselves but stump speeches denouncing government have successfully obscured the fact that government is changing it is getting smaller more efficient and more user friendly for the past 2 years we have been working to implement the recommendations of vice piesident gores national performance review implementation of these major reforms involves hard and patient work in the nuts and bolts of government management it is not flashy or eyecatching but it is getting results tonight my colleagues and i will offer reallife examples of how government for the first time in a generation is actually working better with less people and fewer resources than it did the year before as i mentioned earlier the restructuring was first announced by vice president gore in a report of the national performance review from redtape to results creating a government that works better and costs less this ongoing initiative has four main themes customer service procurement reform eliminating obsolete programs and reducing the federal workforce think back for a minute to a memorable sporting event the super bowl or the world cup think about the size of the stadium like the rose bowl one of americas largest filled to capacity that is the net number of people over 100 000 to date that the clinton administration has taken off the federal payroll 100 000 people whose salaries and benefits the taxpayers no longer have to pay 2 years from now that number will grow to 272 000 enough people to fill nearly three rose bowls this year penn state won the rose bowl but vice president gore deserves the national championship for leading this downsizing effort today the number of employees of the federal government is at the lowest level since the kennedy administration because of this action taken by president clinton and the democrats in congress there are fewer federal employees than under the socalled republican fiscal conservatives presidents nixon ford bush and even the gipper this is an amazing accomplishment i just want to show it on this chart this was in 1963 the kennedy years it has gone up and for the first time it is going down and we have reduced government by over 100 000 employees due to other initiatives in reinventing government employees still working for the federal government are able to interact with the public in a more intelligent and friendly manner i will give one example from my district in new york city for years the veterans administration has carried a terrible reputation among veterans notorious even within the va was the new york regional office before clinton and gore an application for veterans benefits would be handled by at least 12 employees working in 4 separate operations however if a veteran actually showed up in person they would not meet with any of the 12 people who handle the application instead he or she would meet with a benefits counselor employee no 13 but the benefits counselor would not have access to all the necessary information the counselor would have to go to yet another unit of the office on a different floor and get the file from another clerk employee no 14 that is the way it used to work today the application is handled by a single team responsible for processing filing and dealing with the veteran face to face when a veteran comes in he or she deals with someone who knows their file their history and can tell the veteran exactly what is going on this change has brought a tremendous increase in customer satisfaction for the veterans we have reduced the federal workforce and we are doing more with less but taxpayers should be most excited about procurement reform i know that the word procurement can put a lot of people to sleep but there are more than 200 billion reasons for taxpayers to stay awake and be very concerned about procurement that is because the federal government spends over 200 billion on procurement every year that is 800 for every american spent on goods and services there is no more important area in which to control spending and better manage our limited resources the federal governments record on procurement before 1993 was terrible we all remember stories about the 600 hammer or the 2000 toilet seat but one you may not have heard occurred during operation desert storm in 1991 during the gulf war the air force needed 6 000 standard commercial motorola radios for the troops like this one they wanted to order them so they could communicate with each other but even in that emergency the government could not just buy commercial products at competitive prices under the regulations at the time motorola would have had to supply records of what it cost to make these and documents proving they had never charged anyone less for them for quite a while the unitedstates government could not purchase these radios it is hard to believe but finally japan had to buy the radios from motorola and give them to the air force that is how bad it was last years procurement reform legislation solved this problem by eliminating requirements that the pentagon obtain cost and pricing data for commercially available items in other words if they are commercially available you can buy them and cut out the redtape i am certain that this historic law will simplify and streamline the federal procurement process while ensuring fairness accountability and integrity let me give you another example about how procurement reform is making the government work more intelligently and effectively for a long time the government particularly the pentagon spent enormous amounts of time and money developing its own specifications for easily available products like salad dressing instead of being able to buy commercial brands of salad dressing like this one off the shelf like every other american the government ended up buying products like this one paying more for less quality but this salad dressing was designed for government specs no more if it is available on the shelf you can buy it off the shelf as a result of changes initiated by the vice president and the 103d congress the defenses personnel supply center which buys all the food clothing and medical supplies for our troops has been able to undertake commonsense procurement techniques that make ordinary commercial products like this wishbone dressing available to the troops like it is to every other american to date the supply center has realized savings between 5 and 10 percent and for those lower prices our troops get better tasting nationally recognized products lastly we also save money because we now get our commercial products delivered when they are needed so there is no longer any need to warehouse enormous quantities of governmentdesigned salad dressings in addition to this commonsense program this new law will reduce paperwork especially for contracts under 100 000 and encourage the federal government to buy commercial products at the fairest prices it will strengthen oversight and procurement improve integrity and standardize the procurement code by eliminating obsolete and redundant laws it incorporates many of vice president gores national performance review recommendations such as providing for multiyear contracts promoting excellence in vendor performance and allowing state and local governments to use federal supply centers in a nutshell the law is going to save the taxpayers billions of dollars this is what is projected to be saved from the downsizing 46 billion procurement reform 12 billion and in other areas five coming to a total of 63 billion however president clinton plans to reform the procurement process even more today there was a hearing in the committee on government reform and oversight to outline the administrations plans for more improvement to americas procurement laws i would like to enter the entire record of that committee hearing today into the record so that the american taxpayers can have easy access to read everything that took place in this hearing today as i said earlier reinventing government means one more thing abolishing obsolete programs senator james byrne once said the closest thing in this world to immortality is a government agency but president clinton has demonstrated that immortality foi federal programs is no longer a sure thing for example more than 50 years ago wool and mohair were deemed important for making army and navy uniforms so a government subsidy was started that program survived and grew under every president from roosevelt to bush until bill clinton in 1993 the president and congress affirmed eliminating the wool mohair and honey subsidies thus saving the taxpayers 695 million that is a lot of money we are just getting started reviewing other obsolete programs that was just 1 of the more than 300 programs that have been eliminated so far what does this reform add up to it adds up to 46 billion in savings to the american taxpayer and an estimated 60 billion over the next 2 years we have more obsolete programs to abolish and more procurement reforms to achieve but thanks to the reinventing government program the american people have reason to believe that their government can work again and america can compete and win again in the world economy we have taken important first steps toward the day when business as usual in washington will actually have positive connotations on that note i am very happy to

democratic substitute would replace h r 3103 with language from the kennedykassebaumroukema bill this bill would expand access to health insurance for americans by increasing portability and limiting insurance companies ability to deny coverage because of preexisting conditions the political consensus for the kennedykassebaumroukema bill means that it could become law in a matter of weeks but h r 3103 embraces controversial divisive policies that doom any chance of insurance reform and minimal health security for the american people as a longtime advocate of fiscal responsibility i must oppose the provisions in this bill establishing generous medical savings accounts the msas would result in a significant loss of taxpayer doilars without a substantial revenue offset under this bill individuals could deposit up to 2 000 annually and families up to 4 000 in taxfree msas the joint committee on taxation has estimated that this provision alone would cost the unitedstates taxpayers approximately 2 billion this flies in the face of the deficit reduction goals to which this congress purports to aspire the republican leadership counters that the bill contains budgetary savings to offset the revenue loss from msas this assertion is laughable and cynical the budgetary savings are achieved through reforms in the medicare programthe health plan for americas senior citizens this is the same medicare program that the republicans claim is in such a dire financial crisis any savings achieved through medicare reforms should be used to shore up the medicare trust fund failing that these savings should be used to lower deductibles and increase benefits for medicare beneficiaries it makes no sense to use this savings to offset a tax break for the limited number of individuals who can afford msas individuals who choose to open msas will likely be healthier wealthier and younger than average unfortunately the majority of the medicare population is among the older and sicker and

improvement act of 1996 h r 3719 will better the ability of the small business administration loan program of the 7 a program the lowdoc program began as a pilot project in 1994 and has since spread successfully across the country the program provides a significantly shortened onepage application for a sba guarantee for loans of 100 000 or less minority and womenowned small businesses disproportionately apply for these smaller loans therefore the lowdoc program has had great success in recruiting more women and minority small business owners to the 7 a program in addition because of the reduced paperwork required of the lending institution in lowdoc loans the program has increased the participation ofsmaller lenders who have been found to be more likely to lend to smaller busioesses the sba has been criticized in recent years for overlending to larger small businesses at the determent of smaller small businesses the lowdoc program is one of the devices the sba has created to successfully address this complaint h r 3719 severely limits the lowdoc program by restricting which lenders can make lowdoc loans under the act only those lenders who are preferred certified or have significant experience in making small business loans can make lowdoc loans these categorizations will greatly limit the number of lenders who can make lowdoc loans in particular the number of small lending institutions able to provide lowdoc loans will be greatly reduced thus h r 3719 acts to limit accessibility to lowdoc loans according to representative meyers h r 3719 limits access to lowdoc loans on the basis of anecdotal evidence that lowdoc loans are high risk however the sba has shown that there is no reason to believe that lowdoc loans are more risky than other loans and in fact they may be even less risky the sba has found that both the currency rate the rate of payments made on time and the default rate on lowdoc loans are as good or better than those for other sba loans there appears to be little reason to alter the lowdoc loan program given that the program has made the 7 a loan program more accessible to minority and womenowned small businesses to all smaller businesses and to small lendinginstitutions in addition the program has proven to be a relatively safe loan program the changes to the lowdoc program are simply an example of the micromanaging which exists throughout h r 3719 and which is not necessary to successfully reform the sba however i am confident that these problems can be worked out through amendments and in conference committee therefore i restate my support of h r 3719 and commend the bipartisan effort which led to its creation"], [0.0004635453224182129, 0.4995364546775818, 0, "like a golfer if you had 48 golf balls in one
