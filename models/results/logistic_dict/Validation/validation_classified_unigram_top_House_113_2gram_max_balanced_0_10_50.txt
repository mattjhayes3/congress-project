it is about grippingtaking holdof the heart and soul of america as i said in the rules committee the budget is actually a moral document a moral compass of where we want to take this country i think what needs to be explained to the american public is that in actuality we have been making progress the deficit has gone down from 1 trillion from the past administration from the bush administration to now 680 billion we are making progress from losing 800 000 jobs a month to gaining close to 200 000 yet the document that is on the floor today the ryan budgetthe republican budgetchooses not to have the morality and the affection for the american people that is desired when you look at their budget you will see that 3 3 trillion of their budget69 percentis cut from programs for people with low or moderate incomes from the very people who need a stairstep of opportunity and they give 200 000 in tax cuts to the top 1 percent none of us have any challenge to prosperity and opportunity but how can you have a budget that hits lowincome programs or programs that give opportunity how many have gone to school because of pell grants 175 million in cuts how many people have gotten their health care from medicaid and still do like children how many people have needed to have the snap program i believe that we should have budgets that work for all people i intend to vote for the cbc budget and for the democratic budget and no on this underlying republican budget we need to have a standard that respects all people in this country and this budget does not mr chair i rise in strong opposition to h con res 96 the house republicans budget resolution for fiscal year 2015 i oppose this irresponsible budget resolution because it continues the reckless approach to fiscal policy that the house majority has championed for years with disastrous results mr chair the budgeteers on the majority side have a very poor track record when it comes to economic forecasts and projections for years they have based their entire legislative agenda and strategy on their belief that the affordable care act or obamacare would be a failure the wish was father to the thought but they were wrong because of obamacare more than 10 million americans now know the peace of mind that comes from affordable quality health insurance that is there when you need it 7 million through the exchange and 3 million through medicaid house republicans oppose increasing the minimum wage claiming that it costs jobs wrong again every increase in the minimum wage has been accompanied by an expanding economy especially during the clinton administration house republicans opposing comprehensive immigration reform claim that it will lead to lower incomes and lost jobs wrong again studies conducted by groups as far apart as the chamber of commerce and the aflcio consistently show that comprehensive immigration reform will grow the gross domestic product by 1 5 trillion over 10 years given this sorry track record of economic forecasting i strongly oppose the republican budget because it favors the wealthy over middle class families and those struggling to enter or remain in the middle class i oppose this republican budget because it asks major sacrifices of seniors who can barely make ends meet and fundamentally alters the social contract by turning medicaid and snap programs into a block grant and medicare into a voucher i cannot and will not support a resolution that attempts to balance the budget on the backs of working families seniors children the poor or mortgages the future by failing to make the investments needed to sustain economic growth and opportunity for all americans mr chair we democrats have a better way we understand that we are all in this together and that our current economic situation calls for a balanced approach between increased revenues and responsible reduction in expenditures our plan will protect and strengthen our recovering economy reduce the deficit in a responsible way while continuing to invest in the things that make our country strong like education health care innovation and clean energy mr chair this republican budget is bad for america but it is disastrous for the people from my home state of texas who sent me here to advocate for their interests let me highlight a few examples 1 if the republican budget resolution were to become the basis of federal fiscal policy 3 435 336 texas seniors would be forced out of traditional medicare and into a voucher program under the republican plan to end medicare as we know it texas seniors will receive a voucher instead of guaranteed benefits under traditional medicare 2 for the 3 435 336 texans aged 4554 the value of their vouchers would be capped at growth levels that are lower than the projected increases in health care costs previous analyses showed that this type of plan would cut future spending by 5 900 per senior forcing them to spend more out of pocket and diminishing their access to quality care 3 additionally private insurance plans will aggressively pursue the healthiest least expensive enrollees thereby allowing medicarecurrently the lifeline for 3 187 332 texas seniorsto wither on the vine 4 if the republican budget resolution were to be adopted by congress 206 304 texas seniors would pay more for prescription drugs next year 5 the republican plan would reopen the donut hole forcing seniors to pay the full cost of their prescription drugs if their yearly drug expenses are more than 2 970 for the year 6 seniors reaching the prescription drug donut hole would pay an average of 828 more in prescription drug costs in 2014 and approximately 13 000 more from now through 7 under the republican budget the 2 445 462 texas seniors who utilized free preventive services currently covered by medicare in 2012 will face increased costs in the form of higher deductibles coinsurance and copayments for certain services including even cancer screenings and annual wellness visits 8 the republican budget slashes 31 71 billion in nursing home care and other health care services for 754 500 texas seniors and disabled who currently rely on medicaid for their longterm care needs 9 the draconian cuts included in the republican budget would have a devastating impact on the 1 191 certified nursing homes in texas that serve 91 717 seniors with more than half relying on medicaid as their primary payer as a result nursing homes would be forced to slash services turn away seniors or close their doors mr chair this budget could have invested in programs that help strengthen the middle class reduce poverty and strengthen our economic recovery instead the republican budget makes deep cuts to the area of the budget helping lowincome families put food on the table and make ends meet these are families who are already struggling with unemployment lower wages and just simply trying to make ends meet the house republican budget will push millions more americans into poverty and put a large number of lowincome children seniors and people with disabilities at risk it guts medicare and medicaid and calls for massive cuts to food assistance all in order to protect tax breaks for special interests and for multimillionaires who are not even asking for them the republican budget may be characterized in many wayscruel irresponsible shortsighted recklessbut fair and balanced is not one of them in contrast the alternative budgets proposed by the democratic caucus congressional black caucus and congressional progressive caucus which were made in order by the rules committee are each worthy of support because they fairly balance the need for increased revenues and responsible reductions in expenditures with the imperative of making the necessary investments in human capital required to move our country forward specifically the alternative budgets proposed by the democratic caucus cbc and cpc help create more jobs now replace the sequester make key education investments invest in research and development and clean energy invest in longterm infrastructure preserve medicare as we know it protect health reforms benefits for seniors protect medicaid for seniors in nursing homes preserve supplemental nutrition assistance snap reduce the deficit through a smart targeted and steady approach provides tax relief for working families and ends tax breaks for the wealthy take a balanced approach to reducing the longterm deficits and debt and put the budget on a sustainable path mr chair under the democratic budget the deficit would fall from 7 percent of gdp in 2014 to 2 3 percent of gdp in 2024 the democratic budget alternative will generate at least a million more jobs this year compared to the republicans austerity first plan by making the investments needed to create jobs strengthen the middle class create greater upward mobility and ensure opportunity for our children and future generations the democratic alternative budgets extend emergency unemployment compensation for the longterm unemployed which provides a lifeline to the 2 37 million jobless workers who have already lost their benefits and the 72 000 persons who stand to lose there benefits each week if congress does not act additionally the democratic budget immediately ends the sequester which would otherwise cost the economy 750 000 jobs by the end of the year and replaces it with deficit reduction resulting from a balanced approach combining responsible spending cuts with increased revenues by cutting tax breaks for special interests and wealthy individuals without increasing the tax burden on middleincome americans mr chair the democratic alternative budget maintains our commitment to medicare medicaid and social security expands the eitc for childless workers extends the tax credits from the american taxpayer relief act due to expire at the end of 2017 and provides 7 6 billion annually for early childhood education it is said often mr chair but is no less true that the federal budget is more than a financial document it is an expression of the nations most cherished values as the late and great former senator and vicepresident hubert humphrey said the moral test of government is how that government treats those who are in the dawn of life the children those who are in the twilight of life the elderly and those who are in shadows of life the sick the needy and the handicapped for that reason that in evaluating the merits of a budget resolution it is not enough to subject it only to the test of fiscal responsibility to keep faith with the nations past to be fair to the nations present and to safeguard the nations future the budget must also pass a moral test the republican budget resolution fails both of these standards the democratic alternatives do not for these compelling reasons i stand in strong opposition to h con res 96 and urge my colleagues to join me in voting against this illconceived and unwise measure"], [8.463859558105469e-06, 0.9999915361404419, 1, "mr chair i rise today to ask my colleagues to reject the budget put forth by chairman ryan and the

disaster for our senior citizens it brings back the doughnut hole for medicare prescription drugs we eliminated the doughnut hole with the affordable care act but this republican budget brings it back

very much let me thank you congressman horsford for that very gracious introduction and also for your continued leadership on so many fronts especially in organizing the congressional black caucus special order along with congressman hakeem jeffries i really want to thank you for making sure that the theme this evening of this special order the 60th anniversary of brown v the board of education did not go unremarked you are both really doing a fantastic job representing and working hard on behalf of your constituents i also have to say that congresswoman marcia fudge our fearless congressional black caucus chair really serves as an excellent steward of the conscience of the congress let me just say i was just a child congressman horsford in el paso texas when the supreme court issued its landmark decision in brown v the board of education on may 17 1954 schools were segregated when i started school so that was in the notsodistant past i remember it very well my good friend congressman beto orourke so ably represents el paso today i have to tell you that the results and the impact of the supreme courts decision striking down the separate but equal doctrine is visible throughout the city i am proud to say also that in 1955 el paso became the first city in the state of texas to integrate its public schools my mother mildred parish massey was one of the seven african american students to boldly integrate the university of texas at el paso in 1957 el paso elected raymond telles the first mexican american mayor of a major united states city on june 7 1962 the el paso city council under the leadership of alderman bert williams passed the first city ordinance of any major city in the former confederacy outlawing segregation in hotels motels restaurants and theaters these were public places that were previously barred to african americans and in some cases in el paso earlier to mexican americans this history has been recounted by congressman orourke during black history month i thank him for that because i just have to say i lived this my family lived this my friends lived this just as so many millions of people throughout our country lived this shameful time in our history this is just a bit of my personal background we know that despite the landmark decision it would take decades in many cities and states for that first mandate of the supreme court to be carried out but because of brown we have the civil rights act of 1964 the voting rights act of 1965 and the civil rights act of 1986 of course we have come a long way since the 1950s and 1960s but the fact remains that the fight to end inequality in public education continues the end of the legal doctrine argued then by the brilliant great thurgood marshall who was the attorney and later supreme court justice and the naacp legal defense fund did not necessarily mean the end of racial segregation by neighborhood and community resulting in schools that continued to see stark segregation by race and income in fact many schools have reversed the desegregation gains of the 1970s and 1980s while many other schools remain as segregated as they ever were as a new ucla report mentioned last week which i have to cite congressman horsford called brown at 60 great progress a long retreat and an uncertain future black and latino students tend to be in schools with a substantial majority of poor children while white and asian students typically attend middle class schools my home state of california along with new york and illinois is among the top three worst states for isolating black students latino students are the most segregated in california and now with the attacks on affirmative action in states including my own state unfortunately including proposition 209 many years ago in the state of california many minority students are being systematically shut out of public higher education but lets be clear even in schools that are well integrated minority students often are treated differently as the results from the civil rights data collection survey showed which was recently released by the department of education and supported by the cbc despite making up only 18 percent of enrollees african american students represented 42 percent of preschool students suspended once can you believe that fortytwo percent of preschool students suspended once these are 4 and 5yearolds and nearly half of the students suspended more than once african american girls were suspended at rates 12 percent higher than girls of any other race or ethnicity black boys were suspended at higher rates20 percentthan girls or boys of any other race or ethnicity these are kids who are 4 and 5 years old this is simply unacceptable as chair of the cbcs taskforce on poverty and the economy and the democratic whips task force on poverty income inequality and opportunity we as task force members recognize that equal access to a quality public school education is key to lifting children out of poverty and true equality could not be achieved if systematic institutional barriers to opportunity are allowed to persist it was the thurgood marshalls of the world the medgar everses the rosa parkses the fannie lou hamers the martin luther king jr s the malcolm xs and all those unsung heroes and sheroes in our communities at the local level that ensured that this nation would live up to its own promise and the guarantee that was laid out in brown and so on the 60th anniversary of this tremendous supreme court victory i hope that members of this body recognize that while legal segregation is endedyes the laws of the land will not allow itde facto segregation and institutional and structural racism is alive and well our public policy agenda must take that fact into account we must complete the unfinished business of brown v the board of education by supporting legislation public policies and funding priorities that bring true equality and equity in education to all children thank you again congressman horsford for allowing us to talk this evening on this historic and momentous 60year anniversary of brown v the board of education"], [2.181529998779297e-05, 0.9999781847000122, 1, "let me thank the gentleman from nevada first of all for his tremendous leadership on behalf of the people of nevada and also thank you for those kind words and thank you for really helping to put together not only this special order tonight on behalf of the congressional black caucus but for your leadership on so many fronts thank you let me first say i serve as a member of the budget committee and i have seen closehand the republican vision for our countrys future and believe you me it is not a vision of shared prosperity or economic growth having a sound and balanced alternative like the congressional black caucus budget exposes the republican budget for the disaster that it really is the republican budget shortchanges 99 percent of the american people so it can give even more tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires and to protect tax loopholes for special interests and big oil at a time when we need job creation the most the republican budget would kill more than 2 million american jobs in 2014 alone thats unconscionable cutting infrastructure development would also kill jobs that are important to our communities communities of color jobs in the construction sector and in the public transit sector these sectors employ many people that other sectors do not employ the republican budget would take away food from hungry children and families kick thousands of children off of head start and close the door to college for thousands of graduates next year twothirds of all of the republican budget cuts target programs for people who are poor or low income and communities of color would be the hardest hit communities of color still bear the brunt of the last economic recession unemployment remains high as of january 9 7 percent of latinos and 13 8 percent of african americans were unemployed compared to the national average of 9 percent and income inequality continues to grow federal unemployment benefits already under sequestration would face greater cuts under this ryan budget as he proposes an additional 900 billion in cuts to nondiscretionary spending the republican budgets vision for america is very clear their budget would shred the social safety net it would shatter our economic recovery and would push millions of struggling families over the edge in stark contrast the congressional black caucus budget shows that we can choose a different way forward it is a document that shows our nations priorities and values for after all a budget is a moral document the cbc budget protects and enhances social security medicare medicaid tanf snap all of our vital safety net programs that save millions of people from poverty we believe strongly that any savings derived from changes to social security medicare and medicaid should be used to extend their solvency not to pay for tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires and we do not support a cut in benefits for four decades many of these programs have received support as the first line of defense against hunger and alleviating poverty helping to ensure vulnerable families in our nation that they have a stable life while protecting important antipoverty programs the cbc budget would also make sound invests in critical areas like infrastructure education innovation and poverty reduction to strengthen the economy for all im very proud of the fact that the cbc budget includes supporting language for developing a national strategy to eliminate poverty with the goal of cutting poverty in half in 10 years fifty million people in the wealthiest and most powerful country in the world are living in poverty 16 million are children weve also included in our budget a formula that leader clyburn continues to champion thats our 102030 formula which targets resources 10 percent of federal funds into certain accounts where there has been a poverty rate of 20 percent for the last 30 years that is extremely important as we begin to cut poverty in half in 10 years the republican budget of course is a pathway to poverty with cuts to social safety net programs jobs as well as programs that serve as a bridge over troubled water for millions of lowincome and vulnerable families the fact of the matter is when the economy grows through sound policies and investments that lift up struggling families everyone benefits also let me just mention the section with regard to national defense congressman horsford thank you very much for reminding us about these two wars quite frankly that have been off budget and that are responsible for the deficits and for the lack of jobs and the unemployment rates that we see throughout our country our congressional black caucus budget brings our defense spending in line with our legitimate security needs and we also have a budget that measures our growth in terms of our economic footing as it relates to investing in our national economic security here at home whatever savings can be achieved we put into mental health veterans health and also support and research treatment for traumatic brain injury also let me just remind you that the pentagon is the only federal agency thats not subject to an audit the pentagon has lost tens of billions of dollars to waste fraud and abuse there have been reports of suitcases full of dollars unitedstates taxpayer dollars being stolen or lost as it relates to iraq and afghanistan weve got to be able to audit the pentagon and so our budget uses the 300 billion of the savings from cuts also to the ballistic missile defense program for implementing the remaining gao recommendations i think we have now 1 682 of them which would save about 89 billion and so our budgeting insists that we begin to audit the pentagon that is a very important function that the congressional black caucus understands very clearly finally let me just say we restore harmful cuts to the military tuition assistance program i cant believe that the republicans would cancel military tuition assistance for veterans who have fought so hard in these wars dont they deserve better the congressional black caucus believes they deserve better and so we restore those harmful cuts the congressional black caucus knows we can do better we know that a shared prosperity is the most important key to sound growth and sound fiscal policy first let me just urge everyone to reject the ruinous republican budget and to support the cbc alternative budget i have to thank congressman bobby scott and the budget task force and all the staff for their tremendous work and their support in putting forth and writing a budget really that speaks to the aspirations and to reigniting the american dream for all americans i thank you again

media particularly by the three main networks for broadcast television and cnn and msnbc as well i saw a chart that was put together by a group called the minority report but i wasnt as interested in the group as i was in finding out if the relationships set forth in the chart were actually accurate so i had my staff help me lets find out is this chart really accurate i was really staggered by what was in the chart this is not the entire chart but it is most of it their chart was entitled keeping it in the family and it was very interesting as you see the chart here at cnn the vice president and deputy bureau chief in washington is virginia moseley who is married to tom nides who is the former deputy secretary of state under hillary clinton the former secretary of state you have bianna golodryga married to peter orszag who was the former director of the office of management and budget under the obama administration you have ben sherwood and he is the brother of dr elizabeth sherwoodrandall who is the former adviser to joe biden and also an adviser to the president at abc news you have ian cameron who is the former executive producer of this week and he is married to someone named susan rice who obviously was the national security advisor to the president before she went to the u n you have claire shipman who is married to someone named jay carney claire shipman is a correspondent with abc news then you have matthew jaffe who is married to katie hogan katie hogan was the deputy press secretary for president obamas 2012 reelection campaign and she is the spokesperson for organizing for action ofa which is working hard apparently to turn texas blue as they say anyway matthew jaffe is a reporter with abc news then not to leave out nbc news you have robert gibbs the former white house press secretary for president obama you have him as a contributor to nbc news you have the former senior adviser to the president david axelrod who is known for the massive and important advice he has given to president obama as a senior political analyst for msnbc oh we dont want to forget over here cbs news you have the president of cbs news who is david rhodes david rhodes is akin tois the brother ofben rhodes who is the person who coined the phrase kinetic military action instead of using the word war he coordinated the edits apparently of the benghazi talking points and of course he had a great deal to do with what was done in libya by this administration and the way that was discussed with the media so it is not necessarily surprising that sharyl attkisson ran into the buzz saw she did at cbs news when the president of cbs news is the brother of someone who was helping pull the strings at the white house in fact some of the articles that were pulled to point out some of these relationshipsan article by ed morrissey on april 29 of 2014 talked about the newly released white house email which shows that the rice talking points on benghazi were politically motivated it says in part in the article the youtube story was designed to distract from policy failures according to barack obamas aide ben rhodesor the brother to the president of cbs news then it goes on to set out part of mr ben rhodes email and he says in the email ben rhodes doesthe brother of david rhodes the president of cbs news to convey that the united states is doing everything that we can to protect our people and facilities abroad to underscore that these protests are rooted in an internet video and not a broader failure of policy to show that we will be resolute in bringing people who harm americans to justice and standing steadfast through these protests to reinforce the president and administrations strength and steadiness in dealing with difficult challenges on the toplines he says since we began to see protests in response to this internet video the president has directed the administration to take a number of steps his top priority has been the safety and security of all americans serving abroad indeed that was exactly what people in the administration were saying that was what the people at cbs news were parroting since that came from the brother of the cbs news president that seems to have worked pretty effectively there is another article here worldly at 35 and shaping obamas voice it was an article in the new york times in march of 2013 by mark landler it says as president obama prepares to visit israel next week he is turning as he often does to benjamin j rhodes a 35yearold deputy national security advisor with a soft voice strong opinions and a reputation around the white house as the man who channels mr obama on foreign policy mr rhodes is drafting the address to the israeli people the president plans to give in jerusalem but his influence extends beyond what either his title or speechwriting duties suggest drawing on personal ties and a philosophical kinship with mr obama that go back to the 2008 campaign mr rhodes helped prod his boss to take a more activist policy toward egypt and libya when those countries erupted in 2011 on further in the article it points out two years ago when protesters thronged tahrir square in cairo mr rhodes urged mr obama to withdraw three decades of american support for president hosni mubarak of egypt a few months later mr rhodes was among those agitating for the president to back a nato military intervention in libya to head off a slaughter by colonel muammar qaddafi further down in the article it says at the white house mr rhodes first came to prominence after he wrote mr obamas landmark address to the muslim world in cairo in june 2009 the speech was notable for mr obamas assertion that governments should reflect the will of the people prefiguring his policy in dealing with mr mubarak and colonel qaddafi another article from march of 2011 by rick moran it starts out with a reference to alice in wonderland when rick moran says a war is a war is a war right not if you live in the rabbit hole and have to answer to alice talking about alice in wonderlandas commander in chief but byron york is quotedand i take it this was an article by byron york inserted in mr morans pieceand says in the last few days obama administration officials have frequently faced the question is the fighting in libya a war for military officers to white house spokesmen up to the president himself the answer is no but that leaves the question what is it in a briefing onboard air force one wednesday deputy national security advisor ben rhodesagain this is 2011took a crack at an answer i think what we are doing is enforcing a resolution that has a very clear set of goals which is protecting the libyan people averting a humanitarian crisis and setting up a nofly zone rhodes said obviously that involves kinetic military action particularly on the front end that came from ben rhodes and then mr morans article says what we are doing in libya is making war whether the obama administration admits it or not people arent getting killed by kinetic anything they are dying the oldfashioned way they are getting blown up this gives a whole new meaning to kia another article from patrick howley from may 11 2013 entitled top obama officials brother is president of cbs news may drop reporter over benghazi coverage it says the brother of a top obama administration official is also the president of cbs news and the network may be days away from dropping one of its top investigative reporters for covering the administrations scandals too aggressively down further it says that reporting revealed that president obamas deputy national security advisor ben rhodesbrother of cbs news president david rhodes was instrumental in changing the talking points in september 2012 the article further down says more about mr rhodes being a 35yearold new york native david rhodes president of cbs news since 2011 so it is rather amazing but it should be more clear to people people wonder why the mainstream gives such favorable coverage to the obama administration well blood is thicker than water is one saying in the case of our mainstream media they totally dropped the ball on benghazi and continue to report on anything else they can besides benghazi i am very grateful that the mainstream media on the left and right back in the seventies did not drop the watergate investigation they stayed on it until the truth came out back in those days the mainstream media was so important to protecting our freedom and protecting americans from a president who had an enemies list and protecting america from a president that seemed a bit paranoid at times a man a fellow christian and an amazing man of faith after his conversion during the watergate investigation chuck colson talked in his book born again about how after the kent state debacle and students were killed it turned basically into a bunker at the white house it was we against they and if you were critical at all you didnt deserve to be in the bunker you were an enemy we are very fortunate that when a president begins to have that kind of mentality and so afraid of anybody who is critical we are fortunate he did not understand just how far a president how far an administration could push the irs into going after political enemies as we have now seen that it has whether or not the irss weaponization was before the 2012 election the president had a call to arms right here in front of the house and the senate and the cabinet members joint chiefs of staff and supreme court sitting right here when he mistakenly asserted what he believed were facts about the citizens united ruling by the supreme court and it was so wrong to the point that justice alito sat right here just feet away from where i am standing shaking his head and saying not true not true not true nonetheless people at the irs heard the call they paid attention and they came to understand that maybe the supreme court says conservatives can run ads and get involved in political issues like union groups do but maybe we can stop them and they effectively did that by putting their investigations into their tax status on hold and refusing to give them any kind of decision until well after the 2012 election thereby silencing those voices i have had reporters who obviously dont understand the tax code and the power of the irs say well what difference does it make those groups probably shouldnt have been applying for tax status like they were anyway obviously showing the ignorance of the reporters when they ask such questions because the way the internal revenue code is set up if someone in the general population just decides i want to get a bunch of friends together who have political beliefs like i do and we are going to pool our money together and then we are going to start spending it on issues to educate the american public and somebody has got to account for all that money you dont want the irs coming after you as you accumulate money to spend on political education of america so you have to go begging to the irs for the proper designation so that you can go about gathering money without them coming against you as being a single individual raising money to spend on political issues that also is one of the reasons why we need to throw out the internal revenue code just pass a bill that says as of a certain date the internal revenue code will be totally void and that gives us a deadline to shoot for i like the idea of a flat tax there are people that i love and respect that think a fair tax is a better way to go but by scrapping the internal revenue code throwing it out on a date certain then we would only have so long to get a new tax code figured out we would be serving notice to people that that is when it would change i have heard our president say so many times that people need to pay their fair share well it doesnt look like that is ever going to happen until we have a flat tax where if you make more you pay more you make less you pay less that is what we ought to be doing anyway as a result we have an irs that became weaponized on behalf of one political party and one administration and we do need a special prosecutor i have been pointing that out for quite some time there are criminals laws that may have been violated that is why we need a special prosecutor not the justice department we have seen their kind of just us rather than justice we need a special prosecutor that is not appointed by eric holder we need to get to the bottom of who violated the law because it appears laws were broken but some wonder why the mainstream media doesnt get into the irs weaponization more we see the familial relationships between the mainstream medianot that i am saying cnn and msnbc on the extreme left are mainstream media but they are part of the media who avoids reporting anything negative about this president well you hate to report things negative on your own family so that is understandable so it explains a lot once you begin to see all of the marriages and all of the sibling relationships between this administration and people in the mediasiblings in the mediapeople calling the shots and giving the advice in our major news media we also sometimes are a little surprised as the mainstream media tries to desperately change the subject from the false reports and statements that were made about benghazi and the coverup that we are now finding out about benghazi they are constantly trying to change the subject in their desperation to protect their familial relationships in the administration i had a call today wanting me to come on the news tomorrow and talk about climate change it used to be called global warming until people realized wow it is not really warming anything very serious so we better start calling it climate change and as any real scientists know when you come up with a scientific theory then there are certain facts that will prove your theory or your assertion but when we talk about climate change people are not doing that whatever happens if there are a lot of tornados they say see it is climate change if there are very few tornados they say see it is climate change if we have numerous hurricanes they say see it is climate change if there are not many hurricanes they say see it is climate change no matter what happens in the weather we are told it is climate change the truth is i believe in climate change i not only believe in climate change i know it is happening usually most places four times a year they are called seasons then we have climate changingi will never forget back in the midseventies there was a cover of one of the main american magazines about how we were approachingheading into a new ice age i thought well that doesnt make sense i do believe the bible and i dont believe the world is going to end in ice that just doesnt seem right yet we heard scientists telling us oh no we are at the beginning of a new ice age in the mid1970s we are at the beginning of a new ice age they were wanting to change everything we were doing oh we have got to change everything we are doing about power about fossil fuels everything because we are at the beginning of a new ice age about 10 years later people saw well we may be slightly warming so we had better quit talking about global cooling and now we are talking about global warming there is an interesting article that came out today from mario lewis entitled national climate assessment report alarmists offer untrue unrelenting doom and gloom this article today says tuesday the unitedstates governments global change research program released its latest national assessment report on climate change impacts in the united states as with previous editions the new report is an alarmist document designed to scare people and build political support for unpopular policies such as carbon taxes capandtrade and epa regulatory mandates also in keeping with past practice the latest report confuses climate risk with climate change risk droughts storms floods and heat waves are all part of the natural climate our risk of exposure to such extremes has much more to do with where we happen to live than with any gradual climate changes associated with the 1 3 degree fahrenheit to 1 9 degree fahrenheit increase in average unitedstates temperature since the 1880s since even immediate and total shutdown of all carbon dioxide emitting vehicles power plants and factories in the unitedstates would decrease global warming by only a hypothetical and undetectable twotenths of a degree celsius by 2100 eightyfive years even if they got everything they wanted for 85 years the article says it is misleading to imply as the report does that the obama administrations climate policies can provide any measurable protection from extreme weather events the assessment is flatout wrong that climate change is increasing our vulnerability to heat stress as hot weather has become more frequent people and communities have adapted to it and heatrelated mortality in the unitedstates has declined cities with the most frequent hot weather such as tampa florida and phoenix arizona have practically zero heatrelated mortality that is the most probable future for most unitedstates cities if global warming continues the report also foolishly predicts that climate change intensify air pollution as epas own data show despite allegedly unprecedented warming the unitedstates air quality has improved decade by decade since 1970 as emissions declined the report blames climate change for the midwest drought of 2012 but the governments own analysis concluded otherwise neither ocean states nor humaninduced climate change factors that can provide longlead predictability appeared to play significant roles in causing severe rainfall deficits over the major cornproducing regions of central great plains this assessment ignores substantial data and research finding no longterm increase in the strength and frequency of tropical cyclones and no trend in extreme weatherrelated damages once losses are normalized or adjusted for changes in population wealth and consumer price index for example the report says trends in the frequency and intensity of tornadoes are uncertain whereas in fact there is no trend and a new study by university of colorado professor roger pielke jr finds with some certainty that the number of years with very large tornado losses has actually decreased during 1993 2013 compared to 19501970 similarly the unitedstates is currently in the longest period on record with no major category 3 5 hurricane landfalls this good news is not included in the report the assessment gives short shrift to the warming pause which it calls shortterm in the assessment the pause is depicted as running from 1998 through 2012 that is 15 years in fact the pause is now 17 years and 8 months long more tellingly the assessment does not discuss the growing divergence between climate model predictions and observations the divergence now in its 34th year and accelerating due to the pause raises questions about the climate sensitivity assumptions on which dire climate change scenarios depend climate sensitivity is an estimate of how much warming will eventually result from a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations relative to preindustrial levels in its discussion of sensitivity the assessment basically endorses the u n intergovernmental panel on climate changes 2007 likely sensitivity range of 3 6 to 8 1 degrees fahrenheit and best estimate of 5 4 degrees fahrenheit it neglects to mention that partly due to the pause and model overshoot of observed temperatures the ipccs 2013 report lowered the bottom end of the likely range and declined to offer a best estimate more importantly the assessment presents the debate over climate sensitivity as a he said she said as if a single paper by john fasullo and kevin trenberth balances out some 16 recent papers indicating that the ipcc climate sensitivity estimates are too hot in other words they are just wrong the article says so despite an occasional fig leaf to hide the nakedness of its alarm message the report does acknowledge that climate change has lengthened growing seasons helping to make food more abundant and affordable the assessment is unrelenting gloom and doom its only hopeful message is that its not too late to implement kyotostyle climate policies sorry thats not good enough even for government work mario lewis is a ph d a senior fellow at competitive enterprise institute and it really is important to real realize what is at stake here it is something that shocked me back when we were trying in my freshman term to amend and reform the endangered species act that has wreaked such havoc with our economy and continues to cause people to lose jobs there was reported decline in the unemployment rate from 6 7 to 6 3 and you heard all of the mainstream media in helping their family members in this administration just all abuzz and aglow with how wonderful that fourtenths of a percent drop was failing completely to mention that that was only a fraction of the 800 000 who got so tired of not finding work800 000 people gave up and quit looking for work and are now considered under statistics to no longer be unemployed even though they are unemployed it doesnt account for all the people that are underemployed that are out of college and cant find jobs the historic high unemployment rate of our veterans coming back and looking for jobs even as this administration not only wants to cut the military back to a fraction of its former self back to preworld war ii levels when we were not a superpower and hatred and genocide began to reign supreme that doesnt explain why the administration and some people here in the house friends of mine here in the house that are saying you know what lets give the few jobs left in our military to people that are not lawfully in this country if they will do that even though it will displace one of the few military jobs left after we cut the military back so far and even though it will push them into an evengrowing high unemployment rate for veterans lets go ahead and give those few jobs left to people who are not lawfully in the country it is not a good idea after pushing for over a year and a half for a select committee to get to the bottom of what happened at benghazi and after we still havent gotten to the bottom of the department of justices role in forcing guns which we know they did forced guns to be sold to criminals and people that should not have had guns that ended up with drug cartels in mexico with reports of hundreds of mexicans killed by the weapons we forced into improper and illegal criminal hands webeing the justice department of this administrationwe havent gotten answers to that that is why even today as i stand here the highestranking law enforcement officer in the land stands in contempt of congress although i was gratified to hear him say in answer to a question of mine that i am not supposed to ever presume that it wasnt a big deal to him unfortunately he said a year ago to abc news that it wasnt any kind of big deal at all because to be a big deal he would have had to have respect for the people that voted for the contempt and since he had no respect for the people that voted for the contempt it wasnt a big deal to him so a year ago it wasnt a big deal and this year apparently it is still a big deal but i am not supposed to think that it is not a big deal to him even though that is what he said and the familial relationships in the mainstream media continue to give cover as i have continued to complain about the inadequate investigation into the tsarnaevsthe failure of this administration to properly investigate the tsarnaevs even after the russians who are not our friends gave us twice a heads up look out the older tsarnaev has been radicalized now you have got people in the mainstream media parroting what the obama administration is saying well those darned old russians they should have given us more information they did us a favor giving us a heads up we are not their friends they gave us a heads up anyway they dont eventhey purged the fbi training material so our agents dont know the proper questions to ask to find out if someone has been radicalized they wont allow people that have spent their adult lives studying radical islampeople like that like steve coughlinthey are not allowed to even go give a briefing to people to explain what radical islam is and then we hear people like the department of homeland security secretary at the time janet napolitano who seemed to take the position that gee you know we are just not able to connect the dots but yet it appears that under her watch not only did she promote what egyptian muslim brother publications said were top muslim brother people into top homeland security and obama administration positions but she gave a secret clearanceand there is no way it could have been given after proper vetting because proper vetting would have showed that he was a main speaker giving tribute to the man of vision the ayatollah khomeini who has a foundation called the freedom and justice foundation which is the same name as the muslim brother political party in egypt who defended the convicted terrorist supporter of the head of the holy land foundation said there was nothing wrong with what he was doing i am very proud of the senator from iowa i want to do a shoutout down the hall and read a letter from senator grassley i was just there in iowa a few days ago senator grassleys territory the senior senator from iowa charles e grassley wrote a letter to the new secretary of homeland security jeh johnson and he said my office recently received copies of disturbing internal department of homeland security dhs emails regarding the admittance of individuals into the united states with potential ties to terrorism the may 2012 email chain between unitedstates immigration and customs enforcement ice and unitedstates customs and border protection cbp surrounds the question of whether to admit someone who had scheduled an upcoming flight into the unitedstates allegedly the individual was a member of the muslim brotherhood and a close associate of a supporter of hamas hezbollah and palestinian islamic jihad according to the same email the individual had been in secondary inspection several dozen times of the past several years but had not had a secondary inspection since 2010 one of the responses to the initial email states the cbp national targeting center ntc watch commander advised that the subject has sued cbp twice in the past and that hes one of the several handsoff passengers nationwide apparently his records were removed in december 2010 and the dhs secretary was involved in the matter the email continues im puzzled how someone could be a member of the muslim brotherhood and unindicted coconspirator in the holy land foundation trial which parenthetically was a trial in which people were convicted of supporting terrorism providing financial support for terrorism convicted and this individual mentioned was a named coconspirator in the pleadings the message and the email goes on be an associate of redacted say that the unitedstates is staging car bombings in iraq and that it is okay for men to beat their wives question who was behind the 9 11 attacks and be afforded the luxury of a visitor visa and dewatchlisted it doesnt appear that well be successful with denying him entry tomorrow but maybe we could reevaluate the matter in the future since the decision to dewatchlist him was made 17 months ago senator grassleys message to secretary johnson of dhs said in order to understand the events described in these emails please provide the committee with answers to the following questions one why was this individual removed from the watchlist in december 2010 two please describe the nature extent and reasons for the involvement of the dhs secretary or her staff in the removal of the individual from the watchlist three what is the current watchlist status of this individual four how many people are on the handsoff list mentioned in the email five what qualifies someone to receive the handsoff designation six does filing a lawsuit result in being designated handsoff and thus avoiding secondary security screenings seven who makes the determination that an individual should be considered handsoff senator grassley says i would appreciate receiving answers to these questions by march 3 2014 should you have any questions regarding the letterand he goes on and he signs it charles e grassley ranking member then there is an attachment to his letter and there is so much that is redacted here that there are a lot of gaps but even so it is easy to see how serious this is this was from thursday may 10 2012 not quite a year before the boston bombing but as was pointed out in the letter this email was from a unitedstates immigration and customs enforcement officer to the unitedstates customs and border patrol protection the body says the ntc watch commander advised that the subject has sued cbp twice in the past and that hes one of several handsoff passengers nationwide he said he checked if there was a copy of the lawsuits filed against cbp in the historical logs can you pass the lawsuits if they are at ntc i assume the lawsuits were against the heads of dhs and presume it was a civil proceeding but who knows where it was filed since the subject lives outside the unitedstates i didnt know that a canadian citizen who lives in blank could sue dhs also not sure if the lawsuits were regarding him being stopped frequently or his admissibility inadmissibility or both if the lawsuits werent about his admissibility inadmissibility we should proceed forward regarding that once the lawsuits are reviewed if the lawsuits arent readily accessible at cbp ntc i can check with someone at cbp headquarters to get them apparently his records were removed in december 2010 and the dhs secretary was involved in the matter im puzzled how someone could be a member of the muslim brotherhood and unindicted coconspirator in the holy land foundation trial be an associate of blank say that the unitedstates is staging car bombings in iraq and that is okay for men to beat their wives question who was behind the 9 11 attacks and be afforded the luxury of a visitor visa and dewatchlisted it doesnt appear that well be successful with denying him entry tomorrow but maybe we could reevaluate the matter in the future since the decision to dewatchlist him was made 17 months ago thanks and then the name is blotted out anyway other messages one in response down the email chain i spoke with cbp blank who is obviously very familiar with this traveler i am of the opinion that blank meets the parameters for refusal based on the three ina 212 a 3 terrorism charges and that when he enters the unitedstates on a bi b2 for lectures speeches for organizations or for events where a registration fee is required or admission needs to be paid he should probably be seeking an r 1 or an 0 1 visa instead perhaps one of the reasons he has not applied for an 0 1 visa or r i visa is because of the terroristrelated questions these forms ask that he would then be forced to answer does ntc have any background information or guidance it can share on the logs or former records this subject has had or if he has applied for any waivers of inadmissibility does ntc have any objections if cbp denies admission to blank under either terrorism grounds or improper nonimmigrant visa based on a review of the statements of the subject i think it is clear that he meets the definition of endorsing and inciting if hed like to enter the unitedstates in the future he can seek a waiver to overcome those inadmissibility grounds but none has been sought to my knowledge and the email prior to that said yesterday afternoon we hsi blank office received a lead regarding blank aka blank an egyptianborn canadian citizen who is a member of the muslim brotherhood and close associate of blank an individual residing in blank who supports hamas hezbollah and palestinian islamic jihad blank has been looked at in secondary inspections several dozen times over the past several years however he has not been secondaried since blank 2010 blank has a reservation to depart blank canada at blank on this friday morning for a flight to blank that stops in blank first he is scheduled to speak at some conference in some city on some nightit is all blacked out i am passing this right up to blank at hsi to forward to cbp regarding possible inadmissibility grounds related to ina 2012 a 3 terrorism charges because blank s potential inciting endorsing and association with terrorists blank has been looked at in the past but hopefully this collection of 20 supporting open source articles will assist with making an informed inadmissibility determination but anyway apparently despite all of those open inadmissibility issues according to the later email the secretary of the department of homeland security herself at the time janet napolitano had a handsoff list apparently including people like this member of the muslim brotherhood when it comes to the boston bombing i have met some of the boston police i was impressed and i would bet if the city of boston police department had been given a headsup by either the fbi or cia that the russians say this tsarnaev guy has been radicalized is capable of murder then it would have entirely changed the investigation by the boston police department into people that were killed that were known to tsarnaev and i would bet you since i am not aware of the boston police department having had their training materials purged to exclude anything that might offend a radical islamist they may have been able to go out to the mosque and ask about tsarnaev if they had known the allegation that he had been radicalized and they may have been able to answer better questions about the type of islamic leaders that the older tsarnaev liked that he read that he endorsed and they could have made a better decision than our own justice department did on whether or not he had been radicalized that should have been shared with the boston police if they had had that information without having had their training materials purged they may have done a better job of protecting those people at the boston marathon then you read emails going back and forth among our ice agents customs and border patrol people who were shocked that a guy who is a muslim brother who has incited people to hatred against the united states who was a named coconspirator with people who were convicted of supporting terrorism how it is the secretary of homeland security could give him a pass just as she did to a reported member of the muslim brotherhoodreported by an egyptian magazine supportive of the muslim brotherhoodhow she could just give him a secret security clearance and even after i tell her about his downloading two documents from a classified source that she gave him access to and pointed out to her about a reporter saying he had tried to shop the two documents she said she investigated but i know they didnt because they never even talked to that one reporter that knew about the documents being shopped they never checked as far as i know he is still giving advice at the top level of homeland security as a muslim brother according to the egyptians he is given access to our classified documents and then we see that same homeland security secretary that gave him access to classified documents that he reportedlyand according to somebody i trusthe had shopped them and tried to get a national news media to publish them they didnt even look into it they didnt even investigate that properly how safe can america be when homeland security is creating handsoff lists that put us at risk with that i yield back my time"],

recently reintroduced here in the 113th congress as h r 946 every american should have the power to negotiate with their employer about the terms of their employment but no american should be forced to pay union dues just to get or keep a job however when congress enacted the national labor relations act in 1935 it established monopoly bargaining and that monopoly bargaining conscripts workers who want nothing to do with the union into paying union dues that doesnt sound like the america that i know in 1947 congress admitted this provision violated the rights of workers but because the votes werent there to fully repeal this provision they opted instead to allow the states to opt out of the nlras monopoly bargaining statute that was a provision that the states though had to pass laws to exempt themselves to date 24 states have enacted these righttowork laws and because of that they have been able to mitigate the negative effects of our misguided federal labor law on their citizens and their economy iowa is one of those states but the fact remains that congress created this problem in the first place by making forced unionization the default position for all states since congress created this problem it is congress responsibility to correct it the national right to work act does so without adding a single new word to the federal code by simply erasing the forceddues clauses in the federal statute while the votes werent there to repeal this provision in 1947 they should be there today because we now have decades of data to compare forceddues states and

of these businesses are about to get a far different deal than they bargained for when they accepted their jobs as a result of the 30hour rule some parttime employees are seeing their hours reduced the cbo has confirmed that shifting to a 40hour full time definition would lead some workers to seeing an increase in their takehome pay in addition to lost wages many workers could lose scheduling flexibility so that they wont cycle in and out of fulltime status from week to week these are ways that workers will lose the administration has already acknowledged the difficulty in implementing the

to making federal funding decisions critical to this discussion is the priority placed on investments in medical care for our active duty servicemembers and veterans i appreciate that the committee continues the precedence set in past years of providing advanced appropriations for the va allowing for advanced appropriations provides a platform for longterm planning and investment in critical programs that meet the emerging needs of our servicemembers and military families i want to personally thank the committee for providing these resources that will allow our va hospitals including those in my district to prepare adequately for the number of veterans returning home from deployment this approach will provide flexibility to capitalize on emerging technology and treatments that

in our military installations i applaud the inclusion of 35 8 million for the construction of housing units at naval station great lakes located in my district this funding will allow more

compounds he amazed and impressed the libyans by walking the streets with the lightest of escorts sitting in sidewalk cafes chatting with passersby there was a risk to being accessible he knew it and he accepted it what he would never have accepted was the idea that his death would be used for political purposes there were security shortcomings no doubt both internal and outside investigations

the clarion call i guess on the problems that that would cause to the environment in the future because the tar sands to mine is a very carbonintensive activity you take away the forest you also have to use a lot of water and a lot of energy in the production just the production of the tar sands causes great damage to the environment let alone the potential for damage to our country when they would travel through the pipelines then when theyre burnt thats i guess lighting the carbon bomb and letting it go off but dr hanson studied climate and was one of the first to warn on this issue he has retired so we will have his voice i live in memphis its kind of the center of the region oklahoma over for tornadoes tornadoes have been much much more prominent in the united states this just isnt a quirk mother nature can have her times and certain variances in her schedule but its obvious whats been happening with the increase in tornadoes the droughts the floods the mississippi river its been the lowest its ever been in spotsand its flooded it had the worst floods in memphis ever about 2 or 3 years ago and this year the river was its lowest weve gone from its highest to its lowest and somethings happening its obvious something is happening scientists almost to one tell us that this is because of what weve done to the environment there might be two out of 100 scientists it seems so unfortunate that the other side always grabs one or two of those people rather than the 98 we all have a debt and a duty to protect the earth and i think looking out for issues where we do conserve

about in their specific situation armored cars that have a lot of going around and they idle their engines when they pick up their financial depositsit costs a lot to the environment in burning of oil when the car is running theyve got a way where the car can be turned off and the idling of the engine can stop but nevertheless the vehicle still gets airconditioning and power it can save a tremendous amount of gasoline and protect the environment hopefully they can come within some grants that are already available to make companies that need to retrofit their vehicles to use that but it is like raising our cafe standards the best way to save energy is not to have to use it and to conserve on that there are opportunities we have obviously we have to concentrate on this weve got to

heard testimony from industry experts about the need to extend the commercial space launch acts risksharing system two of the witnesses who testified deal with this law on a regular basis mr stuart witt president of the mojave air and space port is developing new launch systems and technologies that could revolutionize space by making it more accessible he told the subcommittee that this law allows companies to continue to innovate and grow another witness ms patricia cooper president of the satellite industry association represents companies that add billions of dollars to the unitedstates economy as a result of the current risksharing system ms cooper testified that the systems continuation is absolutely essential and that her association strongly recommends that it be renewed before it expires the committee also recently received a letter signed by digitalglobe boeing virgin galactic lockheed martin american pacific corporation aerojet rocketdyne atk ball honeywell amt ii and orbital sciences which advocated the renewal of the risksharing system in order to keep the unitedstates competitive in the global market last year the space and aeronautics subcommittee held a separate hearing on indemnification and heard from the federal aviation administration the government accountability office digitalglobe and the aerospace industries association at this hearing frank slazer with the aerospace industries association summed up his trade associations position by stating many foreign launch providers competing against unitedstates companies already benefit from generous indemnification rules we cannot afford to drive away highly skilled technical jobs to foreign countries where the regulatory frameworks provide better critical risk management tools lastly a nonrenewal could impede new unitedstates entrants to the commercial launch market discourage future space launch innovation and entrepreneurial investment without a level playing field for competition new unitedstates entrants could find it highly undesirable to begin their business ventures in the united states the faa launch indemnification authority has been in place for over 20 years and the american commercial space industry has benefited significantly over this time thankfully the provision has never been triggered by a serious accident but the stability it provides allows the unitedstates to remain competitive in the global market and to push the boundaries of space technology the bill before us would extend indemnification for 1 more year with the hope that we can address a longerterm legislative solution i would have preferred a longer extension for instance the nasa authorization act that the science space and technology committee passed last summer extended indemnification for 5 years but we now have a bipartisan bill before us that provides stability to our commercial space industry by protecting companies against thirdparty liability claims this provision expires on december 31 so time is short this bill buys us time to work on a longterm extension as part of the larger commercial space launch act renewal that we will take up next year i urge
