really shut out and marginalized for to work very hard each and every day years and years and years but also on to make sure thatwe provide the vehibehalf of the american people because cles and the opportunities for everyone we know and we recognize as members in our country to get a job of the congressional black caucus the trigger may have been of course that whats good for our communities the bubble in the housing markets in especially communities of color the terms of the unemployment rate but i african american community makes tell you these excesses on wall street america stronger its good for the and the failure of the bush administracountry so thank you very much for tion to enforce any securities laws the continuing to lift our voices on behalf deregulation of the financial services of the people industryand i was on the financial tonight youve done a great job talk services committee for 8 years and we ing about really the reason and the ra kept talking about that with chairman tionale that we have to embrace work greenspan and there were very few force development training job train who really wanted to bite the bullet ing because so many of our constitu and say we have to not d6 this but we ents are not only recently unemployed did unfortunately so now we have an but they just havent been employed industry thats just run wild really for many many years for many many its run amok we also have to rememhistoric reasons many of which are ber that there was very little oversight systemic the opportunities just have of the banks and this unfortunate situnot been there as i was listening to ation has spread this crisis to each and you i was reminded of the new green every household and business in our industry its a trilliondollar industry country weve seen 7 million jobs lost but of course there are many in our since the beginning of the bush recescountry who dont have the requisite sion and the unemployment rate has skills to be able to even apply for these now risefi to 9 4 percent nationallyjobs in this new industry 14 9 percent however for african i want to just call attention to one americans and for latinos organization in my district in oakland now during the bush administration california the oakland green job 5 million more people fell into poverty corps where young people are learning unfortunately now we have 37 million green technology are learning to americans living in poverty 47 million weatherize homes are learning to put with no health insurance and that is solar panels on roofs they are learning rising so weha e to tackle this beand developing the skills necessary to cause if we dont tackle this we will be able to be fully employed in this have millions more living in poverty new industry and these are young peo actually last week the congressional ple who may not have had a chance black caucus released our agenda as had it not been for the cyprus mandela well as our biannual report and we call training center mayor ron dellums it opportunities for allpathways out our city of oakland and of course the of poverty department of labor and all of the partners who have helped put that to u 2045 gether our energy czar from the white all members of the cbc put one of house ms browner came out and she their bills on this agenda we have 42 looked at the green job corps and we bills and if you look at each and every are hoping that this will be seenas a one of the pieces of legislation that is model to replicate throughout the pending that we consider our priority country legislation each one provides a pathlet me just remind you that the con way out of poverty and an opportunity gressional black caucus has histori for all cally been knowa as the conscience of we also unfortunately in the last the congress and we recognize that few years have watched company after the dignity of all human beings is ex company cut their benefits and mil tremely important in our work to close lions more americans now as i said thesesome of us call it these moral earlier have lost their health insurgaps that exist these disparities and ance and their retirement plans and tonight of course were talking about pension plans have fallen unfortujobs employment and unemployment nately off the table the last administration has left us and our nation in shambles and it is really critical that we come together to begin the work of providing opportunities for all in america and ending this spiral of poverty that is spiraling downward unfortunately with millions more people in this situation we have got to expand and extend the proven antipoverty programs that were included in the american recovery and reinvestment act like expanding access to the child tax credit and the earned income tax credit we have to maintain support for the vital extensions of unemployment insurance and cobra health insurance millions of americans need these subsidies while millions of americans continue to face job loss and extended periods of unemployment these are stopgap measures but this has to be seen as necessary just to stop the hemorrhaging and give people some relief so they can survive and sustain them selves until the jobs that we are working so hard to create are created we have got to maintain support for and invest in education and job training programs as congresswoman fudge talked about earlier and fully support initiatives such as the affordable housing trust fund and the neighborhood stabilization program which our colleague congresswoman maxine waters who chairs the housing and opportunity subcommitte6 of the financial services committee worked so hard with the congressional black caucus upport to bring some stability to our hardesthit communities but we all know we have to do more we need to raise and index the minimum wage so that every working person can be assured that they will earn a wage that will lift them up and out of poverty each and every year without having to rely on legislation to keep up with increases in the cost of living yes we increased the minimum wage several years ago but i believe like many of my colleagues believe that we must support and find ways to provide for a living wage raising the minimum wage is not enough we also must ensure access to early childhood education guarantee a quality public education for every american student and make sure thatevery working family has access to affordable quality child care again why is child care so important well we have millions of women millions of single moms and single men who want to work but they cant afford the child care so we cannot look at creating jobs without understanding we must provide for the job training and child care assistance so that they can really afford to get a job and will not have to worry about their young people also and oftentimes we forget this there are millions of men now that we call in my community formerly incarcerated individuals who have been released from jail we know that the recidivism rate is very high and part of h6302 co the reason is because there is very little employment for these individuals so we have to provide support for our reentry initiatives i am very proud of the fact that congressman danny davis a member of the congressional black caucus from illinois continues to work on behalf of those who would not have this second chance we passed the second chance act a couple of years ago but we must fully fund this so that we can provide for that job training and those jobs for fbrmerly incarcerated individuals also our disconnected youth we have young people who need jobs many families now because of the fact that mothers and fathers are unemployed oftentimes young people have to help and they deserve to be able to get a job too so we have to fully fund and support summer job programs for our young people which i am very proud of the fact that president obama speaker pelosi and all of our leadership here our majority whip mr clyburn supported with the economic recovery package to make sure we have funding in there for our summer jobs program for youth also access to health care some of us believe and i know many of us in the congressional black caucus believe that health care should not be a privilege it is a basic right it is a basic right and as we begin health care debate again we cannot forget that closing health care disparities in communities of color must be part of any health care reform package otherwise those communities those individuals who have historically been discriminated against in our health care system and really that is what has happened over the years it has lieen discrimination they deserve to have some of these gaps closed so this has to be part of again a comprehensive approach to job creation and employment so let me just conclude by saying that during this economic crisis we think that we have to see this also as an opportunity to make the changes that we seek some of the systemic changes that we seek to guarantee access to health care to guarantee and ensure fair and adequate housing for all and to provide topflight education for all of our children and support the growth of the new green living wage economy that will carry america into the 21st century we have to support the employee free choice act because many of us in the african american community know if it hadnt been for labor unions many of our families would not have become middle income so the right to organize the right to participate and to be in a union is essential because when we are talking about jobs we are not just talking about a job but we are talking about a job with justice jobs with good pay with benefits with a pension with health care the type of a job that any american deserves so this employee free choice act is an"], [0.0001821526966523379, 0.0001821526966523379, 0, "in the deep dark dungeons of this capitol the government trolls are writing bills behind closed doors their aim has always been to take away our liberty one step at a time its what bureaucrats do they look for ways to grow and take over more of our lives to justify their existence so these elite government trolls think they know better how to run our lives than we do and they keep their bills in secret so we the people wont know whats in them until its too late until the legislation is forced upon an unwilling misinformed people it has been decades since freedom and liberty faced a full frontal assault from a single piece of legislation a bill that is so damaging in scope that by its passage american freedom and american health will be sacrificed on the altar of more government control of course im talking about the universal government takeover of health care this is the most important piece of legislation in modern history and we were promisedwe were promised that we in this house we would have transparency we would see what is taking place the administration promised us that transparency in fact the administration invited interested parties in health care to the white house to discuss health care of course for some reason i wasnt on that invitation list because im always willing to discuss my position and the position of the people i represent we were promised that cameras would film the transparency cameras like cspan cameras like the ones here in the house of representatives down the hallway in the unitedstates senate so the american people can see what takes place i believe in cameras so that the american public can see what happens in our republic when i was a judge back in texas i was one of the first judges to allow cameras into the courtroom so the american people could see what took place in a criminal trial ive offered legislation to have cameras in the united states supreme court in their hearings so the most important most powerful court in the united states and in the world the people can see what takes place over there of course that legislation hasnt gone anywhere and cspan what do they do well theyre not a news organization in the sense that they have commentators they just film what takes place and the american public decides cspan wants to film what is taking place somewhere in the dungeons of this capitol where the trolls are writing yet another health care bill you know health care is more than about just government control of health care its about government control of our lives its more about government raising taxes more government spending more borrowing from the chinese and from the japanese and more oppression a government takeover of health care is unhealthy and its not going to make the american health better its going to make the individual health of the american people actually worse given that the government control over health and health care is not compatible with liberty if we love the competence of fema and the efficiency of the post office and the

were nor ever will be secure when the transactions of their rulers may be concealed from them and thats exactly whats taking place in this third health care bill that is supposedly being written by members of the senate and members of the house somewhere in this capitol when rulers plot against the people in secret it makes it hard for the people to fight back because they really dont know whats going on but the people are fighting back they are fighting back with ballots and not bullets that was proven yesterday in massachusetts the way things are running in washington d c these days the proof is purposely hidden from the people and the question is why why cant the people see through cspan what is taking place behind closed doors because its giving power to government and not to the people and thats why were not being allowed to see whats taking place its about changing the phrase we the people to we the subjects and thats why we the people arent allowed to see whats taking place

important to the american people should be important to the american people the deficit spending the debt that has been created with this budget alone is greater than all presidencies combined every one of them combined this one budget is greater than all of those we cant continue down this road this budget bill is a steamroll of socialism that has been shoved down the throats of the american public it is going to strangle the american economy it is going to choke the american people economically we have been promised that 95 percent of americans were going to get a tax cut we saw that in

single family is going to pay an increase in their cost of living by 3 100 per family we cant afford that it is going to hurt the poorest of people in this country it is going to hurt our seniors who are living on a fixed income it is going to hurt small business because of this class envy and class warfare thats being proposed by this administration we have seen promise after promise broken by this administration and not only that we are creating a debt for our future generations so that their standard of living is going to be much less much lower than ours today as mr duncan was talking about we are either going to have hyperinflation or deflation i think were fixing to head for hyperinflation we have seen in the past that gross deficit spending by governments has created hyperinflation to the point that people almost literally had to have a wheelbarrow to take the currency to the grocery store to buy one loaf of bread thats where were heading today warren buffet just 2 weeks ago said that were off the cliff i think were headed towards a marked prolongation of this recession a deepening of this recession and very probably a severe depression franklin delano roosevelt when he was spending taxpayers dollars like a drunken sailor did nothing but prolong that depression thats exactly what this philosophy thats being promoted here in this house and in the senate across the way and by this administration is going to do in fact the only thing that got us out of the great depression was the creation of a manufacturing entity in america to supply the needs for world war ii are we going to need a world war to get us out of this depression that were headed towards i hope not but this deficit spending is totally irresponsible it is unconscionable that we would have this kind of philosophy promoted in this congress it is going to hurt the people who can stand to be hurt the least and thats tlfe poor people the retirees those on fixed incomes this

created by bigger government bigger socialism taking our freedom away taking our money away taking our future away and taking our children and our grandchildrens future away because this budget spends too much it taxes too much it borrows too much and weve got to put an end to it it is up to the american people to cry out to members of congress to say no absolutely no were going to stop this so i

frankly make sure well need another one because they kill all regulation secondly even as to the tarp heres my difference the minority leader came to the well and said tarp was passed to be an emergency bill and the emergency is over you cannot directly address a member so let me say will someone tell the minority leader it aint over until its over on main street all throughout america maybe when the republicans had that meeting with a group of financial lobbyists they took some time out to celebrate the ending of an emergency but most of us know the emergency is not over i didnt say aint again the emergency continues and heres what the administration has proposed under the bush administrationand i voted for tarp i thought that the lack of regulation created a crisis but the big banks got the first tarp money we are now finally succeeding in getting tarp money for smaller banks who can do community lending and small business lending we voted today to take 3 billion and give it as loans to people who cant pay their mortgages because theyre unemployed not people who got mortgages they shouldnt have gotten not subprime mortgages hardworking people who cant pay a mortgage the 3 billion would go for that to help them avoid foreclosure and they can pay it back when they get the job thats gone so the antisocial parts of tarp are okay and now they want to get rid of the other parts by the way who are they saving money for here their friends the big banks the original tarp legislation said at the end of the day any tarp shortfall will be made up by an assessment on the financial community weve gone further than that the amendment we adopted over republican opposition by the gentleman from michigan instructs the fdic in this bill that they want to kill not surprisingly to assess the financial institutions to make up any shortfall from the tarp they kill that they complained before about our assessment they are very upset that we might levy on jpmorgan chase and morgan stanley and goldman sachs and the others some responsibility financially for whats gone on so heres what they do first of all they kill all reform and their pretense that they are for a different form of it they deliberately left it out of their bill they were just playing it they secondly say now that tarp money has gone to the big banksand they dont have to pay it back by the way under this bill necessarilyand we are trying to use it socially to encourage lending to give it to community banks with some requirement they lend to help people who are unemployed avoid having foreclosure until they get their jobs back now they want to get rid of it and to whose benefit the big banks the question is should we use tarp money to give to the small banks for community banking should we use tarp money to help people avoid unemployment or should we do what they want to do and give it back so that the big financial institutions arent assessed thats whats at risk here not the taxpayers the taxpayers are not on the hook for this tarp money the large financial institutions are and i know what they say it will be a restriction in capital well i think capitals a good thing but to the extent that capital was misused for speculation that it was misused for unleveraged credit default swaps then a little reining in is a good thing but once again heres what you have a bill a motion that says lets not do anything to change the financial system lets let companies go bankrupt and not worry about them lets not have anything about derivatives lets just do nothing and instead lets save the big banks from having to pay their fair share when the tarp is repaid"], [0.9718819856643677, 0.9718819856643677, 0, "on rollcall no 71 the motion to suspend the

her timely work in authoring this tribute the sudden and unexpected passing of ambassador richard holbrooke earlier this week was a shock to all of us the depth of sadness that we felt at the news was a testament to his exemplary life of service to our country in so many different capacities ambassador holbrooke was one of the most consequential world diplomats of the last halfcentury and his tireless work in pursuit of united states national interests and international peace have put us all in his debt his advocacy for peace was of course most clearly shown during the conflict in bosnia his tenacity and force of will brought the warring parties to the negotiation table in dayton ohio where he skillfully brokered the accord that ended the over 3 years of atrocities and bloody conflict over 100 000 perished in the bosnian war and it is impossible to say how many thousands were saved by ambassador holbrookes actions at dayton and while that accomplishment would have been enough to mark any diplomatic career with high distinction it was only one of the many facets of his service which continued to the end of his life as assistant secretary of state for two regions of the worldeast asia and europe as united states ambassador to the united nations and as unitedstates special representative for afghanistan and pakistan he made his mark on many issues that remain urgent concerns today in new york at the u n he did much of the heavy lifting on congressionally led efforts to rein in u n spending to rationalize the dues paid by the united states and to improve the standing of israel in that multinational body sadly those concerns have returned with a renewed urgencywith the need for fundamental reform of u n budgets and the virulently antiisrael u n human rights council so called and the congress can only hope to have such a tenacious principled partner in the future ambassador holbrooke made his final appearance before our committee on foreign affairs in the spring of last year as unitedstates special representative for afghanistan and pakistan we lament the loss of his matchless skills in those critical regions but while we grieve at his passing let us renew our own commitment to success in afghanistan as a fitting way to honor his service toward that end at this time we extend our condolences our thoughts and our prayers to his wife kati and to his children while we mourn the loss of a dedicated public servant they mourn the loss of a husband and a father i urge all of my colleagues to join me in this expression of gratitude for the

demean the build america bonds provisions by calling it money to state and local governments when everybody knows its for infrastructure that goes to private contractors and their employees you

in this structure this is a credit that is supposed to relate to the income by american companies created overseas so what has been happening under this loophole is that the credit has been used not in relationship to that income but has been used relating to other income so it isnt double taxation its an effort to avoid any taxation and the rest of us pick up the bill now one company that has objected to this has dramatically increased their investment offshore and diminished their jobs in the united states and diminished their r d so they say close the loophole and we will pay more taxes yes what we are saying is follow the rules like small business does in this country and like all of us individual taxpayers do in this country you can come here and say closing a loophole increases taxes by definition it does because it says to people who are skipping paying taxes pay your fair share so this is a twofer jobs in the unitedstates and stopping the shipment of jobs overseas and if

resolution again this year i would like to thank the gentleman from new jersey for joining me in working on this resolution as well as on many other important issues since 1974 catholic schools week has celebrated how catholic schools have positively impacted our country and it has recognized their outstanding contributions in providing a strong academic and moral education as well as teaching the importance of responsibility to ones family and community the national catholic educational association and the united states conference of catholic bishops have provided exemplary leadership in conceptualizing and organizing catholic schools week this years theme is timeless in scope and universal in its values catholic schoolsdividends for life faith knowledge discipline morals this theme perfectly embodies the call of americas catholic schools always emphasizing the necessity of a wellrounded educational experience nearly 95 percent of catholic schools have a service program and the average student completes approximately 80 hours of public service my desire to serve was fostered by the dedicated teachers whom i had in 12 years of catholic school today almost 2 2 million elementary and secondary students are enrolled in nearly 7 500 catholic schools by maintaining an excellent studentteacher ratio and through dedicated efforts catholic school students on average surpass other students in math science and reading in the three grade levels tested by the naep test the graduation rate for catholic high schools is 99 percent and 97 percent of catholic high school graduates go on to college or to technical school in a country where poor educational reports have sadly become an annual tradition these statistics are truly remarkable and should be greatly commended catholic schools are known for embracing students from all walks of life and are highly effective in providing excellent educational opportunities for minority students and disadvantaged youth almost 15 percent of students in catholic schools are not catholic and over the past 30 years the percentage of minority students enrolled in catholic schools has more than doubled despite exceptional results the success of catholic schools does not depend on selectivity accepting nine out of every 10 students who apply in addition to producing welleducated students catholic schools save american taxpayers billions of dollars every year by lessening the number of students in already overburdened public schools in fact it is estimated that taxpayers save over 1 billion from students attending catholic schools in the chicago area alone and 20 billion nationwide the importance of this savings is undeniable to american taxpayers unfortunately the current economic climate combined with decadeslong travails of the middle class have been hard on catholic schools in some areas like me my wife judy attended catholic schools for 12 years graduating from st patricks grade school and bishop mccort high school in johnstown pennsylvania unfortunately last year st patricks closed this closing has proven to be a great loss not just for the students of st patricks but for the entire community of moxham demonstrating just how important catholic schools are to the greater community i was born and raised and live in the chicago archdiocese which still has one of the most successful school systems in the country more than 96 000 students attend 258 schools in my district alone there are seven catholic high schools and approximately 50 grammar schools including one of the best in my home parish of st john of the cross in western springs my experiences have taught me the important spiritual moral and intellectual foundations that catholic schools provide to students a catholic education has granted me the knowledge discipline desire to serve and a love of learning that has enabled me to achieve my doctorate degree and become a teacher before being elected to
