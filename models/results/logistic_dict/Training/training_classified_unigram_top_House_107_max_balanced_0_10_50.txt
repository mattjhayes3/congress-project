business of the american peoples agenda the house has a lot of work to do and not a lot of time in which to do it in america today millions of hard working families face challenges in their daily lives since january 2001 our nations economy has deteriorated dramatically and this house has failed to provide real relief to the families who need it most we have seen the most anemic period of economic growth since dwight eisenhower was president in 18 months the stock market has lost 4 5 trillion in value more than 2 million people have lost their jobs a wave of corporate scandals has eroded peoples fundamental faith in our nations free markets and scores of corporations have become bankrupt consumer confidence dropped in each of the last 4 months and is at the lowest level since november 2001 our nations retirement security system has also been undermined and in great difficulty in 18 months republican economic policies have taken 2 trillion from the social security trust fund baby boomers retirement benefits have been jeopardized in each of the last few years prescription drug prices have soared more than 10 percent reliable prescription drug coverage eludes almost twothirds of all medicare recipients on a daily basis senior citizens face a choice between buying food paying the rent or buying their medicine senior citizens actually slice pills into halves because they cannot afford their full prescriptions faced with these challenges the house republican leadership has failed to address peoples kitchen table concerns in the last 18 months this leadership passed an agenda that satisfied the special interests misled the american people and dismissed the interest of americas hard working families but for bipartisan action after the september 11 terrorist attacks republicans amassed a record of nonachievement in this 107th congress and failed to make a difference a real difference in peoples lives on the economy republicans have demonstrated a devotion to special interestdriven tax cuts in 2001 in a mammoth tax cut giveaway republicans gave the lions share of the breaks to those who least needed tax relief the republican economic plan turned record surpluses into deep deficits for the decade ahead the only surplus that is left is after they have squandered most of the social security surplus the republican economic agenda rejected the fundamental values that in the 1990s propelled the longest economic expansion ever recorded opportunity responsibility and community in a socalled stimulus bill the republican agenda even tried to give enron a 254 million tax break for the economic victims of the september 11 attacks the republican agenda blocked the extension of unemployment benefits legislation for 5 months for people who had lost jobs in this republican recession the republican agenda blocked the extension of health care benefits legislation this ideological agenda has blocked a modest very modest minimum wage increase even though in the 5 years since the last increase the minimum wages real value has fallen 11 percent this agenda has done almost nothing positive for americans it has instead led to large layoffs weakened americas manufacturing sector and helped produce big losses in peoples pensions iras and mutual funds across the board faced with this mounting tide of bad economic news republicans continue to support more special interest tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals in april in the middle of a reces sion they voted to extend provisions in the spring 2001 tax cut bill that would not take effect until 2011 think about it as families face financial hardships the republican majority wasted valuable time trying to cut taxes for the wealthiest individuals starting 10 years from now in 2011 in recent weeks they have wasted the houses time and peoples money passing the exact same tax cut all over again republicans sliced their 10year enrichment plan for the wealthy into individual tax cut pieces in order to distract attention from the absence of a real agenda that would address americas real problems the sole passion of house republicans has been to reward their wealthy political clientele for the next decade and beyond at the expense of every other need of the american people republicans pass one press release after the next and abdicate their responsibility to lead america they seek to create the illusion of real life legislative progress on americas real problems where none exists perhaps more telling about their inability to carry out their responsibility to govern is that to date not a single spending bill has been sent to the president just one week before the new fiscal year begins in fact since the august recess this house has failed to pass a single spending bill and it is the house that must originate this important budgetary legislation republicans are failing at this most basic task because their misguided economic plan is starving important investments we can and must make in our families futures especially in educating our children their budget plan would force 50 000 kids from afterschool programs that keep children safe republicans will leave children trailing behind in america in fact because some republican moderates understand cuts will have to be made they have been unable to bring key bills to the floor and now their strategy appears to be delay delay delay until after the november elections to avoid voters wrath this week the house will have to pass the first of what will probably be several continuing resolutions to try to fund the federal government republicans are simply kicking the can down the road looking ahead to a possible lame duck session to fix their budgetary problems while they continue to deny the consequences of this deeply misguided economic plan a lame duck session deprives voters of the legislative information to make an informed decision and by delaying key spending decisions republicans are depriving critical resources to public schools hospitals homeland security among other priorities the house should not adjourn before holding a full debate on all of these spending bills and priorities people deserve common sense solutions to the challenges that confront them that is why i hope republicans will at least accept our offer to convene a bipartisan economic growth summit to put together a plan that will cut the budget deficits bring back responsibility and discipline and get us back on the path to longterm economic growth and opportunity even now as we consider a resolution to go to war there is an unwillingness to reconsider republican economic and budgetary decisions made more than 1 year ago before september 11 2001 furthermore democrats support a 21st century energy agenda that creates jobs protects the environment and expands the economic pie for all of us education investments to create the most trained and most highly skilled work force on the planet a minimum wage increase for hardworking families and a second round of extended unemployment benefits because for over 1 million people their benefits have been exhausted and by december 1 5 million people will be in this position second this house must have a free and fair debate about our nations social security future despite repeated promises to safeguard the surplus the republican leadership passed an economic plan that diverted 2 trillion from social security into other nonsocial security initiatives putting special interest tax cuts first second third fourth fifth and sixth republicans broke our commitment to save social security first and jeopardized the baby boomers social security benefits social security is the greatest retirement security program ever conceived social security puts food on peoples table shelter over peoples head it spells the difference between poverty and dignity in the lives of millions of senior citizens surviving spouses and people with disabilities it represents the largest most reliable income source for middleincome seniors republicans have at least five plans to privatize and cut social security benefits these schemes make it clear either republicans will have to cut benefits divert trillions of dollars from other as yet unspecified programs or they will have to do both things according to one study senior citizens surviving spouses and people with disabilities would see benefit cuts between 30 and 46 percent annually if the republican privatization proposals get enacted therefore i can think of few more crucial priorities than a full social security debate with a spotlight shining on republicans privatization schemes i am deeply disappointed that house republicans seemingly do not want this debate and they do not want this vote the republican leadership is doing everything in its power to sweep social security under the carpet until after the november election they understand just how unpopular the privatization agenda has become especially since the near record drop in the stock market of the last months the american people have a right to know the consequences that flow from this decision they deserve a frank honest discussion about all of the republicans social security privatization proposals as elected leaders it is our obligation and our responsibility to hold this discussion before the november elections so the people the people can decide social securitys future in addition republicans must complete the unfinished business of the american peoples prescription drugs agenda right now they are trying to run out the clock on the crucial challenge of prescription drug prices i have talked to hundreds of senior citizens who have urged the congress to cut prescription drug prices down so hardworking families can afford them in this congress republicans have failed these families while protecting the profits of the biggest drug makers that support their campaigns in july republicans passed a sham bill written by the prescription drug lobby they refused even to let us vote on our democratic alternative they rejected a real medicare prescription drug benefit rooted in the right values a benefit available and affordable to all and 100 percent available reliable and guaranteed the republican bill represented a fraud and a farce it was not worth the paper it was written on it covered barely a fraction of americas senior citizens put the benefit in the hands of private insurance companies and took a dangerous first step toward privatizing medicare on a partyline vote it passed the house days later i was in missouri and i saw commercials underwritten by the pharmaceutical lobby the spots praised republican candidates for supporting the republican prescription drug bill fraud that bill secured the profit priorities of our nations drug makers over and at the expense of our nations senior citizens it is the same special interest republican story line on the issue of prescription drug prices this summer the senate 78 to 21 passed a good bipartisan bill that will close loopholes used by drug makers to stifle competition keep prescription drug prices high and maximize industry profits this simple legislative step could cut prescription drug prices by about 60 percent according to the nonpartisan congressional budget office it would save consumers 60 billion in prescription drug prices each year in the house democrats are circulating a petition to discharge the senatepassed bill because republicans also refuse to debate this not surprisingly the pharmaceutical lobby is starting an advertising blitz attacking the senate bill scaring people with the canard that if this bill is enacted somehow magically medical and pharmaceutical advances will come to a grinding halt the drug companies continue to fund republican campaigns as a reward for republican actions and inactions on this highpriority agenda item the special interests can afford to pay for this largess since january the big drug makers earned more than 37 billion in prescription drug sales on this issue the special interests have seized and controlled the agenda before adjournment we must make this the peoples house again we must not let it be the pharmaceutical companies subsidiary corporate interest we should and we must vote in this congress to try to lower prescription drug prices for all americans preventing more corporate scandals and bringing corporate criminals to justice is the fourth piece of unfinished business here in the house again the reality the sad reality is that special interests haveguided the republican response to the whole basket of corporate accountability issues under republican leadership thousands of americans have lost jobs due to corporate misbehavior in recent months arthur andersen fired 7 000 employees global crossing fired over 9 000 employees worldcom fired~over 20 000 and enron fired over 4 500 this is not part of a normal business cycle to say the least in recent months peoples pensions lost 210 billion and state pensions lost 4 billion combined when worldcom and enron stock plummeted because their books had been cooked in response to these awful mindnumbing developments house republicans passed watereddown special interest legislation to create the appearance of action when the truth was a failed republican deregulatory agenda republicans blocked accounting industry reform for months until the pressure became so great they had no choice but capitulation but they refused to impose stiff penalties on employers who mislead employees about the value of company stock they failed to punish ceos who run their companies into the ground they blocked our efforts to eliminate tax breaks and federal contracts that corporations still today receive by relocating overseas to avoid paying american taxes in april republicans passed a pension reform bill that failed to protect pensions from corporate abuse and indiscretions one house republican even acknowledged that the bill does little to protect peoples pensions it failed to give employees control over their nest eggs and retirement plans it treated executive pensions better than employee pensions maintaining two sets of rules it offered employees no legal remedies when companies abused peoples 401 k s i believe america has the greatest most vibrant free enterprize system on the face of this planet but for the sake of every consumer every ceo every employee and every investor we must create one set of rules for all reward hard work with fair play and ensure that corporate criminals pay the price i will continue to stand on this floor and fight for comprehensive business employees and investors bills of rights let us get it done today and restore peoples faith after what has happened to their precious savings sadly the republican response to all these challenges is to run out the clock on the congress as one newspaper wrote over the weekend i saw a headline just yesterday calling the republican agenda an avoidance agenda i quote bob novak apart from the war on terrorism the republican party he says flinches from standing for much of anything in the 2002 election to retain their majority republican leaders have created a playbook that reveals the failed republican agenda and mocks the priorities of their constituents in recent weeks even with misguided bills republicans seem incapable of taking any action republicans pulled an education tax bill pulled the bankruptcy conference report now they waste time and over 100 000 a day of the peoples money according to one calculation passing press release bills one more obvious than the next the nonsense of the house resolutions as i would like to call them will make zero impact on peoples actual lives the same can be said of other wellmeaning resolutions that represent the lions sharb of the legislative agenda with house republicans in the majority in this session the house has passed at least 40 suspension bills to bestow names on post offices under republican leadership this house has considered the following resolutions among others supporting the goals of the year of the rose honoring the invention of modern air conditioning recognizing the significant contributions of paul ecke jr to the poinsettia industry and for other purposes ensuring continuity for the design of the 5cent coin establish the coin design advisory committee and for other purposes at the rate we are going nobody is going to have any coins to redesign if we do not get this economy straightened out this house is becoming irrelevant because peoples kitchen table priorities are not being addressed on a constructive and bipartisan basis instead of wasting time on empty meaningless gestures and then voting to allow the presidents plans to privatize social security to take effect sheltering unpatriotic offshore corporate tax havens from paying their fair share of taxes blocking campaign reform passing the largest gift to the wealthy in the history of this nation in the form of massive tax breaks without even considering a new economic plan passing a gift to enron and other oil and gas interests through a dirty energy bill delaying and bending to corporate interest in addressing the corporate scandals and protecting pensions delaying and then undoing the strong air safety rules congress enacted to safeguard the public in the aftermath of september 11 republicans should have been working with democrats to address the american peoples unfinished and important business the american people want us to raise the minimum wage protect investor rights enact job training pass medicare prescription drugs cut prescription drug prices and extend unemployment benefits people also want ujs to reform our elections and voting apparatus to ensure that every vote counts and that what happened in 2000 and 2002 in florida and elsewhere never ever happens again people want us to enact a real patients bill of rights with teeth and effectiveness and not the sham republican legislation that is languishing and waiting in going to conference they want us to help school districts across america get class size down to 18 students in each classroom they want us to pass school construction to promote safety in every public school create a stable learning environment and meet the staggering backlog of unmet school construction needs people want us to close the pay gap between men and women they want us to overturn new white house rules and restore real medical privacy protections to every american patient they want us to make polluters not taxpayers foot the cleanup bill and maintain the super fund program that cleans up toxic waste they want us to enhance our hate crimes law and provide more resources to states and local jurisdictions to help investigate and prosecute these heinous crimes they want us to reinstate worker safety protections to prevent repetitive stress injuries in the workplace just to name a few this agenda is worthy of the american peoples highest dreams and hopes for their family it is worthy of peoples real concerns that are there on a daytoday basis it is incumbent upon us all to stop wasting time in this house to stop being irrelevant to the peoples real agenda and to get about the business of the american peoples domestic security agenda let us do it on a bipartisan basis let us enact an agenda that creates opportunity

republican house majority leader dick armey said we must understand that it is inviolate to intrude against either social security or medicare and if that means forgoing or as it were paying for tax

year that every single dollar of the social security and medicare surpluses would be saved for social security and medicare with this republican budget virtually no dollar of the social security and

several tax bills funded by the projected budget surplus without giving any consideration to the impact that the bills will have on our ability to retire our 5 7 trillion nationaldebt these tax cuts have been predicated on the notion that the projected budget surpluses of 5 6 trillion over the next ten years will somehow materialize i submit that the likelihood of these projections actually materializing is extremely slim we are all aware of the recent 3 7 trillion loss in the equity market this slowdown will undoubtedly have a negative effect on revenues and produce lower overall budget projections how much lower is anybodys guess and we should not bet the farm on tax or spending programs that are based on circumstances that no one can accurately predict i am concerned that the total costs of this bill fully phasedin could exceed not only the 1 6 trillion number that fits within current projections but may actually result in congress returning to deficit spending this is why i intend to support the fiscally responsible substitute which provides immediate estate tax relief targeted to farmers and small businesses while protecting other urgent priorities such as paying down the debt and shoring up the longterm future of social security and medicare i will also support however final passage of h r 8 because it is the only vehicle the leadership will allow to provide

financial institutions and consumer credit for yielding time to me our federal deposit insurance system is a critically important element in our economic stability and it has served our people quite well for almost 70 years i do believe that h r 3717 makes some very important improvements to that system among the bills strong points it would merge the bank insurance fund the bif and the savings association insurance fund the saif it would make the system less procyclical by permitting the fdic to charge riskbased assessments at all times and it would eliminate the socalled cliff of extremely high required assessments should the fund fall below the designated reserve ratio for an extended period it also deals with the socalled free ider problem it also provides the fdic with enhanced flexibility to manage the fund now for years i and a number of other members and industry leaders and regulators have been calling for these reforms and i am pleased very pleased that these reforms are included in this legislation that we consider today i am also very pleased that the longstanding law encouraging lifeline banking that the gentlewoman from california has promoted since she has been in congress will be made operational by a provision in this bill that she drafted all those factors persuaded me to support going forward on this bill on the other hand there are some provisions of the bill most of them articulated by the gentleman from california that do give me some concern i hope we will be able to give closer attention to them in conference should we ever get to a conference these are features that could result in increased risk to the federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system specifically i am concerned that the increase in the coverage limits for standard bank deposits and the increase in the limits for municipal deposits especially could create increased incentives for risktaking by banks thrifts and credit unions without an appropriate compensating benefit for depositors and without any assurance that the increased limits will result in a net increase in deposit in the institutions that claim these increases are needed to fund loans to their customers my concerns are not isolated they are shared by federal reserve chairman alan greenspan by the fdic chairman by the former secretary of the treasury larry summers and by the present secretary of the treasury paul oneill mr oneill points out that an increase in coverage would primarily benefit high net worth individuals and do little for the great majority of savers who have deposit balances far below the current coverage limit to raise the general coverage level to 130 000would the fdic estimates reduce the fund balance by almost four basis points immediately and more than an additional four basis points in the future now eight basis points may not seem like much but it would be the difference today between a combined fund ratio of 1 29 above todays statutory designated reserve ratio and 1 21 which is below the current drr of 1 25 under current law a fund ratio at that level would definitely result in increased premiums and under this legislation would likely prompt the fdic to begin to assess higher insurance premiums every basis point of premiums takes money out of the banking system and away from lending to communities the cbo predicts that the bill will result in a net premium increase to banks thrifts and credit unions of 3 5 billion over 10 years that is 3 5 billion that could be used for community lending i am encouraged that the gentleman from ohio chairman oxley and the subcommittee chairman the gentleman from alabama have been willing to address some of my concerns about the increased coverage by agreeing to reduce the maximum municipal deposit insurance limit from 5 million to 2 million the lower limit reduces risk to the deposit insurance fund and the banking sys tem but it still permits more than 80 percent of the nations local governments to place all their cash in their local community banks while enjoying the maximum fdic protection provided by the bill on balance however especially because of the merger of the bif and the saif the federal deposit insurance reform act of 2002 represents a serious effort to reform our current deposit insurance system and it should be taken to the next step in the legislative process i look forward to working with the chairman of the full committee the subcommittee the ranking members and the members of the other body to reduce the legislations potential

many members i represent people who have worked hard and whose entire hope for a secure retirement may well rest on the success of their 401 k leather workers jet engine assemblers teachers nurses and other hardworking intelligent folks who are bright and able but many of whom have little experience in understanding investment fundamentals they may lack thetime or even the knowledge to work through a mountain of financial information they need advice that is given by a provider that meets at least minimum standards one who is qualified and one who is subject to the laws of erisas fiduciary standards standards of trust and one who is free from financial conflict free from divided loyalties and they need an advisor who will put the workers or investors interests first above profit consider this following example two mutual funds each posting annual gains of 12 percent consistently for 30 years one fund has an expense fee of 1 percent the other an expense fee of 2 percent if you invested 10 000 in each fund the fund with the lower expense fee at the end of 30 years would earn 229 000 but the one with the higher expense fee of 2 percent would have only 174 000 the mutual fund would pocket the difference of 55 000 obviously there may be little incentive for the advisor connected to the riutual fund to highlight the significance of this conflict of his or her potential gain in steering someone to the higher fee investment why should we allow such a conflict of interest to exist when it is not necessary perhaps that is why the fund industry islobbying so hard for this bill but workers and retirees are not asking for its passage these hardworking people like other investors need and want good sound advice but allowing money managers to make recommendations that will generate more income for themselves hardly falls into the realm of independent advice in 1974 congress chose to ban transactions between pension plans and parties with a conflict of interest except under very narrow circumstances and they did that for a simple reason there is too great a danger that a party with a conflict of interest will act in its own best interests rather than exclusively for the benefit of the workers that concern is no less valid today studies by the financial industry itself have found broker conflicts have harmed advice received by individuals audit conflicts have undercut the value of audits on financial firms analyst reports have shown significant evidence of bias in comparing ratings the law erisa was designed to protect against just these types of issues

mr need not obliterate longstanding pro pomeroy and i think it also addresses tections for plan participants in order some of the remaining concerns it to do that surveys show that the most does provide for adequate disclosure it important reason advice may not now does provide for fiduciary responsibe offered is that employers have fears bility sometimes i think we are being that they may be held liable for advice a little bit condescending to a lot of gone bad the remedy for that and it the people who are participating in is in the bill is that congress should these plans when we are not giving encourage more employers to provide them the credit for engaging in their independent advice by addressing em own due diligence by trying to deterployer liability it should clarify that mine what the costs will be and what an employer would not be liable for the values are of the various instruspecific advice if it undertook due dili ments of investment that they are gence selecting and monitoring the ad going to be considering vice provided it is as simple as that most people today are there is no need for conflicted advice becoming increasingly aware that you many plans already provide for in have to consider the cost of a parvestment education many plans now ticular plan most people are becoming provide independent investment advice aware that there is increasing risk and through financial institutions and volatility with different mechanisms other firms without conflict clarifying that you could invest in that employers would not be liable if i remember when mr lieberman was they undertake due diligence with re engaged in his last campaign and he spect to advice providers would further said it is interesting when i would be increase advice as necessary

were making he said they had can encourage independent unbiased more information than most people investment advice that will better en that he had come into contact with able employers to improve
