the war against freedom being waged by the soviet union and its communist allies i want to focus on two major areas one is the gorbachev propaganda offensive trying to set the stage for geneva it is an attempt to create an environment in which there will be more pressure on president reagan to appease the soviet union than there has been in any western leader since neville chamberlain went to munich in 1938 in addition to talking about the gor bachev offensive and what i think is the correct american response to that propaganda offensive i want to talk about recent developments in central america and in particular the ways in which the nicaraguan communists are threatening costa rica i also want to talk about the ways in which as the el salvadoran communists find they are unable to win they are reverting to terrorism in their efforts to defeat the government of el salvador let me first talk about the gorbachev peace offensive the fact is that marxistleninist parties in particular led by lenins own writings are very oriented to psychological intellectual warfare they think that words are very very important one of the reasons why in most communist countries there is a dramatic increase in education as soon as a communist government takes over is because they regard education as the key to brainwashing the population they believe that brainwashing that teaches people the right words is the key to controlling people in the long run so it is natiiral for a communist government to think that a psychological political offensive is a part of warfare indeed unlike the west if you study leninist warfare or soviet warfare manuals they have an entire section on psychological political intellectual warfare in which they have invested very heavily and in which they train a great number of people in the past i have cited from the grenada documents documents which were captured when we liberated the island of grenada documents that are based on a communist government and a communist party in grenada in those documents i have quoted examples of the very serious planning that goes into a communist government trying to mislead both the american people and the american news hedia and the careful planning which goes into propagandizing their own people it is clear from the grenada documents that there is a serious longterm communist effort to understand the american news media and to know how to manipulate it an effort to understand american church groups and to know how to manipulate them in that setting i think the gorbachev offensive is part of a long pattern of soviet willingness to lie and deceive in order to try to communicate their values in the recent time magazine interview with gorbachev there were two fascinating examples of the soviet modern techniques of manipulation the funnier of the two was a line where gorbachev was quoted as saying god in his infinite wisdom i found it fascinating here you have the leader of the communist government an avowedly atheist movement a man whose wife teaches marxist philosophy at the university of moscow cheerfully for purposes of western newsmen citing god a god which technically he cannot believe exists if he believes the teachings of lenin but because he knows that we feel comfortable with people who cite god he is perfectly willing to make us feel more comfortable second we had in the very same interview a reference which gorbachev said we would never start a war unfortunately no one on the time magazine editorial board saw fit to say to him what about afghanistan where you are currently fighting a war what about czechoslovakia which you invaded in 1968 what about hungary which you invaded in 1956 what about the occupation of the army in poland instead they passed over it allowing a communist leader with a totally straight face to say to them we of course would never start a war i promise you that one has to wonder how naive you must think americans are if you can get away with that kind of baldfaced lie since he is in the middle of fighting a war in afghanistan the pattern of this offensive is very simple we know from a variety of works of which possibly john barrons books on the kgb are the best shevchenkos work on fleeing from moscow as a soviet senior official telling us the inside story is helpful and there have been a number of other studies we know from these works that the soviet government systematically and consistently goes after the penetration of western news media a recent novel the spike is another example of that its coauthor is arnaud de borchgrave the editor of the washington times a former srnior columnist for newsweek magasine as you study these books whether they are fiction or nonfiction you learn that the kgb the soviet secret police spends a great deal of money bribing some reporters influencing some editors establishing some academic centers setting up a framework of thought it is i think fair to say that not since adolf hitler manipulated the western news media in the late 1930s have we seen an offensive designed to convince manipulate and dupe western people as sophisticated as gorbachevs current offensive what then should the correct american answer be when the new york times prints an ad paid for by the soviet embassy as it did recently should we censor that ad i do not think so when gorbachev offers to be interviewed should we stop the interview i do not think so it would be helpful if the news men were a little more tough minded if they asked better questions if they were more aggressive in crossexamination but basically if we are going to be a free society we have to allow people who are going to lie to us to tell their lies out in the open and then we have to hope that our intellectuals our news media our politicians our citizens will pay attention and learn who is telling the truth and who is lying rather than talk about censorship i would like to suggest just the opposite we have an opportunity in the third week of october to lay out for the entire world to see who the communists are and what the system is rather than arguing with gorbachev as a person or discussing whether or not his wife dresses well it seems to me far more appropriate for us to look at the underlying question of the nature of the soviet system the nature of the communist government i think there is no better time to do that than the third week of october which is the second anniversary of the liberation of grenada i think it is important for two reasons first of all the liberation of grenada was the first time that a communist government was overthrown and people regained their freedom in that sense the experience of the grenadian people now free now with a free market now with a democracy now with a free press now with freedom of religion the lesson of grenada in ceasing to be communists offers hope to people all over the world it offers hope to the afghan freedom fighters it offers hope to the nicaraguan freedom fighters it offers hope to the angolan freedom fighters it offers hope to people in poland in the ukraine in estonia in latvia in lithuania and throughout the soviet union second in liberating grenada and saving some 800 american students from possibly becoming hostages we also captured 35 000 pounds of communist documents the records of the communist government the records of the communist party so we know a great deal about grenada unfortunately because the american intellectual community is largely leftwing because it does not want to learn about communism because it does not want to study the soviet union in reality very little has been done with those documents qnly a few books have been written of which the most notable was edited by romerstein and ledeen and published by the state department as the grenada documents in addition a book by paul seabury studies the grenada documents but when one looks at all of the leftwing intellectual effort to discredit el salvador the philippines south africa chile and then you look and ask how many ph d s rush down to the national archives to look at these documents how many people have been busily studying and trying to tell us what we can learn about communism and the grenada lesson the answer sadly is very few therefore i think it is very very important that we take the third week of october the week of october 25 and we focus america on looking at the lessons of grenada and asking ourselves what do they tell us about today what do we learn about communism in grenada that teaches us about gorbachev nothing could better prepare america for geneva than to study the real nature of communism and look at the real lessons of the grenada documents that is why i urge my colleagues to cosponsor house resolution 313 which congressman iks skelton of missouri and i have introduced as a bipartisan resolution it already has over 165 cosponsors and it is designed to make the week of october 25 a week in which high schools colleges sunday schools synagogue classes civic clubs veterans groups everyone who has an interest in understanding the world we live in and the nature of communism might look at the lessons of grenada that is why i would urge every citizen to look at their own civic clubs their own classes their own opportunities to study the lessons of grenada i think it helps to get the local news media to ask the question what have we learned about communism by getting editorial writers before they interview gorbachev to study the way in which lenin has practiced the art of lying to western news media to look at the lessons of disinformation and deception as practiced by the soviet union i think that helps all of us so i would urge all of my colleagues to cosponsor house joint resolution 313 and help us make the week of october 25 a week to learn the lessons of the grenada documents i would also urge every group around america that is interested in and concerned about communism or about the survival of freedom to take the opportunity that week to study the lessons of grenada i would urge those citizens whose congressmen have not yet cosponlored that resolution to contact their congressmen and ask them to cosponsor house joint resolution 313 in addition to handling propaganda as it relates to the soviet union i think it is also interesting to look at what has been happening around the world that the american news media does not cover very aggressively there is a tendency in the american news media if an american ally does something to put it on page 1 and if a s6viet puppet does something to either not print it at all or put it on page 30 therefore i have asked that we put together some major eveits and on a weekly basis on thursday i am going to try to link together differeit news stories you may ndt have seen im going to show how they relate to the war against freedom being waged by the soviet union and its communist empire here are some examples first the communists have been linked in nicaragua to 700 costa ricans training in cuba at least 700 costa ricans linked to leftist groups have received iilitary training in cuba with assistance from the communist sandinista government of nicaragua according to costa rican deputy minister johnny campos notice that this is not a citation from an american source this is the deputy security minister of costa rica he said in a recent interview in la nacion campos broached the magnitude of local and foreign espionage in his country he also stated that this training had been going on foi 4 years he divided the espionage activities into three groups which included the involvemeht of the ortegaled communist government of nicaragua the deputy minister described the situation as dangerous and he is very concerned about it an example of what has been happening around the world the communist terrorists in el salvador are changing their behavior according to radio venceremos the communists in el salvador have again bragged about their sabotage activities for example over the fourth of july weekend the communist guerrillas carried out important sabotage against power lines in this central area of the country these power outages affected san salvador and large parts of central el salvador the broadcast also went on to boast that on july 5 guerrilla units of the julio armando climaca detachment downed three high voltage power pylons in las gorritas canton san jorges jurisdiction san miguel department we continue with more activities to sabotage the war economy of duartes government sabotage is victory i think every american needs to look at that and ask themselves these are communist guerrillas they claim that they are for the people yet their strategy as they grow weaker and are unable to field a military unit is to engage in terror and in sabotage imagine the nature of a group which would say that sabotage is victory sabotage is destruction the breaking up of the economy the destroying of jobs the wiping out of civilized amenities then when american reporters go to a major city and the power goes out because the guerrillas have successfully sabotaged the power lines instead of reporting on guerrilla brutality on the senselessness of their campaign of their unwillingness to vote instead the reporter talks about how weak the government is let me suggest that if we had guer rillas trying to knock out power lines around washington we could appreciate better the challenge to president duarte not only his daughter kidnaped by terrorists but he is faced with a guerrillamovement which as it loses the main war against his army reverts more and moreto terrorist tactics and to guerrilla warfare to the south of nicaragua costa rica finds itself increasingly in difficulty for example costa rican president luis alberto monge has said definitely that there will be no dialog between costa rica and the communist regime of nicaragua because the communist regime has refused to apologize and give explanatioi for actions to costa rica concerning their aggressions directed against his government monge referred to three separateincidents in which nicaragua waged uriprovoked attacks over its border into costa rica the events at las crucitas on may 31 when two costa rican civil guardsmen died the july 3 incident in the same area when communist troops attacked the costa rican guardsmen who were trying to recover the body of one of the slain guardsmen and the july 26 incident at barra del colorado when three communist air force planes entered costa ricas airspace and dropped bombs the point i want to make here is that of all of the countries in central america costa rica is the most peaceful the most democratic the most open costa rica disbanded its army in the late 1940s it literally has no army anymore it has been observed by one expert on central america that costa rica is the greatest danger to nicaragua precisely because itis a democratic country with a free market and a free press that means that every possible younger nicaraguan will flee to costa rica just like in western europe we see people flee from east germany to west germany from czechoslovakia to austria from hungary to austria and so forth the point this expert had made was that as long as costa rica is alive as long as it is a free country as long as it is a better place to live than nicaragua it will be an active threat to the communist government of nicaragua precisely because it drains away people here we have the president of costa rica a country which does not even have an army reporting on three incidents in which the communist government of nicaragua entered costa rican territory the costa ricans are concerned in part because as they look to the north toward el salvador they have some sense of how a country can be torn to pieces by communist guerrillas communist guerrilla commander joaquin villalobos in a statement concerning the increased terrorists use of land mines and urban terrorism has threatened more violence on the people of el salvador our aim is to convert every road into a river of blood with mines each stone into a mine and every helicopter into a coffin villalobos said in a recent rebel radio broadcast the farabundo marti liberation froit the communist terriorist organization bent on destroying the democratically elected government of president duarte is increasing its activities due to decreased support in their insurgency efforts over the past year the subversives have planted a lot of mines in the last few months because they can no longer confront armyunits directly said maj omar vaquerano an infantry battalion commander the mines are a demonstration of the subversives weakness the increase in the effectiveness of the governments efforts against the communists activities has broken up the terrorists into small pockets of subversives taking much of their support base supplied by the masas the point i want to make is this here we have communists in el salvador saying that we are going to rely on sabotage i quoted earlier sabotage is victory they have said here we have them saying their aim is to convert fvery road into a river of blood with mines each stone into a mine and every helicopter into a coffin imagine you were living in democratic costa rica that you were looking up the road to el salvador that you saw that kind of bloody viscious anticivilian guerrilla warfare sabotage and terrorism going on you can appreciate why the costa rican government the most democratic most open and decent government in central america is increasingly angry with the nicaraguans because it sees in nicaragua a country which is supporting guerrilla warfare with communists in el salvador a country which is itself a communist dictatorship and costa rica sees an increasing willingness to launch raids against them president monge in an august 13 letter to daniel ortega the communist dictator of nicaragua said that costa rica was a peaceful people and blamed nicaraguas warmongering attitude for the border crisis let me emphasize this this is the president of costa rica the neighbor of nicaragua a democratic country which does not even have an army his 117462attitude toward the communist government of nicaragua he said it was a warmongering attitude this is not ronald reagan talking this is not some rightwing republican this is the democratically elected free president of costa rica he went on to say that we costa ricans are a peaceful people and have never attacked anyone the costa rican president stated that if there is no peace in nicaragua then his nation is affected by this however monge stated costa rica is not responsible for nicaraguas peace costa rica cannot achieve or impose peace in nicaragua in clear reference to the unprovoked border aggressions launched by the marxistleninist regime monge said thatthe various border incidents on costa ricas northern border specifically the painful incident at las cructas and the violation of our national airspace by your governments military forces can be protested as acts of aggression we will not tolerate and which if repeated will force us to defend ourselves we demand a satisfactory explanation because these incidents are the result of nicaraguas warmongering attitude and of the lack of peace in nicaragua which is an issue that your government cannot evade therefore steps toward peace both inside and outside nicaragua should be taken by your government monge said he also stated that he considered nicaraguas international propaganda aimed at tarnishing costa ricas real position in relation to the nicaraguan conflict unjust and illintentioned so again we have on august 13 the president of the democratic demilitarized free costa rica complaining saying to the nicaraguan communists to let us alone quit trying to provoke us yet what happened on august 25 a communist army patrol from nicaragua was spotted by civil guard units inside costa rican territory in the boca de san carlos region marking the third unprovoked border incident within a week against this democracy according to the panama city acan report from the northern region of costa rica the sandinist peoples army patrol fired at the civil guardsmen with their rifles and the civil guardsmen fired back area residents told reporters that apparently the communists had seized a farm but then abandoned it after the clash with the costa rican public forces public security minister benjamin piza carranza has explained that a police patrol discovered the communist group in costa rican territory and for this reason obeyed the order to fire at them costa rica has no standing army he said that the civil guard remains on alert in the border area which has been the site of recent unprovoked and illegal attacks launched by the marxistleninist regime this is the third incursion the communist forces have carried out on costa rican soil in 1 week according to official reports issued by the government of president luis alberto monge on august 22 five communist aircraft violated costa rican airspace and fired shots only 24 hours after the costa rican government denounced an attack by the nicaraguan communist forces on the boca de san carlos police post these events have been unfolding during the nicaraguan socalled peace dialog propaganda campaign in other words where the nicaraguans are publicly in interviews with american television talking to american church groups they pretend they favor peace there are three times in 1 week in late august that the nicaraguan communists violated costa rica and attacked costa rica in fact things have gotten bad enough that costa rican foreign minister carlos jose gutierrez said that the interamerican reciprocal treaty might be requested if unprovoked communist border attacks continue citing that regimes expansionist objectives as a possible cause for these incidents i think that if these aggressions continue we may resort to the tiar costa rica has not done so thus far because it believes the aggressions do not meit it gutierrez said in a telephone interview with radio cadena nacional nevertheless he noted that their frequency and constant repetition might lead costa rica to resort to a step of that nature gutierrez said that the communist attacks on costa rica could have various explanations among them that the communist regime may be trying to intimidate the costa rican people this could be one of the reasons he said he explained that perhaps the attacks seek to prevent costa ricans living in the border area from continuing to express support for the antisandinists second it might be that the attacks are the result of the arrogance of the sfndinist army which wants to show its military might to its neighbors gutierrez added we also think the attacks could be part of the expansionist objectives of the nicaraguan government which does not hide its aggressive intentions with regard to the countries that border nicaragua let me make this point for all of our friends who belong to church groups that say why can there not be peace in central america here he is the foreign minister of costa rica a country which is a democracy a country which is free a country which does not even have an army all it has is a border patrol and a civil police and now what is the foreign minister of costa rica saying he said that the government of nicaragua has and i quote expanionist objectives and does not hide its aggressive intentions with regard to the countries that border nicaragua in other words the foreign minister of costa rica is trying to say to all of the world you cannot deal with the communist government of nicaragua because it is trying to expand itself nicaragua is an enemy to its neighbors and it is supporting guerrilla war what do the people of costa rica think in a poll conducted by an affiliate of the international gallup organization it was found that 89 percent of the costa rican population consider the marxistleninist regime of nicaragua a threat to peace in the region the poll which was published in the san jose daily la nacion also found that 87 percent of the population have an unfavorable opinion of the communist government in addition 63 percent said that neutrality ought not to apply if nicaragua violated the costa rican sovereignty according to the results of the survey most costa ricans approve of the way president monge is handling the nicaraguan crisis but are displeased with the way the contadora group is resolving the problems between the two nations also 83 percent of the costa ricans polled said they were confident the united states would help defend costa rica if they were invaded on a similar subject oscar aguilar presidential candidate of the national union party has said that in view of the new communist attacks against costa rican territory which were confirmed by the costa rican government the country should break diplomatic ties with the marxistleninist regime if only temporarily his statement which was on san jose radio reloj on august 22 also explained that firmness does not mean aggression but that the country cannot continue to defend the national sovereignty with protest notes that no one pays attention to i think there are two messages here for americans first of all the next time someone says to you but why do you think the nicaraguan communists are dangerous ask them if 89 percent of the free people of costa rica are scared of their neighbor should that not worry you if the folks who are down there who are natives who are local and who speak spanish who have friends in nicaragua if 89 percent of them are scared of the communist next door should not that be a sign to us that maybe they know more than the local politician or your local reporter who once spent 2 days there on a trip second what would our friends on the left do to save costa rica if in fact the communists in nicaragua are violating costa rican sovereignty i have just indicated there were three times in 1 week in august that the nicaraguan communists were occupying part or acting on parts of costa rican territory what would we do are our neighbors in fact the costa ricans right when 83 percent of them say we would help them if they were attacked by communists or are they wrong i wonder i wonder in this house how many of our more leftwing members woyld in fact find some excuse for explaining away communist aggression some way of indicating that it was really caused by costa rica even though costa rica is unarmed has no army and could not attack anyone in fact the costa rican government is considering seriously breaking relations with nicaragua costa rican foreign minister carlos jose gutierrez has said that president monge and his administration has not ruled out a break in relations with nicaragua on various occasions and in view of repeated attacks and violations of the sandinist army we have been on the verge of breaking relations with nicaragua but the situation has always been reconsidered the foreign minister said government sources say that the possibility remains considering recent territorial violations and the air attack august 21 we now have to think of more drastic measures gutierrez said he went on to say the conditions for signing the peace document do not exist and added that the tension mentioned by mexican foreign secretary bernardo sepulveda is not the result of the position adopted by costa rica which is willing to sign the document if it includes all the aspects necessary to achieve peace it is not a matter of signing the peace document but of fulfilling all its provisions if this is not done the efforts would have been useless each country that signs the peace document must comply with its provisions it is not a matter of simply signing the document so as to form part of a group of countries that will subsequently not comply with it the foreign minister concluded i began tonight talking about the propaganda offensive of gorbachev and of the soviet union and that there is a parallel propaganda offensive by the nicaraguan communists one of the comforting systematic natures of communism that does not seem to change overi time you can count on it is that they can lie with a straight face they can tell you they are for law and order while picking your pocket so it is not at all uncommon for a communist government like nicaragua in a peace offensive have their president giving peace speeches while their army and air force are violating costa rican territory here we have the costa rican government telling us about the event again the costa ricans are worried in part because of nicaraguan communist direct activity and they are worried in part about what they see just up the road in el salvador as recently as late august we have seen examples of the kind of communist terrorism in el salvador which frightens the democratic disarmed country of costa rica according to an august 24 san salvador la prensa grafica report new acts of vandalism and terror have recently been carried out by subversive groups of the communist fmlnfdr terrorist insurgency organization on the highways to santa ana atiquizaya sesuntepeque tejutla usultan ilobasco and other places the terrorist groups attacked buses injuring at least 20 civilians in another unprovoked attack official reports say that on august 23 the communist extremists machinegunned a bus truck and pickup truck in deliclas de concepcion canton san juan according to the report several passengers were wounded and all were taken to hospitals in that capital and zacatecoluca as the communist subversives were preparing to set the vehicle on fire a military patrol arrived and the rebels immediately opened fire and fled from the army the communist terrorists organizations goal is to overthrow the democratically elected government and replace it with a marxistleninist regile similar to those currently in control in cuba and nicaragua now notice the style here now that the communist guerrillas in el salvador cannot stand up to the army what do they do they shoot the civilians they machinegun a bus they machinegun a pickup truck this is the kind of banditry which can break down a free society but which is very hard for us to fight where are our freinds on the left those who are upset because the cia mined nicaraguan harbors those who talked about atrocities from the right where is anyone from the left in this body standing up and saying it is wrong for communist guerrillas to shoot innocent civilians we have not heard a single person from the left in this house complaining about communist guerrillas yet we recognize that there are all sorts of terrorists from the left who are engaged throughout central america in trying to destroy proamerican and prowestern gov ernments there is one final point i would like to make tonight about events in central america and that is that there is some evidence that nicaragua is working in concert with drug trafficking there has been considerable evidence that cuba works with drug traffickers but there has been a recent report worth looking at in terms of the nicaraguan communists an agreement that allowed colombian coccaine lords to process and ship narcotics through nicaragua was described july 31 by a pilot working undercover for unitedstates authorities adler barryman seal described an april 8 1984 meeting at the colombian mountaintop home of jorge ochoa attended by several members of the ochoa smuggling cartel they had struck a deal with some lofficials in the sandinista government in nicaragua seal said were not communists we dont agree with their philosophy but they serve our means and we serve theirsthen they made gestures indicating money seal 45 said he was initially worried about being arrested if he landed in a plane full of cocaine in a communist country but he said he was assured that there would be no problems with nicaraguan officials united states authorities concluded that the operation had at least the tacit approval of highlevel sandinista officials the point that i think really ties together drug trade terrorism the propaganda offensive and nicaraguas attacks on its neighbors in costa rica is that from a communist standpoint all of this fits together gorbachev as a communist leader sees the united states as the enemy the soviet union and its marxistleninist leaders are very open in saying that we are the enemy anyone who has studied the grenada documents can find the thencommunist leader of grenada maurice bishop saying in a secret speech of course we are communists of course this is a dictatorship of course we are against the americans but if we told them the truth then they will know what we are doing sowe are goingoto lie to them it is amazing since 1917 we have had an opportunity to study what lenin wrote in creating the soviet state to study how stalin behaved as a dictator or to look at what now is almost 70 years of systematic warfare against the west it is remarkable to see them spy against us to have americans who are arrested as spies to see west germans who turn out to be spies to recognize that the british are expelling spies right this very day to see that all over the world gorbachev is involved in country after country in systematically spying to try to undermine the west similarly we see as we look around the world a communist offensive there are russian troops in afghanistan killing free afghans this evening as i speak there are cuban troops in ethiopia in angola in mozambique killing people who want to be free there is a communist government in nicaragua trying to impose a dictatorship on its people there is a communist army from vietnam in cambodia trying to impose a communist government on its people there is a communist army holding down the people of poland in the middle of all this gorbachev appears on the cover of time magasine and explains that he is really a nice guy who is just misunderstood in the middle of all this we have a socalled peace offensive sometimes you have to ask yourself how naive is the american and european news media how naive are our intellectual elite how easy it seems to be for the communists almost by the flick of a wrist to change and say oh please forget everything we are doing in afghanistan ignore the people we are killing the men women and children who are being butchered the villages that are being bombed the atrocities that are being committed we really mean well please ignore the spies that you are uncovering in your country that we send there we really mean well why dont you come to geneva and just talk to us in a pleasant way i believe the president should go to geneva i agree with winston churchill who once said jaw jaw jaw is better than war war war still we should recognize what is going on neville chamberlain went to munich in 1938 thinking if you could appease a dictator somehow things would get better neville chamberlain might have given up radar in order to make adolph hitler happy and the british would have lost the battle of london the president has the 21st century equivalent of radar the strategic defense initiative it is vitally important that all of us in america and in europe and in japan and all of the free countries recognize who is going to geneva on the one side there is a communist empire there is a man whose armies are currently trying to conquer afghanistan there is a man who is spying against all of us who is supporting terrorism and who represents the dark forces of the secret police the gulag archipelago and the concentration camps of political prisoners that is gorbachev we should recognize that we should remember it and we should go to those negotiations starting with a question since this is a man who will lie with a straight face who will quote god even though he is an atheistic communist who would tell us he would never start a war even whole he has 120 000 troops fighting in afghanistan let us be clear what is happening it is vitally important the american president talk with the communist leader it is equally important that the american president not try to appease the communist leader if we can reach reasonable agreements that are enforceable that is worth doing i hope that on the week of october 25 we will study the lessons of the grenada documents and we will celebrate for free people everywhere and people who would like to be free everywhere the fact that for the first time a communist nation has become free again as we look at the lessons of that second anniversary it is my hope that across america and through the unitedstates information agency across the world the people who are free will be able to look once again at the lessons of communism and the nature of communism and what really was happening in grenada and that that will give us a much more sober a much more realistic a much more reasonable balance as we move toward geneva it is vitally important that geneva occur but it is equally important that geneva not become another munich while ronald reagan is a churchillian figure a man of great resolution a man who understands communism a man who as a former labor union president knows how to negotiate it is very important that he not have neville chamberlains style news media neville chamberlains style elite neville chamberlains style advisers neville chamberlains pressure from his own public to make unwise concessions by asking your congressman to cosponsor house joint resolution 313 to help us look at the lessons of the grenada documents by asking your civic club your sunday school or your synagogue group your high school or college class to take time that week to look at the lessons of grenada i think it is possible to educate ourselves and i think that in the long run an educated free people will survive despite the threats of dictatorship and that we can achieve peace through knowledge and through information i thank the speaker"], [0.0019251108169555664, 0.9980748891830444, 1, "i ask unanimous consent that the commit national independent tee on post office and civil

publication of the state department of september 1984 this rather heavy blue book which has several hundred pages of documents from the government of grenada and the communist party of grenada represents the first time we have ever captured the entire basic bureaucracy of a communist party and a communist government and it has in it a number of very specific lessons that i think the people of the united states need to look at it was very striking this morning when paul harvey said that in politics president reagans popularity rating as measured by the gallup pollsters shows that 60 percent think he is doing a good job but only 20 percent are with him on nicaragua at the same time when you look here in the house and you listen to wellreasoned and wellintentioned members of congress who do not agree with the president on nicaragua you have to ask yourself why is there such a vast difference between the presidents general approval and general understanding in this one area is it a situation where he is wrong or is it a situation where he may be well informed but for some reason in a very unreaganlike manner has not been able to articulate clearly what is going on i suggest that we are in the last stages in which american foreign policy partially because of vietnam and partially because of the mccarthyism period in the 1950s has seen a very powerful segment of the american nation with an ostrichlike view of what is happening in the world that is very important very intelligent people were committed to a belief about the way the world worked that is simply wrong but to which they were also very deeply committed not to learn about almost if you will ostriches who first hide their heads in the sand in reality and then have amnesia when in fact lessons are developed there can be a lot of arguments about past american relationships with communist states but i think in this case we are looking at the case of grenada and what it teaches us about another western hemisphere communist government that of nicaragua as a former history teacher i hope that every member of the house will first of all get a copy of the grenada documents it is available from the state department i hope that every library in america will someday have a copy of this volume in addition i hope they will look at one particular speech from the grenada documents and compare it with one speech by a nicaraguan communist commandante baryardo arce a secret speech which was given in 1984 now arces speech is available in a small document from the state department as is the original copy of maurice bishops secret speech both have been published both are available to the public to libraries and to members of congress maurice bishop was chairman of the central committee and on monday september 13 1982 he talked to the grenadian communist party the speech was called the line of march for the party a speech presented by comrade maurice bishop chairman of the central committee it is a fascinating document it basically walks through step by step what the grenadian communist party was attempting to do it is a 49pagelong speech and obviously even in a 1hour special order i am not going to be able to put the whole speech in furthermore large parts of the speech relate to the local situation at that time in grenada but what is important is to recognize that maurice bishop in speaking secretly was clearly a communist thought of himself as a communist and thought of himself as leading a communist party let me give you some examples he said on page 7 it requires a serious marxistleninist vanguard party leading guiding and directing the whole process he goes on to say on page 8 obviously if we are speaking of building socialism and we are then it is clear that our objective as marxistleninists must be in the first instance to construct socialism as rapidly and as scientifically as possible again on pages 14 and 15 he goes on to say that it is only under the leadership of the working class led by a marxistleninist vanguard party now americans listening to this might ask what does all this stuff mean why all these terms like marxistleninist and vanguard party the important thing for americans to understand is that lenin the founder of the bolshevik party which now dominates the soviet union was an intellectual he used words for very deliberate reasons he created the concept of a vanguard party to justify the dictatorship in which the communists control the country let me quote again from maurice bishop in grenada on page 15 he said the essence of that political aspect is the dictatorship of the working people the dictatorship of rule of the working people that is the essence now in the soviet communist jargon a dictatorship of the working people in fact becomes a secret police state a state in which the secret police dominates everybody else and in which you can go to jail without any recourse to law and in which there are no elections i will come back to that but i want to emphasize that clearly when you read the grenada documents when you look at this volume of documents which were captured when we liberated the island of grenada that the communist government of grenada was committed to becoming a dictatorship in which a secret policy would dominate let me carry this a stage further in maurice bishops secret speech why bishop asks in effect why if we are going to be communist do we have to have all these other people participate in government this is what he said and i think this applies absolutely directly to nicaragua and the nicaraguan experience from page 17 within the first few hours of taking power we tried to build an alliance and we began to build that alliance for two main reasons first to hold on to power in the first few seconds minutes hours days and weeks and the second reason was to defeat imperialism in the months and years thereafter because defeating imperialism is a complex process that requires a political orientation in other words in the classic manner suggested by lenin when the grenadian communists took power they deliberately set up a common front allowed a few businessmen to participate so that the americans would think that it really was not a comunist dictatorship what was happening in fact behind the scenes all this applies very directly to nicaragua where there is today a communist dictatorship which is systematically lying to the united states and lying to the american people what did maurice bishop say in his secret speech to the grenadian communists he said on page 17 again it was the party and the party alone that took power let me repeat that it was the party and the party alone that took power he goes on to say there was no alliance with any upper petty bourgeoisie or any national bourgeoisie on seizing power he goes on to say we took power on its own but njm that is the communist party of grenada then decided correctly that an alliance was needed to hold power in other words the only reason they are allowing anybody but communists into the government in the beginning stages is to deceive the united states so that they could lie to the americans and say oh we really arent just communists we have a lot of people in this popular government but let us go on again to say what does maurice bishop the communist leader of grenada say in this period on page 18 it is very significant comrades that from the start from the very first second of the grenada revolution let us say 4 30 on march 13 1979 from the very first second of the grenada revolution what was established was a dictatorship of the entire working people in its operationalization in its initial concretetisation it took the form of the antigairy poor and working people in other words those people who were oliposed to gairy were the ones who appeared to be in the vanguard and that is true they were in the vanguard but right from the start the effective dictatorship was not only of the antigairy working people it was a dictatorship of the entire working people now what is that saying in communist doctrine bishop is saying that from the very second they seized power they were determined to establish a communist secret police dictatorship what is the parallel in nicaragua the fact is that the fsln the nicaraguan communist party from the very day it seized power was dedicated to establishing a communist dictatorship in nicaragua let me carry on because it is very important to recognize how they did that when he talks about setting up the alliance this is how bishop explains the grenadian communists setting up an alliance from his secret speech on page 19 this was done deliberately so that imperialism wont get too excited and would sayp well they have some nice fellows in that thing everything all right and as a result wouldnt think about sending in troops in other words the grenadian communists guided by the soviets and the cubans deliberately set up a phony front in order to kid the americans so that the americans at that time under jimmy carter would say oh gosh and let me quote what he said this is bishop describing the united states well they have some nice fellows in that thing everything all right in other words the grenadian communists were confident based on their cuban and soviet advice that we as a country we americans are so gullible so naive so eager to be taken in that as long as they had a handful of people at the front of the government they could fool us as to the real nature of their government again this is not some conservative analyst this is the actual secret speech which we captured of the communist dictator explaining to the communist members of his party in a secret meeting what they were doing and you can apply it directly to nicaragua all of the nice naive church groups that come in talking about the sandinistas they are talking about communists all the people who go down there and are given a sincere show where they will walk around and they are shown only the people the dictatorship wants them to see they are shown only the situation the dictatorship wants them to have once again the ability of the american left to become an ostrich the ability of the american left to hide from reality is being counted on by the communists as the best way of insuring that they can establish a military dictatorship of communist style with secret police in nicaragua now why did they do this well bishop goes on to say that the reason they put up a phony front was because they knew if they were openly communist they would be deposed here is what he says from page 19 of the secret speech that was the mistake for example the comrades in gambia made a few months ago remember the gambia coup detat a few months ago what was the first thing those comrades did they say we are marxistleninists and we have just had a marxistleninist revolution and we go wipe out the bourgeoisie the same day they overthrew them the same day they did not even give them three days so fortunately njm had a little more sense than that and like i said comrades the first 14 names were bourgeoisie big capitalists petty bourgeoisie middle capitalists peasantry and professional middle strata that is who made up the peoples revolutionary government it is only after about a week and a half if i recall correctly when we held the party general meeting in radio free grenadas studio and some comrades here would have been present at that meeting that we finally got around to pooling some more party comrades you all remember that meeting down in radio free grenadas studio it was then we chose nine more comrades to make up the 23 but the first set of names were lyden pam buxo norris bain lloyd noel and so on that is what i mean by saying that the alliance began from the first few hours from the first few days that alliance was and is extremely important from our point of view comrades why do we need the alliance we need the alliance firstly as we pointed out already to hold power in the first few days and weeks we need the alliance secondly to consolidate and build the revolution and to insure the defeat of imperialism this time we cant do this effectively without the alliance now what is the communist leader of grenada saying on these two pages of his secret speech he is saying that they form a phony alliance to deceive the united states in order to buy time to consolidate their power to establish a secret police state this is exactly the pattern used by castro in 1959 and 1960 it is exactly the pattern being used today in nicaragua and it is exactly the pattern which was described by lenin in the 1920s let me go on to say that there is absolute contempt for the west for the left for the united states on the part of communists listen to maurice bishop again secretly telling his own comrades how they are setting up a communist dictatorship on page 23 part of the reason we can form the alliance with them is because of their own low level of class consciousness therefore they dont really fully understand what it is we are doing it comes over in a million things they say from time to time they are not really sure they are still hoping that what we are building is not socialist but as one of them puts it socialistcapitalism or capitalistsocialism whatever that means so there is that area of confusion but comrades a few more words in the nature of the alliance that we have with these sections first of all it is important to us to understand that the alliance we have gives full total complete control to the party and the working people the party and the working people have hegemony a monopoly will mean total power hegemony will mean total control and that is the distinction we are drawing between hegemony and monopoly but there is absolutely no doubt that we have a hegemonic control on power and over all the capital areas of the state in other words what the communist dictator of grenada was saying is we can lie to the businessmen because they are so gullible and so foolish they will accept our lies but the fact is that the communists have absolute control in fact he goes on to quote on page 23 if you look at the party and the cabinet and you analyze them carefully you will discover an over90percent control by the party of the ruling council in other words behind the phony front set up to deceive the americans the communists in grenada controlled 90 percent of what was going on let us apply that to nicaragua the fact is that in nicaragua the communist party has established a communist dictatorship and is lying to us just as cheerfully as the communists did in grenada h 1950 he goes on to say to reassure his friends about the dictatorship they are establishing look at the composition of our army and militia we dont have any upper or petit bourgeoise or bourgeoise in our army or militia when you look at the officers in the army it is working class comrades or petitbourgeoise revolutionary democrats or communists who are the officers in the army thats the situation in our army thirdly comrades consider our zonal councils and workers councils and so on the bourgeoise is not invited deliberately and consciously so they dont have the opportunity to come and try to confuse people inside the councils when were having a zonal council in this building or workers parish council we send out the invitations we decide who we want to invite and we leave the bourgeoise out deliberately and consciously in other words the communists in grenada deliberately set up a system where the average person on the surface could think that there was an open government but every method of controls the army the militia the government the neighborhood councils were totally controlled by communists in a deliberate and systematic manner he goes on to say there is no doubt about it what we have is hegemony we have full control now for people who talk about legality and they tell us about how concerned they are about american legality and they tell us all their concerns for nicaragua listen to what the communist dictator of grenada said about the law just consider comrades how laws are made in this country laws are made in this country when cabinet agrees and when i sign a document on behalf of cabinet and then that is what everybody in the country like it or dont like it has to follow or consider how people get detained in this country we dont go and call for no votes you get detained when i sign an order after discussing it with the national security committee of the party or with a higher party body once i sign it like it or dont like it its up the hill for them up the hill was a reference to where the prison was on top of a hill what is in this secret document from grenada what is the communist dictator saying about how they operate it is very simple they have a small secret committee of communist members who decide who to arrest when to arrest them where to send them and what happens to them and as he says and it is a wonderful line we dont go and call for no votes you get detained when i sign an order in other words when we say how free is nicaragua it is about as free as the grenadian communist dictatorship it is about as free as cuba it is about as free as the soviet union why do american tourists get this impression of a free country because the communists deliberately set up a sort of a disneyland they designed an artificial world in which to fool the americans and

also means that there are approximately 216 members who did not vote today and when those members come back tomorrow and ask why was there a vote on monday a pro forma day i hope the chair will advise them that it is because on the republican side of the aisle there is very grave concern about the fact that mr mcintyre who has now won both an election and a recount has not yet been seated and the people of indiana of the eighth district as i mentioned in my 1minute speech earlier are being denied the kind of personal representation which is so necessary if the house in fact is to serve its purpose of representing the american people let me first read the editorial involved in the wall street journal monday february 25 on page 28 entitled trashing hoosier voters trashing hoosier voters democrats in the house have gone into the business of declaring federal election irrelevant early this month all but five members of the democrat majority voted to further delay the seating of republican richard mcintyre winner by a narrow margin last november in the eighth district of indiana the latest ballot set up a task force tolook into the election which was lost by oneterm democrat frank mccloskey the democrats dont expect to finish their report until late april that means that for four months a halfmillion americans will have no representation in the house of representatives the bare facts of the dispute are that mr mcintyre was certified as the elections winner by 34 votes mr mccloskey challenged that victory and after a recount mr mcintyres lead increased to more than 400 votes the house majority refuses to recognize the results mr mcintyre has filed suit in federal court to be seated while the investigation proceeds the democrats decision to temporarily disenfranchise such a significant number of citizens is largely without precedent it also has practical consequences indianas eighth district has many farmers whose affairs are a central issue in washington now whatever his or her politics a member of congress is their surrogate to public and private deliberations that may affect them directly so whats the point speaking from the high ground the democrats have said in a motion to have the mcintyre suit dismissed that they are merely acting in accordance with the constitutional provision that each house shall be the judge of its members elections speaking from more familiar lower ground the house democrats say theyve got problems with the varying counting standards used in the districts counties it now appears that the house democrats will send some staff aides out to show indianians how to count votes that ought to put the national democratic party in tight with the states elected officials the constitutional provision cited by the democrats sounds impressive but the supreme court had a pass at this issue in 1969 and was not impressed the house had tried to prevent the seating of the flamboyant and controversial harlem democrat adam clayton powell jr who was perennially reelected by this constitutents the court said the house members had the right to kick mr powell out of congress but until that formal action was taken they did not have the right to deny a seat to an elected representative mr mcintryre concedes the house may work its will with his election but he has his election certificate and he wants that seat right now there is a broader issue house republicans and democrats also have conducted a bitter fight over committee assignments the republicans argued persuasively that the democats packed many standing committees with an unfairly large number of their own members from all appearances the democrats fared so badly at the polls last fall that their house leadership is taking any advantage that rolls into this room but refusing to seat an elected republican or packing committees really looks like doginthemanager behavior on the senate side holding ed meeses confirmation hostage while demanding a larger farm bailout was another telling example of this instinct congressional politics can be rough but all the members know well enough when the game is being played outside the rules the wheel could turn eventually and it would only take a handful of republicans to make sure that some future democrats get badly trashed its possible especially in the insular world of the capital to dismiss all this as mere partisanship but we wonder whether the electorate shares that view today voters do not take it kindly when their choices are ignored they cast votes to have their public affairs conducted in a responsible manner what they are now getting isan increasingly disabling pettiness on capitol hill this is the wall street jouinal probably the most widely read single newspaper in america certainly the most widely distributed a publication which in this case is simply saying look rick mcintyre won he won with 34 votes on election night he won on 415 votes on the recount he is clearly the winner indiana law is satisfied the secretary of state of indiana has certified that he won and he ought to be seated the wall street journal made the point that has practical consequences as it refers to the eighth district of indiana farmers let me point out to the members of this house that if we do take up an emergency farm bill later on this week that the farmers of indianas eighth district will have no voice and have no vote if we are going to be truly compassionate and concerned there is something wrong with the way we are going about this if the election task force which itself is biased 2 to 1 in favor or the democrats but if the election task force wants to go ahead and finish its work and report back if at a later date it decides that the election was not won by mr mcintyre then he can be asked to step aside in a new hampshire case in 193738 it took a year and a half to make that decision one gentleman served during that period when the house committee finally responded he stepped aside and the other gentleman was seated but to have no representation now as we end february to have gone through all of january with no representative for the eighth district of indiana to go through all of february with no representation for the eighth district of indiana is basically fundamentally wrong and there is no constitutional case or precedent for doing it the only case ever cited is a 1961 case which was rather peculiar in which both members of congress happened to have certificates in this case there is only one certificate there is only one winner the secretary of state in the state of indiana has said who they thought won and that person should be seated until proven otherwise i have a second editorial written by dick williams in the atlanta journalconstitution the sunday paper which is the largest paper in my state and covers my district he says some rather strong things that i may need to ask for the chairs advice and the parliamentarians advice in one or two places in here because there is some strong language i am not totally certain it is appropriate but i am not exactly certain how i should enter this material into the record so i may ask the chairs advice mr williams column appeared in yesterdays atlanta journalconstitution and was entitled oneill and his lemmings steal from the people it is datelined washington it reads theres a dirty little secret here that shouldnt stay so secret its about the rape of an entire congressional district the arrogance of power and the very theft of democracy congress is in session march approaches and yet the people of the 8th congressional district of indiana have no representative the clerk of the house presides over the congressional office what we have here is a clear case of right and wrong with right being trampled on by house speaker tip oneill and his lemmings in political terms the democrats saw a chance to steal a house seat and so far neither law precedent nor the wishes of the people and officials of indiana are being heard in brief republican richard mcintyre defeated incumbint frank mccloskey in november by 34 votes of some 228 000 cast three months later a final recount showed mcintyre increasing his lead to 415 votes whats important is that mcintyre came to washington in january with the certificate of election from indiana officials that certification always outweighs other controversy in these kinds of cases yet twice the house has voted to deny mcintyre the seat while it investigates lawsuits are flying including the obvious one back home in indiana that contends citizens are being denied representation the technicalities aside the case is interesting for what it says about the congress the votes on the mcintyre matter went right along party lines in the second vote only five democrats dared abandon oneill and the leadership georgias democrats went right along with the herd in defiance of basic

ask that the spring of next year or late winter in february and march when this house will again turn its attention as will the other body to the foreign policy of our country and what we will do following up on the presidents state of the union message on helping freedom fighter groups across the countries and reminding him of the appreciation by many members of this house that he brought up the freedom fighter movements in at least 5 countries around the world to mr gorbachev at the summit talks in geneva last month and so reported to this great legislative body on the evening of november 21 when we and the other body met in joint session to see a president return to us without any signs of wear and tear from the nonending meetings in geneva the clamor of a very large aggressive and interested world press corps and the long jet flights that brought the president from switzerland back to his united states president reagan told me tuesday that he would appreciate meeting with members of his own party with long discussions on which direction to take in this house and that he would also like to meet with members of the majority party in this house the minority party in the other body on how we can come to some sort of bipartisan agreement on the extent and the type of aid to fighters some of them as i discussed with the president very young in years people that we could describe as boys and girls in their midteens who are willing to die to offer their lives in the struggle for freedom in their countries and i told the president that i had right here in north america on the border of nicaragua in very roughhewn infirmaries in no way could they be called hospitals talked to freedom fighters young men and young women who were healing from wounds received in battle with the forces of the communist government of managua and told them through simultaneous translation that although we had lost the vote on april 24 to give these very young fighters in those infirmaries humanitarian aid boots uniforms hospital care medical care and food that we would return for another vote in this house and attempt to turn that negative vote of april 24 around i was not so sure as i stood there with congressman vin weber at my side also assuring them we would try and win that fight for them here in the house without any threat to our lives i was not so sure we would be able to follow through on our promises to them i told the president that when i mentioned his name this is last tuesday i told the president that when i mentioned the name of president ronald reagan to them that he wanted to help them that some of them began to cry the tears rolled down the faces of these combathardened young freedom fighters and when i told the president that he was visibly moved i have no witness to verify that because i was alone in the oval office with the president but i give you my word of honor he is well aware that these young people fighting in the hills of nicaragua laying their lives down and for all i know some of those very people that i discussed with the president and his intentions to help them in may died in some of the major offenses against them by daniel ortegas forces out of managua flying that massive effective hindd sovietmade helicopter piloted by cuban officers maybe some of those very people i spoke to in may died in some of the assaults around esteli in the month of august while we were all in our districts during our summer break and i told the president that we had promised them we would go back and turn the vote around and we did on june 10 in july there was even a more stunning vote in this house where we won by even a bigger margin those of us who want to help freedom fighters that was when we removed the infamous clark amendments named after a united states senator long since defeated that we would remove this last carryover from what i call the vietnam syndrome that lasted almost 10 years that the united states no longer had a role of leadership in the world except possibly to try and help people from starving even if that starvation was caused by communist governments such as the one in addis ababa ethiopia that we had no role anywhere in the world to help freedom fighters and that vote in july that took away the clark amendment that although the clark amendment applied specifically to angola had thrown a cloud over afghanistan cambodia laosand ihave been meeting recently with laotian freedom fighters i met recently in the last few weeks with people who would still like to see a return to some form of freedom in south vietnam in mozambique in the northern provinces of ethiopia in these eight countries around the world we have no role at all to help people because of the vietnam syndrome although in the last decade we have seen ac change where the insurgent groups around the world are not flying red flags and using russian kaloshnikov assault rifles unless they have been taken from communist governments but now except for the insurgency in the philippines and the one we do not hear about too much any longer in el salvador because president duarte has won several elections down there and the forces of freedom are winning now we see insurgencies around the globe in the 8 aforementioned countries where the freedom fighters are aligning themselves with liberty and democratic pluralistic systems and the expansionism of the soviet union and their puppet mercenaries from cuba are on the defensive so i would like to discuss with angola which along with nicaragua will be part of what the president will propose to this body in late winter early spring february march april some of the myths that surround angola and the communist government in luanda myth 1 is that the cubans are in angola to protect the angolan people from the oppressive south african government the fact is the cuban forces are in angola to protect the communist government in luanda from the angolan poeple there is no threat of invasion into angola from south africa from south africanadministrated namibia and the communists know it well it is evident by the deployment of the sovietequipped cuban troops they are not deployed along the southern angolan border near namibia or south africa they are deployed in the north around the city of luanda and the cubans are also in the north in the oilrich enclave of cabinda which although separated by some land is north of the northern border of angola the cubans in the past have desperately avoided all conflict with the south african forces but they actively participate in every military action they can against the true representatives of freedom and the people of angola jonas savimbis forces also castro intervened in angola long before the south african forces came to the support of savimbi within the country south african military forces have entered angola primarily because the communist government has allowed the swapo organization south west african peoples organization a communist front group to use angola as a sanctuary to carry out terrorist acts against namibia which for good or bad has been administered by south africa since the german governments were removed after world war ii myth no 2 that unitedstates aid will only make the communists in angola more dependent upon the soviet union and cuba the fact is that it is hard to imagine how the angolans could become any more dependent on the soviets and their satraps than they already are we have done nothing to help the democratic resistance in angola for over 10 years since the senator clark amendment was enacted into law yet the soviet and the cuban presence without any external threat has continued to grow there are now more than 35 000 cuban forces inside this large and embattled african nation soviet commanders are now directing battles while cuban pilots just as they do in nicaragua fly that large effective and dreaded hindd helicopter the helicopters and the mig21s flown against the angolan people are flown by cuban pilots north american people killing blacks in the name of communism president reagan has publicly announced that he favors aiding jonas savimbis anticommunist forces and there is strong congressional support for renewing aid to unita but the blame america first crowd in determined to prevent the united states from helping angolan freedom fighters these myopic fear merchants are spreading myths designed to counteract conservative actions and reintroduce the worst effects of the vietnam syndrome myth 1 the cubans are in angola to protect the angolan people from the south africans the fact is that the cuban forces are in angola to protect the communist government from the angolan people there is no threat of invasion of angola from south african administered southwest africa namibia and the communists know it it is evident by the deployment of sovietequipped cuban forces they are not deployed along the southern angolan border where they would be if there was any fear of invasion the cubans are in the north around the capital city of luanda and in the the oil rich cabinda enclave north of angola proper the cubans in the past have avoided clashes with south africa but they actively participate in military action against the true representatives of the angolan people savimbis forces also castro intervened in angola long before south african forces came to the support of savimbi within the country south african military forces have entered angola primarily because the communist government has allowed the south west african peoples organization to use angola as sanctuary to carry out terrorist acts against southwest africa namibia myth 2 unitedstates aid will only make the communists in angola more dependent on the soviet union and cuba the fact is that it is hard to imagine how the angolans could become any more dependent on the soviets and their satraps we have done nothing to help the democratic resistance in angola for over 10 years yet the soviet and cuban presence has continued to grow there are more than 35 000 cuban forces inside that embattled nation soviet commanders are now directing battles while cubans pilot the soviet hind helicopters and mig fighters flying against the angolan people while united statesowned gulf chevron oil has created more than 60 percent of the hard currency that pays for communist control of angola the soviet union has taken about 2 billion of these petro dollars for military equipment support the soviet union has given precious little in economic aid and what little they did give is certainly not free myth 3 support for unita is support for apartheid the fact is south african support for unita like that of other african nations stems from a common goalriding africa of the scourge of soviet hegemony and of the economic stagnation that always accompanies communism no one of conscience supports the machinations of apartheid but why curse the angolan people with a system that keeps them apart from freedom reform within south africa is far too slow but will come to a stop if communism overwhelms savimbi and takes over in all of angola it is the height of hypocrisy for liberals to denigrate south africas relationships with its neighbors not only do a number of black african nations support unita and find no conflict but even the socalled front line states recognize and accept south africas economic leadership in the region myth 4 savimbi is a marxist the fact is savimbi is not a marxist savimbi stands for negotiated settlement and pluralism the unification of his country and the elimination of all foreign troops from angola it is true that prior to 1975 savimbi did receive chinese support from mao and advocated a socialist program along chinese lines but even john stockwell the former cia angolan task force officer and now unfortunately is an ardent opponent of unitedstates involvement anywhere because of frustration over weak policies stated savimbi was neither a marxist nor capitalist but an angolan patriot what is most interesting about this myth is the people who support it have made careers of endorsing or supporting marxist governments elsewhere all of a sudden these dedicated liberals are now concerned that president savimbis political philosophy may be

present the congressional black caucus alternative budget this marks the fifth year the caucus has produced an alternative budget in light of recent events it is clear this alternative is needed in developing our alternative budget the caucus sought to be fair and equitable to all americans not just the politically and economically powerful historically the cbc alternative budget has been called the constructive alternative budget this year a more appropriate title is the compassionate alternative budget in putting our budget package together we have sought to preserve or restore our national commitment to fair treatment for urban and rural america the elderly students small business men and women middleincome wage earners and the economically disadvantaged massive deficits in our national budget appear to be the order of the day the congressional black caucus decries these massive deficits and proposes a budget that significantly reduces the effect of the admihistrations unprecedented peacetime military buildup the deficit reductions proposed by the other body the house budget committee and the congressional black caucus are approximately 172 billion for fiscal year 1986 however the cbc proposal significantly reduces the deficit to 125 19 billion and 73 8 billion in fiscal years 1987 and 1988 respectively this results in a lower deficit than either the other bodys or house budget committee proposals the major factor contributing to the expansive national debt is our unbridled defense spending the basic concept of the cbc budget is freeze minus rather than continue along the upwardly spiraling path of increased expenditures for unnecessary nuclear armaments we limit outlay in 1986 to 261 5 billion although we increase funding for new procurement by 63 7 billion we realize budget authority savings of 286 billion and 172 billion in outlays for the next 3 years some of these savings are realized by eliminating new procurement of the mx trident ii pershing ii and cruise missiles our opposition to these weapons reflects our opposition to the nuclear arms race much of the responsibility for our current deficits rests with our inequitable tax policies many of which will only be exacerbated by proposed administration policy corporations and highincome wage earners should pay their fair share our budget squarely places an equitable tax burden on corporations

similar clear incident with the trip of ortega to moscow a number of ostriches were shocked that the morning after this house defeated an effort to help the freedom fighters a month ago the following morning ortega announced as a communist in nicaragua he would visit his fellow communists in the soviet union now what was interesting to those of us who have been following the nicaraguan communists was that that was his seventh trip to the soviet union ortega visited moscow in april of 1980 in may of 1982 in november of 1982 in march of 1983 in february of 1984 in march of 1985 and in may of 1985 yet suddenly people were shocked but i am not so sure i fully blame ostriches in this house for being shocked if in fact the americin state department cannot get its act together and explain what it is doing if the american state department cannot use the word communist to describe cuba or the soviet union or nicaragua then probably the american state department was not briefing anybody up here on the communist network that was propping up a communist dictatorship and the american state department probably was not briefing the news media the american state department probably was not coordinating academic research into communism and there is little wonder that a foreign service which cannot bring itself to follow its presidents directives and within 2 weeks of his saying publicly

people of indiana and rick mcintyre who won election in indiana and the problem we have in getting the people of indiana adequate representation in the congress and the very grave danger to this congressional system from the policies which have been followed by the democratic leadership in not seating mr mcintyre the case is very simple on election night mr mcintyre won the election in indiana because of a mathematical error in counting the precincts twice by a democratic judge in one particular county for a brief period of time it appeared that the democratic incumbent mr mccloskey had won but in fact there was a mathematical error which was discovered and when the votes were counted accurately the secretary of state of indiana concluded that mr mcintyre had won by 34 votesa narrow victory but nonetheless a victory the secretary of state of indiana certjfied that mr mcintyre had won and sent the certificate to the house of representatives and on the day this congress was convened the clerk of the house reported that mr mcintyre had won and indeed on the vote for speaker mr mcintyre voted only after the vote for speaker did the democratic leadership move to stop mr mcintyre and to force him to stand to one side this is an unprecedent step there were claims that there was confusion that the 34 votes were too narrow and that in fact there had to be a recount interestingly the democratic incum bent who had been defeated mr mccloskey did not file under the federal elections act and did not seek to make a case and in fact behaved as though he had been defeated but here on the house floor the democratic leadership decided to do something which constitutionally is unprecedented to stop the people of indiana from having their representative even though the secretary of state of indiana had certified that he had won a recount was underway so without doing more than protesting with our votes and speaking out we stood to one side for approximately 1 month and when the recount was over under indiana law in 15 counties following the procedures of indiana law with democrats in a majority of the recount situations being in charge because they have local conatrol not only did mr mcintyre win the recount but he won by a larger margin that is he went from 34 votes ahead of mr mccloskey the democrat who had been defeated to 418 votes ahead of mr mccloskey the democrat who had been defeated once the recount was done it was clear there were no mathematical errors they had carefully and scrupulously followed indiana law they had taken the steps necessary to prevent cheating and they had taken the steps necessary to prevent the voting of ballots which may have been cast by fraud they had done precisely what indiana requires and at that point mr mcintyres margin had gone up to 418 votes and yet on the last day we were in session before the presidential holidays recess this house voted with only five democrats voting to follow the constitution with only five democrats voting to seat the man who had won the election and the recount why did only five democrats cross the line i think there are two reasons first many good decent democrats have been misled by their leadership and have been told things which are simply not correct and second many democrats are afraid because some very powerful democrats have put their prestige indeed possibly their careers on the line in an effort to take a seat which the people of indiana have voted not to give to the democratic incumbent we stand then today in a very unprecedented and a very dangerous situation we stand in a situation in which for the first time in american history the people of a congressional district are being denied representation while a task force looks at the election now let me make very clear that there is nothing wrong with the task force looking at the election i serve on the house administration committee and i think when there is any question we ought to investigate the elections and we ought to make sure the correct persons are seated but historically if the state government certifies that a member has won an election if the state government is willing to put its honor and its prestige on the line and say we believe we have counted these votes honestly and we believe mr mcintyre has won historically we always seat the winner while looking at the election the reason for that is very simple if we establish the precedent in this house that 218 members can decide to deny an election winner and set him or her to one side and say we are not going to seat you while we decide some other things and then go through long complicated counting procedures and through the difficulties of staff work and for a variety of reasons drag it outand after all the people of indiana are now into their second month with inadequate representationthen the people of the eighth district of indiana have not been represented for the first 7 weeks of this congress and they are literally being taxed without representation that is precisely what the american revolution was about this could drag on for months with a truly clever political machine willing to place its own partisan interests above the nation and above the constitution they could drag out a recount for 4 5 or 6 months and could find all sorts of reasons to dispute it and i have been told there is some dispute about what the democrats were told on the day on which we voted some people suggested that within 45 days the work of the task force could be done others suggested that by april 30 a far longer period than 45 days the task forces work could be done and that is without any complications now we are not suggesting that the people on the task force are not trying to be sincere and to be dedicated and to be good citizens what we are suggesting is that the task force could continue its policies while mr mcintyre was seated that seating mr mcintyre would provide representation for the people of indiana based upon the indiana secretary of state certification based on the election count and the recount and that during the period the task force was nieeting at least the people of indiana would have all their voices rather than being one short and the people of the eighth district would have their voice instead of being unrepresented now this opinion is not a partisan republican opinion very sincere and very competent democrats who have looked at this issue five of them took the very courageous risk of turning aside their party whip and voting against their partys leadership an act for which some of them may indeed be punished ultimately an act of great courage because the pressures were enormous the washington post hardly a republican newspaper on february 11 wrote an editorial entitled a seat for mr mcintyre i want to quote it because the washington post is a liberal newspaper normally and normally not a newspaper that goes out of its way to be decisively helpful to republicans but it is a newspaper which has looked at this issue and which has come to the conclusion which i think every member of this house should look at on the day the 99th congress convened a cloud remained over the election results in indianas 8th district incumbent democrat frank mccloskey aj~peared to be the victor on election night he was ahead by 72 votes but after a correction had been made in the count in one county republican challenger richard mcintyre pulled ahead by 34 votes indianas secretary of state certified mr mcintyre as the winner but the democrats demanded a full recount in each of the districts 15 counties that recount had not been completed by the first week in january and both men showed up to be sworn in when the house met because the earlier count had been so close and the recount was still in progress the house on a partyline vote refused to seat either man that day though both have been on the payroll temporarily the postponement was reasonable at that time last week a recount of all counties in the 8th district was completed and the final figures show mr mcintyre to be the winner by a comfortable 418 votes there are no allegations of fraud and even though thousands of ballots were disqualified during the recount the action was taken in 90 percent of the cases by election commissions dominated by democrats nevertheless the house on thursday refused once again to seat mr mcintyreeven conditionallybecause the committee on house administration is reviewing the returns this process is expected to take another 45 days mr mccloskey has every right to challenge the result of the election in court as former rep george hansen has done in his tight idaho contest but there is no need for the house to wait for a judicial determination to seat the winner nor is it necessary to leave the people of indianas 8th district without a voting representative in congress until april the votes are in they have been counted twice the margin of victory is comfortable and indiana election officials have twice certified the winner the house is the final judge of the qualifications of its members but until and unless the committee on administration finds otherwise mr mcintyre ought to be seated that is the washington post calling for the seating of congressman mcintyre let me make this case again to reinforce the posts point the burden of proof is on the democrats who lost the election not on mr mcintyre who won the election the secretary of state said on election night that mr mcintyre won the secretary of state has said now that the recount is done mr mcintyre has won therefore the burden of proof is on those who would take away his seat not on him he should be seated until there is proof conclusive that he should not have won every indication at the present moment is that he is seated that he has won that the people voted for him and yet what do we find we find that the people of the eighth district of indiana have no representation other people around america are beginning to notice this case the winkler county news from the small town of kermit tx wrote this editorial entitled poor losers and it is interesting that it was a texan who was the democratic leader who moved to take the seat away from the people of indiana and here is a texas newspaper commenting in an editorial entitled poor losers residents of indianas eighth congressional district are being denied representation in washington in a blatant abuse of power by democrats controlling the house of representatives richard d mcintyre was elected to the house from the eighth district last november but he still is on the outside looking in the election was a close one mr mcintyre was certified the winner over the democrat frank mccloskey by a scant 34 votes in december mr mccloskey demanded a recount which was not expected now the recount has been completed by county election commissions that were dominated by democrats in 11 of the 15 counties comprising the eighth district mr mcintyre again emerged the winner but by the more substantial margin of 415 votes the democrats are turning out to be poor losers representative tony coelho of california chairman of the partys congressional campaign committee insists the returns still are not conclusive he points out that 1 000 ballots were ruled invalid in the precinct with a heavy promccloskey vote but conveniently ignores the fact that thousands more were ruled invalid in precincts that favored mr mcintyre election officials in indiana are satisfied that the election of mr mcintyre was on the up and up but the democratic leadership in the house is insisting that the seat remain open until the house administration committee which it controls has had a chance to investigate the case the investigation of course is a last ditch effort to find some reason to give the seat to mr mccloskey this is believed to be the first time the house of representatives has ever refused to seat a person whose election was duly certified by state election authorities if the democratic majority is allowed to impose its will in this manner the implications are frightening why bother to have elections if the party controlling congress can overrule the results if mcintyre is not seated promptly voters in indiana should seek an order from a federal court granting them the representation in congress that is being duly denied to them by the losing side in the november election now let me point out two things from this editorial from the winkler county news in kermit tx first of all they make very clear that in 11 of the 15 counties that did the recount democrats provided the majority of the counters so it was not a republican steal of a seat in 11 out of the 15 counties it was local democrats in indiana trying to hold an honest election and those local democrats reported that mr mcintyre won second if we were truly going to be bipartisan we would have a task force on the election similar to the way we run the ethics committee on the ethics committee there are as many republicans as there are democrats there are an equal number they can only make a decision by ensuring that both parties agree however the election task force has two democrats and only one republican the fact is that if we truly were interested only in a bipartisan way of counting the ballots we would have a task force that had the same number of democrats as republicans and that sought to make truly bipartisan decisions now i think there is a great deal of wisdom in the winkler county news assertion election officials in indiana are satisfied that the election of mr mcintyre was on the up and up but the democratic leadership in the house is insisting that the seat remain open until the house administration committee which it controls has had a chance to investigate the case the investigation of course is a last ditch effort to find some reason to give the seat to mr mccloskey it should worry every member of this body that papers from the washington post to a texas weekly are beginning to suggest that this body would take a seat away from the people of indiana would give that seat to a man who lost the election because that indeed strikes at the very heart of the electoral process major cities have also looked at this case the detroit free press on february 14 1985 detroit again is not texas it is not washington a third voice from the nation at large on february 14 the detroit free press in an editorial entitled democracy in america says as follows on todays oped page rep guy vander jagt gives a fairly detailed chronology of an outrage taking place in the unitedstates house of representatives the democratic leadership of the house had decided not to seat richard mcintyre who in the judgment of indianas secretary of state won the right t represent indianas 8th district in congress house speaker tip oneill majority leader jim wright and democratic congressional campaign committee chairman tony coelho defend their action by saying the election was improperly conducted that republicans threw out lots of votesparticularly in black precincts favorable to mr mcintyres opponent frank mccloskeyand that the voters deserve a fresh new election none of these pious justifications make much sense no one has questioned the honesty of the election and nearly 90 percent of the ballots thrown out were discarded by democratic election officials what democrats really want is to increase their sizable majoritythey control more than 58 percent of the house seats even though they won only 50 03 percent of the votes for those seatsby stealing a close election a couple of interesting things have happened since rep vander jagt wrote his piece however first five democrats refused to endorse their leaderships decision to ignore democratic tradition in a vote to kill a republicansponsored privileged motion that would have seated mr mcintyre romano mazzoli and four colleagues thumbed their noses at their party leaders second mr mcintyre and everett robertson jr an 8th district voterhave filed suit in the unitedstates district court for the district of columbia charging that house officials violated their first amendment rights to free speech and fifth amendment rights to due process under the law by refusing to seat richard mcintyre give him an office perform support services and repay his travel expenses to and from his district the suit asks the court to seat the republican force house speaker oneill to administer the oath of office to the republican and demand that house officers give him an office perform typical duties for the congressman and grant him admission to house chambers democrats have asked to have the suit dismissed in a perfect world the court would agree the houses imperious action has no precedent in american history of the 82 challenged seatings of memberselect since 1933 81 favored the winner the only exception was the rousch vs chambers case in 1961 in which indianas republican secretary of state certified two winners but decertified the republican incumbent george chambers for alleged vote fraud the fraud in the mcintyre case illustrates the danger alexis de tocqueville described in democracy in americathat the unbounded power of the majority is favorable to the legal despotism of the legislature such tyranny he warned can weaken peoples respect for their leaders and for the rule of law certainly its made lots of people question the integrity of the house leadership which abandoned a tradition that congress has honored for nearly two centuries when it refused to seat a certified winner of an election boss oneill and his henchmen have made a mockery of the democratic process and have sullied the democratic party in the process they deserve whatever grief angry votert and politicians give them for denying richard mcintyre his rightful place in the99th congress now the detroit free press is asserting three things that every democrat should consider before voting again on seating mcintyre they are setting first that the democratic leadership quote what democrats really want is to increase their sizable majority by stealing a close election i am convinced that the overwhelming majority of democratic members of this house have no intention of stealing an election however i am also convinced that they have gone along with a process which the detroit free press says the houses imperious action has no precedent in amerian history so in an unprecedented way democrats in this house have been going along with a process which is wrong which is unconstitutional and which again quoting de tocqueville the unbounded power of the majority is favorable to the legal despotism of the legislature and they call it tyranny and they warn de toqueville warns such tyranny can weaken peoples respect for their leaders and for the rule of law and then the detroit paper goes on to say certainly its made lots of people question the integrity of the house leadership which abandoned a tradition that congress has honored for nearly two centuries when it refused to seat a certified winner of an election now my plea to every democrat who is not totally bound to the leadership who is not frightened by the whip who is not unwilling to challenge the democratic campaign committee is to look at this case before we vote again there are no constitutional grounds there are no precedents there are no legal grounds for refusing to seat rick mcintyre while waiting for the task force to report there is every precedent for seating rick mcintyre who won tht election there is every precedent for seating rick mcintyre who has been certified by the state of indiana only the tyranny of the majority would prevent his seating and let me say to my colleagues on the democratic side of the aisle if you seek to run this house by tyranny then you give those of us in the minority no alternative except to oppose tyrants clearly in the mcintyre case we have begun an extraordinarily dangerous precedent which if continued would have the gravest the gravest dangers for this country because it establishes the precedent that some time in the next few centuries of americas history anyone with 218 votes could simply expel and then argue about anyone they did not want to be seated by refusing to seat them could then create based on the precedent of 1985 the ground rule that says after all were not sure why dont we have a task force and lets not seat them while were looking it is a far more serious constitutional challenge than the vast majority of democrats have yet come to consider because they have two good reasons for not thinking about it first of all if they really think about it they might decide that mcintyre is right that the people of indiana deserve representation and then they might have to vote against their leadership second it is just so much easier to hide from the issue to ignore the facts to wander in and vote and hope no one notices this house had a chance thursday a week ago to seat the man who won the election to do what the constitutional precedents would suggest to give the people of indiana in the eighth district a voice in congress this house failed it runs a very real risk now of being a body which is an affront to the constitution and which is violating the very basic american principle of no taxation without representation because in fact the people of eighth district of indiana have no representation at the present time because of the democratic leaderships decision what do the people of indiana think let me cite first the leading paper in the state the indiana star dated february 13 1985 an editorial entitled suing for a seat this is from indiana now from the state capitol and what does the indiana star say there is yet another twist in the tangled tale of indianas 8th congressional district election republican richard mcintyre twice declared the winner and twice rebuffed by a democratcontrolled house of representatives has now taken his case to a washington d c federal court mcintyre this week filed suit against speaker thomas p oneill and the 221 democrats who voted to keep the eighth district seat vacant pending a house investigation of the election he is asking that he be permitted to take office until the house rules on its own findings indiana secretary of state edwin j simcox had certified that mcintyre had defeated democrat incumbent frank mccloskey by 34 votes and a later districtwide recount gave mcintyre a 418vote edge on the opening day of congress rep lee hamilton dind arguing that the certification was invalid and the election still unsettled urged that mcintyre not be seated it would be a disservice to the 500 000 residents of the 8th district to seat the wrong man today only to have him unseated tomorrow hamilton said mcintyres suit contends it is a much greater disservice to deny representation to the 500 000 residents of the 8th district thereby violating their constitutional guarantees of free speech and association the house has the prerogative of judging the qualifications of its own members that authority derives from the constitution and ought not be questioned in several respects therefore mcintyres recourse to the judiciary is regrettable yet mcintyre is miffed and justifiably so at the houses partisanship minutes after the house voted on jan 3 to deny republican mcintyre his seat it voted to seat another certified winner democrat richard stallings of idaho whose election is being contested by republican george hansen in 82 other elections contested through the years the house has allowed the certified winner to serve while disputes were settled so mcintyres case is unprecedented the best outcome would be for the house to recognize that it has made an unfortunate exception in mcintyres case and permit him to be seated conditionally if that were done quickly the suit would be moot and the court would not have to determine if it has jurisdiction an inhouse settlement would be eminently preferable to a possible testy confrontation between two branches of government in other words the indianapolis star is saying to the members of this house you have made a mistake reverse your decision now before the court rules and seat mcintyre until the task force reports let me draw the distinction which the indianapolis star refers to on the date that the democratic leadership refused to seat mcintyre in a close election republicans in this house unanimously voted to seat a democrat from idaho in a very close election we said he was certified even though there might be a contest even though there is a lawsuit even though the incumbent republican who was defeated is contesting it he should be seated because the democrat had the certificate from idaho there is no moral or legal ground to stop mcintyre from being seated if in fact the democrat from idaho is being seated yet the very democrats who voted to seat the idaho democrat voted not to seat the indiana republican it is clearly an act of discrimination it is an act which has no precedent and it involves i think a very very dangerous step against the constitution let me suggest also that we look at the eighth district let us look first in the evansville press at a letter an open letter written to mr mccloskey the defeated democrat by dale mcconnaughay in the evansville press evansville in in the eighth congressional district mr mcconnaughay says as follows this is an open letter dear mr mccloskey you have waged a long valiant and what for you as well as your opponent has to be a frustrating campaign that frustration is shared by 8th district constituents who more than three months after the election remain without a congressman many of those constituents have called this office or written letters expressing that frustration you have no doubt heard from many others some of them say they will never vote again fortunately they appear to be in the minority most others have simply become cynical but that cynicism left unchecked represents a cancer to the body politic to our very democratic tradition that tradition that system is one that we cherish and respect because it has never failed in exalting individual valor statesmanship and sacrifice for the common good especially in the most trying of times where systems themselves seem to fail us the time has arrived to again summon those qualities what has become evident is that the proper course of action in the current dispute one representing the best interests of 8th district constituents cannot be inspired by the system unless it is instigated by the individual if you persist in asking your democratic colleagues who control the unitedstates house of representatives to essentially ignore the 8th district vote to ignore the certificate of victory awarded your opponent and to vote among themselves whom to seat then you may have held onto a seat but paid a terrible price to do so your own colleagues apparent reluctance to engage in so brazen public and raw an act of power politics last thursday when five house democrats defected from the party line and voted their conscience to seat your opponent added evidence of reluctance by your colleagues can be found in the delays house officials say it could be mayan added three monthsbefore a congressman is seated from this district as one who has served in that seat and understands the constitutional significance of taxpayer representation you must find that unacceptable no one suggests you abandon your convictions or your proud fight rather that you step aside for now until the house completes its investigation permitting conditional representation from this district by an opponent who at the moment holds the more valid claim to the seat what is gained by denying 500 000 residents of the 8th district a voice in congress over the next three months do you strengthen your claim to be a man who has the best interests of the people of your district at heart do you show yourself to be a fair man who plays by the rules even where those rules may appear less than favorable to your cause do you enhance your reputation as a public servant or do you invite the incisive remarks from people like rep bill frenzel the ranking republican on the house administration committee who charged last thursday that the only way mccloskey can win is if he confuses his cronies so that they violate the law of the united states and the state of indiana and vote him into congress much has been said in the long period since the november 6 election about good faith voters cast ballots in good faith on november 6 however technically flawed ballots may have been it seems a terrible miscarriage of justice to have tossed out thousands of them districtwide lacking conclusive evidence of any fraud the various local bipartisan commissions conducting recounts of ballots did so in good faith though again flawed by inconsistent procedures from one county to the next which neither you nor your opponent protested sufficiently at that time the results soon after the election saw your opponent certified the winner by fewer than 50 votes a republican secretary of state who delayed certifying a winner can be criticized only for not having delayed that certification long enough until the full recount was complete but when that recount was complete the margin of victory for your opponent grew to more than 400 votes good faith on your own part should require respecting house tradition and permitting an opponent holding a victory certificate to be seated conditionally until you have satisfied the burden of proof that he doesnt have the right to his seat since this is the kind of individual valor statesmanship and sacrifice for the common good which is so desperately needed just now to regain some measure of voter trust and confidence in other words a local editorial writer in the eighth district of indiana

this resolution in raising an issue which is of vital concern to the american people for what is involved here is a matter of principle the soviet union is of course a great country but it seems almost unbelievable to think of what they have done to their own creation in afghanistan this fight started not because afghanistan was free this fight started because the soviets did not like the kind of communist government that was in there so this whole fight this whole destruction of freedom in afghanistan is simply for the soviet union to show not only the people of that country but to the world that if everybody is not in a little square box that looks exactly like the box the soviets want they will go out and destroy people who show the slightest variation from whatever it is the leadership in that government wants to have this is a phenomenal thing we are seeing in afghanistanthe destruction of a people and a country in a dispute over a slight variation within their own system so here we are as a matter of great moral conviction talking about selfdetermination and human rights this is a matter that should be of greater interest to the soviet union than anyone else because of the message that they have given so clearly to the third world that if you are going to choose a different system if you are not going to go to the democratic process you better be darn sure what kind of a communist process you choose because if they do not like what you are doing even as communists they are going to set out to destroy you that is the message of afghanistan but that is not the reason i took the floor i took the floor because i want the american people to know about this bipartisan support for this they read and they hear about so much contention in the congress and that the parties are always fighting and that there is a dipute between the republicans and the democrats or between the house of representatives and the other body or the congress and the chief administrative officer of the country the president of the united states yet what we have demonstrated in the committee on foreign affairs since the beginning of this congress is that we have managed to take extremely important issues with strongly held views of both the republican party the democratic party liberals conservatives and people in the middle and we have forged a bipartisan consensus and this resolution is another example of that effort 1 want the american people to understand and realize that all is not lost while we have our different parties while we have our differences of

to thank representatives lantos and porter for this important special order on human rights this special order is particularly timely for me late last week a constituent contacted my office about a particular human rights case that she knew about she wondered if there was anything i could do to help publicize the case this special order has given me that chance my constituent had befriended on iranian family in california a relative of that family majgan homayounfar recently escaped from iran to the untied states and told my constituent about her experiences at the hands of the iranian government and its feared revolutionary guards i would like to take this opportunity to relate this tragic story ms homayounfar was a teacher and a sympathizer of the opposition to the present iranian government in 1981 ms homayounfar was kidnapped off the street by members of the iranian security forces the revolutionary guards she was taken by car outside of teheran beaten slashed with a machete and burned with a cigarette although she was going in and out of consciousness she recognized one of her attackers and called out his name at one point she saw the man that she knew coming toward her with the machete she passed put and awoke to see the guards tossing something back and forth as her vision cleared she saw that they were playing with a human foot only then did she realize that it was her foot which her captors had amputated the men then took ms homayounfar in a car dumped her out in the road and attempted to run her over she was able to move slightly at the last moment but her remaining good leg was crushed the men then left her for dead ms homayounfar was found by passersby however word eventually got back to the guards that she was still alive and she was kidnapped again and taken to the notorious evin prison in teheran after a 15minute trail she was sentenced to 15 years in jail she remained in prison for over 3 years because she received no medical treatment while in prison her condition worsened fortunately for ms homayounfar her case was known to people around teheran fearing the repercussions from her death in jail the government released her believing that with her medical problems she would not survive but she did survive eventually making it to this country to tell her story as one of the few survivors of the iranian jails ms homayounfar has many horrible stories to convey an artist she has attempted to draw many of the scenes she has witnessed believing that words cannot convey their true horror one device that she mentions is something the prisoners nicknamed the coffin it is a box just large enough for a persons body that prisoners are meant to lay in there is not even enough room to move around she has known several people that have been tortured and that have died i do not think it is overstating the case to suggest to my colleagues that iran today is a human rights nightmare there are reports of young children coerced into joining the war effort against iraq to serve as human minesweepers in front of the iranian tanks there has been documentation of executions and widespread repression of members of the bahai faith concerns that led congress last year to pass a resolution condemning the iranian governments actions against the bahais i quote from the 1984 amnesty international report on human rights in 1984 amnesty international learned of 661 executions this brought the number of executions of which it was aware to 6 108 since the 1979 revolution amnesty international believed the true figures were much higher amnesty international continued to receive reports of executions after summary trials with no right of appeal it also learned of cases in which prisoners were executed after being sentenced to relatively short terms of imprisonment when both the prisoner and the family had been given to believe that release was imminent families were generally not informed until after the executions last week the united nations passed a resolution condemning iran for its human rights record this is an important first step but it is not enough the international community must continue to put pressure on iran to refrain from torture and repression of its citizens i would ask that those concerned about human rights around the world continue to focus their attention on iran and continue to make

feel that it represents a reasonable balance between the need to control spending and the need to provide student assistance for postsecondary education in this country since other members have gone into detail on the background of this legislation and the major changes which have evolved from the committee consideration of h r 3700 i would merely like to highlight some of my special interests and concerns first of all i have worked closely with the chairman in developing a fair and reasonable amendment dealing with the problems created by lenders and institutions which have abused the program either willingly or unwillingly and in the process have not only damaged the reputation of the guaranteed student loan program but have hurt both students and the taxpayers in particular my amendment would merely close the circle by requiring a national response to a potential abuse in the program discovered by a guaranteed agency for example under current law and under the current provisions of h r 3700 we have no assurance of a national response when a guarantee agency in a particular state takes a limitation suspension and or termination action against a lender or institution which has violated program regulations and its program participation agreement my amendment requires the secretary of education to take action within 60 days upon notice of a guarantee agencys implementation of an ls t procedure such an action would prevent institutions which have been found in violation of the laws and regulations of the guaranteed student loan program from ignoring a state action by seeking a national lender and or guarantor i have received a concrete example from my own state agency the pennsylvania higher education assistance agency which demonstrates the need for this amendment at the same time i agree with chairman ford that we must continue to provide due process for lenders and institutions in the gsl program my amendment accomplishes that goal my amendment is not designed to penalize any entity but rather to protect students and taxpayers from poorly administered or even fraudulent institutions and or lenders no one operating a good program in good faith will have any problems with this amendment at the appropriate time during the 5minute rule i plan to discuss my amendment in greater detail i would also like to call attention to a provision in title v of this bill dealing with the requirement for a state task force on teacher training we axe all well aware that there has been such a grassroots revolution occurring in the field of elementary and secondary education in general including teacher training i want to ensure that states which have already taken substantial efforts in complying with the statewide activities envisioned under section 571 of h r 3700 are not required to duplicate their efforts therefore i will offer an amendment to provide for a waiver of the provisions of section 571 when the secretary of education determines that such activities are unnecessary in light of state initiated activities although i share concern over increasing costs in any program i am pleased that h r 3700 when compared to the extension of the current authorization levels more than meets the tests of fiscal responsibility since this is an authorization bill and not a budget reconciliation action or an appropriation

to be a cosponsor of this amendment which i believe can play a positive role in avoiding an uncontrolled arms race in space i commend the dedicated efforts of the gentleman from california and the gentleman from pennsylvania on this important issue over the past year both the united states and the soviet union have observed an informal moratorium on the testing of antisatellite weapons against objects in space it is one of the few areas where voluntary mutual restraints have worked and had a positive impact on the prospects for arms control the soviet union last tested its asat in june 1982 and has indicated its intention to continue to refrain from testing so long as the united states shows similar restraint the soviet system is not a major threat according to testimony provided by then unitedstates air force chief of staff lew allen in 1979 he stated that the soviets have not had a test program that would cause us to believe it is a very credible threat since that time the soviet system failed three times and encountered only one partial success in the words of leslie dirks a former cia official it does not work anyone who has followed it closely would have to agree what tests have been successful in the soviet system have involved a primitive radar sensor that is extremely vulnerable to countermeasures all tests of the more advanced infrared optical sensor ended in total failure the unitedstates system has not been without its problems testing problems are the stated reason that the administration has not provided the certification required by the conference agreement on the fiscal year 1985 authorization act and why no unitedstates tests have taken place against an object in space the program has also encountered substantial cost growth now listen to this those of you who are cost conscious costs have grown from 1 5 billion in november of 1982 to more than 4 billion today an increase of over 250 percent the asat moratorium is important in my judgment because it provides an opportunity to seek negotiated limitson such weapons without the process that technological developments wil overwhelm any such negotiations before they have had a chance to succeed the current systems are limited to low altitude satellite coverage but the advance of technology will inevitably lead to improved systems that can attack higher altitude satellites that provide the critical early warning of missile attacks that is the cornerstone of deterrence so what we are doing here if we drive forward with our system is that we are going to force the soviets to do the same thing they are going to go into higher altitude they are going to threaten the very early warning satellites that are essential for our national security and essential for our ability to respond beyond that and even more incredible by driving this technology forward we are going to give them the capability to counter the sdi program by being able to attack sdi systems in space so it makes no sense for us to drive this technology forward because it simply is the most significant way to counter the strategic defense initiative in light of this i am disappointed that the administration has not even developed a position on asat arms control to present at geneva without such a proposal i find it hard to determine how they expect to be able to certify to us in this congress that they are negotiating in good faith on this issue and that a resumption of unitedstates testing and the inevitable soviet response will not undermine prospects for an agreement limiting these weapons this is an
