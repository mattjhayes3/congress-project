cesar chavez for more than three decades cesar chavez symbolized the voice for political awareness among latinos he carried the cry for farm workers rights to the fields of california and echoed the call for la causa the struggle to raise political consciousness and deliver justice to all latinos with every breath cesar chavez brought passion to his quest for justice but his triumphs sharpened the bittersweet taste of organizing and unionizing the migrant workers a step forward in the march was often matched by a step backward success often mixed with suffering it was in 1962 that cesar chavez took out his life savings and first organized the national farm workers association in the san joaquin valleys agricultural town of delano by september of the same year the nfwa held its first formal meeting in fresno with 287 participants who came to listen to the powerful ideas of the farm workers rights movement lead by the inspiration of cesar chavez along the thousands of miles traveled through the california farm land chavez brought the message of farm workers unity and unionization during the late 1960s and early 1970s the ufws membership reached its peak with over 70 000 members in 1975 chavez delivered his most important legacy to the farm workers rights movement successfully campaigning for the landmark agricultural labor relations act which permitted farm workers to organize and bargain collectively for the first time the grape pickers struggle took center stage in what chavez called la huelgaa series of strikes a call for adequate living conditions and higher wages and a stop to the exploitation and injustice suffered by latinos chavez is also responsible for one of the first and largest consumer boycotts persuading millions of consumers to voluntarily abstain from buying california grapes the boycott gave consumers an active role in opposing the injustices against farm workers across the country throughout his life cesar chavez brought to the public eye the existence of mexicanamericans as a growing and vibrant population more than just the political movement chavez created a moral spiritual and cultural world for mexicanamericans to explore with each and every march chavez continued to challenge all mexicanamericans to engage in an active search for their own cultural identity by the 1970s the term chicanismo the identification of latinos of mexican decent as a symbiosis of hispanic indigenous and american culturesfirst appeared in the lingo of the time chicano art brought nourishment to the spirit of farm workers and to urban life cesar chavez was the inspiration for the teatro campesino which made its debut at the picket lines among the farm workers it was luis valdez agustin lira and others that colored with music and drama with the fight chavez would come to epitomize chavez gave writers painters and other artists the strength and inspiration to express the chicano and latino struggle for equality he gave latinos a voice a spirit and a dream the means to speak a common language through the words of the working poor cesar chavez spoke in a language that was as dear to puerto ricans as it was to mexicanamericans i recall my late father who had walked the picket line on behalf of the sheet metal workers in the bronx it was my father who often expressed to me and my brother that the one power the working poor have is the right to strike it was with these ideas that cesar chavez became part of the puerto rican struggle in the east coast chavez encountered many impediments throughout his struggle but fought his opponent only through words and nonviolent philosophy in 1969 chavez said if the strike means the blood of one grower or one growers son or one worker or one workers son then it isnt worth it in 1968 chavez began a 25day fast chavez explained his actions by saying it was an act of penance recalling workers to the nonviolent roots of their movement even though his fasting lead to physical deterioration it powerfully communicated the hunger for dignity of the farm worker to every one present today and for the thousands of farm workers in the united states it is difficult to express through words the sorrow felt throughout this nation like martin luther king jr who organized africanamericans in the south to stand up against injustice and discrimination cesar chavez stood up against injustice and discrimination cesar chavez stood up against oppression and exploitation in the agricultural fields of california but chavezs greatest accomplishment was to unite the latinos in this country who are children of the earth share the common land to sow and with one united voice await the season when justice may be reaped for the betterment of all as a humble voice

40some denied their rights on the floor of this house you are about to see the taxers the spenders the regulators who control this house the democrat leadership attempt to convince you and the american people that the bill that pays for the operation of this congress has been substantially reduced i get so exercised when i see this mr speaker and members that is an outrageous charade this bill does not reduce spending on we the congress it does not reduce spending by 20 percent by 10 percent by 5 percent not even 2 percent this bill authorizes spending on we the congress of 1 800 000

american family to cough up at least 800 per year in new taxes forcing every american family to tighten their belts yet these same democrats continue on their drunken spending spree refusing to cut their own budgets and even worse through this gag rule refusing to let rankandfile republicans and democratsand here they are democrats look at them you have been slapped by your democrat leadershiprefusing to allow republicans or democrats to even offer amendments that would significantly cut our legislative budget why is this a charade it is a charade because the democrat leadership in an 11thhour rules meeting yesterday kidded 40some members democrats and republicans alikehere they arewho came to us pleading to let them offer significant cutting amendments to the bill why is this a charade mr speaker because after listening to all of these members recite what their constituents were saying back home cut spending cut spending cut spending cut spending cut spending the

hundred million dollars from this bloated legislative expense budget that continues to hire 37 000 employees which i think is lust to make us look good why is this a charade mr speaker because after refusing to allow any of the significant cutting amendments to be offered and debated on this floor the democrat leadership in a cute little ployand you just heard it recited by the manager herein a cute little ploy made in order six small amendments have you people listened to it up there do you know what those six small amendments were for they were good amendments but none of them individually

six of these amendments pass all six that were magnanimously made in order which my good friend the gentleman from texas has said they were really gracious in allowing all these amendments if all six were allowed to pass they would not even cut our legislative budget by a tenth of 1 percent that means that congress this year will continue to spend on itself almost the same amount that it always has while socking it to the taxpayers of this nation to portray this legislative budget as a costcutting bill is a charade the american people have had enough they have had it with a congress that continues to raise their taxes so that they can spend the money on themselves that is exactly what we are doing here they have had it with a congress that continues to pass laws that regulate the

to find the proper balance in the defense budgetto build a military adequate to meet current and future threats during a time of shrinking defense dollars as president clinton said during his state of the union speech we must draw the line against further defense cuts though the fiscal atmosphere calls for tough decisions both the administration and the budget committee lave managed to retain a strong defense budget and stay within the discretionary spending caps taking an additional 2 4 billion out of defense would place our industrial base at risk and force the defense department to make cuts that would leave our military vulnerable the defense question would change from how do we best meetglobal and regional threats to which threats will go unmet as the representative of the aerospace center of california i know what is at risk and it is not pork the balance achieved in the committee budget resolution reflects the tough budget choices we made last year enacting the largest deficit reduction package in historynearly 500 billion over 5 years included in that package was a proposal i coauthored with several of my colleagues to create a deficit reduction trust fund to ensure that net revenue increases and spending reductions included in the package go toward deficit reductionnot new spending this discipline has paid off the deficit is lower than it has been at any point in the 1990s we have a growing economy a falling jobless rate historically low interest rates and negligible inflation our direction is sound and the committee budget resolution keeps us on this fiscal path and keeps federal spending within the caps that the congress enacted last year in contrast to maintaining the balance the solomon and kasich alternative budgets compromise the investments we need to secure a productive future the solomon proposal cuts the technology development associated with the space station it cuts wastewater treatment land conservation job training education and law enforcement the kasich proposal cuts energy research including renewable energy research it cuts environmental cleanup civilian technology research transit student loans and high speed rail development and these are cuts beyond the substantial scaleback of discretionary spending under which we are now operating that is not to say that additional balanced deficit reduction cannot still be achieved during the coming months many of us will be fighting for specific cuts during the appropriations process we need further tools to ensure that those cuts stick that is why i have joined with a bipartisan group of colleagues in drafting a deficit reduction lock box this lock box will mandate that cuts made in appr6priations bills go to deficit reduction instead of simply freeing up the funds for future spending we need thelock box to mak sure that the deficit reduction momentum we have started can continue i commend the work of the budget committee in adhering to the

and makes certain additional necessary changes to the existing bill i want to congratulate my colleagues from the public works and transportation committee chairman mineta surface transportation subcommittee chairman rahall and ranking member mr petrj for their hard work on this important bill i also want to thank energy and commerce committee chairman dingell and ranking member moorhead for their hard work and cooperation in producing this legislation our two committees worked hard together to enact a law in 1990 that made major changes to the hazardous materials transportation act which governs the transportation of hazardous materials in this country because the 1990 law was so comprehensive and has been so successful the reauthorization bill this year is straightforward and does not make any major changes to the hmta hazardous materials transportation in this country has never been safer we enjoy a tremendous safety record while transporting over onehalf million shipments per day of hazardous materlals materials necessary for our industries and from which we all benefit our two committees stringent oversight of the program has helped to achieve that safety record and i am sum that our actions today will serve to continue our enviable record h r 2178 as amended reauthorizes the hazardous materials transportation act for 4 years makes some technical clarifications imposes a reciprocal registration fee waiver to foreign shippers and provides for certain training and studies for hazardous material related issues i urge my colleagues to support h r i also want to note that a provision to clarify a section of the highway beautification act was dropped out of h r 3460 the bill reported by the public works and transportation committee due to a jurisdictional conflict with the energy and commerce committee i have a commitment that this issue will be dealt with at the first appropriate opportunity the provision in question is section 13 of h r 3460 as reported by the public works and transportation committee this provision made a technical correction to section 131 s of the highway beautification act as added by the intermodal surface transportation efficiency act of 1991 that prohibits new billboards on scenic byways the purpose of the istea provision was to protect truly scenic areas all discussion of that provision related to scenic values and the understanding of the members during consideration of that provision was that it related solely to roads in scenic areas the federal highway administration interpreted that provision to override other provisions of the highway beautification act that permit the erection of billboards in commercial and industrial areas under the fhwa interpretation the new istea provision applies to commercial and industrial areas that may be designated as part of a scenic byway for the purposes of connecting scenic areas a state that has a scenic byway program will in most cases want to designate continuous scenic byway routes that is a scenic route that traverses mostly rural areas may pass through towns and cities the advantages of continuous scenic byways are numerous particularly conceming mapping and nolice to motorists what the fhwa interpretation means is that if a state designates a segment of road that runs through a commercial and industrial area as part of a scenic byway for the purpose of connectivity that segment of road would be subject to the new billboard prohibition no matter how urban or blighted that commercial or industrial area might be and even if the state does not want to change its billboard regulation in commercial and industrial areas the public works and transportation committee believes that the fhwa interpretation of section 131 s is not the best reading of the section the last sentence of section 131 s reads as follows control of any sign display or device on such a highway shall be in accordance with this section this section includes subsection d the commercial and industrial exemption the congress intended by this sentence that the scenic byway provisions would be subject to all the other provisions of the highway beautification act in addition if congress had intended to override other longstanding provisions of the act it would have explicitly done so a basic feature of the beautification act is to permit states to allow billboards to remain in industrial and commercial areas congress would not have relied on inference to make such a drastic change in the law indeed the conferees on istea never discussed the possibility of overtuming the commercial and industrial exemption the anomaly of the fhwa interpretation is that it preempts states in an area where they have never been preempted under the highway beautification act under the act a state may ban new billboards anywhere n the state including commercial and industrial zones the state may also choose to continue the federal commercial and industrial exemption the fhwa interpretation tells the state that if it designates a continuous scenic byway it may not as a matter of federal lawcontinue the commercial and industrial exemption

clinton repeatedly said that welfare benefits should be timelimited and that after 2 years of job training and education welfare recipients who can work should be required to do so we have to end welfare as a way of life he told us and make it a path to independence and dignity the presidents rhetoric taps into a feeling held by most of us that longterm welfare dependency is a serious and growing social problem about half of all new recipients are off the rolls within 2 years this is truebut only because of the high turnover among shortterm recipients at any one time about 82 percent of all recipients are in the midst of spells that will last 5 years or more and about 65 percent are caught up in spells of 8 years or more the best effort we have to date that addresses welfare reform is 1988s family support act which sought to move welfare recipients into jobs first by making the receipt of benefits contingent on participation in education and employmdnt programs second by providing transitional health benefits and child care to those returning to work although mandatory education job training and work programs are at the heart of the act the obligations it places on

made all afternoon some very sharp and incisive from both sides of the aisle and on both sides of the issue it obviously does not cut right down the center aisle and it is one in which we are going to have yeas and nays on both sides of the aisle but this gatt agreement is one of the most important trade agreements of our time in the final analysis gatt is about more than trade it is about differing attitudes toward change and the future it is about confidence in americas ability to compete in the world and that is what makes it so controversial the question before us today is whether we will passively sit by and watch our destiny be shaped by other nations in the next century because we are too afraid to compete or whether we will have the political courage and the national confidence to proclaim to the world that we are for gatt because we are americans and wecan compete with anyone at any time in every field in free and open competition and amidst all the heated rhetoric i would ask members to consider several indisputable facts there are currently more foreign trade barriers against unitedstates products than there are unitedstates barriers against foreign products under gatt foreign governments have agreed to reduce their tariffs by some 50 percent more than we are lowering ours under this gatt agreement all nations must abide by the same rules now that is a significant first for a multilateral trade agreement figures show that we currently have about 12 percent of the worlds exports but will gain some 18 percent of the benefits accruing under the gatt agreement our republican joint economic committee staff estimates that the total fiscal impact of gatt could produce as much as 115 billion in additional revenue to the federal government over a fiveyear period more important is the number of better paying jobs that will be created by the passage of gatt and those estimates range anywhere to over half a million to 700 000 jobs and beyond notwithstanding all those dire predictions of our losing jobs during the nafta debate we have actually increased our exports and created a minimum of 100 000 new jobs with its passage i am a free trader by nature by heritage and by congressional district i believe that in world trade you have to take the offensive and when it comes to creating jobs in a global economy a nation cannot sit there and contemplate its navel twiddle its thumbs and gas about how frightened it is in this day and age you either have to get out there and compete to gain your share of the market or you die economically that is what this world is all about today it is not like yesterday and some of our highly organized labor unions i am sorry to say have not recognized the changes that have taken place domestically and internationally as for the issue of losing our sovereignty as a member of the world trade organization that argument has been debunked by eminent constitutional scholars besides that very language we are approving as part of the implementing legislation makes it clear in these words unitedstates sovereignty is fully protected under the wto agreement the wto will have no power to change unitedstates law unitedstates law will have precedence in any conflict between unitedstates law and the uruguay round agreements only congress and the administration can decide whether to implement a wto panel recommendation and if so how to implement it allow me to get a bit autobiographical at this point for 50 years i guess in one capacity or another i have had the great honor of serving my country i believe i can say with honesty that the protection of the sovereignty of the united states has been at the heart of much of what i have been asked to do over the period as a soldier and as an elected official my friends believe me i did not come this far and endure all we have endured from world war ii through the cold war to come to the floor now in my last official speech as a house member and try to convince anyone to give up our sovereignty as a country one final observation particularly for those on my side of the aisle gatt really began as a republican agreement negotiated primarily by the reagan and bush administrations and since world war ii we republicans have by a wide margin been advocates of lowering tariff barriers free and open trade we believe in competition that is what it is all about we will cut the deficit in the best way possible by encouraging economic growth and the increased revenue resulting therefrom this gatt agreement is
