rise to urge the republican leadership to address the unfinished business of the american peoples agenda the house has a lot of work to do and not a lot of time in which to do it in america today millions of hard working families face challenges in their daily lives since january 2001 our nations economy has deteriorated dramatically and this house has failed to provide real relief to the families who need it most we have seen the most anemic period of economic growth since dwight eisenhower was president in 18 months the stock market has lost 4 5 trillion in value more than 2 million people have lost their jobs a wave of corporate scandals has eroded peoples fundamental faith in our nations free markets and scores of corporations have become bankrupt consumer confidence dropped in each of the last 4 months and is at the lowest level since november 2001 our nations retirement security system has also been undermined and in great difficulty in 18 months republican economic policies have taken 2 trillion from the social security trust fund baby boomers retirement benefits have been jeopardized in each of the last few years prescription drug prices have soared more than 10 percent reliable prescription drug coverage eludes almost twothirds of all medicare recipients on a daily basis senior citizens face a choice between buying food paying the rent or buying their medicine senior citizens actually slice pills into halves because they cannot afford their full prescriptions faced with these challenges the house republican leadership has failed to address peoples kitchen table concerns in the last 18 months this leadership passed an agenda that satisfied the special interests misled the american people and dismissed the interest of americas hard working families but for bipartisan action after the september 11 terrorist attacks republicans amassed a record of nonachievement in this 107th congress and failed to make a difference a real difference in peoples lives on the economy republicans have demonstrated a devotion to special interestdriven tax cuts in 2001 in a mammoth tax cut giveaway republicans gave the lions share of the breaks to those who least needed tax relief the republican economic plan turned record surpluses into deep deficits for the decade ahead the only surplus that is left is after they have squandered most of the social security surplus the republican economic agenda rejected the fundamental values that in the 1990s propelled the longest economic expansion ever recorded opportunity responsibility and community in a socalled stimulus bill the republican agenda even tried to give enron a 254 million tax break for the economic victims of the september 11 attacks the republican agenda blocked the extension of unemployment benefits legislation for 5 months for people who had lost jobs in this republican recession the republican agenda blocked the extension of health care benefits legislation this ideological agenda has blocked a modest very modest minimum wage increase even though in the 5 years since the last increase the minimum wages real value has fallen 11 percent this agenda has done almost nothing positive for americans it has instead led to large layoffs weakened americas manufacturing sector and helped produce big losses in peoples pensions iras and mutual funds across the board faced with this mounting tide of bad economic news republicans continue to support more special interest tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals in april in the middle of a reces sion they voted to extend provisions in the spring 2001 tax cut bill that would not take effect until 2011 think about it as families face financial hardships the republican majority wasted valuable time trying to cut taxes for the wealthiest individuals starting 10 years from now in 2011 in recent weeks they have wasted the houses time and peoples money passing the exact same tax cut all over again republicans sliced their 10year enrichment plan for the wealthy into individual tax cut pieces in order to distract attention from the absence of a real agenda that would address americas real problems the sole passion of house republicans has been to reward their wealthy political clientele for the next decade and beyond at the expense of every other need of the american people republicans pass one press release after the next and abdicate their responsibility to lead america they seek to create the illusion of real life legislative progress on americas real problems where none exists perhaps more telling about their inability to carry out their responsibility to govern is that to date not a single spending bill has been sent to the president just one week before the new fiscal year begins in fact since the august recess this house has failed to pass a single spending bill and it is the house that must originate this important budgetary legislation republicans are failing at this most basic task because their misguided economic plan is starving important investments we can and must make in our families futures especially in educating our children their budget plan would force 50 000 kids from afterschool programs that keep children safe republicans will leave children trailing behind in america in fact because some republican moderates understand cuts will have to be made they have been unable to bring key bills to the floor and now their strategy appears to be delay delay delay until after the november elections to avoid voters wrath this week the house will have to pass the first of what will probably be several continuing resolutions to try to fund the federal government republicans are simply kicking the can down the road looking ahead to a possible lame duck session to fix their budgetary problems while they continue to deny the consequences of this deeply misguided economic plan a lame duck session deprives voters of the legislative information to make an informed decision and by delaying key spending decisions republicans are depriving critical resources to public schools hospitals homeland security among other priorities the house should not adjourn before holding a full debate on all of these spending bills and priorities people deserve common sense solutions to the challenges that confront them that is why i hope republicans will at least accept our offer to convene a bipartisan economic growth summit to put together a plan that will cut the budget deficits bring back responsibility and discipline and get us back on the path to longterm economic growth and opportunity even now as we consider a resolution to go to war there is an unwillingness to reconsider republican economic and budgetary decisions made more than 1 year ago before september 11 2001 furthermore democrats support a 21st century energy agenda that creates jobs protects the environment and expands the economic pie for all of us education investments to create the most trained and most highly skilled work force on the planet a minimum wage increase for hardworking families and a second round of extended unemployment benefits because for over 1 million people their benefits have been exhausted and by december 1 5 million people will be in this position second this house must have a free and fair debate about our nations social security future despite repeated promises to safeguard the surplus the republican leadership passed an economic plan that diverted 2 trillion from social security into other nonsocial security initiatives putting special interest tax cuts first second third fourth fifth and sixth republicans broke our commitment to save social security first and jeopardized the baby boomers social security benefits social security is the greatest retirement security program ever conceived social security puts food on peoples table shelter over peoples head it spells the difference between poverty and dignity in the lives of millions of senior citizens surviving spouses and people with disabilities it represents the largest most reliable income source for middleincome seniors republicans have at least five plans to privatize and cut social security benefits these schemes make it clear either republicans will have to cut benefits divert trillions of dollars from other as yet unspecified programs or they will have to do both things according to one study senior citizens surviving spouses and people with disabilities would see benefit cuts between 30 and 46 percent annually if the republican privatization proposals get enacted therefore i can think of few more crucial priorities than a full social security debate with a spotlight shining on republicans privatization schemes i am deeply disappointed that house republicans seemingly do not want this debate and they do not want this vote the republican leadership is doing everything in its power to sweep social security under the carpet until after the november election they understand just how unpopular the privatization agenda has become especially since the near record drop in the stock market of the last months the american people have a right to know the consequences that flow from this decision they deserve a frank honest discussion about all of the republicans social security privatization proposals as elected leaders it is our obligation and our responsibility to hold this discussion before the november elections so the people the people can decide social securitys future in addition republicans must complete the unfinished business of the american peoples prescription drugs agenda right now they are trying to run out the clock on the crucial challenge of prescription drug prices i have talked to hundreds of senior citizens who have urged the congress to cut prescription drug prices down so hardworking families can afford them in this congress republicans have failed these families while protecting the profits of the biggest drug makers that support their campaigns in july republicans passed a sham bill written by the prescription drug lobby they refused even to let us vote on our democratic alternative they rejected a real medicare prescription drug benefit rooted in the right values a benefit available and affordable to all and 100 percent available reliable and guaranteed the republican bill represented a fraud and a farce it was not worth the paper it was written on it covered barely a fraction of americas senior citizens put the benefit in the hands of private insurance companies and took a dangerous first step toward privatizing medicare on a partyline vote it passed the house days later i was in missouri and i saw commercials underwritten by the pharmaceutical lobby the spots praised republican candidates for supporting the republican prescription drug bill fraud that bill secured the profit priorities of our nations drug makers over and at the expense of our nations senior citizens it is the same special interest republican story line on the issue of prescription drug prices this summer the senate 78 to 21 passed a good bipartisan bill that will close loopholes used by drug makers to stifle competition keep prescription drug prices high and maximize industry profits this simple legislative step could cut prescription drug prices by about 60 percent according to the nonpartisan congressional budget office it would save consumers 60 billion in prescription drug prices each year in the house democrats are circulating a petition to discharge the senatepassed bill because republicans also refuse to debate this not surprisingly the pharmaceutical lobby is starting an advertising blitz attacking the senate bill scaring people with the canard that if this bill is enacted somehow magically medical and pharmaceutical advances will come to a grinding halt the drug companies continue to fund republican campaigns as a reward for republican actions and inactions on this highpriority agenda item the special interests can afford to pay for this largess since january the big drug makers earned more than 37 billion in prescription drug sales on this issue the special interests have seized and controlled the agenda before adjournment we must make this the peoples house again we must not let it be the pharmaceutical companies subsidiary corporate interest we should and we must vote in this congress to try to lower prescription drug prices for all americans preventing more corporate scandals and bringing corporate criminals to justice is the fourth piece of unfinished business here in the house again the reality the sad reality is that special interests haveguided the republican response to the whole basket of corporate accountability issues under republican leadership thousands of americans have lost jobs due to corporate misbehavior in recent months arthur andersen fired 7 000 employees global crossing fired over 9 000 employees worldcom fired~over 20 000 and enron fired over 4 500 this is not part of a normal business cycle to say the least in recent months peoples pensions lost 210 billion and state pensions lost 4 billion combined when worldcom and enron stock plummeted because their books had been cooked in response to these awful mindnumbing developments house republicans passed watereddown special interest legislation to create the appearance of action when the truth was a failed republican deregulatory agenda republicans blocked accounting industry reform for months until the pressure became so great they had no choice but capitulation but they refused to impose stiff penalties on employers who mislead employees about the value of company stock they failed to punish ceos who run their companies into the ground they blocked our efforts to eliminate tax breaks and federal contracts that corporations still today receive by relocating overseas to avoid paying american taxes in april republicans passed a pension reform bill that failed to protect pensions from corporate abuse and indiscretions one house republican even acknowledged that the bill does little to protect peoples pensions it failed to give employees control over their nest eggs and retirement plans it treated executive pensions better than employee pensions maintaining two sets of rules it offered employees no legal remedies when companies abused peoples 401 k s i believe america has the greatest most vibrant free enterprize system on the face of this planet but for the sake of every consumer every ceo every employee and every investor we must create one set of rules for all reward hard work with fair play and ensure that corporate criminals pay the price i will continue to stand on this floor and fight for comprehensive business employees and investors bills of rights let us get it done today and restore peoples faith after what has happened to their precious savings sadly the republican response to all these challenges is to run out the clock on the congress as one newspaper wrote over the weekend i saw a headline just yesterday calling the republican agenda an avoidance agenda i quote bob novak apart from the war on terrorism the republican party he says flinches from standing for much of anything in the 2002 election to retain their majority republican leaders have created a playbook that reveals the failed republican agenda and mocks the priorities of their constituents in recent weeks even with misguided bills republicans seem incapable of taking any action republicans pulled an education tax bill pulled the bankruptcy conference report now they waste time and over 100 000 a day of the peoples money according to one calculation passing press release bills one more obvious than the next the nonsense of the house resolutions as i would like to call them will make zero impact on peoples actual lives the same can be said of other wellmeaning resolutions that represent the lions sharb of the legislative agenda with house republicans in the majority in this session the house has passed at least 40 suspension bills to bestow names on post offices under republican leadership this house has considered the following resolutions among others supporting the goals of the year of the rose honoring the invention of modern air conditioning recognizing the significant contributions of paul ecke jr to the poinsettia industry and for other purposes ensuring continuity for the design of the 5cent coin establish the coin design advisory committee and for other purposes at the rate we are going nobody is going to have any coins to redesign if we do not get this economy straightened out this house is becoming irrelevant because peoples kitchen table priorities are not being addressed on a constructive and bipartisan basis instead of wasting time on empty meaningless gestures and then voting to allow the presidents plans to privatize social security to take effect sheltering unpatriotic offshore corporate tax havens from paying their fair share of taxes blocking campaign reform passing the largest gift to the wealthy in the history of this nation in the form of massive tax breaks without even considering a new economic plan passing a gift to enron and other oil and gas interests through a dirty energy bill delaying and bending to corporate interest in addressing the corporate scandals and protecting pensions delaying and then undoing the strong air safety rules congress enacted to safeguard the public in the aftermath of september 11 republicans should have been working with democrats to address the american peoples unfinished and important business the american people want us to raise the minimum wage protect investor rights enact job training pass medicare prescription drugs cut prescription drug prices and extend unemployment benefits people also want ujs to reform our elections and voting apparatus to ensure that every vote counts and that what happened in 2000 and 2002 in florida and elsewhere never ever happens again people want us to enact a real patients bill of rights with teeth and effectiveness and not the sham republican legislation that is languishing and waiting in going to conference they want us to help school districts across america get class size down to 18 students in each classroom they want us to pass school construction to promote safety in every public school create a stable learning environment and meet the staggering backlog of unmet school construction needs people want us to close the pay gap between men and women they want us to overturn new white house rules and restore real medical privacy protections to every american patient they want us to make polluters not taxpayers foot the cleanup bill and maintain the super fund program that cleans up toxic waste they want us to enhance our hate crimes law and provide more resources to states and local jurisdictions to help investigate and prosecute these heinous crimes they want us to reinstate worker safety protections to prevent repetitive stress injuries in the workplace just to name a few this agenda is worthy of the american peoples highest dreams and hopes for their family it is worthy of peoples real concerns that are there on a daytoday basis it is incumbent upon us all to stop wasting time in this house to stop being irrelevant to the peoples real agenda and to get about the business of the american peoples domestic security agenda let us do it on a bipartisan basis let us enact an agenda that creates opportunity for all to fulfill their potential and let us not adjourn before it is done let us get to work"], [0.0017727307276800275, 0.0017727307276800275, 0, "i move to suspend

from his comments that this house intends to pass tax cuts larger than 1 6 trillionat least beyond the 10year window make no mistake this bill today achieves that goal by pushing its true costs beyond our agreed upon budget window simply h r 8 would have the american people believe that they will receive immediate and substantial estate tax relief this bill delays a full repeal which will have budget implications that this country simply cannot afford with over one trillion dollars in lost revenue this has the potential to put this country back on the wrong fiscal track of increased deficit spending and an exploding national debt although the majority claims to support retiring the publicly held debt they havebegun the session by scheduling several tax bills funded by the projected budget surplus without giving any consideration to the impact that the bills will have on our ability to retire our 5 7 trillion nationaldebt these tax cuts have been predicated on the notion that the projected budget surpluses of 5 6 trillion over the next ten years will somehow materialize i submit that the likelihood of these projections actually materializing is extremely slim we are all aware

of the 5 6 million new hiv infections in 2000 occurred in africa african residents accounted for 85 percent of all aidsrelated deaths in 2000 10 million of the 1 3 million children orphaned by aids live in africa life expectancy in africa is expected to plummet from 59 years to 45 years between 2005 and 2010 many experts attribute the spread of the virus to a number of factors including poverty ignorance costly treatments lack of sex education and unsafe sexual practices some blame the transient nature of the workforce many men needing to leave their families to drive trucks work in mines or on construction projects engage in sex with commercial sex workers of whom an estimated 90 percent are hiv positive in addition many men go untested and unknowingly spread the virus many of those infected cannot afford the potent combination of hiv treatment available in western countries in some countries only 40 percent of the hospitals in some capital cities have access to basic drugs whie efforts are continuing to find an aids vaccine many experts fear that some african countries hardest hit by the epidemic lack the basic infrastructure to deliver the vaccine to those most in need more than 25 percent of workingaged adults are estimated to carry the virus counties have lost 10 to 20 years of life expectancy due to this disease 80 percent of those dying from aids were between ages 20 and 50 the bulk of the african workforce 40 million children will be orphaned by the disease by 2010 many of these children will be forced to drop out of school to care for a dying parent or take care of younger children children themselves are being infected with the disease many through matemalfetal transmission while drugs like azt have been proven effective in reducing the risk of an hiv positive mother infecting her newborn child those drugs are too costly for most nations however today unprecedented opportunities exist to improve health around the world the private sector led by the gates foundation has provided additional resources for health programs in developing countries last weekend members of the world bank the international monetary fund and the group of sevenmet in washington and articulated the fact that hiv aids is no longer just a health problem but a global health development problem threatening to reverse many of the development gains made over the past halfcentury what came out of these meetings was an agreement that what is needed is a war chest and a war strategy against hiv aids money alone will not solve the problembut it is a critical part of the solution total global support for hiv aids in developing countries last year was under 1 billion less than a third of the estimated need in africa alone for fy 2001 congress provided 315 million to usaid for global hiv aids a 115 million increase over the previous year usaid was instructed to provide 10 million for the international aids vaccine initiative 15 million for research on microbicides and up to 20 million for the international aids trust fund at the world bank however our forward progress must continue the creation of new drugs and vaccines cannot stand alone and we must also continue to invest in the development of public health infrastructure it is estimated that it will take as much as 6 billion to address the pandemic the united states is uniquely positioned to lead the world in the prevention and eradication of hiv aids some believe that the year 2000 was a turning point in the international response to the epidemic we can be encouraged by this trend however we must not become complacent we must continue to provide the drugs and the care to lessen the pain and the suffering of millions of men women and children throughout the world who are
