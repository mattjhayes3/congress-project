why do i come down on the side of supporting this conference report i have to build my case beginning with last years tax bill president reagen as i recall asked for 2 things 3 years of personal rate reduction 10 percent 10 percent 10 percent across the board 3 years in a row for all individuals in this country second more rapid depreciation writeoffs for business and industry that is all he asked for now admittedly he advocated some of the other changes but they would be added later what did he get not only the 3 years of personal rate reduction that totaled not 30 but 25 percent but a reduction on unearned income subject to tax from 70 to 50 percent in 1 year not 3 years indexing iras marriage penalty correction estate tax reduction reduction of capital gains from 28 to 20 percent reduction of corporate rate taxes from 48 to 36 percent utility dividend investment allsavers certificates safe harbor leasing and what have you now most of these are desirable but i wonder if we had o do it in retrospect all at once this tremendous loss of revenue so quickly was not commensurate with the kind of expenditure reduction that was possible to achieve around here and there is plenty of blame to go around when you consider them as individual spending reduction bills as a result the president was forced to submit a budget with an unacceptable deficit that almost everyone in this body decried on both sides of the aisle but we here in the congress reworked the budget our way and agreed after long tortuous hours on a budget resolution it passed this body by a very narrow margin if you recall and in it we called for that 21 billion of revenue to be raised in fiscal year 1983 to narrow the deficit now the skeptics did not think we would meet our reconciliation goals on expenditure reductions called for in that budget but we did it with that vote yesterday 96 percent of it the skeptics did not think we would meet our revenue goals either in an election year but here we are biting down hard on the bullet just to prove them wrong do you think that has not gone unnoticed by those smart money market managers i read the ticltr a while ago and the market is up by 9 points with 78 million shares traded i tell you they have been watching what we have been doing around here in the last week or 2 and have concluded that we really mean business we have beaten down inflation down to half the rate it was and interest rates finally seem to be responding to what we have been doing i am convinced personally the vote for this bill will reduce those interest rates further and that is the key element to full economic recovery defeat of this bill will surely mean a higher deficit mark that in your book we might very well expect interest rates to rise again if the bill goes down i have to say here in conclusion my friendsthat i have been in the congress now for 26 years would you believe it except for the social security tax increases and that temporary excise tax during the vietnam war that the speaker referred to i have never had to vote for a tax increase and federal revenues went from 78 billion when i come here in 1956 to what they are at 650 billion today how did it happen bracket creep inflation bracket creep inflation and who was the beneficiary big government tax moneys just kept rolling into the treasury i say that is why those personal rate reductions enacted last year are so important why the president has been so insistent that we have got to retain the third year of that tax reduction because that is the way the average citizen catches up with these other preferences some of which we are trying to correct today that principle has been preserved and indexing beyond 1985 has also been preserved if it holds in the future every time we want some big spending program we are going to have to toe the mark for the taxes to pay for the program i have been in the congress a quarter of a century as i said and have never had to vote for a tax increase like today but these are different times by voting for this bill we are not doing a flipflop i might say to the members on our side or turning our back on the principal thrust of what we began to do last year yes we are strengthening compliance yes we are making a few adjustments in our excesses of last year but the bottom line here is that passage of this bill will sill leave us with a net tax reduction from last years most comprehensive tax bill of 377 billion those are the facts may i say in conclusion it is good to have this bipartisan support we see manifested here

election years one expects a lost of rhetoric for the benefit of special interest groups usually there is little action to benefit the nation or its economy but rather a lot of pandering that in the long run proves to be harmful to our future this was the case recently on a vote regarding a concurrent resolution expressing the sense of congress that funding appropriated for title v of the older americans act the senior community service employment project should be maintained in future years at the level necessary to insure that its current jobs and other services be maintained or expanded on the surface this resolution sounded magnanimous and full of compassion for our fine elderly citizens as could have been expected it passed by an overwhelming margin in the house i voted against it for several reasons first i do not dispute the intrinsic worth of a senior community service program i am well aware that our older citizens have much to offer their communities and nation and that too often they are shunted aside by the now generation my concern centers around which segment of government should finance such a program with a budget deficit of more than 100 billion this year it should be obvious that the federal government does not have the money i have absolutely no objection to programs of this nature and local and state governments and perhaps private enterprise might wish to consider maintaining and expanding this program state and local governments generally have to operate within balanced budgets lack the massive moneyabsorbing bureaucracy of the federal government and allow local people to have more control over their own programs second it is pure hypocrisy for congress to decry massive budget deficits and overspending by the federal government and to sponsor balanced budget amendmentswhile at the same time playing to the grandstand with proposals that add to the federal deficit third it is wildly inaccurate to claim that federal progrpms pay for themselves and do not end up costing the taxpayers if overspending by the federal government paid for itself as is claimed for virtually every domestic program contained within the budget we would not have 100 billion deficits or trillion dollar national debts today fourth such resolutions are in themselves meaningless because congress will either appropriate the funds or it will not therefore one must assume that the purpose of such proposals is simply another liberal ploy to encourage partisan and philosophical demagoguery prior to the november general elections liberalsand many conservatives are quite aware that they will be painted as ogres haters of the elderly and uncompassionate individuals if they vote against such grand sounding proposals fifth spending on the federal level for this and similar programs actually worsens the lot of those it is designed ostensibly to help federal overspending robs the elderly and forces their backs against the wall by creating inflation inflation destroys the purchasing power of the elderly more than any other group because so many are dependent on fixed incomes so while the seen hand of federal largesse may have the public relations image of helping the elderly the unseen hand of federal deficits debt and inflation soon destroys any positive effects that earlier help may have had sixth such resolutions actually make prostitutes of many politicians becaue they in effect sell their votes for the programs in return for the votes of specific groups on election day in other words the unspoken agreement is that the various lobbing groups will urge their member to vote for congressman x because he voted for the program pushed by that lobbying group the problem is that the money of current taxpayersand future taxpayers considering the national debtis being used to buy the votes finally this process and the lack of courage on the part of many politicians are the reasons why our nation is in such an awful economic mess today we must realize the federal government cannot give something to anyone or any group that it has not first taken away from someone else this is especially true where deficit spending is concerned because it obligates money from future taxpayers with our national defenses desperately in need of rapid rebuildingit has been postponed for more than a decade due to

the major concerns that i have about the existing procedures used by the insuring agencies and in particular the federal home loan bank board to resolve problem cases today the agencies are arranging forced mergers of institutions suffering losses caused primarily by high interest rates these mergers are usually accompanied by forced management changes as well as a result of these actions local communities are losing institutions and managers who have a direct and close involvement with their communities these firms know the needs of the people and businesses in their market and they have been responsive in providing financial services to them the creation of the multibilliondollar interstate institutions with their operations being directed from some faraway state and with management brought in from the outside destroys the ties that the former local institution had with its community i want to know how a savings and loan officer in california who now owns a s l operation in new york or florida or some other state can provide that same personalized service to the people of those states with the same knowledge and understanding of the needs of those people i do not think that that officer can or will the substitute does nothing to address this concern it will in fact lead to more mergers more multistate operations and a further depersonalization of essential banking services the committee bill on the other hand would preclude conditioning receipt of a guarantee on the signing of a blank merger resolution by the board of directors of an institution which will receive aid the committee report also stresses that in the majority of cases management will be found to be capable and effective in those caces we stress that the agency should not condition receipt of a guarantee on management signing blank resignations which can be exercised at the whim of the agency the substitute does not address this issue and in fact would allow the agency to condition receipt of assistance on the provision of blank merger resolutions and on management changes second the substitute does not address the very real question of the backing of the guarantees to be issued by the agencies i am concerned that the resources of the fslic in particular will not be viewed by the public and the investing community as sufficient to back the volume of guarantees which will be outstanding we must address this matter up front and directly the committee bill does this by providing an authorization to issue guarantees up to the limit establihhed in the bill and the provision of an authoilzation to appropriate the sums which might be needed to honor the guarantees this will be viewed i am confident by the investing community as a real commitment by the unitedstates government and they will not have to wait for us to act at some point in the future to provide further funding for the proposal in the substitute the committee bill will provide an answer to the

from federally funded unemployment benefits a brief historical sketch of this situation is in order here under former law federal unemployment benefits were provided to former military personnel if they met certain eligibility requirements of the state in which they applied and if they had served 365 or more continuous days of active duty and were separated from the military under other than dishonorable conditions unlike other workers whom many states disqualify for voluntarily leaving a job service members were eligible for unemployment benefits for leaving the military at the end of a term of enlistment recent changes in the law howvecr have eliminated unemployment compensation for those who voluntarily quit military service at the end of a term of enlistment and are eligible to reenlist proponents of this provision of the budget reconciliation bill argued that these individuals had voluntarily enlisted in an allvolunteer force and should therefore be treated like civilians who voluntarily accept and quite a job in the process of saving dollars equity was not considered this change in the law has the net effect of rewarding those persons wvho are not qualified to reenlist in our military services and punishing those who have honorably and capably served our country there are other problems with the present approach as well first it drastically impacts the number of households which might be eligible for food stamps second it places the service member who may be quite a distance from his home at a considerable disadvantage in assessing the labor market compared to the local civilian generally speaking it serves to impede rather than assist the readjustment process from the military to the civilian sector today i am introducing a bill which remedies this situation and which appears to be a reasonable response to critics of unemployment benefits for exservice members yet which represents a reduction in spending compared to the former law in short it first provides that a person must have 7~30 days of continuous military service in order to qualify as employment for unemployment compensation purposes second it requires a 4week waiting period between the week in which an individual is separated from the military and the week in which he or she first becomes entitled to compensation and finally it limits an eligible exservice members total entitlement to no more than 13 times the weekly benefit amount payable i sincerely believe that this legislation will serve the best interests of our veterans and i therefore urge my colleagues to join me in assisting those who have served our country by supporting this bill"]]}
