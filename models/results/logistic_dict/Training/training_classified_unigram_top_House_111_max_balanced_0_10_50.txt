increase government spending and lead to the destruction of the worlds best medical care americans are fed up with washingtons out of control spending with more and more power over their daily lives being put in the hands of nameless unaccountable bureaucrats and with the systematic shift of the united states government from a government of the people to a government for the people the growing discontent began with the bloated stimulus bill that did nothing but grow a bigger washington and create more bureaucratic jobs it increased with the government takeover of general motors the cap and tax bill the placement of power in the hands of unconfirmed and unconstitutional czars and the grossly inflated spending bills passed for fiscal year 2010 with the democrat attempt to takeover health care the discontent has now come to a full boil this spring summer and fall the american people have spoken loudly and clearly about what they do and do not want in health care reform the democrats ignored these sentiments and introduced h r 3200 and the two senate bills this led to the most lively spirited town halls in my 15 years in congress followed by an unprecedented number of phone calls emails and letters sent to my office by concerned kansans the american people told us what they do and do not want they do not want a government takeover of health care the american people do not want higher taxes the american people do very much want to keep their health insurance and increase their choices and access for those who do not have insurance what was the democrat response to their constituents a new bigger bill that again ignores the input of the american people and is even worse than h r 3200 the new bill is a government takeover of health care h r 3962 is double the original h r 3200 at 1990 pages long and loaded with new mandates the word shall appears 3 425 timesin other wordsthis is the government telling you to do something the bill creates 118 new bureaucracies the congressional budget office cbo calculated the cost of the bill at 1 2 trillion but this does not include 28 instances of hidden costs indicated by the ominous words indicating that certain programs be appropriated such sums as may be necessary the bill raises taxes on individuals and job creators including a 461 billion surtax on small businesses according to the unitedstates chamber of congress the pelosi bill will result in 5 5 million job losses at a time when unemployment is already over 10 percent and to top all of that offthis bill completely rewrites 16th of our nations economy h r 3962 cuts benefits to seniors does not ensure that americans can keep their health insurance limits choice covers even more illegal immigrants than h r 3200 2 5 million more according to crs and allows for taxpayer funded abortions if h r 3962 is enacted into law even the democrats acknowledge that health care costs will increase as pj orourke said if you think health care is expensive now wait until you see what it costs when its free my biggest concern with the democrat proposals is the intended rationing of health care the obama administration has already begun to set the framework for rationed care with comparative effectiveness research this is a very dangerous road to travel down in addition to all the other concerns i am also opposed to the baucus and pelosi attempt to destroy health savings accounts hsas hsas are what we should be promoting as a way to expand choice give patients more control over their medical spending and reduce health care costs i want health care reform and am saddened that this process has become so political that we wont see the much needed modernization that will ensure americans have access to the best health care for decades to come i am saddened that states like my home state of kansas are forced to take drastic action to try to protect their citizens from being affected by washingtons takeover of health care republicans have offered better solutions and principles that should be included in any health care reform those principles should let americans who like their health coverage keep it give all americans the freedom to choose the health plan that best meets their needs ensure that medical decisions are made by patients and their doctors not government bureaucrats and improve americans lives through effective prevention wellness and disease management programs while developing new treatments and cures for lifethreatening diseases the republican 219 page bill is a plan that will lower cost and improve health care access this bill includes tax incentives association healthcare options to let americans group together for greater purchasing power limitations on defensive medicine and implementing comprehensive medical liability reform tackling waste fraud and abuse a 10 billion annual cost to taxpayers generated from medicare alone and incentives for savings and increased use of personal health savings accounts hsas in addition the republican plan will ensure that americans are not prevented from health coverage due to preexisting conditions and are not subject to lifetime caps on treatment unlike the pelosi and obama plans the republican plan protects medicare for seniors finally the republican plan protects taxpayers from funding abortions or health insurance for illegal immigrants the congressional budget office has confirmed that the republican bill will lower premiums for the american people by up to 10 percent under our plan premiums for families and small businesses would be nearly 5 000 per year lower i strongly encourage my colleagues to vote for the republican substitute that will provide real solutions that will meet the needs of the american

wanting to get into all of these different businesses and that certainly is a scary kind of thing and the other thing were seeing a whole lot of which is making people tremendously frustrated and angry is seeing one thing being said and opposite things being done the true engine of job creation in this country will always be americas businesses but government can create the conditions necessary for businesses to expand and hire new workers this statement is completely true unlike a lot of statements that are made this statement is completely true the true engine for job creation in this country will always be americas businesses lets put a little bit sharper point on it what businesses well 80 percent of the jobs in america come from what are small businesses or businesses with 500 or fewer employees so the businesses with 500 or fewer employees in america hire 80 percent of the employees in america now the true engine of job creation in this country will always be in america as we say smaller businesses but government can create the conditions necessary for business to expand and hire new workers thats absolutely true the government cannot create a job no matter what it does but it can create conditions which allow the small businesses to prosper and hire a lot of people so this statement is entirely true the president is right in this the conditions can be created well what are those conditions well lets take a look at it does it mean 2 trillion in tax increases over 10 years no it sure doesnt what happens when the government takes a whole lot of tax money out of the economy its taking it out of the pockets of the people who own the small businesses guess what tax category the people who are running those small businesses guess what tax category theyre in theyre in the exact bracket that president obama said he wants to take tax from people making over 250 000 people say my goodness if somebodys making 250 000 they ought to pay a little more taxes fine keep taxing them what happens if you keep taxing these guys they wont invest in their businesses if they dont invest in their businesses where are the jobs going to come from you cant have it both ways and yet it seems that the administration wants to talk saying that weve got to create the right conditions and theyre doing precisely the things that destroy jobs in america worst of which is excessive taxation on the people that own the small businesses so thats certainly the wrong thing to do its creating the exact wrong conditions it is driving unemployment making it even worse which is what fdr did to take a recession and magically turn it into the great depression one of the pieces of legislation that the president in his last state of the union urged members of congress to support the jobkilling capandtax legislation whats this well this is a tax on energy well wasnt there a promise that said unless you make 250 000 were not going to raise taxes yeah unless you flip a light switch and then youre going to get taxed because he is pushing a tax on energy everything uses energy particularly small businesses so if you put this capandtax bill into place youre doing another thing that makes it harder for creating jobs thats why this cartoon has got a lot of truth when it says that youve got this health care and the capandtax these are things that are destructive to jobs new taxes on employers who dont offer a government health insurance plan of course the new socialized medicine bill is going to be brutal in terms of creating unemployment because what are you doing youre first of all trying to balance the cost of giving everybody cadillac health care and youre going to try to balance that on the back of small business owners what are they going to do theyre going to say hey i dont want any more employees than i could possibly have because ive got to buy health insurance for all of them and its terribly expensive so im going to work my employees as many hours as i can just to make sure i dont have a single employee more than i need so youre creating a tremendous economic pressure to get rid of jobs by passing this socialized medicine bill so lets take a look standing back a little further what is it what are the things that are killing jobs because obviously something is killing jobs in america what are the different factors that are killing jobs well here is a whole list of them if you want to kill jobs this is the thing to do and this is just what the administration has been doing for a year and a half this isnt rocket science this is very common sense its about as common sense as a lemonade stand the first thing is economic uncertainty if youre a small business man and you dont have a clue what the government is going to do to you next what do you do in missouri we call it hunkering down you dont make decisions you dont hire people you dont buy expensive new machine tools you hunker down when there is economic uncertainty so thats first of all when you have things out there such as capandtax which is going to tax energy youve got a new socialized medicine bill that nobody understands how its going to be implemented but we know it has been loaded with taxes they have even got wheelchair taxes i dont know what poor mind thought of the idea of taxing wheelchairs but it seems kind of perverse to me maybe that should be a hate crime too i dont know economic uncertainty this is a job killer you want a steady economic climate if you want to keep jobs running forward consumption reduction thats just talking about the economy slowing down when you have the economy slowing down it hurts everybody just as a rising tide floats boats a tide thats going down you end up sitting on the rocks so the poor economy also is a job killer excessive taxation is probably probably the biggest factor which is going to kill jobs and thats why it is that the democrats should have learned from jfk i dont expect them to learn anything from ronald reagan but they could learn from jfk they did the same thing reagan did and that is cut taxes so that the businessman has money to invest and create jobs but instead what we have been doing is tax after tax after tax all these new taxes whats that do to the guy that owns the business well to start with he doesnt hire anybody to start with he reduces any kind of expansion to his business but after a while just like your body if you keep cutting off your food pretty soon you start to get skinnier and skinnier and eventually guess what happens to that little business it goes out of business and now there is no longer a little engine there to create jobs because that business is gone and thats what fdr did he drove the taxes so hard that the businesses started to shut down from excessive taxation in a temporary sense the business just doesnt hire in a longerterm siege what happens is the business goes bankrupt and now there is no one there to start to create the jobs in the first place excessive taxation is deadly as a job killer insufficient liquidity is another problem that seems a little complicated but it makes a lot of sense if you own a small business one of the things that you have to have is liquidity that is you have to have some money to be able to borrow to get going on different projects there is a company in my district out in the st louis area called innoventer innoventer is obviously an idea coming from inventions they are inventive sorts of people and one of their latest inventions is something that people that live in the midwest would be tickled to know there is a use for and that is pig manure when you get out in the country and you smell something that smells a little funny you know you are near a hog farm and pig manure is not one of those things that people will go out of their way to try to obtain its considered something of very low value and something you would just as soon not smell well innoventer has come up with a way of taking pig manure and putting it into essentially what is a glorified pressure cooker they put it at pressure and under a certain temperature and they break that pig manure into sort of like the oil that is pumped out of the ground sort of a primordial kind of goo which they have found they can then use to make asphalt with so what do you need in order to make this little business go this is not as pretty as making lemonade but you are going to create these furnaces electric furnaces with pressure and these containers and eventually it makes this stuff which you then can turn into asphalt and we have a section of road in the st louis area paved with this asphalt made from you got it pig manure but you have got to have some money to build the equipment to do this well where do you get the money from well you get loans from banks okay so a lot of small businessmen they will take a 3 or a 6year loan and they have to pay a pretty good interest rate for it because small businesses can make a mistake and go bankrupt and so they get a loan from the banks and the local banks underwrite the small businesses and as they convert pig manure to asphalt you will see people getting hired the trouble though is this you have got to have liquidity and so what has the administration done in order to make it so banks have liquidity well they started one way with the crack cocaine in the federal system that is they released tons of money into this they used to call it printing money so at the high level in the big banks there is lots and lots of easy money thats created by the federal government usually that creates bubbles and then they blow up but now whats happened is that easy money is not coming down through the arteries to the small businesses because the banking regulators are so tough with small business the small banks are afraid to loan any money and so now you have got guys that have imagination that would be creating jobs because there is insufficient liquidity now they are being choked out now this particular innovator has found maybe a way around it to get some money but a lot of problems are in this liquidity are whats the biggest culprit probably excessive taxation second biggest may be this liquidity certainly the economic uncertainty all of these things are factoring into that 10 percent unemployment excessive government spending is a job killer but it does it sort of slowly and it does it on a rebound its not a direct effect what happens is when the government spends too much money then the problem is there isnt the liquidity in the economy and so the money is not invested in the businesses therefore they dont create jobs so thats how that works and then of course excessive government mandates and red tape obviously if you are a small business person and you have got to fill out pages and pages and reams of red tape which small businessmen have to do in america that takes away from your efficiency if you are a great big company you have got a couple of bureaucrats and boy they are experts at every red tape that comes along you can get some efficiency in a big company dealing with red tape but for small businesses red tape is a real real job killer and so thats who the thing that we dont want so now if you take a look at the logic of where jobs come from and what you dont want to be doing and you take a look at what we are doing you are saying hey congressman akin you are creating a perfect storm about everything that creates unemployment you are doing it all and we have a statement from the president saying hey i understand he says i understand that the government the government can create the conditions necessary for business to expand and hire new workers he understands that principle and yet we are doing everything wrong everything he has told us to do is going to affect the jobs and so what are some of these little treasures well first of all this health care reform that we just passed boy is this a humdinger i have been here 10 yearsi hate to admit how old i ami have been here 10 years and i have seen some lousy bills in my day but this health care this socialized medicine that we just passed is two or three times worse than any other bill i have ever seen this is going to have terrible consequences for unemployment and for just hammering small businesses and its going to create not only that of course it will create lousy health care it will probably bust the federal budget but i am mostly on the subject of what are we doing about jobs and this thing here is a job killer this is a real job killer you have got basically just like we are talking about with congressman scalise what we are doing is the federal government wants to take everything over this is taking over a sixth of the economy the government just going to take over health care its not a matter of fixing something broken in health care its a matter of scrapping it and having the government take it over not instantly but over time the capandtrade they call it capandtrade its really capandtax this is that energy tax that the house passed people were so mad about it that was the one where they had 300 pages of amendments passed at 3 oclock in the morning and the bill was here from the floor and there wasnt even a copy of the bill when they passed the thing the house passed it and people got so mad that the senate refused to take it up but this is a big tax of course and of course thats not a good thing for small businesses you have got other miscellaneous taxes coming many of them associated with this health care reform thats where some of those taxes are coming from so we are doing we are really doing all the wrong things and it shouldnt surprise us that we are getting problems with unemployment obviously there are other problems that are going on too pretty serious ones and i would just like to talk a little bit about some of these other taxes these are tax increases tax increases this is really fine print isnt it look there are 16 of them on this sheet if congress takes no action these are the tax increases we are taking a look at in 2010 and so what happens when you increase taxes businessmen dont have the money to invest in companies and you pull the economy down is that all we have got oh no you have got to remember we have got 2011 coming these are tax increases if congress takes no action in look at that we have got another bunch of these the marginal income tax rates will increase as follows these are not small things these are big deals the 35 percent bracket will increase to 39 6 the 33 percent bracket will increase to 36 percent the 10 percent bracket will increase to 15 and the 25 is going to go to 28 so first of all all the marginal tax increases on everybodys income taxes are going to go up if the congress doesnt take any action this is 2011 this is 2010 down here look at all these taxes now we are having a tax party arent we and its going to give a tax to our economy dividends will no longer be taxed at the capital gains rate for individuals thereby increasing the double taxation and dividends as much as 164 percent guess what kind of people have these dividends and have money invested in these things people who own small businesses of course so you are going to tax those people guess whats going to happen they are not going to expand the business you got it the personal capital gains tax will increase to 20 percent and 10 percent from 15 and 5 and the child tax will decrease so the standard deduction for couples all of these things there will be more and more tax increases is that it oh no no there are more tax increases too in 2012 the adoption of a tax credit will decrease from 13 to 5 000 the credit for electric drive motorcycles plugin electric vehicles will expire all these things tax increases and so is this the right direction no of course its not the right direction what we are doing is we are doing precisely what you would do if you are trying to crash the economy now lets talk a little bit i dont have charts on this i want to talk a little bit about whats happening on the spending side is it because there are just so many demands on the federal government that we just have to keep spending money on all these things is it the federal government is just getting so expensive well lets take a look if you go back to president bush he was criticized for spending and the republicans that were with him myself included were criticized for spending too much money and you know what that criticism was just we spent too much money and 2008 was the worst year in terms of bush spending too much money he had a deficit that year of about 450 billion thats too much deficit as you take a look at that you say by golly i dont know how much 450 billion is thats a little bit outside of my normal family budget well one way to look at it is as a percent of our overall gross domestic product the gdp thats 3 1 percent which is about common for a lot of presidents in various years to have a deficit at about 3 percent or so thats not uncommon and that was his worst year in 2008 under a pelosi congress so the democrats were running this institution you had president bush in the white house worst deficit 350 billion well what happened in 2009 that deficit under president obama went from 450 went up to 1 4 trillion that is more than three times bushs worst deficit spending in 2009 so how does that relate to gross domestic product well instead of 3 1 percent it jumps all the way to 99 9 percent of gross domestic product thats the highest level of deficit since world war ii and that was 2010 what do you think 2011 is going to be like well you have got it right 2011 is worse it takes it over 10 percent of gdp and so we are spending tons of money thats part of the reason for these tax increases but the tax increases arent beginning to be able to keep up with our high level of federal spending and so what you got to the point now is when the federal government spends a dollar 41 cents of that dollar that they are spending is borrowed money its not the federal dollar so they spend a dollar but 41 percent of it is borrowed what would happen what would happen if the american family ran its budget that way that you could go out and spend 1 40 but you didnt really have a dollar you really only had you know 59 cents i mean i just cant imagine us putting ourselves into that kind of a situation so a whole lot of americans not necessarily just republicans theres a whole lot of americans saying this has got to stop this is not the way to run a company yes the president said something truthful here he said something truthful he said the true engine of job creation in this country will be americans businesses but government can create the conditions necessary for business to expand and hire workers what he forgot to add was governments can also create the conditions to put people in the poorhouse drive every job out of this country and put americas finances in a horrible mess we can also do that thats what we are doing and its time for people to start pulling the alarm button and saying enough of this stuff i am joined by my good friend from texas congressman gohmert and i hope you will rescue me because im starting to get a little hot under the collar"], [4.398822784423828e-05, 0.9999560117721558, 1, "i rise in support of the conference report to h r 1 the american recovery and reinvestment act which addresses the unprecedented

on job losses across our country in my home state of rhode island we have the countrys second highest unemployment rate at ten percent and last december we were ranked sixth nationally in foreclosure rates these harsh realities have made it increasingly clear that our economy will face an even sharper downturn if we do not act soon the compromise between the house senate and white house is not perfect but it contains the right formula of spending and tax relief to stimulate our economy and increase new job opportunities with that in mind i support taking action to rebuild our nations economy and put rhode island families first h r 1 will appropriate spending for transportation and infrastructure upgrades and construction health care programs education assistance housing assistance and energy efficiency upgrades and includes personal and business tax breaks tax provisions intended to assist state and local governments and energyrelated tax incentives for a total of 787 billion to be expended over fiscal years 2009 and 2010 this measure helps those hit hardest by the economic downturn by extending unemployment benefits providing job training to get people back to work quickly increasing food stamp benefits and extending health benefits the recovery plan provides funding to modernize our crumbling roads and bridges increase transit and rail funding to reduce traffic congestion and gas consumption and invest in clean water and other environmental restoration projects these investments will immediately create jobs in my state as projects will only receive funding if they are ready to go within 90 days of the enactment of this bill this legislation also includes additional infrastructure funding that will improve our national security by modernizing our electric grid upgrading our airport port transit and rail security and updating department of defense facilities one of the best ways to grow our economy is by investing in our future workforce the inclusion of robust education initiatives that will build 21st century classrooms labs and libraries is also very important to me as we prepare the next generation of workers to support and strengthen our economy i am pleased that funding to modernize renovate and repair school buildings is included in the final language it also contains funding for title i programs which serve disadvantaged children and idea which serves disabled children ensuring that all children regardless of where they live or their disability receive a quality and equal education moreover this level of funding for idea increases the federal share of special education services to its highest level ever and brings much needed relief to school systems h r 1 also provides 15 6 billion for pell grants and it is estimated that rhode island will receive 97 5 million in aid for 28 217 recipients for an average award for the academic year 200910 of 3 456 investing in our childrens education not only has longterm benefits to our economy but it also delivers on our nations promise to ensure that all individuals have an equal opportunity to succeed investments in american health care also represent a vital component of our nations economic recovery and long term fiscal sustainability this package contains several provisions that will stimulate job growth and improve health care quality and efficiency through 10 billion investments in biomedical research and 19 billion for the further development and implementation of health information technology this bill bolsters crucial safety net programs that provide invaluable health and social services to our nations lowincome and disabled citizens with the inclusion of 87 billion in enhanced funding for state medicaid programs that have been stretched to the breaking point under increased unemployment and skyrocketing health costs this package also includes a provision to assist recently unemployed individuals and their families by helping them maintain their health coverage through a 65 subsidy for health insurance premiums under cobra for up to nine months one of the greatest challenges we face with this effort is ensuring that we do not repeat the mistakes of the past this bill makes great strides by investing in the transformation of our national energy policy which will lead to greater technological advancements in renewable technologies job creation and energy independence now is the time to make the commitment to our children and our grandchildren that we will leave a safer cleaner and healthier environment than we have now as a cofounder of the sustainable energy and environment coalition i fought for several provisions in h r 1 that promote energy efficiency and renewable energy production and development including tax provisions for families and businesses in addition to funding that will drive the creation of new greencollar jobs more importantly than tax incentives alone this measure sets forth a longterm energy policy that puts our nation on the path towards energy independence individuals and families will also receive relief through the making work pay tax credit which will provide up to 400 for an individual or 800 for married couples filing jointly parents will also benefit from an increase in the earned income tax credit for families with three or more children and the bill allows additional lowincome families to receive the child tax credit the measure will also provide a tax credit up to 8 000 for first time home buyers if they purchase a home between january 1st 2009 and december 31st 2009 injecting a much needed financial incentive into the housing market i also urge my colleagues to join me in my support for h r 1 because it includes unprecedented accountability and strong oversight by creating the recovery act accountability and transparency board which will coordinate and conduct oversight of federal spending under the bill a public website will also contain the boards reports show exactly how funds are spent and will list announcements of contract and grant competitions and awards it is important to understand that this funding is not a silver bullet but that our economy will continue to decline without this immediate action the recovery package will slow our downward economic trend and allow us to regain our footing as we begin to make muchneeded

wall streets risky decisions it will protect families retirement funds college savings homes and businesses financial futures from unnecessary risk by ceos lenders and speculators it will protect consumers from predatory lending abuses from the fine print and industry gimmicks and it will inject transparency and accountability into a financial system that has run amok wall street reform is good for our country because it is a critical step to create jobs and grow the economy years without accountability from wall street and the big banks have cost us 8 million jobs having a healthy financial system will help spur lending to businesses of course which will grow our economy as we rebuild our economy the new commonsense rules from this bill will ensure that big banks and wall street cant play games again with our futures americans want fairness they deal openly and honestly with their banks and they want their banks to treat them like the good customers that they are there was a meltdown for 8 years under the previous administration our allies on the other side of the aisle looked the other way as wall street and the big banks exploited loopholes americans had no clue that wall street barons were gambling away their money on complex schemes and being handsomely rewarded for failure and for recklessness americas families and small businesses paid the price we lost 8 million jobs and 17 trillion in retirement savings and americans net worth in this meltdown it was the worst financial crisis since the great depression there are tough choices this congress and our president president obama have made tough choices and taken effective steps to bring our economy back from the brink of disaster the recovery act has already saved or created up to 2 8 million jobs and much of the tarp has already been repaid but more must be done the next step is the wall street reform it is a critical step to create jobs and grow the economy as we rebuild our economy we must establish commonsense rules to ensure big banks and wall street cant play russian roulette again with our futures wall street may be bouncing back but we know from experience they are not going to police themselves let me just talk a bit about what is in this legislation this bill protects hardworking americans from the worst abuses in the financial industry id like to share with you just some of the consumer protections that are included in this bill there is protection for families and small businesses by ensuring that bank loans mortgages and credit card terms and disclosures are fair and understandable transparency in the industry will be overseen by the new consumer financial protection agency credit card companies will no longer be able to mislead you with pages and pages of fine print you will no longer be subject to hidden fees and penalties or the predatory practices of unscrupulous lenders this bill will make lending agreements easier to understand and protect small borrowers it ends predatory lending practices that occurred during the subprime lending frenzy that this country experienced the legislation outlaws many of the egregious industry practices that led to the subprime lending boom it ensures that mortgage lenders make loans that benefit the consumer it would establish a simple standard for all home loans institutions must review proof of income to ensure that borrowers can repay the loans they are sold this legislation will force mortgage companies to play by the rules youll be empowered with easytounderstand forms and youll have clear and concise information to make financial decisions that are best for you and your family financial firms will no longer be able to engage in behavior that is so risky and irresponsible that it threatens to bring down the entire economy this bill replaces taxpayer bailouts with new procedures to unwind failing companies that pose the greatest risk this winddown process will be paid for by the financial industry and not by taxpayers it produces tough new rules on the riskiest financial practices that gambled with your money and caused the financial crash like the credit default swaps that devastated aig and commonsense regulation of derivatives and other complex financial products offered to consumers it provides tough enforcement and oversight with more enforcement power and funding for the securities and exchange commission including the registration of hedge funds and private equity funds it provides enhanced oversight and transparency for credit rating agencies whose seal of approval gave way to excessively risky practices that led to a financial collapse it protects investors it strengthens the secs power so it can better protect investors and regulate the nations securities markets reining in egregious executive compensation allowing a say on pay for shareholders requiring independent directors on compensation committees and limiting bank executive risky pay practices that jeopardize the safety and soundness of banks as a member of the cbc one important part of the bill i would like to highlight is the new offices of minority and women inclusion at federal banking and securities regulatory agencies the bill establishes an office of minority and women inclusion that will among other things address employment and diversity contracting opportunities with the federal government the offices will coordinate technical assistance to minorityowned and womenowned businesses and seek diversity in the regulatory workforce by actively engaging minorities and women the nations financial system will become stronger nearly 2 years after our nations financial system stood on the verge of collapse congress is working hard to protect american consumers and to grow our economy the wall street reform and consumer protection act will accomplish both goals this sweeping new legislation will modernize americas financial rules in response to the worst economic crisis since the great depression once signed into law these tough new regulations will hold wall street accountable it will end taxpayerfunded bailouts and protect americans from unscrupulous big banks and credit card companies wall street reform is a win for the american people this is about making the system fair and accountable the financial crisis that unfolded in 2008 should never have happened but since it did this congress has been working hard to develop legislation that will prevent a future crisis i support the wall street reform and consumer protection act because it includes commonsense reforms that hold wall street and the big banks accountable but most of all this bill supports the american people lets give americans what they deservefairness in the financial system"], [5.5909156799316406e-05, 0.9999440908432007, 1, "as we all know the recession we are facing today is the most severe since the great depression it is evident that the bush administrations economic policies have failed us with a new president we now have the ability to begin to repair our economy and get our country back on track we must significantly cut our bloated defense spending i agree with my friend and fellow chair representative barney frank that we should reduce defense spending by at least 25 percent the cpc budget does this by withdrawing our troops from the senseless war in iraq saving american tax payers 105 billion in 2010 and by ending the procurement of antiquated cold wdr weapons systems that no longer further our common national defense these actions will save another 60 billion yes 60 billion dollars per year this budget will also address the root causes of terrorism by enacting and fully funding the smart security platform for the 21st century this is a more effective targeted and nuanced national security strategy that will focus more of our resources on the critical issues that affect our national security nonproliferation conflict prevention international diplomacy and multilateraism furthermore the cpc budget will offer serious reform that will bring back americas tradition of progressive taxation first it eliminates the bush tax cuts for those in the top 1 percent increasing government revenues by 84 billion moreover the bill will force banks who helped create this financial disaster toself finance their received bail outs by implanting a one quarter of 1 percent tax on all stock and futures trading lastly it will end outrageous overseas corporate tax havens in the caribbean switzerland and all elsewherebringing 100 billion in taxes back to the american treasury with these extra 300 billion government revenues the cpc budget will help hard working americans th rough these tough economic times specifically the budget alternative adds funding for job training puts americans to work with robust transportation funding extends cobra health benefits and provides extra food stamps for the poor women and infants in these dire times the progressive caucus budget will help us realign our fiscal policy with our values as a nation as we cut useless defense spending and misdirected tax cuts for the wealthy while providing aid to the middle and working classes we will make an important statement america honors work and those who play by the rules we appreciate the success of the wealthy but we expect them to reciprocate when it comes to promoting the common good america will strengthen its national security by working with our allies around the world and by showing compassion to our brothers and sisters who lack our economic blessings finally and most importantly america is a flexible country that can and will change with the times make smart investments and lead the world in a new economic direction i encourage my colleagues to support the progressive caucus alternative budget so that we may move forward as a nation that honors work justice and peace now more then ever americans are speking government to help them during these uncertain times for too long members on the other side advocated for no government intervention citing the mantra of extreme free market capitalism now we are seeing the devastating consequences the congressional black caucus budget is one way to confront our pressing issues and move america forward todays legislation addresses minority health needs it calls for significant increases in funding for the minority aids initiative ryan white care act and cdc prevention activities for hiv std tb and viral hepatitis furthermore the cbc budget calls for a 200 million increase in funding for the national center on minority health and health disparities at nih these programs will promote better public health services to the many who depend on these programs in the richest country in the world access to housing is a human right after many years of underfunding of the nations affordable housing programs the cbc fully funds section 8 public housing to 100 of need furthermore the bill calls for 360 million increase to housing for people living with hiv aids hopwa lastly the cbc urges an increase in funding for the neighborhood stabilization program which allows states localities and nonprofits to buy up and rehabilitate abandoned and foreclosed properties as chairman of the house judiciary committee i whole heartily support the cbc efforts to reduce juvenile crime and efforts to rehabilitate exoffenders todays legislation would fully fund the second chance act an important bill that gives assistance exoffenders during their reclamation to society and may ultimately reduce crime furthermore the cbc budget will increase funding for the justice assistance program the j uvenile justice program civil rights enforcement the cops program the byme justice grant program and state and local law enforcement assistance during these tough economic times we need expanded and improved access to high quality education the cbc budget supports the president to expand the pell grant program to hardworking students it is a national shame that the bush administration woefully underfunded the no child left behind act and the todays legislation calls for substantial increase in funding level furthermore cbc budget calls on congress to fully fund head start trio including upward bound gear up youth build and vocational education programs i could go on about the features of this legislation but clearly it puts americans first i urge my colleagues to support this legislation"], [5.698204040527344e-05, 0.9999430179595947, 1, "thank you very much let me begin my thanking my friend and colleague the gentlewoman from ohio congresswoman fudge for anchoring once again tonights congressional black caucus special hour we are talking tonight about job creation and the economy every monday the house of representatives is in session we hold special orders so that we can bring attention to some of the most pressing issues confronting our country that often really dont make headlines and so i have to thank congresswoman fudge once again for her leadership and for leading these special orders because this continues to keep our caucus and the entire country focused on the critical issues that sometimes do not receive the type of attention really that they should receive and also really puts forth what the agenda is of the congressional black caucus as chair of the cbc i rise once again this evening sounding the alarm for the urgent and vital need to create jobs in america we have to create jobs in our communities that have disproportionately suffered the brunt of this economic crisis and who as a result are in desperate need of targeted concrete and meaningful relief for many months now members of the congressional black caucus have been and continue to be laser focused on stimulating the economy and creating jobs particularly for the chronically unemployed we have sought to engage the obama administration our house and senate leadership committee chairs and our coalition partners to develop a legislative strategy to address the needs of millions of americans who are struggling in this tough economic environment last week we tried but this week i hope we will pass h r 4213 the american jobs and closing tax loopholes act this includes funding for summer youth jobs and emergency assistance for needy families these provisions will target resources to communities with the most urgent need for help over the past several months we have worked to develop a job creation strategy that will address needs of the chronically unemployed and one of our top priorities has been the creation of a summer youth jobs program for americas youth the congressional black caucus met with president obama and we raised the importance of the summer jobs program to address the huge unemployment rate among young people we need this targeted assistance to help put our young people to work and to teach them an array of valuable job skills that they can use throughout their life but even more importantly at this point in many of our communities and in our districts many of our young people have to help their families just survive they have to help pay the rent and put food on the table while the most recent job reports issued at the beginning of may show the overall teen unemployment rate dropping significantly african american and latino teens remain unemployed at significantly higher rates than their white peers african american and latino teens are unemployed at 37 3 percent and 29 2 percent respectively compared to an overall national rate of 23 5 percent these figures underscore the urgent need for this legislation and for the united states senate to quickly follow we know that these jobs and the jobs initiative provisions in these bills will help all young people due to this recession and due to parents being unemployed again our young people have a critical role to play now in terms of just the stability of their families studies have shown also that teenage joblessness has many longterm consequences young people who fail to find early jobs are more likely to be unemployed are underemployed into their 20s and permanently mind you trapped at the margins of the economy so i urge all of us to support h r 4213 and get this passed this bill will also provide critical tax cuts and support for american workers through the end of this year some of the other provisions included in this legislation would provide tax relief to businesses and state and local governments to help them invest and to create jobs provide important tax cuts to put money back into the pockets of working families and help restore the flow of credit to enable small businesses to expand and hire new workers by extending small business loan programs this bill also expands career training for americans who are looking for work it extends eligibility for the unemployed who need the unemployment insurance benefits also cobra the health care tax credits and other critical programs that families and communities depend on through these hard economic times this and sometimes i call it the survival package which is what it is helps families maintain and only maintain until they can get back on their feet and also until we can do more in terms of creating some real good paying and sustainable jobs this bill also ensures that seniors and military servicemembers and americans with disabilities continue to have access to doctors that they know and trust also it closes tax loopholes for wealthy investment fund managers and foreign operations of multinational corporations so we need to consider this bill quickly we also need to look at chairman millers bill which is called the local jobs for america act because many of the provisions that the congressional black caucus has been championing are included in that bill also in the miller bill we target funding to communitybased organizations serving communities with poverty rates of 12 percent andor unemployment rates that are 2 percent or more than the national average we provide for onthejob training for thousands seeking new skills for a new economy in many of our districts throughout the country even if we created jobs our workforce may or may not have the requisite skills and may not have the preparation and the job training for those jobs because they have been undereducated they have not had the type of resources and have been chronically unemployed for many many years and so we need to have onthejob training and workforce training as part of any comprehensive jobs package also in the miller bill we target communities that are hit hardest by the recession and we support programs that train retrain and hire teachers law enforcement officers and firefighters so this bill that we are working on and talking about tonight h r 4213 is building a foundation it is an excellent first step but we must move forward and have a comprehensive jobs bill to invest in people invest in our workers provide for worker training and retraining apprenticeship preapprenticeship programs but also direct investment in job creation efforts i want to thank once again my colleague from ohio for sounding the alarm certainly in ohio we have witnessed an economic downturn that is hard to imagine with the foreclosure crisis the loss of jobs outsourcing the lack of health care i know ohio has really gone through some very difficult times in my own state of california we are facing a huge budget deficit people are being cut of course unfortunately the safety net is being cut and so what we need to do here is provide federal investment in job creation because this ultimately will help us reduce our deficit put people back to work and allow american men and women and families to finally regroup and be part of the american dream"], [6.186962127685547e-05,

the finances of this country increased our deficit by 87 percent from 5 trillion essentially a little over 5 trillion to a little over 10 trillion they didnt quite double it but 87 percent more debt under the bush administration that i called fiscal child abuse why because it was not done at a time of fiscal crisis with large unemployment that unemployment was caused by the policies of the last administration why do i say that because under the clinton administration we created 21 million jobs in the private sector just a little short of 21 million jobs 22 8 overall when you include public employment and during the bush administration how did it relate to that 20 1 million new jobs in the private sector one million how did it relate per month to job production 216 000 under the clinton administration and 11 000 per month under the bush administrations thats what their economic policies wrought their economic policies of cutting deeply not 40 billion or 34 billion borrowed money but trillions with an s of borrowed money to fund tax cuts which they did not pay for they werent continuations of the tax code as jon kyl the secondranking republican leader in the senate now argues ought not to be paid for 687 billion that we just ought to continue that for the wealthiest in our country not the little children who are worried about whether their parents are going to be able to afford the mortgage or afford to put bread on the table thats what were talking about in this bill for literally millions of people who have run out of support now will they run out of support in this moral country they will not ultimately run out of support theyll be put on welfare and food stamps and they wont be available for the insurance to which their employer and they participated in providing for the contingency that we ran the economy into the ditch the worst economy in threequarters of a century wrought by the bush economic policies to which mr sessions the chairman of their campaign committee says that they want to return to the exact agenda im so pleased i had the opportunity to come and respond to my friend from texas it does demonstrate the difference between our two parties absolutely jon kyl who says we ought to borrow 686 billion from the chinese to give to the wealthiest in america and democrats who say we want to borrow 34 billion to give to the children of america whose families are in needyes that is the difference if my friend from texas wants to make that the difference this is about saying that we have an emergency and historically from ronald reagan to today ronald reagan bush the first and bush the second what did you do when you were in charge you borrowed at times of economic trouble to give unemployment insurance we are doing the same thing why did we do that because we perceived it to be an emergency an emergency that people in the richest nation on the face of the earth were about to run out of the ability to keep their homes buy their food clothe their children a moral and great country thinks thats an emergency thats what this vote is all about this vote is also about as the gentleman from texas has said expressing our values i agree with that and im going to express my values and i urge the members of this house to express their values this day on this vote as millions of people have lost their unemployment insurance because we could not get 60 votes in the senate had almost every democrat saying we need to help now people are running out of ability to support themselves now we paid insurance for now so i urge my colleagues to vote for this legislation a few months ago we passed unemployment insurance through this house by unanimous consent the election wasnt as proximate then as it is today the deficit is way too high and we need to get a handle on it and i just made a speech and i have been criticized by some on my side of the aisle and some others for saying that we needed to put everything on the table i reiterate that today we need to put everything on the table no sacred cows i have three children three grandchildren as all of you will get tired of hearing and one great granddaughter and i owe it to her personally as a member of this house to say ladies and gentlemen of this house and of our country we have a moral responsibility to get a handle on this deficit a reporter just asked me as i was walking down the aisle did i agree with mr bernankes comment that we ought to pay if we extended the tax cuts and i said to him this at a time of fiscal crisis when our economy is struggling to get back from the ditch it was in when this administration took overhow much of a ditch during the last year of the clinton administration we added 1 9 million new jobs i tell my friend from texas last year clinton administration 1 9 million new jobs in america and it was a slowdown period during the last year of the bush administration after the economic policies that were pursued from 2001 and 2002 and 2003 and through 2009 even though we took the congress we couldnt do anything because the president would veto legislation and did in fact veto legislation 3 8 million americans lost their jobs thats a difference of 1 9 million new jobs in the last year of clinton to 3 8 million lost jobs in the last year of bush or a 5 7 million jobs turnaround is there any wonder why there is a lot of pain in america and families are in great distress and theyre angry and they have angst and we share that today does not solve the problem but today reaches out to those folks in distress and say in the shortterm on an emergency basis we are going to continue to give you help so you can support your families in this the wealthiest nation on the face of the earth you worked hard you paid in and through no fault of your own you lost your job maybe because of the fault of wall street that my friend believes we were too harsh on we are imposing rules on so they can play by the rules and not squander and take risks that put wall street profits before main street stability yes and also were not going to apologize to the bp oil company and say were sorry that we expect you to be accountable for the negligence that caused millions of people to be in economic distress were not going to say sorry some people want to say sorry that the president of the united states suggested hey you need to help those people maybe helping people is a difference between our two parties i dont necessarily think that i dont want to say that but if thats the difference today is a

to the afghans in remote areas aid workers have played a vital role in serving the afghan public over the last three decades due to the countrys instability while many aid workers in the past were given safe passage in conflict areas sadly in recent months attacks against them have escalated the perpetrators are breaking longstanding customs and have resorted to targeting the very people who are trying to supply the people of afghanistan with the resources necessary to meet their most basic needs it is obvious that those who killed these aid workers oppose economic and social progress in afghanistan including access to medical care education and shelter these perpetrators must be brought to justice these terrorists who killed these six americans and four others are no different from the terrorists who throw acid in girls faces when they try to go to school they are the same terrorists who use children as human shields against american troops do we understand that these senseless killings are another terrible reminder of the brutality of the taliban and al qaeda foreign fighters do we understand that these murderers must be brought to justice no matter where they originated either in afghanistan or pakistan the people of afghanistan suffer every day from the cruelty of the taliban along with the families who lost loved ones the afghans suffer from the loss of these dedicated and courageous aid workers as a result of this brutal attack critical medical care will no longer be available to many of the afghans who were served by these humanitarian workers we in the united states need to understand that and we need to call for justice the afghan authorities must conduct an investigation and find these murderers no matter where they might be hiding or receiving sanctuary from various reports there are strong indications that the attackers were not local and some were speaking nonafghan languages given the location of the attack the proximity to taliban strongholds in nuristan a province that borders volatile areas of pakistan and given the crossborder nature of the afghan insurgency i strongly urge the government of pakistan to do its utmost to cooperate in rooting out extremism on its soil in particular the safe havens that exist on the pakistani side that have been the source of many acts of violence in both afghanistan and pakistan the safe havens for the taliban the al qaeda and the haqqani network must be eradicated this attack has been called by some the worst attack on humanitarian aid workers in three decades of conflict in

because we passed this this is just necessary it does remind me of a piece of legislation i introduced many years ago in the 1970s when we had rampant inflation which i anticipate will probably come back to this country back then we had a 15 percent inflation rate my suggestion then in the form of legislation to get the members attention to understand what inflation was all about i said we should take a pay cut at the rate of inflation even today we might suggest that there is a lot more inflation out there than we admit to so maybe not only should we freeze our salaries maybe we should be taking a pay cut so that we can do a better job because we really cant brag about the job that we have done for the country because of the condition the country is in but i would like to extend this motivation to freeze the pay of congressmen to freezing a few other things i would like to see our budget at least frozen where it is that would go a long way to solving some of our budgetary problems and how about freezing the debt level lets not raise the debt level instead this next year our national debt is going to go up about 2 trillion when you add up all that we borrow from our trust funds also i would like to see a freeze on regulations because regulations usually backfire there are unintended consequences they cost a lot of money they act as a tax and they dont improve the economy overall i would be in support of freezing the wealth transfer system the system that most people think is going to help all the poor people the trouble is the wealth transfer system helps the rich people and they are the ones who get the bailouts and the poor people dont so a freeze on wealth transfer would go a long way toward restoring a free society and a constitutional government also i think the consensus of the american people today is we ought to freeze the bailouts lets not bail out anybody anymore but it looks like it will be a long time before that happens because we have a monetary system where we have somebody over there called the federal reserve that says we can print money at will and our job is to be the lender of last resort that means to bail anybody and everybody out that needs money and it looks like that will be domestic as well as international i would like to freeze the ability of the federal reserve to print money out of thin air that in moral terms is counterfeit and yet that is the encouragement for us to run up our deficits because the fed can come in and increase the money supply a sound monetary system would have frozen anybodys ability to just create money out of thin air i would also like to freeze the income tax at the 1912 level and that indeed would be a real boost to the people of this country all of a sudden there would be great wealth in the hands of the consumer just think if all the money that we spent on the bailouts that just tided things over if just a portion of that had been used to get rid of the income tax i think the money would have been better spent because the people would have been spending the money instead of the bureaucrats and the politicians and the regulators that bailed out the people who were making all the money in the first place but i would also extend this freeze onto some other things too i would like to freeze some of our militarism i think we have enough fighting going on i dont think we should expand the war i dont think we should be looking for another enemy i would like to freeze the sanctions on countries i would like to see a lot more free trade i would like to see that the bombing is not extended that we quit allowing our cia to extend the bombing of countries that have not attacked us i would also like to put a freeze on this concept of preventive war this whole idea of the concept of preventive war means that we can literally start the war so yes its good that we are freezing the salaries of us here in the congress but if we really want to restore the republic we will freeze a lot of these other issues as well"], [0.9690660834312439, 0.9690660834312439, 0, "i yield myself as much time as i may consume in the last house resolution that

from our commander in chief barack obama in it his advisers suggest if this amendment is a part of the bill that they will be recommending to the president that he veto this bill indeed it is time for us to recognize that the war on terror is very real the challenge in afghanistan is supported by the president because he recognizes its very real and its one of the bases of operation for their

and we have to go out and take risks it seems to me that what we need to do is realize as a country that we should not be condemning businesses that are doing things to help people have jobs the service industry is not always the best paying industry and these are great jobs for students great jobs for people coming up with limited skills at the entry level the wonderful thing about it is that there is no sort of degree requirements so you dont have to have a college degree or ph d to manage a big resort if you have skills and you are able to deal with people and some business

by way of california he is going to be going for language training to monterey california let me say that my very good friend mr price has talked about the importance of speros work in dealing with the missions that have been put forth by this house and specifically the house democracy partnership and i would just like to say that when we look at the work of our partnership one of the very important things to note is the fact that we have gone to as mr price indicated some of the most troubled spots in the world when i think about trips to ulan bator mongolia monrovia liberia nairobi kenya and clearly kabul afghanistan the notion of congressional travel is one where i think the perception is that most travel takes place in other spots when in fact this house democracy partnership has been focused on a very important mission four years ago this spring when i had the privilege of beginning with mr price this partnership and took on the task of putting together the countries with which we were going to partner in working to build the parliaments i at the very outset looked to the united states marine corps now for full disclosure i have to say i am very partial my father sometimes i regretted this but my father was a drill instructor in the united states marine corps i regretted it the first 18 years of my life especially but i survived it one of the things that happened when i first had the opportunity to chair the house democracy partnership i made the decision that we wanted to have the united states marine corps play the important role of orchestrating and leading with the assistance that only they could provide these efforts frankly as we looked at the task that was before us it was very appropriate for the united states marine corps and up until now with the departure of deputy director koumparakis among other great people who have served in the past to take this task on because the united states marine corps are in fact on duty in embassies throughout the world they are on the frontline in those embassies and play a very important role and i happen to believewell i will say this many of the other branches with all due respect to every single one of them approached me and said that they wanted to play a role in doing this and i said the answer was yes they could as long as they enlisted in the united states marine corps so i cant say enough about speros koumparakis and the work he has done and the effort that the united states marine corps has put into especially the house democracy partnership what we have done as mr price said 15 countries 15 countries around the world new and reemerging democracies where we have had the task of trying to help them take these fragile democracies and build their parliaments when we think about it it is very important to recognize that our relationship is so often simply with the head of state but if we are going to build up democratic institutions there is none more important than parliaments that have independence and a very very good grasp and an opportunity for oversight at the executive branch and speros regularly understood that and played a key role in making sure that the house democracy partnership could complete its mission and so i simply want to join with my colleague mr price in extending congratulations to speros and to bree i know they are going to continue that very fine service to the united states of america in their work both in california and in buenos aires and we look forward to getting great reports on him"], [0.00033470988273620605,
