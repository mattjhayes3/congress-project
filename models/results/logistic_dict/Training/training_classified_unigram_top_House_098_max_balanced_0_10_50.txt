reason the liberal democrats although they did use the gentleman from colorado mr wiar were not willing to bring up the gentleman from colorado mr harts tax plan nor were they able or willing to bring up the gentleman from minnesota mr mondales plan and the reason is simple they would raise taxes so dramatically either mondale or hart or jackson any of the three would raise taxes so dramatically that we would enter a period of economic decay worse than jimmy carter we would look back on jimmy carter as the good democrat if in fact we had a chance to pass the mondale or the iiaut or the jackson increases as i mentioned earlier tonight let me just repeat mr mondale would increase taxes if you take his program by about 231 billion between 1985 and 1999 231 billion in tax increases of which approximately 160 billion would be paid by individual americans by contrast mr hart is even more liberal mr harts new ideas are very old ideas he would raise 300 billion in taxes between fiscal years 1985 and 1989 and about 200 billion in those taxes would be paid by individuals that is mr hart would raise taxes on the average american by almost 1 000 per american or 4 000 per family of four over that 4year period now i can well understand why the liberal democratic leadership did not want to trot out the budgets of their presidential candidates because the fact is that those budgets if they were seen by the american people would lead to an even more dramatic collapse of the liberal democratic campaign for the presidency one of the targets for both mr mondale and mr hart is indexing and yet indexing is one of the key defenses of working americans against inflation i have seen one study of the mondale indexing figures which suggests that mr mondale assumes that we will have 10percent inflation if he is president so that his indexing numbers only makes sense if you assume that americans are getting 10percent paper increases because of the inflation rate pushing them into

minage to convince the majority to utilize the rules to bring their interests to the floor whereas schoolchildren who want to pray are not necessarily that well organized so we have to abide by the

items but in this case the democratic majority felt it was sufficiently important that we vote on the era so it was brought up under this extraordinary procedure the only point i am making is that

look at some of it in a little more detail with a little more specificity because it seems to me that the issue that we have been facing over the last several days an issue that has to be put in tie context of building up over a period of some weeks now is how this house deals with the issues that are before the country now that the problem was that many of us perceived at the end of the first session of this congress as we were moving toward the second session of this congress was that we knew from going back home that were a vast variety of issues out in the countryside that the american people were conceri ed about but yet we did not seem to be addressing in the house of representatives some of those issues were dealt with if they were issues that the majority was interested in if the majority felt that there was good politics in bringing some of those issues to the floor of course they got dealt with however many of the issues issues like balanced budget issues like the crime control issues like dealing with drug purveyors issues like voluntary school prayer issues like lineitem veto many of those kinds of issues we had not been dealing with because they were issues of primary concern to the minority in this body but issues where the majority felt that politically they could be devastated by those issues being brought to the house floor so we asked ourselves as well as we could what are the avenues open to the minority within the rules of this house proceeding as the rules of this house permit us to that would allow us to bring those issues to the attention of the house and to the attention of the american people we took a look at that and we decided that there were few avenues that were open to us one avenue was through the unanimousconsent procedure we could come to the floor and we could ask unanimous consent that some of these matters be considered we could ask unanimous consent that a bill referring to those matters be brought to the floor for immediate consideration beginning early in this session we did that we came to the floor in 1minute speeches during the 1minute speech period time and began asking unanimous consent that the balanced budget amendment be brought to the floor that the voluntary school prayer amendment be brought to the floor that the lineitemveto amendment be brought to the floor for a couple of days we were permitted to proceed in that direction which is a direction that has been used around the house for some period of time i have often sat on the floor and heard whole measures brought up by unanimous consent which is what we were doing but then suddenly the rules were changed suddently the speaker made an announcement that we were going to be gagged on that particular procedure lie announced a new procedure whereby we would have to go to the minority leadership and the committees on the minority side and the majority leadership and the committees on the majority side and get clearance before we were permitted to bring those unanimous consents to the floor we acceded to that we went to the minority leadership and we got the clearance to bring the issues to the floor of course when we began to ask the majority leadership for their clearance we got none so we acceded we stopped raising those unanimousconsent requests we simply started making the statement that we had cleared it with the minority and were looking for majority sponsorship and of course never got it but we operated within the rules of the body seeking to bring issues to the floor that are legitimate issues but the majority immediately found a way to try to shut down that process another option we knew that was open to us was the option of discharge petitions as the gentleman from georgia mentioned earlier the dischargepetition route is one that we are still exploring and we are looking at the possibility of perhaps finding a way to make public the names that go on discharge petitions so that more force can be put into the discharge petition process we think public discharge petitions as a new rule in this house would be a good thing so we are exploring that but the problem with discharge petitions is that they are dependent upon at least some majority cooperation in order to bring them out they are not wholly something that the minority can do a minority of 168 or 169 people does not give us enough numbers to get 218 signatures so that is a rather iffy kind of process by which we can raise our issues the third thing we had available to us within the rules of the house to have our issues addressed was the special order process the special order process provided for the minority party the only time when we could take a block of time and discuss the issues that we wanted to discuss in the way we wanted to discuss them i raised that issue on the floor earlier today and there was an attempt as far as i was concerned to distort what i was saying on that i was told well of course the minority always gets blocks of time whenever bills are brought to the floor the minority is given half the time and that is absolutely true i do not quarrel with that the problem is that what we are doing during those blocks of time is we are discussing the things that the majority has brought to the floor they control the schedule they are not necessarily issues we want to discuss many times the issues being brought to the floor are being brought to the floor with the idea of embarrassing the minority of hoping to get them on the record during that block of time in order to have their

every three soldiers stationed abroad is in europe we hear a lot about the 1 200 marines in lebanon or the 55 trainers in el salvador we have many times that number in virtually every nato country let me examine for a moment whether this sort of concentration makes sense in military political or economic terms the economics are quite clear it costs a great deal of money to station house feed transfer support and maintain troops abroad the congressional budget office cbo estimated a couple of years ago that the withdrawal of a division 20 000 soldiers from europe would save 2 billion in onetime costs and another 500 million annually thereafter i suspect the potential savings have grown since the cbo report and i also guess that there would be further savings not included in the report still the point is that it costs a lot more money to keep a soldier abroad than at home the money we spend to maintain troops abroad comes in addition to contributions we make to support the nato infrastructure we have mainlained and increased our payments since we made a commitment in 1978 to increase defense spending by 3 percent annually in real terms our nato partners and japan have not made any similar increases according to the pentagon publication entitled report on allied contributions to the common defense issued a month ago the average increase in defense spending by nonamerican nato members and japan will be just 1 percent in 1983 despite the 3 percent pledge we all took in 1978 the rate of growth in defense spending among our allies averaged 2 2 percent in 1979

having been achieved while some nations might be amenable to modest increases in defense spending there are virtually no government which could survive substantial increases in defense spending at the

do somthfng about an employee who is still on the staff who may have engaged in this kind of behavior there is no doubt about that and if that is what we find we may well want to refer the matter to the ethics committee for that one question however there are questions of the rules of the house there is a question about how this whole matter came about the way in which the transcripts were handled there are questions relating to the integrity of the processes of the committees all of those things which go beyond the scope of the ethics committee which the ethics committee would have no jurisdiction to look into and the troublesome aspect is that if the person being investigated or persons being investigated were all of a sudden no longer to be employees of the house at some point or members of the house or whatever it is that investigation would halt immediately and there would be nothing further done we think that there are many things much further that need to be done on this matter and we would hope that we would have the kind of forum that would permit us to deal with the seriousness of the issue"], [5.328655242919922e-05, 0.5000532865524292, 0, "i am trying to be

that is to make sure that those people to whom we loan money through the imf do not get a better interest rate than our small businessmen in this country and much of that money goes to communist countries and the gentleman knows it"]]}
