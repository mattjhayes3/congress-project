reminding us tonight of much of this unfinished business of our great country and laying out the glaring disparities that were witnessing in the african american community but also what our economic empowerment agenda is of the congressional black caucus so thank you congresswoman tubbs jones millions of americans are one paycheck that is if they have a paycheck away from poverty now the numbers speak for themselves gas prices are at record levels averaging in my district 3 73 a gallon even as oil is traded at over 100 a barrel and big oil companies are reaping in record profits foreclosures have skyrocketed putting hundreds of thousands of people out on the street the american dream of homeownership is quickly turning into a nightmare for many hardworking individuals and families in our country in my district in alameda county we are projected to lose nearly 4 700 homes to foreclosures due to the subprime mortgage crisis eliminating 3 2 billion in home equity value thats equal to a drop in home equity by almost 8 500 for each homeowner in my district meanwhile food prices have risen squeezing recipients of food stamps even as the number of people expected to enroll in the program will reach a record 28 million people in the next fiscal year health care costs are going through the roof even as this administration is posing massive cuts in funding for medicare and l4dicaid and african americans continue to be the hardest hit as of february 2008 the unemployment rate for african americans was over 8 3 percent nearly double the national average of 4 3 percent among the african american community poverty rates are 2 5 times higher than the national average even more disturbing almost 40 percent of african american children under 5 years of age live in poverty and all the while african americans continue to be the target for as we talked about earlier subprime loans african americans are three times more likely to have a subprime loan than whites accounting for 52 percent of all subprime loans and as the housing market has collapsed estimates indicate that african americans alone will lose between 164 to 213 billion in home equity value during this recession its long past time for congress to address the burden of this economic downturn on the african american community and other communities of color and address the ongoing lack of opportunity in minority communities in america even in the face of this massive housing crisis and impending recession growing unemployment and the highest number of applicants for food stamps since the programs inception the bush administration wants to cut funding mind you cut funding for the most vital programs so that he can continue to fund his failed occupation in iraq this is partly due to iraq billions of dollars that have beenspent this economic downturn i personally call this the iraq recession at nearly half a trillion dollars the occupation of iraq and the resulting iraq recession has wasted too much of american treasure drained too much of our american resources and most importantly claimed too many american lives and we cannot dismiss the toll that this occupation has had on the economic security of our nation and on the average american family who will feel the impact of these expenses for years to come the joint economic committee estimates the total bill for the war through 2008 will cost the typical family of four a full 16 500 can you imagine what a family of four can do with 16 500 this conflict has claimed the lives of more than 4 000 brave members of our armed forces and has resulted in injuries to more than 28 000 others five years after the invasion and occupation of iraq 47 million americans are living without health insurance 47 million and more than 36 million people continue to live in poverty at least 2 million of which have fallen into poverty since 2003 five years later it is projected that more than 2 million american families will lose their homes to foreclosure primarily over the next 2 years and worse as the demand is increasing for programs serving children the elderly and the poor and those facing the loss of their income more than half of our states face serious budget shortfalls that will force them to cut back or even eliminate programs that serve the most vulnerable of our populations so we must address the needs and the will of our country by bringing an end to this occupation and to the immeasurable costs that will continue to be exacted on the physical and economic security of the american people for generations to come fortyone years ago dr martin luther king was as he said compelled to see the war as the enemy of the poor and attack it as such of course dr king was referring to the vietnam war but his understanding of the relationship between the vast sums spent dropping bombs in a foreign country and the resulting lack of funding for programs that relieve hunger and poverty are just as true today as they were back then especially now with this economic downturn a recent survey revealed that 68 percent of americans believe that ending the war and occupation in iraq is an important step the unitedstates government must take to respond to the current economic recession so we must put an end to this occupation and we must fund a real economic stimulus plan that expands unemployment assistance and food stamp benefits provides housing assistance and foreclosure relief for homeowners and expands medicaid payments to states through the federal medical assistance percentage we need to pass a real bankruptcy reform bill i believe this one that were working on now is h r 3609 its called the emergency home ownership and mortgage equity protection act of 2007 that will give struggling homeowners a fighting chance to stay in their homes weve got to reauthorize and realize that hope vi is an important important housing initiative and pass h r 3524 to finally stop putting an end to predatory lending and instead of spending billions to bail out bear stearns we should really be investing that money to train our workforce and to expand green jobs and eradicate poverty so as we remember 3 years ago hurricane katrina served as a real rude wake up call to the nation and the continuing inequality that plagues minority communities especially the african communities in america katrina opened the eyes of many americans about the continuing burden of poverty that often isolates and traps generations of americans of color african americans in a cycle of poverty and disenfranchisement so we cannot ignore the legacy of katrina nor can we ignore the legacy of dr kings words so this week as we approach the 40th anniversary of dr kings assassination let us all make a commitment to honor his vision and his lifes work we must end this occupation of iraq and we must enact a real economic stimulus plan so that the american people can move forward take care of their families come out of this downturn and really begin to live the type of life the quality of life that they so deserve in the wealthiest and most powerful country in the world thank you

show their commitment through their legislative work in a hearing at the early stages of his leadership when we were allowed to present solutions they were not republican solutions or democratic solutions they were solutions for those of us who love america and i just want to simply reinforce that i thank mr skelton for his leadership i have legislation that declares a military success and i rise today to make it clear that i believe that the fallen in battle are heroes and those who still fight carry their banner for 3 611 have died and i dont know why were not on this floor declaring a military victory thanking our soldiers and my good friend from texas says thai he supports the iraq study group so do i and i have legislation we all have legislation that responds to the iraq study group i might remind him that that report bipartisan report speaks articulately to redeployment and so when we look at the costs of the war 120 billion americans are asking should one more drop of blood be shed and my answer to that is no should we engage yes should we involve in the surge of diplomacy absolutely we want to make sure that all of those nation states can work to help solve the divide the civil war but we must face the facts that this process that the president is continuing to repeat does not work it is wracked with corruption and misdirection there were no weapons of mass destruction as a member of the homeland security committee i have been disturbed this whole week as i listened to the secretary of homeland security speak about his gut feeling of the possibility of a terrorist attack im a member of that committee i live every day with the idea that the question will be asked by americans to the homeland security committee and the homeland security department does the secretary realize that we have fueled the fires of terrorism by training terrorists in this war and so when i speak of why we must end it is to save lives it is to reconcile iraq and it is to make america safer i ask for support of the underlying legislation i rise in strong support of h r 2956 the responsible redeployment from iraq act i rise in strong support of this legislation because i am listening and responding to the will of the american people last november 2006 americans went to polls by the millions united in their resolve to vote for change they voted for a new direction and a change in the bush administrations disastrous policy in iraq the new democratic majority heard them and responded by passing h r 1591 the iraq accountability act the president vetoed the bill demanding instead a continuation of the ancien r6gime under which the republicanled congress gave him a blank check to mismanage the occupation and reconstruction of iraq those days are over no matter how many veto threats the president issues this congress is not going to give him a blank check to escalate and continue the war ad infinitum it is long past time for change in iraq it is time for the people and government of iraq to take primary responsibility for their own country it is time for the president to recognize the reality on the ground in iraq the time when a surge in troops is useful and necessary is past it is now time to redeploy our troops and launch a diplomatic surge for national and political reconciliation in iraq h r 2956 will help achieve this goal and that is why i support the measure there is no more important issue facing the congress the president and the american people than the war in iraq it is a subject which agitates the passions of all americans including members of congress the framers understood that while the military does the fighting a nation goes to war that is why the framers lodged the power to declare war in the congress the branch of govemnment closest to the people they knew that the decision to go to war was too important to be left to the whim of a single person no matter how wise or wellinformed he or she might be four years ago president bush stood under a banner that proclaimed mission accomplished if the mission was to further place our troops in harms way at the hands of insurgents and sectarian violence then it is mission accomplished after spending more than 450 billion sacrificing the lives of 3 611 of americas finest citizensoldiers what have we accomplished and where are we headed i cannot support the presidents waging of a war that has no clear direction does not meet the benchmarks that the president set and has no visible target four years after launching the invasion conquest and occupation of iraq the evidence is clear and irrefutable the preemptive invasion of iraq while a spectacularly executed military operation was a strategic blunder without parallel in the history of american foreign policy this is what can happen when the congress allows itself to be stampeded into authorizing a president to launch a preemptive war of choice it is time to change our strategy in iraq it is time to engage the key stakeholders in the middle east and make real strides towards securing a just and lasting peace in iraq and for the iraqi people and most important bring our troops home so they can be reunited with their families friends and neighbors that is why i support h r 2956 the responsible redeployment from iraq act requires a responsible redeployment of unitedstates troops beginning within 120 days of enactment and ending by april 1 2008 the legislation requires the president to publicly justify the postredeployment missions for the unitedstates military in iraq and the minimum number of troops necessary to carry out those missions this legislation is consistent with the advice of military and foreign policy experts ensures the safety of our men and women in uniform addresses our commitment to fighting terrorism and reflects the will of the american people the need for a new direction in iraq could not be clearer in the face of mounting evidence that progress is not being made in iraq military leaders defense experts republican and democratic members of congress and the american people are demanding change yet the president continues to urge continued support for a failed policy that is not making america safer or supporting our troops in a report released today by the white house the administration concedes that violence continues in iraq and that the iraqi government has failed to meet key benchmarks endorsed by the president in january and political reconciliation is nonexistent by thebush administrations own admission there is unsatisfactory progress on all of the political reconciliation benchmarks announced by the president on january 10 2007 in fact just this week the national security network reported that since the president announced his surge policy 6 months ago more than 25 000 troops have been sent to iraq approximately 600 have been killed and more than 3 000 have been wounded president bush and vice president cheney have been given numerous chances and ample time by the american people and the congress to straighten out the mess in iraq they have failed it is little wonder that the criticism of the administrations failed policy in iraq is mounting by the day respected military leaders like ltg william odom have spoken forcefully according to lieutenant general odom no effective new strategy can be devised for the united states until it begins withdrawing its forces from iraq only that step will break the paralysis that now confronts us key republican senators are joining the chorus of critics in addition to foreign relations committee ranking member senator richard lugar some of the presidents allies in congress have spoken out senator pete domenici says theres no reason to wait trying to tell that he must change his ways because there is nothing positive happening senator elizabeth dole says it is my firm hope and belief that we can start bringing our troops home in 2008 senator lamar alexander says the president

opposed giving president bush the authority to wage the iraq war and ever since i have opposed every supplemental bill that has come to this floor to pay for the war in iraq during each supplemental debate i voiced concern that congress was essentially giving president bush a blank check to wage the war as he saw fit i voiced frustration that the bush administration was unwilling to face the realities on the ground in iraq and that republican congresses refused to provide proper oversight of billions of dollars that were handed out to contractors like halliburton last november the american people sent a clear message that the status quo in iraq was no longer acceptable march 21 2007 h2800 co they entrusted congress to democrats in the hopes that we would help take our iraq policy in a new direction so that we could bring our troops home soon the emergency supplemental addresses the concerns of the american people it is a serious piece of legislation that brings together into one bill the recommendations of the nonpartisan iraq study group military generals the pentagon and even the president himself it provides us the first real opportunity to change course and therefore it deserves the support of anyone who believes the status quo is no longer acceptable the supplemental takes into consideration the views of military generals and military experts who have said for months now that there is no longer a military solution possible in iraq instead they say the only way to end the civil war that is raging in iraq is through political and diplomatic means

diplomatic benchmarks that the president himself set and that if serious improvements are not seen in the coming months then we will begin the process of redeploying our troops out of iraq this only makes sense if the iraqi government continues to believe that unitedstates involvement there is indefinite what kind of pressure are they going to have to make the necessary political reforms they are not and that is why both this pressure and a date certain for responsible redeployment are so important this legislation also begins the process of redirecting the bush administrations attention to

taliban in addition it will reinforce our humanitarian efforts in that wartorn country we must work to give poor farmers an alternative to the illicit opium trade that is rampant throughout

feet and yelling no are we now to belibve that these same liberal democrats standing before us today with a salesman smile on their face are we to believe them that they are now declaring that this is a prodrilling bill the american people are not fools they wont be taken in by this sham of a bill that will actually lock down americans ocean oil reserves there are two phrases that come to mind about this bill the first is grasping at straws which is defined as trying to find reasons to be hopeful about a bad situation the second phrase is fig leaf which means tomething you use to try to hide an embarrassing fact or problem with this bill democrats are grasping at straw fig leaves theres an election coming up and democrats are desperately in search of political cover political cover for their long record of opposing drilling and producing more americanmade energy this straw fig leaf bill was written in secret there were no public hearings on this bill the first copy of it was made public at 9 45 last night barely 12 hours ago and its 290 pages long the democratcontrolled rules committee blocked every single member of this house from being able to offer their ideas for improving this bill no amendments were allowed to the bill so democrats are simply playing a political game everybody knows this bill will never pass congress and become law but dont take my word for it democrat senator mary landrieu of louisiana said this bill is dead on arrival in the senate and when you examine the details of this bill it certainly deserves to be dead it permanently locks up vast amounts of americas oil and gas reserves including more than 10 billion with a b 10 billion barrels of oil on alaskas remote north slope it leaves 88 percent of americas offshore energy resources locked up it increases taxes by billions of dollars taxes which will land squarely on the shoulders of american consumers and it permanently bans drilling within 50 miles of american shores now why is this fact important its important because according to the interior department of the nearly 10 billion again b barrels of oil believed to be offshore in california only 5 percent is beyond the 50mile barrier what this simply means is that this bill permanently bans drilling on 95 percent of the oil believed to be off the coast of california as if a permanent ban on drilling in the first 50 miles offshore were not enough drilling between 50 and 100 miles out would also be effectively banned by refusing to allow states to share in revenue generated by offshore drilling this bill guarantees that drilling offshore will never be permitted by the states right now states along the gulf of mexico are paid a share of the oil produced in those waters under this bill royalty sharing wont be allowed as a result states would have no incentive to allow any drilling whatsoever in fact i would submit they would hare a disincentive why would a state allow someone to come into their back yard and pay them no share of the profits that would be made by the offshore drilling it is the equivalent of the government opening a starbucks or a mcdonalds franchise in your garage or family home but paying you nothing even to alleviate the cost of dealing with the impacts of that business and consider this if this is truly a drilling bill why is there no outcry from the radical environmental special interests its because they know that drilling will never happen under this plan those who are opposed to drilling can vote for this bill secure in the knowledge that drilling will never actually happen under this sham bill my district in central washington is the home of grand coulee dam and vast amounts of hydropower it is the home of the only nuclear plant in the pacific northwest it is home to the vast majority of wind farms in washington state and it is home to the pacific northwest national lab a leader in renewable energy research those who call central washington home believe in an alloftheabove plan that lowers energy prices that means promoting alternative energy sources like wind and solar power recognizing a need for more nuclear power protecting our valuable hydropower dams and also allowing drilling offshore in alaska and on other federal lands but this bill does not address those issues the democrat plan just means billions of dollars in higher taxes more government mandates that will increase costs for everyone and a permanent ban on most of our offshore resources i believe that the american people deserve a vote on legislation that truly expands alternative energy sources and lifts the ban on offshore drilling and in alaska they deserve a vote on h r 6566 the american energy act but the liberal leaders of this congress have blocked a fair yesorno vote on this bill for months they blocked a fair yesorno vote because i believe they know if it were on the floor it would likely pass barack obama joe bden harry reid and nancy pelosi control the democrat party here in this congress they oppose drilling they have fought and blocked it for years every time drilling has come up theyve said no no no and this bill is just more of the same because it says no drilling in alaska no to truly lifting the offshore drilling ban no to opening up oil shale in the western united states no to hydropower as a renewable energy source no to noncarbon emitting nuclear power no to building new refineries here in america and no to clean coal and coaltoliquid technology the only thing that the democrat bill says yes to are tax increases permanent bans on drilling and continued high prices before i conclude my opening remarks i want to shine the light on an area of this bill that has not gotten much attention partly because no one had a copy to read this bill before 9 45 last night of serious concern are the costly new mandates included in the national renewable energy standard that thisbill creates the most likely and certain result of this is to increase the power bills of almost every american family and business that it affects thats right the democrat bill isnt going to lower gas prices but it will increase power bills the most egregious of it all is that this new mandate is slanted and biased by saying solar and wind power are renewable under the standard but that hydropower isnt this discrimination against hydropower is absolutely ridiculous hydropower is the most abundant source of renewable energy in our country hydropower is renewable clean nonemitting nonpolluting and a reliable energy source those are the facts and consider this if capturing the sun shining and the wind blowing is renewable energy then so is water running downhill which is precisely what hydro is all about but believe it or not it is not renewable by definition under this bill when democratswho just days ago were proudly declaring their careerlong opposition to oil drillingare suddenly preaching the merits of this selfproclaimed drilling bill you know its really hard not to laugh except for the fact that families workers farmers schools and small businesses are struggling under the high cost of gasoline and really this democrat congress is doing nothing to help instead of real solutions to real problems of high gas and energy prices that americans are facing this democrat congress has chosen to look after themselves in writing this bill what do i mean by that this bill will do nothing nothing but give democrats a talking point and a 30second television commercial where they can smile and claim

related agencies appropriations bill provides for modest but crucial funding increases in a number of areas including 437 million above the presidents request for the clean water state revolving fund that will allow approximately 150 communities to modernize their drinking water and wastewater infrastructure 200 million increase over 2007 levels for the national park service to end a decade of declines in staffing visitor services and maintenance 900 million more than the president proposed for epa enforcement and scientific research this bill protects coastal ecosystems and communities by maintaining the longstanding moratoria on oil and gas drilling on the outer continental shelf this restriction protects the california coastlines that my constituents and i hold dear finally after years of denials and stonewalling by republicans this bill recognizes that climate change is a reality and requires us to act it would create a commission on climate change adaptation and mitigation to make recommendations on how to best respond to climate change this long overdue step will allow us to begin to address the many challenges that global warming presents president bush has issued a veto threat and called this bill irresponsible and excessive what is truly irresponsible is wasting billions of dollars on a fraudulent war while ignoring the threat of global warming and failing to protect the environment and the public health this bill begins to alter the dangerous environmental course that the president and the republicans have led us down the last 6 years i urge my colleagues to join me in voting yes"]], "top_incorrect": [[0.9993246181402355, 0.0006753818597644567, 1, "but why not cut off funding for the war and what did mr murtha say well you dont have the votes to do that we dont have the votes to do that you just cant go forth and the public doesnt wantthey dont want that to happen so the contortions that you see on behalf of the majority party on this issue are because their desire their zeal to end support for our men and women who are defending liberty and fighting tyranny and fighting terror around the world dont mesh they dont mesh there are some who get it right though throughout congress some members of the majority party who anderstand and appreciate what their leadership is trying to do one of those is senator joseph lieberman from connecticut speaker pelosi was quoted as saying democrats have proposed a different course of action over and over again we have suggested a different plan and senator lieberman was very sage when he said any alternatives that i have heard ultimately dont work they are all about failing they are all about withdrawing and i think allowing iraq to collapse would be a disaster for the iraqis for the middle east and for us slow bleed slow bleed that is a sad and dangerous time when we find our majority party here in the united states house of representatives supporting a policy that would remove the ability for our troops to do what they must do to defend our liberty what is our principle on our side of the aisle what is the republican principle well the principle is that our troops incombat deserve to be sent the resourses and the reinforcemepts that they need to succeed in their mission in iraq without strings and without delay without strings and without delay we have as a matter of fact a piece of legislation that would do just that representative sam johnson from texas a war hero truly a war hero an individual who spent years in a prisoner of war camp in vietnam an individual who knows of the challenges that troops face when involved with an enemy that is ferocious but an individual who understands and appreciates that from this chamber from that congress you cannot micromanage a war and when you attempt to do that as a congress when you attempt to have 435 members of congress who want to all be generals or 100 members of the united states senate who want to all be generals or commanders in chief when you have that it doesnt work it cant work it is impossible so if you want to have the vote i tell my friends i ask my friends i challenge my friends in the majority party if you want to have the vote on whether or not we ought to simply cut off the funding to support our troops in iraq and afghanistan let us have that vote let us have that vote i would be interested in the outcome of that i doubt we would get 100 votes in support of that and it wouldnt because that is not what the american people want the american people dont want failure and that is the prescription that the democrats the majority party are giving us we have a bill house resolution 511 introduced by representative sam johnson as i mentioned and it is very simple it states what the prihciple ought to be when american military forces are in harms way and that principle says as this resolution says congress will not cut off or restrict funding for units and members of the armed forces that the commander in chief has deployed in harms way in support of operation iraqi freedom and operation enduring freedom that is it that is it the problem with that is that that doesnt fit the bumpersticker politics of the majority party that doesnt fit the orwellian democracy of the majority party that doesnt fit the hypocritical actions that are being taken by the majority party and consequently this bill is languishing in committee there is a discharge petition which as you know is a petition that members of the house of representatives can sign to be able to bring legislation out of the committee when it is against the will of the leadership that discharge petition was begun today what it allowsis members of the house of representatives when there are a majority of them and that takes 218 members when there is a majority of them who sign that then that bill then comes to the floor of the house for a vote so i challenge my friends on both sides of the aisle house resolution 511 sign the discharge petition this is principle this is principle this is truth this is the kind of support that our men and women deserve it is not feigned support it is not orwellian support it doesnt say yes i support you and then pull the rug out from under you it is not hypocritical support it doesnt say we want to support you so very very much but we are not going to do what it takes this says it all it says that we will not cut off or restrict funding for units or members that are deployed in harms way whycant we have a vote on that mr speaker what are they afraid of mr speaker what are they afraid of i would suggest they are afraid of the fact that this would pass on the floor of the house of representatives this bill would pass and because it doesnt fit their political agenda their political agenda then i doubt that we will see it unless we can get 218 members of the house of representatives to sign the discharge petition so what about this bill that they are going to bring to the floor what about this supplemental bill that the majority party is planning to bring to the floor this week of course we have been told it would be earlier than this so they seem to be having some difficulty within their own ranks in garnering support but what the bill does as we understand it is to put in place an inflexible timeline an inflexible timeline that says that the troops must come home regardless of what is happening on the ground unless the mission is completely accomplished in essence well as you know in battle and in war it is just not possible to have 535 commanders in chief that is not the way our system works not the way it ought to work not the way our founders envisioned it in fact it is curious when the articles of confederation were written and our nation was formed some of the aspects of those articles didnt work very well so the match 20 2007 cc founders ofour great nationgot together in a constitutional convention and they worked on issues to try to make certain that this federalist system this united states could come together and work together and one of the first things that they did was recognize that in the articles of confederation there were no provisions for a commander in chief so one of the easiest things that they were able to do was to get consensus on the fact that the commander in chief ought to be one individual and that that individual ought to be the president of the united states and the executive branch and that that was the only way to work it because obviously you couldnt have countless members of the house of representatives or countless members of the united states senate who were functioning as commanders in chief it doesnt work and they recognized that so putting in place an inflexible timeline that culminates with a date certain for the withdrawal micromanages our commanders in the field and it undermines the efforts of our troops on the ground i believe that i believe that putting in place the kind of artificial timelines and artificial constraints on our commanders on our generals on our troops would be a disaster it doesnt make any sense all it does is make political points and that isnt fact isnt fact it is just not republicans who believe that that would be the wrong course there is a remarkable orchestra of individuals and groups all around the nation that are standing up now and speaking out against the foolishness of that kind of proposal i cite for you the washington post now the washington post is a wonderful newspaper it has been around for a long time but nobody would contend that the washington post was a very conservative newspaper or a great friend of conservative thought nobody would contend that but what does the washington post say about this plan of the majority about the democrat plan they say it is an attempt to impose detailed management on a war without regard for the war itself that was written on march 13 just 1 week ago an attempt to impose detailed management on the war without regard for the war itself what volumes that speaks when you think about where it is coming from it is not coming from individuals who would have any political chip no political reason to embarrass the majority party or to call them out on a policy that may not necessarily be very sound what that does is demonstrate that they understand and appreciate the consequence of adopting what is supposed to come to this floor this week as the iraq war supplemental would be devastating for the nation of iraq for the middle east for the united states and yes for the world we have heard a lot about the iraq study group the iraq study group was the bipartisan group that got together actually a group that began because representative frank wolf a republican in this house added it to a piece of legislation that was passed almost a year ago what it said is that we ought to have a bipartisan group get together and work in a non political way to make recommendations to the executive branch and to congress about how to move forward in iraq they came up with a number of recommendations we hear it all the time from the other side that the iraq study group didnt endorse this or didnt propose this or didnt support that that they supported a withdrawal of the troops from iraq that they didnt support any escalation in the number in fact if you look on page 73 of the iraq study group that is another fact if you look on page 73 of the iraq study group report it in fact supports an escalation a small escalation of the number of troops in iraq what they also did was oppose a date certain for withdrawal again a fact i quote from one of the cochairman former secretary of state james baker who said in testifying before the united states senate committee on foreign relations the study group set no timetables and we set no deadlines we believe that military commanders must have the flexibility to respond to events on the ground i hope that my colleagues here in the house heard that i hope that they are listening because what they are saying what the iraq study group said is exactly what we are saying now and that is that this supplemental bill that has artificial timetables and artificial deadlines that are capricious and politically motivated clearly that that kind of action is not appropriate it wasnt called for by the iraq study group and would not allow the military commanders to have the flexibility that they need to succeed how about the los angeles times again not a paper in our nation that has tended to be terribly friendly to conservatives or republicans the los angeles times in an editorial on march 12 when it had reviewed what the majority party was proposing in this supplemental iraq war resolution to fund the hard incredibly diligently working men and women who are defending liberty what did the los angeles times say well the los angeles times called for the bill to be vetoed vetoed why would they do that i appreciate our receiving a message from the senate the message from the senate is that a senate bill was passed and we are pleased to see that we look forward to the time when the senate will take up some of the legislation that the house majority has passed that they have been so terribly proudof and look forward to working in concert on that legislation but i was talking about the supplemental war resolution that will come forward the bill that will provide for appropriate funding of our troops in harms way defending liberty and defending us and the proposal that is coming from the majority party is a proposal that would micromanage the operations of our troops it is a proposal that has been described as slow bleed which is a proposal that means that you will defund you will remove the funding from the men and women who are working so valiantly to defend us that is not just an opinion from our side of the aisle that is an opinion from all over many people are recognizing that the washington post as i mentioned had an editorial that criticized the majority party for coming forward with it the iraq study group supports in fact a minor small escalation in the number of troops and never said never said that they agreed with artificial timelines the los angeles times again a paper that has not been noted for its friendliness to our side of the aisle called for the bill to be vetoed they called for the bill to be vetoed why did they do so they said it is absurd for house speaker nancy pelosi to try to micromanage the conflict and the evolution of iraqi society with arbitrary timetables and benchmarks that is a fact march 12 of this year the los angeles times calls the war supplemental absurd and what about the national intelligence estimate the national intelligence estimate which was released in january warned of the dangers of early troop withdrawal they said that if coalition forces were withdrawn rapidly during the term of this estimate we judge that this almost certainly would lead to a significant increase in the scale and scope of sectarian conflict in iraq i think it is important to give credibility to the national intelligence estimate those are the folks that determine in an objective way in a non political way what are the consequences or prospective consequences of actions that this nation takes this poster here talks about the consequences of failure it is important that we talk about the consequences of failure because many people not just on our side of the aisle but many people around this nation including the washington post including the los angeles times have concluded for themselves that the proposal that the majority party has put forward is a bill that will result in defeat or failure in iraq so it is important that we look at the consequences of failure for our nation what are the consequences of failure this is from the national intelligence estimate what they say is that iraqi security forces would be subject to sectarian control that interference by neighboring countries would occur in an open conflict that means iran syria other neighboring countries that massive civilian casualties and population displacement would occur massive civilian casualties i wonder if the majority party the leadership in the majority party has considered the consequences of that what would happen al qaeda in iraq would plan increased attacks inside and outside of iraq and spiraling violence and political disarray including kurdish attempts at autonomy in kirkuk clearly clearly failure failure will result in a much worse situation for the people in iraq the people in the middle east i would suggest much more danger in the middle east and for our friends in israel and it would result in a much more dangerous situation i believe for the united states of america so what are they doing what is the other side doing to try to pass this piece of legislation this hypocritical piece of legislation this piece of legislation that they are having such difficulty doing because again what the american people want and what they in their rhetoric what the majority party in their rhetoric say are two completely different things so what are they having to do well they are having to use a lot of what has come to be known in this town as pork the original estimate for the bill was about 100 billion about 100 billion the other side has now added over 20 billion to the bill and what are they doing mr speaker they are buying votes they are buying votes i would suggest that an emergency bill this is an emergency bill to fund our troops is not the appropriate vehicle for unrelated spending either foreign or domestic our troops ought not be bargaining chips our troops ought not be bargaining chips that is what the majority party is doing quoted here in a publication here in washington earlier this month it says democratic leaders see this emerging strategy as a way to encourage their liberal members to vote for the supplemental budget bill this emerging strategy is buying votes adding all sorts of items to the bill curiously this party the majority party ran in their campaign on this wonderful issue of fiscal responsibility financial responsibility making certain that everything that came through congress was paid for they call it paygo payasyougo make certain that you have got the resources in place in order to pay for whatever proposal you are moving forward well they have virtually thrown that out the window we have had a number of amendments on bills that would hold their feet to the fire and make certain that they were accountable on this paygo issue and they have defeated everything that would make them accountable they are doing the same thing here they willfully abandoned their pledge of fiscal responsibility not long ago they pledged to follow payasyougo budget rules and spending restraints to curb the deficit and this bill would not be subject to paygo last year it is important to appreciate that house republicans rejected a 14 billion increase in nonemergency spending that the senate tried to attach to an emergency troop funding bill 14 billion was saved for the american taxpayer in a bill that came to the floor of the house from the senate just last year under a different majority we saved 14 billion the majority party now is going to spend if they have their way with this bill at least 21 billion more than has been requested that is important because this is an emergency bill and as such it doesnt come under the normal budgetary rules so if they are able to spend 21 billion in this piece of legislation then what happens is that they dont need to spend that 21 billion in the normal course of activity in the normal budgetary process so it frees up another 21 billion and in fact what you get is 42 billion of more spending extra spending but our troops deserve the resources that should be in this bill the finite resources the resources that the president and the generals and the commanders in the field have requested they should be able to receive those resources now not after not after our friends on the other side of the aisle in the majority party carry out this incredible political charade of voting on a bill that will never become law in its current form because the senate the senate wont go along they have in essence said so there are some incredible quotes that i have regarding this issue of micromanaging the war and this issue of loading the bill up with pork there is a democratic claim earlier this year just last week as a matter of fact frbm majority leader steny hoyer who said there is no micromanaging of the war period as you know i already have outlined that individuals outside of the republican party and the republican cause have reached the conclusion that yes in fact this is micromanagement again the los angeles times editorial where they said it is absurd that they try to micromanage the war the washington post editorial said in short the democratic proposal to be taken up this week is an attempt to impose detailed management on a war without regard for the war itself aggressive oversight is quite different from mandating military steps according to an inflexible timetable even some of their own members have reached the conclusion that this indeed is micromanaging the war representative dan boren of oklahoma said just 2 weeks ago it is still micromanaging of the war this plan that our friends on the other side of the aisle have truly does a disservice to the discussion does a disservice to the debate makes it seem that all votes are for sale here in washington to members of the house really it is a cynical ploy spending the kind of money they are proposing to spend is not helpful at all where are they planning to put some of that money it is important to look at that we talk about the iraq emergency war supplemental an extra 21 billion where would some of that money go well 1 8 billion in crop disaster assistance it may be appropriate money to be spent but in an emergency war supplemental it is absolutely the wrong place if you will recall if this house if this majority party has its way and puts that money there what it will allow them to do is increase somewhere else spending by 1 8 billion and follow their shadow paygo rules 60 million for salmon fisheries it truly is a cynical ploy on the part of this majority party if they continue to march down this road of packing this legislation with all sorts of extraneous spending that nobody in their logical correct factual truthful mind could conclude was related to the emergency war supplemental 60 million for salmon fisheries 25 million for spinach growers spinach growers may indeed need some emergency assistance but in an emergency war supplemental i think not 50 million for asbestos abatement in the capitol and it goes on and on and on as we know there are very specific guidelines in this bill for our troops very specific dates about when they must be at a certain place in the accomplishment in the engagement in the execution of the challenges that they have before them very specific in this bill there is very specific language about the amount of money that is available for the troops and when it would be cut off if in fact those arbitrary timelines and benchmarks were not met but mr speaker i learned this afternoon something very very interesting and that is there is a significant amount of money for livestock american livestock in this bill that is real pork if you will it may be upwards of billions of dollars but i cant tell you exactly what it is because in the language of the bill it says that the amount of money that will be available for this livestock provision will be such sums as may be necessary that is unlimited and it struck me as truly ironic and sad that this majority party this democrat leadership believes we ought to have an unlimited amount of funds for livestock in this nation and a finite and limited amount of money for our troops in the field that contrast just speaks volumes it speaks volumes about the cynicism with which this hquse is being led about the hypocrisy by which this bill is being brought to the floor an unlimited amount of money for livestock in america and finite limited amounts of money and arbitrary guidelines arbitrary timelines for our troops in the field it saddens me it saddens me to serve in a body where the majority party has a leadership that is that cynical and brings the debate and the items that we discussed here on the floor of the house to a point that is so very very trite really so very very trite i have only a few minutes left and i wanted to spend a few moments discussing the larger issue the larger war qn terror i think it is important we do that because when the american people think about the issue in iraq and whether or not we ought to be there and the debate can be had about whether or not we ought to be there and that is an appropriate debate to have and i wish we could have an honest and open debate and an honest and open vote on whether or not we ought to be there a single vote on that but the majority party has seen not to bring that kind of open and honest debate to the floor of the house of representatives but when americans think about what is going on in the world they understand and appreciate that however things have been executed or delivered in iraq the activity that has gone on on behalf of the american people in iraq although they may have problems with that they understand and appreciate that the bigger picture the larger war on terror is a challenge that we must recognize in america and we all must face it is a challenge and the facing of an enemy the likes of which we have never seen you dont have to go far to find examples of that in fact the best examples i have found are those that come from the selfproclaimed enemies themselves this is a quote from abu musab aizarqawi an individual with whom we had as far as i know no concerns before he decided that he wanted to become a mortal enemy of the free world he acted upon that in a way that has been extremely treacherous he said we have declared a fierce war on this evil principle of democracy and those who follow this wrong ideology well that is a little chilling but it is important that we recognize that is the nature of the enemy in this war on terror the consequences of not engaging and not being certain that we prevail in this war on terror the consequences of failure in that activity would deliver a death knell to our society the issue is as large as that i try to visit schools in my district the sixth district of georgia as often as possible and i like to talk to young people and get their perspective on their life and what they see in the future most of them are very very hopeful and i share that hope and optimism for the future of our nation but oftentimes when we are talking about government and talking about politics and talking about the issues of the day i will ask them especially the middle school students and the high school students i will ask them do you believe the united states will continue to survive forever and it is an interesting question because it forces one to think well what allows us to survive right now what has been put in place that allows us to survive right now most young people when you ask them that question they have not really ever thought about that they have not thought about what has brought about the preservation of our nation the longest surviving democracy in the history of the world it is a remarkable question to ask most of them have not ever thought about it but when they do think about it they understand the gravity of the question they understand that there are challenges in this world they understand there are people like abu musab a1zarqawi out there who want to see the end of our nation as we know it that is not our opinion that is his stated fact that is what he has said that he wants to do so the gravity of the challenge that we have facing us is real and the magnitude of it is remarkable and the ferocity of the enemy is unlike any we have ever faced when i get individuals to tell me well if you just think about this in the way we fought world war ii or previous wars in which we prevailed then you will appreciate we need to do x y and z but i would suggest that the enemy that we are up against is not like any enemy we have faced if you dont believe me all you have to do is think about the terrorist plot and the attacks that were foiled because of the wonderful intelligence work on the part of great britain and the united states and pakistan last august and that plot as you will remember was a plot to bring down at least 10 or more civilian airlines carrying enough people who were flying across the atlantic ocean to bring them down in a terrorist act so they could kill more people than were killed on 9 11 so they had to have 10 or a dozen planes that they would work in concert to bring down that plot was foiled that was a real plot that was a real plan on the part of our enemy and that plan itself is chilling enough but when you realize and appreciate that two of the individuals who were apprehended and had participated in the planning of that and were intent on carrying out that act were a married couple a mom and a dad with an 8monthold child and they were going to use that 8monthold childs baby food in the airplane to be the vessel for carrying the bomb on board they were going to kill themselves and their 8monthold child and bring down a plane and kill as many lhnocent civilians as they could mr speaker that is an enemy whose ferocity we cant even comprehend that is an enemy who says we have declared a fierce war on this evil principle of democracy and those who follow this wrong ideology that is an enemy the likes of which we have never seen and that is an enemy that requires that we in the united states house of representatives work in concert together that understand and ap preciate the gravity of our time of this time and make certain that we do all that we can to follow the principles that have allowed us to become the longestsurviving democracy on the face of the earth part of those principles are embodied in the united states constitution part of that united states constitution that has allowed us to prevail and to have the greatest amount of success and provide the greatest amount of freedom for the greatest number of people ever in the history of mankind part of those principles stipulate that there is one commander in chief not 535 so if the majority party wants to have a vote about whether or not we want to end the funding for the battle that our commander in chief believes we must be engaged in in order to make this next step in the larger war on terror if the majority party wants to have that vote then lets have that vote but to do so as they are planning to do this week in a cynical and hypocritical way to load up the bill with so much extraneous spending tens of billions of dollars in order to buy votes to pass this hypocritical and cynical bill that micromanages this incredibly important endeavor that we are engaged in right now is wrong it does an injustice and a disservice to not just this body but our entire nation i urge my colleagues to encourage leadership on both sides of the aisle to support that open and honest debate i know on our side we are ready for that debate we are ready for that debate i would hope that the speaker and the democrat leadership would encourage and support that debate as well 0l 2115 it is an incredible privilege to come to the floor of the house and share these words i thank my leadership for that opportunity it is very humbling to serve in the united states house of representatives a body in which 10 000 or 11 000 or so individuals have served in the history of our nation it is a great responsibility in serving in this body but the primary responsibility is to make certain that we do all that we can to preserve and protect our constitution and our nation i would suggest humbly that the bill thatis being proposed by the majority leadership this week on the supplemental emergency war resolution is not a bill that does a service to our nation and does credit to the work of this house of representatives i urge my colleagues to bring forth the bill that will show that in fact we do indeed support the troops in harms way"], [0.9909633994102478, 0.9909633994102478, 0, "repealing subsidies to the profitrich oil companies and

the rule which was based on language previously adopted in this house by a vote of 4165 rollcall vote 171 with all republicans including my good friend from washington voting in favor of the amendment let me take this opportunity to clear up what must be a further misunderstanding on the part of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle contrary to what my good friend the gentleman from

friend and former member of the rules committee the gentleman from utah the provision in the rule was based ori language passed on april 9 2008 during consideration of h r 2016 the national landscape

the text of the amendment and i have copies of the section of the congressional record that contain the debate and the vote on the aitmire amendment i also want to point out that the selfexecuting language in the rule is not an unusual or unprecedented procedure it was done numerous times when the other side was in the majority as my good friend from california alluded to in committee testimony on tuesday its a legitimate tool available to address concerns in a bill the amendment that we are selfexecuting is nearly identical to the altmire language the rules committee believes that this language improves the bill and it is entirely reasonable to selfexecute language with a track record of overwhelming bipartisan support in the house those members who dont like the language are perfectly able to vote against the rule now the question of gas prices certainly this is an important issue that has been addressed by this house a number of times we have seen oil climb to record 145 a barrel and we have also seen big oil companies continue to post record profits lets go over a few of the points that have happened in the past years the president signed into law legislation including landmark provisions to make cars and trucks more fuel efficient and to promote more affordable american biofuels that all happened because we passed it in this house and provided leadership on this the new fuel standards will reduce our oil consumption by 1 1 million barrels a day in 2020 onehalf of the current unitedstates imports from the persian gulf and will save american families 700 to 1 000 per year at the pump the house also passed legislation to suspend the filling of the strategic petroleum reserve and just this week the speaker called on the president to unilaterally start releasing oil from the strategic petroleum reserve in order to try and bring down the cost of oil on the world market a very responsible proposal we have also voted to invest in homegrown american biofuels in the farm bill we voted to provide tax incentives for renewable energies and energy efficiency and plugin vehicles and creating hundreds and thousands of green jobs we further voted to reduce public transit fares for commuters pinched by the pump we voted to crack down on oil price gouging and in fact were looking into more of that weve directed the cftc to use its full authority to curtail excessive speculation in the markets and other practices which may be distorting the energy market in fact the ag committee as we speak is meeting to look into this matter and plans another hearing tomorrow we have voted to hold opec accountable for oil price fixing and we have called on the repeal of subsidies to profitrich big oil so we can invest in renewable energy futures further i think its important for us as members to look at who in fact is moving to block the lowering of our prices at the pump a general blanket statement that we c n make that i have observed is you put oil people in the white house and you can expect oil prices to go up president bush and republicans have blocked virtually every step that we have tried to make to lower gas prices for the american people some of these steps have been cracking down on oil price gouging which was opposed by 140 republicans the first time and 145 republicans the second time including all the

suspending the strategic oil petroleum reserve and while the president signed it into law it was only after issuing veto threats the president vetoed the farm bill twice which included the cftc

record vote this was a historic vote and we had every vote on the committee i raise that at this time not to curry favor with the republicans to support this historic piece of legislation before us but because i know from mr mccrerys input and contribution he recognizes that trade no longer has to be seen as something that is negative to americaii workers good trade agreements that create jobs should be allowed a vote and not be hurried so that members are not impeded from the policy and really have an opportunity to study the substance without his cooperation and that of the united states trade representative and secretary treasurer we would noteven have the opportunity to look forward to the bipartisan victory we had in the committee and look forward to on the floor a part of that agreement however was he and i sharing that when people are without work without jobs without hope when communities are adversely affected because of trade that our government and our multinationals have a responsibility not just to their shareholders but to do all that they can to ease the pain to encourage investment and to have a climate whether it is globalization or technology to know that trade is not always the villain and to the extent we are able to improve on many of the things that we have in this bill before us we do hope that the trade and globalization assistance act will be just the beginning that whether it is trade or not we have a responsibility to the dignity of american workers and their children so that in this great country they can aspire to be working and to have the respect that all americans would want in terms of being producers so to the extent that we had the cooperation of mr mccrery in creating the climate and fully appreciating that we had input from republicans on the ways and means committee even though we didnt ask for their votes and accept their amendments it is this climate that makes our country so great that makes this congress so great and makes me proud to be the chair and a member of the ways and means committee i rise today in strong support of h r 3920 the trade and globalization assistance act of we come here today at a crossroads of sorts in recent years trade policy has been a dividing force used as a political tool to advance ideologies rather than a shared sense of purpose that our trade agreements and programs could reflect the broader goals of the american worker the legislation before us today offers an opportunity to change that in the early months of this congress i joined with the speaker and the house leadership to remind the administration that the constitution specifically designates congress as the branch of government responsible for international commerce we agreed that we took that responsibility sertously and we would use our majority to improve american trade policy to better reflect the needs and concerns of our workers not just our large multinational corporations the legislation before us today is the next step in developing a new trade policy that more adequately addresses the growing perception that trade is not working for american workers the trade and globalization assistance act of 2007 would expand training and benefits for workers while also helping to encourage investment in communities that have lost jobs to increased tradeparticularly in our manufacturing sector the growing perception that pror american trade policy ignored the needs of workers here and abroad is a large contributing factor to the declining public support for trade for years we have had a program in placetrade adjustment assistance or taathat was supposed to tadkle some of the issues and problems workers face as it relates to trade despite the best of intentions this program did not meet expectations or promises and has failed to keep pace with globalization we are here to change that today with the trade and globalization assistance act of the bill before us today is a comprehensive policy expanding opportunities for american workers industries and communities to prepare for and overcome the challenges created by expanded trade first the bill significantly expands existing taa for workers by 1 covering service workers and additional manufacturing workers 2 increasing taa benefits 3 making the taa wage insurance program permanent 4 improving the taa health care benefit and 5 increasing tam program funding second the bill includes a package of tax incentives to encourage investment in distressed communities that have lost manufacturing jobs third recognizing that unemployment insurance ui is the gateway to taa the bill reforms the unemployment insurance system by creating incentives for states to cover parttime lowwage and other workers under state ui laws americas ability to compete and win in a global economy is too critical for our trade policy to continue being a partisan issue i noticed with great displeasure yesterdays veto threat from the administration on this bill to that statement i would say that the bill before us today passed the ways and means committee with democratic and republican supportand i expect it will receive the same from the full house the issues contained in this bill are central to the ongoing debate over the administrations trade policy and if this administration wishes to address the growing public concern over the direction of its trade policy it will reconsider this veto threat globalization is here to stayand we must band together as democrats and republicans to shape its benefits for all americans i look forward to todays discussion and i urge you to support h r 3920 the trade and globalization assistance act of 2007 at this time i would like unanimous consent to yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from michigan"], [0.9527735151350498, 0.04722648486495018, 1, "i think were right on target in describing the exact goal that we have here we want to make sure that the american people are secure we want to make sure that our troops can be successful we want to make sure that our troops come home and we want to make sure that the iraqi people can live with dignity the one thing that i will add with that statement that ms slaughter just made is that not only simply live with dignity but with the kind of selfdetermination that led to a 70 percent voter turnout in iraq so obviously we share the exact same goal that ms slaughter just outlined but i am very very troubled with the plans that we have before us frankly withdrawal that would begin in 90 days would undermine every single one of those goals to which ms slaughter just referred and this time it is not just the presidents opposition that stands in their way of what it is that they are trying to do their own colleagues in the senate have said that the house democratic leaderships approach wont work on their side of the capitol ej 1230 senate majority leader reid has criticized their punting strategy and acknowledged he has serious doubts that the house plan could actually get through the senate now this policy of defeat couldnt prevail in april it wont prevail in may so it would appear the idea is to wait and hope for the best in july now the war in iraq is not a game funding our troops who are in harms way is not a game these votes may make my friends on the other side of the aisle feel good but they arent doing anything to get our troops what they need to protect themselves and to fight effectively against terrorists around the world thats what matters here again going back to the words of the very distinguished chair of the committee on rules ms slaughter we want to make sure that we are secure at home the way to do that is to ensure that the troops have what they need we have an obligation to have a serious substantive debate to supply our troops with the funds they need to do their job and to demonstrate to the american people that we are doing what is necessary to win in iraq and to bring our troops home but rather than fulfilling our duties as responsibl6 legislators democratic leadership has simply scheduled one more empty political vote under yet another totally closed process in fact the democrats go so far as to have three closed rules two of them on appropriations bills now we will consider four appropriations bills this year and all of them will have been under a completely closed process and we all know under both democrats and republicans the tradition is that when it comes to wartime supplementals they be considered under an open amendment process but thats been thrown out the door this is a far cry from the open and fair congress that was promised to the american people worse yet buried in the appropriations bill is yet another totally closed rule completely and prospectively shutting out republicans 2 months from now hw~ and they even go so far as to totally deny us a motion to recommit something that we never did in the 12 years that we were in the majority and those were tame restrictions when compared to what they tried to do to the senate it has been said by my very good friend from massachusetts for whom i have the highest regard i served with him for many years on the rules committee i had the privilege for the past 8 years of chairing the rules committee and during that period of time mr mcgovern would regularly say that the rules committee is the place where democracy goes to die ithink that it is only fitting that it is the rule which provides for this bill for his bill that we will use to pronounce the time of death and while this tactic fails to achieve a legislative success here at home it fs already producing disastrous results in iraq ryan crocker the very highly regarded new ambassador to iraq ive heard a number of leading democrats a number of leading outspoken foes of what it is that we are doing in iraq speak very highly of ryan crocker ambassador crocker said last week in an interview with morton kondracke of the roll call that the iraqis are watching the democratic leaderships political games play out in congress they hear the calls to abandon our mission and it is taking away any will to negotiate among political factions and achieve an effective government capable of bringing about a political solution to the crisis as kondracke puts it in his piece and i quote what is going on in congress is hurting crockers ability to get the sides in iraq to make agreements with one another he goes on to say it hardens the sectarian divisions they think we are going to leave and instead of reaching across lines and making agreements with the adversary they are getting ready to go to the mat now that is what mr kondrackewrites following his discussion with ambassador crocker and its very troubling what we do here and say here has consequences and the report back from the new ambassador to iraq is that those consequences are not good those who would declare this war lost before the new strategy of again the very highly regarded general david petraeus who enjoyed unanimous support of the united states senate that means democrats and republicans on a recorded vote provided unanimous support confirming general david petraeus we are now basically with what we are trying to do here with this effort not even giving his new strategy a chance to succeed and i believe that it is a huge mistake now like everyone in this institution and people around this country i read the newspapers and i wbtch the news i watch the pictures on television and i know that the terrible images of violence that are broadcast every day permeate and as we see those horrible pictures i dont blame the american people for becoming extremely discouraged by what is being reported out of iraq and i will say that i am horrified by the pictures and the things that we see coming out of iraq but there is real and significant progress that is being achieved by our military the chicago tribune editorialized just yesterday on one of the great success stories that snccess story being the al anbar province which is the large province just to the west of baghdad its capital city ramadi was once described by the new york times as the most dangerous city in iraq and potentially the most dangerous city on the face of the earth today this former outpost for the insurgency is not only a secure city it is a model for sunni shia and american cooperation in the fight against the organization that was responsible for what happened on september 11 2001 that being al qaeda the chicago tribune editorial said al qaedas terrorists in iraq now face a new enemy sunni tribesmen in the al anbar province their editorial goes on and i quote these tribal leaders in the heart of the insurgency are now backing coalition and iraqi forces against the terrorists you want good news from iraq the chicago tribune editorial goes on to say there it is flashing in neon now this editorial goes on to quote the new york times report saying the progress has inspired an optimism in the american command that among some officials borders on giddiness there are some people who would say we have won the war out here one marine officer said i am simply quoting i would say to my friend the chair of the rules committee not something that a republican said but the editorial that appeared just yesterday i would encourage all of our members to look at that editorial in the chicago tribune now through the joint services stations that have been established local sunni police shia army officers and unitedstates military have worked hand in hand to take back the city and the province and drive al qaeda out with the full support and cooperation of the local sunni leaders the shia army has earned the confidence of the local population through their alliance they are achieving our objective for the entire country peace sustained by the iraqis themselves through national unity general petraeus came here as we all know just 2 weeks ago to provide members of the house of representatives with a classified briefing on iraq unfortunately the speaker of the house ms pelosi was unable to attend that briefing but for those of us who were there we were given a realistic picture from general petraeus of what was taking place he did not and i dont know all of the members who were there but i will say general petraeus did not sugarcoat the tremendous challenges that lie ahead in this war in iraq but he also described tremendous successes such as this great success that i just reported on in ramadi what was one of the most dangerous cities on the face of the earth and has now been stabililed in the al anbar province generl petraeus described the sunni arabs who have turned against al qaeda and have joined the iraqi security forces our american and iraqi forces have succeeded in detaining a number of key network leaders getting critical intelligence on how various elements of al qaeda operate in iraq taking apart a car bomb network that killed 650 citizens in baghdad and destroying several significant car bomb factories these are the kinds of joint efforts that are taking place at this very moment in iraq now general petraeus has spoken publically about these successes about the reduction in sectarian murders in baghdad by twothirds so far this year about the tripling of seizures of weapons cashes this year about the revival of markets and the return of displaced families to neighborhoods and cities that were previously totally uninhabitable because of violence these success stories are not meant to paint a rosy picture of iraq and i will say that again im not attempting to sugarcoat the situation in iraq im notattempting to paint a rosy picture of what is taking place in iraq i know how horrendous and what a difficult situation this is we all know the enormous challenges that our military still faces there and will continue to face for some time to come not just to be solved by september it will extend longer than that we all know that the other night i was with ambassador john negroponte who reminded me of the public statement that he made just as he left his ambassadorial post in baghdad he said it would be at least 5 years so we all know that this battle and this struggle is going to continue but what these successes do demonstrate very very clearly is that we have not lost this war they demonstrate that our men and women when they have the necessary resources can achieve victory we must give general petraeus adequate time and adequate resources to build upon these successes and make his newstrategy work setting a day for defeat whether it is today next week or at the end of july or september is simply not an acceptable policy rationing funding for our troops is not an acceptable policy now i offered two amendments yesterday in the rules committee that would have stricken two of the most egregious elements of this legislation first i proposed to remove the july cutoff date for the troops funding our generals in the field have said that this limitation ties their hands and keeps them from doing even their nearterm planning which is absolutely essential if the successes that we have seen are going to continue wars arent won in 2month increments and military victories arent achieved by congressional decree now my second amendment would eliminate the requirement that the president make his reports to congress on the internet even in its unclassified form this highly sensitive information would provide information to our enemies and the enemies of the iraqi people it would provide them with their blueprint for victory the notion of providing this report from the president to the congress not in any kind of confidential way but on the internet is absolutely outrageous there is no justifiable reason for us to give the people who are wanting to kill us and are responsible for the violence in iraq this kind of information now unfortunately neither of the amendments that i offered was made in order they would have provided an opportunity to consider a troop funding bill that would actually be enacted and would actually fund the troops rather than simply staging one more meaningless vote allowing members to posture now i understand very well having been in the majority for a while i understand that the democratic leadership is in a very tough spot they want to be able to say that they are funding the troops at the same time they have to accommodate their members who want to get out yesterday they want to get out immediately regardless of the consequences so their political situation is to schedule vote after meaningless vote they get their weekly opportunity to say i support the troops out of one side of their mouth and lets retreat and get out immediately out of the other side of their mouth but our troops and the american people deserve more than political gimmicks we must stop playing dangerous games with the lives of the american people our men and women in uniform and the iraqi people who have been struggling for freedom we must get our troops the funding that they need and give our military commanders the means to win and to do what we all want to bring our troops home i reserve the balance of my time"],
