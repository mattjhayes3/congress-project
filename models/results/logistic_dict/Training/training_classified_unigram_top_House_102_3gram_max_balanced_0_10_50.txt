federal policies encouraging the unitedstates flag merchant marine section 304 of h r 5006 as reported deals with humanitarian assistance provided by our armed forces i am concerned that the language

would serve at the pleasure of the ambassador who may terminate their participation if necessary i also include a provision which would allow the former member to serve with the peace corps upon

course of our discussion of h r 6 it is unavoidable that we must discuss the willingness and ability of the banks to reach out into distressed communities and into the minority communities to do what congress said they should do back in 1977 under the community reinvestment act last week or 10 days ago the federal reserve came in with a stunning report basically confirming that many of us have said in terms of discriminatory practices related toward those among us in our society particularly minority groups in distressed communities the mortgage rejection rates around the country 14 4 percent whites blacks 33 9 percent hispanics 21 4 percent so clearly this study confirmed the worst suspicions of many republicans and many democrats what the study did not show however is that it is not just mortgage lending that there is real discrimination in the marketplace but it also has to do with small business lending black entrepreneurs hispanic entrepreneurs have a tough time getting loans many of them even though they are qualified so in this banking bill there have been two approaches the gentleman from massachusetts my good friend who believes as strongly as i do the cra and he has got an amendment that is going to be discussed today and i have got one that others in this body are going to try to take out on monday so i want to use this time to talk a little bit about mine because we will have the debate on the kennedy amendment a little bit later on today i might add i think parenthetically they probably could coexist to see which was better the gentleman from massachusetts prefers a more punitive approach my approach is a little bit more market oriented incentive based approach he would encourage redlining i would encourage greenlining but that is for later on my colleagues are going to receive some information from some of the regulators who are going to say that the ridgeflake amendment and i must emphasize to my colleagues that this is not just my initiative our friend and colleague from new york has worked very hard with me on the bank enterprise act that is the amendment in this banking bill that is the amendment that passed by a vote of 37 to 11 in the committee on banking finance and urban affairs we have worked hard to come up with an incentive to urge banks to lend into distressed communities and i noticed that our friends down at the fdic have already started circulating a letter saying that it is not a good thing because the incentive we used is an offset against some of the bank insurance fund payments that are made by the banks basically to help insure their industry let me give some of my colleagues who are not on the committee on banking finance and urban affairs a little bit of a backgroumd the banks pay 23 cents per hundred dollars worth of deposits and from that 23 cents on a hundred dollars worth of deposits they have created what is now called the bank insurance fund the dollars that would be involved in a potential offset on the ridgeflake amendment are twotenths of 1 percent of the dollars that would be generated over the next 4 years it has been estimated that the bif will generate on this 23 cents per hundred dollars 25 billion in 4 years our cost is estimated by the cbo at roughly 60 million in 4 years but it would leverage my colleagues leverage 1 billion dollars worth of new investment 1 billion dollars worth of new mortgages 1 billion of new entrepreneurial capital in distressed communities my colleagues again it would be twotenths of 1 percent of that 25 billion over a 4year period that would leverage 1 billion dollars worth of new investment and there are attendant economic costs wherever we try to solve a social problem the gentleman from massachusetts has economic costs associated to his approach i have economic costs associated with my approach but i prefer to incentivize greenlining instead of punishing redlining let us get back to these regulators the regulators who have the audacity to come and say that this amendment which is something like 60 million out of 25 billion that will be generated by the banks this amendment which is 60 million in comparison to the 70 billion that the regulators want somehow destabilizes the bank insurance fund make no mistake about it regulators do riot like the cra they do not like the community reinvestment act i had occasion to go back to the 1977 hearings on cra and i would say it is as clear and unequivocal as the nose on your face that the federal reserve board did not like cra then the federal deposit insurance corporation did not like cra then and the office of the comptroller of the currency did not like cra so let us disabuse ourselves of the notion that they are coming up because they think somehow cra would be jeopardized because they never supported it in the past or that somehow the bif would be jeopardized by this modest offset against the 25 billion that would be generated over the next couple of years reaching out to minorities will not destabilize the bank insurance fund creating economic opportunities will not destabilize the bank insurance fund creating community development

war quite a tall order to fill but somehow the coast guard always comes through the prdblem for the ooast guard not to mention the taxpayers is that each year the list of coast guard duties continues to grow as resources continue to dwindle in the last 20 years the legal responsibilities of the coast guard have expanded enormously as a result of the adoption of 19 new maritime laws the coast guard simply does not have the manpower or the budget to absorb new mandates at this rate with the adoption of the recreational boat user fee the congress has successfully if unwisely transformed the coast guard into an arm of the irs and with the latest mandate passed downrequiring the coast guard to commit major resources to the windward passagethe coast guard has been asked to assume the role of immigration support officer it is extra missions such as these that force the coast guard to dip into resources provided for basic coast guard needs and services this is unfair not only to the coast guard but also to the taxpayers at large who depend on basic services up until now the coast guard has successfully lived up to its numerous responsibilities but we may have reached a point where the coast guard and the taxpayers have to say no to additional missions no matter how much we challenge the ability of the coast guard to manage on a shoestring budget we have a responsibility to prioritize the duties of the coast guard with an eye toward affordability i certainly am not advocating micromanagement by congress i am urging a better system of oversight that allows us to know when

the large amount of money that we deal with in the federal budget of course in the midterm you need some kind of correction but what the president did was to submit 99 separate rescission messages i understand omb has a list down there of 360 now what was the presidents criteria for the rescission proposals it was not necessarily elimination of pork barrel projects the criteria was not what is bad or good the criteria is were these items in the original fiscal year 1992 budget submitted to the congress last year i asked some of the agency witnesses that came before my subcommittee what was the criteria they indicated that was a criteria now that is not a criterion for determining what is needed or what should be a midyear correction at all that is just a criterion for setting up the congress so that we cannot get our work done under the rules each one of these rescissions could take in excess of 3 hours if they could tie us up on 99 rescissions for that much time we could not do anything until summer then we would see stories on television that congress cant get its work done congress cant get its work done what was done in this bill was to package these rescissions that is the reason we had an argument on the rule that is the only reason there was an argument on the rule we packaged the rescissions into a bill so that we do not have to take 2 months to do what we can do here in a few hours this is a bill that packages some of the presidents rescissions substitutes some new ones inplace of his proposals and adds others that the committee thought were needed or were justified the committee bill then takes care of 113 rescissions all at one time so i think this is the way to handle this matter i urge a yes vote on the bill"]]}
