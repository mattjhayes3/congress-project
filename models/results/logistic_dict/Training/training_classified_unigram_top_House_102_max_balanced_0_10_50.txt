the democrat party is committed to cooking the goose and then serving it to the people as a political favor the democrats prime directive has been to kill business through regulation stifle business through high taxes and destroy business with labor union legislation tsongas understands the democrat party has done no favors for the american people with shortsighted political legislation that has hurt american competitiveness of course the republican party has said that all along tsongas undoubtedly will get his goose cooked for exposing the democrat party for what it is becoming a

is from the oakland tribune it is written by william endicott he is a rather faceless newsman or columnist out there in america most people do not know who he is i knew him as a political reporter for the los angeles times covering the unitedstates senate race in 1982 and most governor or congressional races he would sometimes cover as a reporter i always suspected he was a flaming liberal now that he is a columnist for the mcclatchy news service who i have been trying to contact his true colors show but he is not just a liberal he is not just a man of the left in the united states heis obnoxious he is an airhead of the highest order and obnoxious in the sense that he would dare claim by name in his column that bob dornan pat buchanan and without even hearing what he said the whole week he admits that rush limbaugh the phenomenal conservative radio host that is now on over 400 stations that we all were gleeful that the hard liners had locked up gorbachev at his crimea dacha and were about to ignite the cold war in its worst ferocity again let me so my righteous anger will be understood let me read most of the column it was not a very large column i will read that beginning again for continuity here the unitedstates conservative right has egg on its face by william endicott political columnist for mcclatchy aside from gennady yanayev and the rest of the gang of eight the people most disappointed about the failure of the soviet coup have to be american ultraconservatives there was a little too much i told you so glee in the comments of columnist and tv commentator patrick buchanan totally quoted out of context b1 bob dornan a congressman from orange county totally quoted out of context and others in the immediate aftermath of the attempted putsch he then goes on to quote us out of context so i will not accommodate him by following up and doing what he did and then here is one little dumb line after he quotes buchanan and myself one of my comments that he quotes was that maybe the white house will learn now and then he suggested i will never be secretary of state what i was talking about was learning that yeltsin was the man of the future not gorbachev and that we should get about the business of recognizing estonia latvia and lithuania george bush our great president has convinced me that his timing was right because he was dealing with things that i was not aware of that he wanted gorbachev and yeltsin at least to take this move to give them some credibility he gave them a week he stood right there proudly next to the prime minister of canada brian mulroney while he recognized them a week ago monday and then he waited a week and did recognize the three great baltic nations ahead of mr gorbachev so we were the 37th country of the world i wanted us to be the first as we were with israel to recognize the baltic nations since we had never even recognized them i visited the estonia delegation up in new york and the two delegations for latvia and lithuania who have been here since 1940 and are right at 16th street from the white house i hope mr bush will make it formal by going up there and visiting those good men and women up there who have kept the torch of liberty alive for over 50 years half a century so he obnoxiously quotes me out of context that what i was saying to the white house the first night of the coup was get with the yeltsin program this is what he does to rush limbaugh fortunately i was out of radio contact with rush limbaugh earlier in the week so i have no idea what he had to say why is he bringing him in then although i probably would have missed it anyway since i push the button as quickly as possible whenever i come across him on the dial can you imagine the childish way these liberals eat their hearts out who have been in journalism for years and they see a man like rush limbaugh a force of the voice of the silent majority a humorfilled goodnatured conservative he is on 400 stations now from guam to the virgin islands to puerto rico to maine to alaska all 50 states every day an audience of a million and a half people he reaches over 18 million people a week and endicott and i will find out soon and i will come to this well and mention it is syndicated in a few papers around this country so he is green with a little envy monster over rush that is why he brought him in when he does not have the faintest idea what he said all week long 3 hours a day he had 15 hours last week 2 weeks ago and the week before that the week after that to find out what rush limbaugh was saying and what he was saying was right on target now get this line sam donaldson has said the same thing stumbling over his words 2 weeks ago on david brinkleys this week with brinkley and phil donahue has been saying this since i was on his show way back on november 11 in kennebunkport in the american legion hall he was trying to beat up on president bush about the decisive course we were taking to liberate kuwait and even in that show on a different subject donahue keeps saying that the soviet union fell of its own weight that conservatives around the world freedom fighters had nothing to do with it here is the key line in this whole column you have to sympathize with these folks speaking of conservatives they have spent years building careers by warning of the communist manace and the events in the soviet union and eastern europe over the past 2 years have invalidated all that effort pardon me how is that all the work of conservatives for 72 years around the world every person proud to stand up as i have done in this well many times and describe themselves as anticommunist and say it is not a term of a program to be delivered with a sneer as most liberal journalists have delivered that word over the years bill endicott i can assure everyone has never written a word never uttered a word never probably had a thought that could be called anticommunist in his short little life so what piece of this action does he have let us see what he says in the last half of the column he quotes a meaningless quote from the massachusetts institute of technology mit some professor says get this line certainly for the last several years the communist party hasnt been a motivating force it has been a drag an inertial force how is that over the last few years does he mean it was not a drag that it was not a murderous system that it was not demotivating to the longsuffering soviet people and all the captive nations around the world and the periphery of the octupus arms extending out from kgb headquarters in moscow that came all the way to this side of the world to chile to all of the south american countries to guatemala to el salvador where there are still people dying to nicaragua where it was a close call unit violeta chamarro won the presidency and still was an issue in doubt until its recent collapse in moscow this probably means that nicaragua will not see a murderous comeback of the ortega boys and there were some in this chamber who befriended them in their cause over the course of freedom and ridiculed president reagan and the contras during all of that peripheral struggle on the edge of the communist empire for the last several years it has been a drag suddenly however there was a coup or a feeble attempt at one for your edification and anybody else who follows these proceedings that are on the premises or watching through national technical means meaning cspan and television i want to hold up my hand as a signal to kind of keep in your immediate memory a few words because he undoes himself in an embarrassing way in about four paragraphs 0 1520 bill endicott however there was a coupor a feeble attempt at oneand the right wing felt vindicated and was much too eager to believe that the power of democratic reform would be no match for the power of the old bugaboo communism it was going to be like the good old days what the heck does he mean by that hungary czechoslovakia food riots vietnam korea what good old days were we conservatives supposedly yearning for when there was nothing like a little anticommunist rhetoric to get the juices flowing and stir the faithful the evil empire was back footnote cbs news correspondent dan rather through his man in moscow somebody is translating to the people in the crowd and one of the people is pleading this is one of the people in a tent who said we dont want the evil empire back here do we really is that what people in the soviet union think it was an evil empire is everybody starting here in the congress and the senate to apologize to ronald reagan for his march 8 1983 speech in middle florida the most visited tourist place in america disney world orlando universal mgm studios that is where the president said it is an evil empire it is the focus of all of the evil in the world and it was and it was right up until recently and in pockets it still is because these schemers are still out there and god willing they will never get another shot to try and reverse this wave of freedom on the eurasian land mass but he said we were hoping that the evil empire would come back you jerk bill endicott wow he continues like the inept there is one of those words and bumbling plotters of the coup the right wing in the united states badly underestimated the lust for freedom that obviously exists among the soviet people yes crushed for 74 years since 1917 when the bolsheviks stole the revolution from kerensky and their determination to resist oppression if there was a second amendment in the soviet union yes maybe we would have seen young people dying in the streets in the 1920s in the 1930s or 1940s or 1950s or 1960s and 1970s instead of three young men giving their lives in front of the state building the russian building that they mendous reporter you have been on call the white house i this whole new russian revolution as more about those courageous young you call it on the cover story i had to men later see the admiral the father of young he continues its interesting that vladimir i had to see it in people buchanan that is patrick dornan magazine as a kind of a background that is i and company were persuad color story and they did not even ed that some tired old communists print pictures of the other two young who resemble nothing less than a po men 22yearold dimitri komar run litical version of the keystone cops over by one of those armored personcould reverse all that nel carriers and the youngest in the now get this he says it was boris beginning of the flower of youth 22yeltsin who was the man of the hour yearold tough name ilya which is true the name of one of the russian the iconoclastic yeltsin what heroes like paul bunyan there is ilya was he iconoclastic about an image moramets the great hero who held off breaker he was alone because as a the golden horde of invading horseformer communist when he quit the men from the far siberian wasteland party in recent history he became an in mongolia ilya krichevsk 28 years anticommunist the type of person old vladimir dimitri ilya that this columnist is attacking ie it was not a bloodless rolling back of said yeltsin enhanced his standing this coup and boris yeltsin did not do at home and his reputation abroad it alone he would be the first to tell i yes because liberals all across you that but he was a figure was he the press in western europe and in not standing on that tank an excomthis city inside the beltway and i am munist kind of like whittaker chamsure endicott in california all jumped bers an excommunist or some of the to that presumption they were call great writers in this country that the ing him a yahoo particularly an in mass media dominant culture has igsulting word in a country that came nored because they are excomrnuout of serfdom calling him a peasant nists kind of like being an ex or a and flat out calling him an alcoholic former homosexual reformed you do i spent some time last june with not get on unitedstates television if you are an boris yeltsin and i got him to sign a excommunist at least you did not picture of an actor in red square in until recently front of st basils which stalin here is where i ask you to read all of wanted to burn down to tear down those words i will go back and recapitdragging behind him the cross of ulate those words feeble attempt the jesus and that was in june and boris old bugaboo old communists the yeltsin gladly signed this picture for keystone cops tired communists me in room 2118 of the rayburn if they are old and feeble and keybuilding signed a picture of jesus stone cops and tired and it was a dragging his cross across red square feeble attempt how can he write this no boris yeltsin is special he was not next line that singlehandedly yeltsin quite so forceful in saying that he was defied the junta during a 72hour an atheist when he was with gorba period when the outcome was far chev when he was on the other night from certain on cbs but i guess he did not want to really it was very tense and the embarrass gorbachev it is my own outcome was far from certain why hope and i hope it is not a fantasy it was just a bunch of buffoons keythat the man will someday come back stone cops running the operation to the russian orthodox faith of his what did we learn on television last parents he did not become a commu night from moscow on cnn from that nist until he was 30 great reporter wolf blizer who was a now says this columnist he has soviet air force commander when he enhanced his standing at home and was told by the kgb plotters that his reputation abroad by singlehand they were going to take helicopter edly defying the junta singlehanded gunships and attack that big tall fedly there were not the 200 000 people eral soviet building the russian buildthere in red square last march and ing right behind our embassy called then a few months ago defending yelt the white house they were going to sin when gorbachev was trying to ruin attack it with helicopter gunships and and end his career cut his throat po i am going to learn this guys name i litically there were not 200 000 there assure you and i am going to meet were not 100 000 and there were not with him in moscow next month and 50 000 but there were 20 000 people pardon me if i am biased a little bestanding there through those first two cause i am air force but this air nights that fully expected to die at the force general this soviet officer said hands of their own young countrymen if you send gunships against the rusin russian tanks and three of them sian building the white house i will did die has endicott ever heard of send up fighter planes migs and vladimir ousov 37 years of age shot sukhoi fighter planes to shoot down in the face on top of a tank the son of those helicopters that one man is as an admiral you cannot see the pic big a hero as yeltsin because this man ture of the funeral in time or news in uniform put humanity decency and week i am impressed that the picture the future of his country ahead of sewas in unitedstates news world report and curing the plot because if they had mort zuckerman i know what a tre shot gorbachev in his dacha those poststalinist people that do not have quite the lust for killing that fidel or tito did or the chinese did in tiananmen square or other stalinist type plotters throughout history or the ones who dumped khrushchev who did not have to kill him if they had executed gorbachev in his dacha in crimea instead of taking his missile codes away what we call the football and it is not so funny that is a crisis and you are right and that is why it was a tense 72 hours and that is why it is not worth anything endicott does about putting in stupid expressions like keystone cops and tired old con imunists it was a close thing my fellow americans and a damned close nightmare i was euphoric that it failed i went to bed early that last night because i was sick of seeing these molotov cocktails and these apcs jamming these buses and i was afraid all hell was about to break loose so i said to my wife maybe sunshine will bring a new day let us go to bed for 3 or 4 hours wake up about 2 oclock in the middle of the night it will be 7 hours later there and at 9 oclock when we woke up what did we see on cnn gloriously the back of those bnp armored personnel carriers those alligators we saw them leaving the city exhaust from a vehicle never looked so good in all my life and yes this irish americans emotions were right up in my throat and the tears rolled down my face and i said i want the names of the six or seven kids who died that is what they surmised but it turned out to be less than half that three and i said i want to get the names of those kids and that is why i tell you on this house floor and no member has mentioned them yet dmitri ilya and the son of an admiral 37yearold vladimir usov these are the heroes that should go down in soviet history next to yeltsin the jury is still out on yeltsin we do not know what kind of a democrat he is or what he holds for the future of this country but he is certainly a far superior human being to gorbachev and we owe gorbachev a lot in the pages of history but it is all for omission it is all that he did not roll the tanks into poland that he did not try to hold on to the empire that he did not put more black berets from the interior department under the communist thugs that he appointed to overthrow them and probably wishes that he had killed them since a couple of them have committed suicide and their lives are on the line and they may be before a firing squad you better believe they wish they had killed them you know as a footnote here what is important do you know what fidel castro told his marxist brother salvador allende down in chile i have h 3 8 seen the transcripts we can listen to these international phone calls he sent him a thompson machine gun chromeplated no less and said secure your revolution in blood is that not what lenin taught us kill several hundred people or it will come back to haunt you that is what castro had done remember the expression take these people to the wall take them to the soccer stadium take them to the main baseball stadium in havana gun them down like animals that is what fidel did living up to lenins instructions allende did not do it so people around the world other communists said you have got to kill people if you are going to make your revolution work what have the chinese been saying quoting mao all power comes from the barrel of a gun that was the major dictum of chou enlai maos righthand man in the long march and down through all this history where the issue is in doubt as to how long we are going to have to suffer with this geriatric set crushing people keeping catholic priests and bishops and ministers still in jail for over 3040 years still keeping some of the student leaders in jail and trying and threatening to arrest american congressmen like nancy pelosi ben jones and my good friend john miller people from both sides of the aisle trying to put flowers and pay a little respect on the scene where tanks ground up young itudents so badly that all you could see was a mass of bloody clothing i could not even pick a bone out of some of the pictures that the cia showed me from that postmassacre bloody mess in tiananmen square so here is how mr bill endicott of mcclatchy ends it seems clear he said that yeltsin is the future of the soviet union we hope so and as president bush said at a press conference wednesday and imagine this guy to attack me and rush limbaugh and to be suddenly quoting my hero george bush and he did not vote for george bush you can bet anything that bill endicott like 95 percent of the liberal press out there and all the major functions of our communications industry they all voted for dukakis as about 90 percent of them voted for mcgovern and he says president bush says yeltsin stood firmly and courageously for democracy and freedom and became the symbol of the resistance yes with these three young men i have been talking about when all was said and done yeltsin and his followers had a lot more confidence in the democratic principles than some of the people in this country who claim to be buchanan dornan rush limbaugh who claim to be the most ardent supporters of those principles yes i am an ardent supporter i will call the people of mcclatchy and i will not ask for a letter to the editor at all i am going to ask for a guest column and i think i am entitled to it now folks let us come to the bigger theme of phil donahue sam donaldson their ilk and this jerk that i have just been reading from this article who do we thank for the collapse of communism here is just a quick little list that i jotted down on the back of his article and i am going to be back here with a 1hour special order next week and the week after talking about people who owe this country and the world and everybody who died in 74 years fighting communism but are these the people we should listen to sammy mr endicott and phill donahue alger hiss we are going to find out whether he was really guilty soon when the files come out of the archives of the kgb a lot of bozos around this country will be trying to book a passage to castros cuba and they will not be able to hide there for more than a year do you think we have caught every spy in this country like the walker family these sleazeball traitors do you think every spy in this country every american traitor has been rolled up the cia told me they do not have all of them and it is not their job it is the fbis job they said we do not have all of them do you think they are shaking in their little booties their traitorous booties a little bit as these files come out of the soviet union do you know what i am hearing as a rumor that it is the soviet union that is saying that we have between 4 and 40 million how is that for a game spread between 4 and 40 million informers in this country let us not have a witch hunt where have we heard that word before in the 1950s it will tear this country apart but guess what we do not have 40 million traitors in the united states we do not have 4 million we do not have 400 000 we do not have 40 000 i do not think we have got 1 000 but we have got a handful and we can handle that and we can have trials for these slimy traitors as we did for the walkers i saw him on 60 minutes unrepentant during the break the man should have been put before a firing squad to tell other americans who sell out their country for 30 pieces of silver there are some spies not just alger hiss how about the hollywood 10 writers the unfriendly 10 pbs says that oh they are not communists they are just unfriendly though we may find out in some old file how many communists were working in hollywood in the bad old 1930s 1940s and 1950s should we thank the chicago seven or the whole sds organization that had that tom hayden founder how about thanking tom hayden he serves as a traitor to the united states in the california assembly in violation of our constitution but our speaker willie brown out there has been defending him how about jane fonda at michigan state saying if you people knew what communism was like we would all be down on our knees praying for it she owes an apology and i am sure not going to thank her for the collapse of communism how about warren beatty who glorified the bolsheviks stealing the revolution for freedom in 1917 at the end of the year 9 brief months under kerensky and these guys steal it with guns lenin had one election and he got about 23 percent do you know what lenin said he said we will never make that mistake again what mistake having an election he never did and stalin never did in his 29year reign or brezhnev in his and gorbachev has never won an election yeltsin is the first man to ever win any real election in the soviet union should we thank ed asner secretary of the screen actors guild when they deny an award from an organization that the president of the united states ronald reagan had been president of in his early years i do not thinkso should we listen to gary hart who is over in the soviet union telling them not to adopt the american or the british or the french model or the canadian model for their economic policy not the german erhard miracle after world war ii make up your own model these people do not know anything about entrepreneurship or work habits this has been destroyed by threequarters of a century of communism so we are going to take gary hart who almost delivered george mcgovern to the united states should we listen to mcgovern remember what mcgovern said does not this man who is decent owe us an apology when he said leave eastern europe alone these people have the kind of government they want this is the system they want never been voted in but it is what they want should we thank president jimmy carter who at notre dame sounding like william endicott the columnist i just tried to rip apart a little bit where carter says we have an inordinate fear of communism and later that same year they invaded afghanistan where they genocided about 1 million people of that great nation never been conquered before and it is going to come out of this all right now four or five million afghans out of a population of 14 million 4 million alone are in pakistan and another 11 2 million in iran and that is not a nice place to have to run to and some are even over in turkey all of that diaspora of that country was because of the soviet killing who was the last general out general boris gromov where was he during the coup i would like to know he suddenly disappeared where is the person they called the dark the evil the black colonel akhness why he is sitting in their congress i saw him on nightline the other night the guy that said you bet there is going to be a civil war and there are going to be nuclear missiles flying around here too now there is a guy with a real nice vision of the future where would colonel akhness have been at boris gromovs side the last killer to leave afghanistan by the way the soviets have been bombing in afghanistan the same soviet air force where i praised one general they have been killing people for the last 2 years in afghanistan and they do it at a high altitude so our stinger missiles that we have given them against the wishes of every liberal in this chamber and of the other body and across this country and including these columnists i talked about"], [0.0015987707301974297, 0.0015987707301974297, 0, "i thank the gentleman from missouri for yielding time to me yesterday in the committee on rules the chairman of the committee on education and labor who i am happy to see is here on the house floor the gentleman from michigan initially said that his preference would be for an open rule but given the time constraints this week and the fact that members on this side want to go to houston and members on the other side want to get back to campaigning or whatever it was argued that some restrictions on amendments are necessary to ensure that we can complete consideration of this bill before we adjourn this is really i believe a bogus argument because if we look at this rule it is the same kind of partisan and abusive gag rule that is traditionally imposed by the overwhelming 9 to 4 vote on the majority of the committee on rules the rule makes in order 11 democrat amendments out of 15 that were submitted to our committee but only 2 republican amendments out of 14 that were submitted to the committee are made in order if my colleagues on the other side of the aisle were so concerned about the outofcontrol amendment process there was a very simple solution it would be to put a time limit on amendments in a sense as far as most of us are concerned on this side of the aisle there is a time limit and it is virtually zero the hardworking gentleman from santa rosa the gentleman from california will not be permitted to offer his parental responsibility amendment because it is considered controversial there is concern on the other side that this amendment might actually stimulate a debate over our nations failed education policies yet they make in order democrat amendments which according to the distinguished ranking member of the committee on education and labor the gentleman

in my hands that i believe is one of the most poignant books to come out of the vietnam experience it is entitled the heart of a man it says by lt frank elkins but he was long gone died in combat in aerial action over north vietnam as the telegram to his widow and new bride says he was avoiding enemy sam action that is russian equipment being fired at him with russian advisers on site to read the exact words i deeply regret to confirm on behalf of the united states navy that your husband lieutenant frank callahan elkins serial no usn is missing in action this occurred on 13 october 1966 while on a combat mission over north vietnam it is believed your husband was maneuvering his aircraft to avoid hostile fire when radio contact was lost an explosion was ooserved but it could not be determined whether this was hostile fire exploding or your husbands aircraft no parachute or visual signals were observed no emergency radio signals were received now this book is a compilation of extensive beautiful sensitive long heartrending letters that he sent home to his wife during his combat cruise as an attack a4 pilot off the carrier oriskany in the summer and fall of 1966 one of his roommates one of his flying colleagues who was designated by lieutenant elkins to be his censor sent all these dairies in totality to the wife let me explain what a censor is each naval officer and speaking to our colleague and war hero sam johnson of texas who was a prisoner for almost 7 years the air force did not require this nor did the army helicopter pilots who flew over enemy territory this was a navy policy where on ship you would pick some friend or bunkmate usually of your own rank to go over all your personal effects take out anything that might be superheartbreaking or embarrassing to the family and also to censor out a slip of any military information that was not to go home the fellow officer that frank elkins chose decided that this was so moving so beautiful that he told mrs elkins her name is marilyn that he was taking a career risk and sending her the entire diaries over this period of combat the censor and i will read an excerpt from him next week died a week later burned to death in his cockpit on the deck of the onskany when a firefrom a dropped bomb and exploding rocket killed 30 aviators and about a dozen enlisted men one of three terrible fires on our carriers in the sea of china off vietnam and none of it due to enemy action when the wife got the letters and the diaries she put it all together and published it in 1973 i have read i think over 20 books of returned pows in 1973 1974 1975 and 1976 this was the one that haunted me the most because obviously all the other books were by returned pows this was a mans voice literally from the grave well his remains came home a year and a half ago in 1990 and almost 2 years now and his wife wrote a new prologue to the book and reissued the book just this year and i think it is very apropos because governor clinton has referred to himself at age 23 as a boy a confused boy and that here is the story of a real man here is his last letter to his wife from yankee station that was the arbitrary orbiting point off the north vietnamese coast that our carrier assault missions were launched into north vietnam against haiphong harbor hanoi vinh and all the other targets in north vietnam dixie station of course was the one down south where many of his other letters to his wife and diary entries were recorded and he said to his wife in his last letter my darling marilyn i dont really have time to write a decent letter now let me tell you and tell the 1 108 000 americans who are probably listening tonightthat is an average from last week of those who listened to cspan one million americans one out of every 250 let me read the jacket about frank callahan elkins who is a native of bladensboro nc where he was the high school star quarterback and valedictorian he earned his bachelor of arts in english from the university of north carolina at chapel hill and entered the unitedstates navy and flight training in 1961 that makes me feel old that is 6 years after i got my wings in the air force that was my last year of flying after my active duty years that was my last year of flying in the guard and fighters i then went to see planes in the reserves for another 5 years but frank married marilyn roberson in january 1966 the same year he died after the crash of his air force skyhawk over vietnam on october 1 1966 he was listed as mia until 1979 when our government against my advice at some of the hearings declared all these people presumptive finding of death and of course i said his remains came home were identified and interred in 1990 he was awarded seven air medals and the distinguished flying cross his wife marilyn roberson elkins holds a ph d dr elkins in english same as her beloved husband of less than a year from the university of north carolina at chapel hill also where she was a finalist for the 19901991 undergraduates student teaching award in the fall of 1992 she will begin an assistant professorship in the english department at california state university los angeles i look forward to meeting her i may have met her during those hellacious years when we were trying to get the state department cia and the defense department to make sure we had an accurate accounting of all of our men lost particularly those from laos and look how that is unfolding in the senate all this week she marilyn is a native of pikesville tn so here is franks last letter to marilyn my darling marilyn i really dont have time to write a decent letter but i just received your letters and i wanted to write you a note or better and i love you and am thankful for your note i do and i am im sitting here in the room eating di dunk because i dont feel like getting dressed and then back into flight gear thats because robert mcnamara secretary of defense general wheeler chief of staff of the army and a bunch of other admirals and army generals and captains and colonels are all on board for the night the oriskany so he spent his last night alive with the man that i have said in the well over and over is the most disgraceful public servant in the history of this century robert strange mcnamara the ships captain came over the intercom today and said now were going to show them a normal days operation and now the aviators chow line is closed i missed the big action this morning down to the south darrow was hitting a truck park and was using his bomb computer the computer fouled up threw a bomb in the boonles and got all sorts of gigantic secondary explosions so now everyone keeps bombing that area and kept getting fires and explosions it was probably a stockpile area for the dmz forces all of course in violation by the communists in north vietnam of the demilitarized zone the next three launches were diverted into that area and got all kinds of results really a big day i missed it all my hop was traded with joe so that he could escort the vips tonight and i got a tanker hop which aborted i didnt care id rather give up that hop than do the escort duty he does not want to be with mcnamara and find out why in the book another bit of excitement occurred today when a number of motorized craft resembling pt boats were approaching the oriskanys steaming area from the north we all figured that maybe we would get someantiservice action but they turned out to be chinese motorized fishing trawlers the unitedstatess constellation found them first and was all set to sink them when pictures revealed the single gun mount on the bow was really a crane another ad1 pilot thats the propeller attack plane that tried to help down pilots was down in the woods today one a day meaning were losing a man a day i read and read again the things you said about the autumn and it sounded so good i couldnt stop thinking about it you cant know how much i wish i were there wont be long even so it seems so long tick tick it seems like a million years since i saw you last im looking forward to our crosscountry trip to california maybe we can borrow sleeping bags and camp out a couple of nights i love you so much i dont think wed need one but sleeping bag or even use the other end or even use other one if we had to well brief time for my flight taking chip out again tonight to the coke machine on the carrier all my love darling and thank you again for your lovely thoughts in those two letters today i love you frank while robert strange mcnamara was still on the oriskany the next day fighting with the skipper of the oriskany over the pathetic targets that president johnson was allowing those wonderful men to hit that next day october 13 frank elkins disappeared and may have been killed in action may have been killed on the ground coming down in his parachute on the ground beaten to death tortured on the way to hanoi died in prison tortured by cubans monitored by soviet advisers we do not know what happen to him maybe he died after most of our men were supposed to be home but this naval pilots vietnam diary called the heart of a man tells me something and i think i am going to start to say this a lot on the house floor depending on what happens november 3 i believe i robert kenneth dornan a unitedstates air force peacetime fighter pilot i believe that the man that probably would have been the president of the united states at the end of this century a hero true hero probably was killed in vietnam i believe that the best men of that generation in the 1960s that would be maturing to the age level to compete for the highest office in the land probably went into a conflict that they felt was noble at its base to do for south vietnam what we did for south korea and what did for france great britain norway what we did trying to help the soviet union under the worlds greatest killer joseph stalin killed more people than adolf hitler stalin did i believe that that man was killed in a war that he felt was politically manipulated by the best and the brightest by politicians who did not understand that there was a way to bring that war to a conclusion with an honorable end at least to match the stalemate in korea these were the men that were skillful enough even as young lieutenants even as ensigns to know that you had to mine haiphong harbor where we had allied ships from nato helping the enemy british ships french ships greek ships and we are putting americas kids on the line getting them killed in combat training accidents in europe thousands have been killed in europe trying to keep europe free from the soviet armor attack and while we are doing that to help them europe whereby just a flip of a coin one young soldier goes to germany along the eastern frontier with communism and the other goes to vietnam and dies that young american could have been killed by logistical equipment shipped to vietnam by england and france the same countries we are trying to help in europe incredible i truly believe that if frank elkins would be running for the presidency this year i truly believe that the mcnamara lyndon johnson and even the nixon delays to do what nixon knew was right to use our b52s against the communist enemy heartland and to mine haiphong harbor which did not happen until may 8 1972 6 years after this man died almost 6 years i believe that our policies killed off the best human beings of that generation in vietnam and whatever happened to the lost generation my generation of men like the gentleman from new york who have combat experience in vietnam in a war they probably did not agree with either but they felt like churchill that if you are going to serve your country you do not ever let somebody else take your place and go in harms way now because of what i said here last night i understand that one of the best of all the weekend talk shows and it probably has the best television current affairs producers asked for the gennifer flowers tapes they just asked me to fax over to them pages from the congressional record of yesterday where i had inserted all of the intamous gennifer flowers excerpts of her taped conversa tions with governor clinton just in the last 3 years they are probably going to discuss it this weekend well i would ask that they read every word of these gennifer flowers tapes because there is not a congress man or woman in this chamber and about 150 of us read these transcripts yesterday in the congressional record there is not a single human being in this chamber on either side of the aisle of any political ideology whether out there working for governor clinton or not who gainsays or contradicts these tapes everybody reads these tapes and they know one thing for sure they were sexually intimate and involved together now here is what broke from my special order last night on one of the wire services across this country and one called hotline it is bipartisan it is three stories here one is white house about clintongore bus trip the next one the jesse jackson story it says reverend jackson acknowledged quotequote that there wasnt enthusiasm among minorities youth and urban residents for the goreclinton ticket then comes this story i will read it verbatim because what i talked about was i asked the question was bill clinton the boy to use his quote on a peace train to moscow with a lot of radical students who were not just antiwar they were not antiwar they were prowar with a victory for hanoi was he with that group and here is what it says peace train representative robert k dornan republican 38th district california asks when bill clinton visited the soviet union while studying at oxford was he on theand then they quote methe socalled peace train from paris to moscow filled with radical students who were enamored with communism the soviet union and ho chi minh doran said he was not charging any conspiracy but suggested it was inappropriate for students to visit a country that was arming the north vietnamese clintons spokesperson didi myers said clintoni just hope up here the fourth estate what the great irishenglish member of parliament great parliamentarian whose years of life pretty much paralleled thomas jeffersons the great edmund burke who said the fourth estate was the most powerful of it all i hope they are paying attention didi myers said that bill clinton went to moscow alone as a tourist and financed his own trip alone boy clintonhis own description to ted koppel on nightline in februarya 23yearold boy alone goes to moscow and that he financed it himself a quote from didi myers from little rock the national headquarters of clintongore he was traveling on a winter break like a lot of other students to suggest a hidden agenda is an outrageous and ridiculous smear tactic knight ridder carried this across the country now am i engaging in a smear tactic is this an outrageous question because i did not charge him with anything well i do not think so work with me here follow me along on this i hope the millionplus people watching chambers proceedings tonight work with me here follow me along here here is my question to a man who would be commander of my unitedstates air force a man who would command the semper fidelis the forces of the unitedstates marine corps a man who would command all those navy air carrier pilots out there making night recoveries on those carriers as we speak all those people still in the gulf all those people still in europe they have been defending europe for 48 years since the normandy invasion the man who would be commander of my dads branch of the service the unitedstates army the man who would command the semper paratus always prepared unitedstates coast guard under our department of transportation the men and women now who will go into the eye of a hurricane or go into 25foot waves to save peoples lives he wants to be their commander in chief i ask him this question a simple one tonight just one let us see if the national media will pick this up the dominant media culture what weeks were you in moscow governor clinton is the way i would frame my question if i were to meet him tonight what weeks were you in moscow because i have a suspicion that it was january now last night i said that he was in oslo because i had lent this book entitled peace eyes to someone and i only had xeroxes of the first few pages it is by a jesuit priest i think he has since left the priesthood father richard mcsorley he is still saying mass every morning reading his office out of his breviary let me know but he surely was a marxist priest in 1969 and in 1978 when he wrote this book and did not even know that his former friend bill clinton of georgetown as he calls him georgetown university had become the attorney general in the state of arkansas at the age of 28 bill clinton lost a congressional seat against john paul hammerscmit who is still with us a classmate of george bushs mr hammerschmidt was from 1966 and he is retiring this year 26 years of great service yesterday i gave him an extra distinguished flying cross john p hi eschmiyr only has four dfcs isnt that a ridiculous use of the word only and six air medals clinton was elected attorney general 2 years later in 1978 at 30 years of age so when this book came out in 1978 peace eyes he did not know what bad happened to his friend bill clinton in the socalled peace movement in europe so i had the foreword and i read it yesterday and i read this when i father richard mcsorley society of jese i am jesuit educated for over 7 years so i can rap the jesuits who stray off the reservation of freedom and justlce when i got off the train in oslo norway i met bill clinton of georgetown university he asked me if he could go with me visiting peace people we visited the oslo peace institute talked with conscientious objectors peace groups university students and as i began to research the book with american deserters military men in uniform who deserted the battlefield they left their buddies to face the enemy alone and ended up in beautiful sweden norway and i have to assume denmark and finlandwell finland that is pretty close to the soviet union so when going through here today carefully i was able to establish the dates of when bill clinton was in norway we got that nailed down now december 1969 first of all in the infamous disgusting deceitful duplicitous letter to col eugene holmes dated december 3 1969 by young boy clinton he refers to how proud he is that he organized demonstrations the assumption is that oxford against the war on october 15 and now he wrote this letter only 18 days after a demonstration he organized november 16 and there was one november there are people over in london and paris and maybe even moscow right this minute looking for the hardcore results of those demonstrations and trying to find people with the big white crosses the skulls on sticks and everything that is described in this book and some others here is father mosorley talking about his trip around england meeting with deserters herewell actually the deserters had to go on to scandinaviajust meeting with students he talks about the december 15 demonstration then he talks about the next day november 16 how there was a prayer demonstration he talked about how bill clinton took these big white crosses up here is the exact quote the next day i joined with about 500 people for the interdenominational prayer service most of them were young and many of them were americans as i was waiting for the ceremony to begin bill clinton of georgetown then studying as a rhodes scholar at oxford came up and welcomed me he was one of the organizers and he asked me to open the service with a prayer this is exactly 17 days before he draws his 311 in the draft lottery the next day he applies to yale and on the 3d of december he writes that rotten sleazy letter to colonel homes saying i euchred you pretty good and i have been complusively eating here until i drop from exhaustion because i have so little selfrespect for myself but by the way i am organizing these demonstrations he was one of the organizers and then he skips forward and says i was glad to see a georgetown student this is young baptist bill clinton studying at the jesuit institution georgetown leading the religious service for peace after the service bill introduced me to some of his friends one of them was probably frank who committed suicide 2 years later with them we paraded over to the american embassy carrying white crosses made of wood about 1 foot high there we left the crosses as an indication of our desire to end the agony of vietnam all this 3 years after frank elkins who gave his life under robert mcnamara this disgracefully flawed leader mcnamara who did not know why he was squandering the lives of these future leaders of america so being against the war and being angry at the war that is all right at this time i felt like i was being squeezed in a vise between the corrupt policies running the war in this city during the johnson years and the no relief from mr nixon when he became president conceding that the country was torn apart i thought mr president nixon would the secret plan he had would immedtately mine haiphong and use surgical military strength that by his own admission he should have done because i saw with my own eyes him tell walter cronkite in a final in an interview after his disgrace and resignation that walter the biggest mistake i made in my whole presidency was not to mine haiphong harbor and use strategic bombing against hanoi in my first few months instead of waiting over 3 years how many died in those 3 years pbs had it wrong the other night they had george reedy on saying that in 1968 when lbj was resigning there were about 20 000 men dead what does that indicate that the other 38 000 died under nixon wrong mr reedy about 38 000 to 40 000 died under lbj and 18 000 to 25 000 under nixon i will have those exact figures next week the pentagon is working on it for me so now father mcsorley after these demonstrations takes off from victoria station to newhaven a little port south of dover he then goes over to dieppe france then travels around france for a whole chapter then he goes up to sweden to meet with over 100 deserters and then he heads to norway well who has cut him off at the pass at norway chapter 4 norway denmark germany and switzerland a familiar face greeted me in the station at oslow bill clinton by now it is december probably middecember i want to refresh your memory help me here work along with me december 1 draws his lottery 311 which secretary of defense mel laird said was coming when he out out completely the december draft call spread if out over 3 months tbld everybody you are probably home free bill clinton beats a path back to oxford does not even register for a room does not attend any classes so father mcsorley is wrong he is not studying at oxford he is taking the money in now dollars about 20 to 25 000 a year and has no intention of taking his exams he is now a fulltime organizer for demonstrations against his country in a foreign country and most of the people if not him i ask him were you one of these most of these people were prowar prohanoi and some of them prohardcore communists so here while father goes to france bill clinton goes up to oslo and he meets father mcsorley at the train station and he says again bill clinton now this is the part he used in the foreword he had been on the same train when he learned i was going to visit the institute of peace research at oslo he asked if i would come along i was delighted we were shown around by the assistant director it is housed in a lovely old reconditioned mansion of victorian design this is in norway its program is designed to promote peace through research peace through strength was what i did most of my years here in the house it worked the soviet union collapsed communism collapsed and the mother heartland of this equal in its evil power to nazism it collapsed because of peace through strength through the policies of ronald reagan and the gutsy confrontational policies of lech walesa and the intense focused prayers and intense confrontation of pope john paul ii it did not end through their kind of research it ended through r d here in this country with the great men and women in our defense industries mcsorley says its program is designed to promote peace through strength we met three conscientious objectors working there they objected to norways role in nato they never prevailed in that over all these years norway is still a key nato ally flying f16 falcons built in texas this was a new reason that we had not heard of before the objection to norways role in nato by the way i explained yesterday the catch22 problem here right out of joseph hellers novel catch22 that if bill clinton had courageously been a conscientious objector he knew he could never run for high political office in california he knew that he probably could never get elected in a southern conservative state to show you how rough that state was today is the anniversary of the 1975 and i am flying f100s at george air force base of the governor of arkansas one of the predecessors of governor clinton calling out the state troopers to block nine beautiful little black children from attending school in arkansas that is how conservative that state was when i was on using conservative as a pejorative negative word i do not call it conservative i call it ugly and evil but that is how tough that state was it motivated me to go to alabama and mississippi and register voters it motivated me to go to philadelphia as a conservative lincoln republican after cheney and goodman and schwerner were beaten with chains and murdered down there it caused me to march with martin luther king on august 28 1963 this republican conservative is very proud of his civil rights record so this is a tough state arkansas and what did this mcgovern worker in 1972 this peace worker till we find other questions answered bill clinton what was he doing in 1969 with these conscientious objectors thinking about a career in arkansas sure was because 6 years before he told the gentleman from minnesota when they were both living at the university of maryland the dorms in the american legion get the irony there the american legion boys nation program he told the gentleman from minnesota at lunch dinner and breakfast that he was going to be president of the united states and one of those days they met john f kennedy in the rose garden that was june 1962 6 years before that what that old catch22 was in bill clintons mind stand tall be principled say you are a conscientious objector and you will never get elected in arkansas maybe he should have moved to hollywood where he had got a lot of new friends so there is the norway trip nailed down i have still got a lot more to read in mcsorelys book i probably will not find any more references to bill clinton but when did he go to moscow that christmas of 196970 because we cannot nail that date down maybe betsy wright campaign guru maybe george stephanopoulos will tell us maybe al gore the distinguishei senator from the other body will tell me but here is that article i showed from the front page of the arkansas gazette now it is the arkansas democratgazette they swallowed another paper in the last 3 years little rock monday june 12 1989 and here is a 23yearold there is that age again 23yearold mah a russian intern journalist anton safronov here he is writing a story at 23 years of age about bill clinton this young journalist still is only 26 i wonder where he is today because he praises gorbachev praises marxism condemned stalinism in this article about clinton but then glorifies clinton in this great interview he had with him he says clinton would have been 43 during this interview clintons moscow visit it came out in our interview 1989 interview that bill clinton spent a week in moscow in the early 1970s when he was a student living in europe doesnt that nail it down the spring of 1968 excuse me that is when he graduated in june does that nail it down to the fall and winter of 1968 and spring of 1969 when he rebuffed two draft notices how did he get over to oxford in the first place when there were no more student deferments for graduate work by getting some friends a rich uncle who owned several buick dealerships to say that he was going to take a navy rotc officers commission why they created a slot for him mr clinton said he never heard of the slot his uncle lawyer said baloney of course billy knew about the slot that slot got him off to england in the fall of 1968 he was a student in the fall of 1968 that winterspring of 1969 he came back here to washington involved himself in all these demonstrations around the district of columbia organized worked with the mobilization office in town andprobably he only went back to arkansas for a couple of weekends to stroke people about the draft because now he is really hot he is out of college by one year has 1 year of oxford under his belt where i assume he studied maybe he didnt study then because there are no exams there are no room checks imagine this every student in america listening a person can check into oxford and their only tests are 2 years away they can take the money the 22 000 a year roughly and never do a lick of work never show up at class and if they show up for their exams because they are geniuses and pass them they are then rhodes scholars with an oxford degree seven years later no matter what they do as long a they dont turn out to be drunk or serial killers they will mail them a masters degree from oxford i have spoken to three of our rhodes scholars one in this chamber and two in the senate today to find out what is required if you take the money so i am just assuming to be generous that he went to class in the fall of 1968 and in the spring of 1969 when he had this midnight vigil of candles and they all cried and he cried that he had gotten his draft notice that is 1969 now it is summer and he is back here in 1969 and he goes through the whole phoney thing with the army rotc at the university of arkansas and then he heads back there he is in oslo we finally got him pinpointed now in december 1969 when is this moscow trip i want to read this again clintons moscow visit it came out that bill clinton spent a week in moscow in the early seventies when he was a student living in europe bill clinton just 3 years ago relations between our two countries were pretty good then not it was a time of d6tente not and the american moon landing had just been shown on soviet television i tried to analyze that last night apollo 11 was 4 days after colonel holmes was calling the draft board under the request of the chief of staff of senator william fullbright of arkansas powerful chairman of the senate foreign relations committee remember the 16th of july to give a timeframe of reference july 16 memo inside the new york times last saturday holmes will call me me the chief of staff of fullbright and then he will take care of calling the draft board they were getting holmes and lt col clint jones his deputy commander of the rotc army unit in arkansas to do their dirty work for them and lean on the draft board it is out of embarrassment that this bataan death march hero stayed silent for 23 years until a letter that has been ignored by the media of september 7 of this month that says this man does not have the patriotism or the integrity to be the commander in chief those are colonel holmes own words september 7 he says that there had just been a moon walk so it cannot be july 1969 he is in washington demonstrating and july 16 he is demonstrating here two days later is chappaquiddick and 2 days after that we landed on the moon that gives a timeframe reference the next landing was the closest we ever had moon landings was in november an allnavy crew i just had been to lunch the other day with commander bean who was the commander of that trip and their film went out remember i said that yesterday they had no film i confirm that today he says they are running film in russia of a moon landing if the russians decided that they could no longer block out these historical events because they blocked out in moscow some friendly times the landing on the moon of navy combat pilot from korea neil armstrong who strafed and napalmed all up and down korea to save half of it for freedom and everybody was praising him while they were damning his fellow officers like frank elkins dropping bags of feces off the san francisco golden gate bridge onto the decks of carriers with the survivors of his crews coming home in 1966 franks crews the other man shot down three migs in korea my friend buzz aldrin that was the first one now comes the second one in november 1969 if the russians blocked out neil armstrong and buzz aldrins moon walk they did have film of that it was available so maybe they decided to show the film of apollo 11 during november 1969 of apollo 12 was bill clinton in moscow before he met up with the marxist priest in oslo a month later or did bill go over in january 1970 my suspicion is he went over in january 1970 and he has the timeframes mixed and the russians were finally showing some moon walking film remember this month january 1970 he calls it the early seventies so he talks about detente the american moon landing then he says just shown on soviet television listen to this it was a very friendly time a good atmosphere the governor says 3 years ago he recalls it was fascinating and i would like to go back friendly time and good atmosphere let us analyze that i was in moscow in january 1970 i had four wives with me wives of missinginaction heroes 10 times the man of young boy clinton then connie hessle men like frank elkins roosevelthessle of african descent big tall handsome guy head of academics at the fighter gunnery school at nellie air force base and finally he got tired of training pilots and he demanded to go over there in combat he had already served in combat in korea he did not have to go roosevelt hessle went and disappeared i think in november 1966 his great wife and my friend connie hessle was with me in moscow then there was pat hardy pat hardy was so in love with her husband jack that she told me i will never ever marry again because i will never find anybody as handsome and as intelligent he had dropped out of the air force academy to marry me carried 30 units at stanford and caught up and graduated with his own air force academy class so he could go through pilot training with the men he had served with at the air force academy in colorado she said i will never find a guy like jack again and she never has remarried her two daughters are big grownup beautiful women they probably have made pat a grandma by now then there was a real tiger the wife of art mearns i went to art mearns funeral over here in arlington his wife also patricia pat mearns asked me gave me the honor to read high flight at his funeral when his heros remains an f105 pilot flying out of socalled secret bases in thailand trying to save south vietnam from communism art mearns an instructor in f105s shot down on veterans day 1966 less than a month after frank elkins and i get to read oh i slipped the surly bonds of earth and it concludes reached out and touched the face of god we used to end our television shows with that beautiful pilots poem prayer high flight that was written by an american a 19yearold man 4 years younger than clinton when he was in moscow and still a man who died in spitfire training in england before we were in the war putting his citizenship in jeopardy to fly against hitler with great britain with some of those men at oxford like clintons friends who had said they would never fight for king or country and turned around and ended up fighting bravely and some of them dying that signed that infamous little document in the early 1930s when chamberlain was stroking herr hitler that poem by frank mcgee high flight makes me think of why i am wearing this tie today this is the regimental tie of the royal air force i have worn it every day for a week doing these special orders because when i see this tie and put it on and i notice clinton was wearing it the other night and he does not even know what it is i think about churchills great words to the 1 400 or so fighter pilots in great britain when they were standing alone against hitler and mussolini and yes japan which had taken over indochina from france without a fight i think of the raf expression the height of the battle of britain winston churchill said never never in the course of human conflict have so many owed so much to so few the few were still flying off the carriers and in the army cobra helicopters and those greasy dirty gunships called hogs and that beautiful little huey in vietnam and they were flying for the air force and the navy racking up hundreds of missions without being allowed to go for the strategic heart of the communist enemy that still torments the 22 million people in north korea and the 66 million people still suffering in vietnam 1740 what wopld have some of the mottos of these socalled peace workers been then i regret that i have but one country to run from as i said the other night or paraphrasing churchill never in the course of human conflict have so many deserted so few to go to the enemy heartland and undermine their brothers and cousins and others from college who were doing their duty or accepting their draft and slugging it out in the jungles of southeast asia i never met a pilot whose heart was not with the men on the ground i remember one of the hero f105 pilots swede larson thank god he came home he is a living testament to this he says why do i fly south he got shot down to the day i said this to a smart aleck reporter who demeaned it in one of the news magazines he said why do i fly north day after day to try and interdict the supplies on the ho chi minh trail coming down and killing these teenage draftees just a few days later in the jungles of south vietnam and he was shot down that day swede larson so it is important what bill clinton did in 1970 and let me tell you the story about three people this congressman bob dornan those four wives that i was with and ross perot i want to come back and talk about the wife i left out because she ended up carole as the first president of the league of families of americans missing in action in vietnam i mention the others patty mearns and patty hardy and connie hessle roosevelt hessles widow they are all widows of these heroes and i will come back to carole hanson and her husband was the first bracelet that i ever had because her hubby was shot down the day that my mom died june 3 1967 ross perot in january 1970 and i hope somebody from ross perot is listening and will tell himi met ross perot when he was 39 years of age and he was in that months issue of time magazine right before christmas and it said he was a billionaire 39 peacetimetrained at annapolis a surface warfare officer like me because of his birth i am born in 1933 and i guess ross was born in 1931 and you cannot pick the year of your birth and he graduated from annapolis the last year of the korean war had the war gone on he would have been in conibat off the freezing waters in korea and he felt what i always felt was a healthy guilt and just by quirk of his birth he was making 1 bilion in texas and his classmates were dying off north vietnam or being imprisoned and tortured so he rented leased two 707s and flew them to los angeles where he loaded them with medical supplies and with food this is december 1969 when billie boy clinton is in oslo norway undermining our fighting men he loads these planes with food i was called down by a friend and helped load the fuel and i know he will not remember this buti begged him to take me with him i was just about to start on a television show that i stayed with for 7 years and that helped bring me to congress and i said take me with you no no i cant he had a few key texas guys with him and off they went i raised 10 000 big money in those days a little bit more than bill clinton was making as a rhodes scholar not studying i raised 10 000 and i took these four wives who i met with that month of december 1969 and we left on the 30th of that month for a trip around the world we met with the pope in rome we were joined up with three navy wives of mias and they never got their men back either we have always speculated were those wives punished because they traveled around the world we arrived without an audience with the pope and is that not unheard of that within 24 hours here i am with pope paul vi me and eight wives and i knew this was a special trip now do you know what pope paul vi said he said this is an unusual journey you are traveling into an enemy country at war with yours not to ask that your husbands be released but just to be given the mercy of the truth are they alive or dead are they prisoners or not none of those wives ever got their man back i look at that color picture sometimes with me the holy father and eight fantastic american wives and i think was one of those to be the president of the united states in 1996 or maybe even in 1992 or would one of those men be the man to take on george bush in the primaries instead of pat buchanan and then come back on the reservation at the convention we will never know but we left from there to romania with no visa and we found out when we got there that romania had under the dictator ceausescu to deceive the west had under the dictator ceausescu to deceive the west had opened up the country without visas just a few weeks before and we stayed in romanla and we went to the embassies we went to the russian embassy we went to the north vietnamese embassy and they would not let us in we begged mercy everywhere all we wanted is to know hey were these men alive or dead the war goes on and we are not asking for any special treatment just are they alive or dead and the agony the psychological torture of the missinginaction for the people in this country and it still goes on listen to what went on in the senate this week we went from there to egypt an interesting place to be in january 1970 it was the start of the war of attrition russian fighter pilots were flying against israel and one day one great israeli shot down five russian pilots all speaking russian on the intercom and here they are coming in in parachutes russian pilots flying in the war of attrition in 1970 in egypt and we think that russian pilots flew in vietnam what did clinton say it was a friendly time it was a good atmosphere very friendly it was fascinating i would love to go back and here is another quote i loved riding the trains in russia and the black bread too oh boy clinton liked the black bread did he while the russian pilots were training north vietnam fighter pilots in migs and robert strange mcnamara and nixon were saying we were hitting some of these mig bases and one that lbj used to dangerously mispronounce phouc yen and you can imagine how he would mispronounce it we were hitting those bases finally but the russians were still running their entire antiaircraft program where they had the gunrunner 2 years later in july 1972 called jane fonda sitting in the plane with her hands clasped together so femininely and her eyes turned skyward and her head cocked to the center and she gives the victory sign and says oh suppose an american plane came over would i know how to shoot it down an interesting day that was she has since apologized for that i am still waiting for clintons apology so january 1970 was interesting and ross perot got on those airplanes in december right after christmas and in january 1970 he was sitting there with his planes in laos i think only one got there and we saw them 4 weeks later with the four pow wives and he waited patiently to be allowed to fly medicine and vitamins into hanoi for our pows several died in captivity that year and a few others disappeared they probably died of being beaten to death like mac cobeil he was beaten to death by the cubans right in front of the men i remember i had norland daughtry in my office and he was reliving how they were smashing cobeils head into the ground over and over and screaming at him in cuban accented american you this and you that and hitting his head and his eyes were glazed over he was already catatonic from the beating with four other americans standing there not knowing whether they were going to get the same watching aware that an american was being beaten to death around that period of time clinton was in moscow and daughtry had tears starting to roll down his face and i started to cry with him as he went back in time to the prison cell in the hanoi hilton and he said i cant believe we couldnt help a fellow american he never came home and his remains were returned he also had i believe a burial in arlington cemetery so there is ross perot and i hope ross does not try to do something to help this draft dodger clinton he remembers his history and where he was in january 1970 but for clinton i am going to find out and i bet my bottom dollar that that is when clinton went to moscow january 1970 any time that year is disgraceful what student with his oxford money on his own as a tourist in the dead of winter goes to moscow let me tell you what happened to those four wives connie hesele patty hardy and pat mearns and carole hanson carole hansons husband was a marine h46 pilot on a rescue mission to pick up an army green beret team on the 3d of june 1967the day my mom diedand he did rescue the team and then they got shot down one green beret sergeant went one direction and he is home today i hope he is listening he got away the remains of one of the corporals who was knocked unconscious he was unconscious and he turned up and he came home but the pilot and the copilot the copilot was injured and steve hanson was briefly knocked out they came to and they were helping organize the men they went in a different direction never to be heard from again steves remains never came home from june 3 1967 carole had met with him in hawaii just as marilyn elkins had for a second honeymoon a few months before he had only a few weeks to go and steve never came home carole was terrific on that trip and with indira gandhi i have a photograph of carole alone in the road in vientiane laos just think ross perots mercy planes are down the road at the field at din chon and here is carole talking to a russian and i can say his name now for the first time in my life valentin valentin had his heart touched when he said what do you want in these ladies and i said let me tell you something valentin you have been fighting with the chinese on the border and some of your men have been captured you do not know what has happened to them if your wife turned up in the united states and met with me and these wives and said i dont want my husband returned i just want to know if valentin is alive or dead i said cant you find out that piece of mercy dont we share the same heritage of western civilization wasnt your country a christian nation again i think i said it maybe again someday and i remember telling the poles in the polish embassy in vientiane laos that very thing he told me he said whispered to us meet me later and he gave us a road and an intersection we met and carole hanson walked down the road with valentin and i have this picture in black and white that i kind of took covertly because i knew he would resent it and i have never shown it to anybody to this day and here is this russian diplomat charg6 no 2 in command of the embassy sitting there talking to carole hanson he said i will do my best when i get back to moscow to find out if i can get you the mercy you seek carole hanson was terrific years after her husband was declared dead she met another hero pow who came home to a divorced wife and no disrespect for the wife 9 years 8 years 7 years a lot of time lot of time a lot of pressure and caroles son 5 years of age then and i remember i took him up in the goodyear blimp when we got back and filmed a little piece for my television show the robert k dornan show his name was todd i have got the film of that flight on the goodyear blimp with little 5yearold todd today he is a navy officer flying f18s somewhere out there in the fleet carole married a hero pow named hickerson i get a christmas card from them all the time i hope the hickersons are listening it was quite a trip in 1970 quite a trip now what are we doing in indochina by the way i saw indira gandhi in india passed through some other countries i do not remember whether we went to bangladesh or burma unless i check my diary but we ended up in cambodia laos vietnam these brave wives went to hospitals shook hands with wounded men met with the ambassador in saigon met with the commander of all military operations then creighton abrams i went back with other wives and with mothers like nancy perisho in march 1970 later in 1970 back in 1971 all over laos up to luang prabang in 1971 no i am telling you it was not very friendly it was fascinating all right but it was not a good atmosphere and it was not very friendly and i repeat what i said last night mr clintons whole trip to moscow then was manipulated by the kgb i said we were in moscow that is not accurate we were arrested in the airport for no visas and connie and pat and pattie and carol and i were locked up under arrest in an old deserted hotel it was 26 degrees below zero might have been 36 but i do not want to make it any worse that it was but 26 degrees was so bad that three of the ladies got sick one of them i thought had pneumonia i had to bring this old gruel soup over from the airport in sheremetevo over to this stinking little freezing cold hotel we were not treated in a friendly way wives of heroes but bill clinton says it was friendly he was there bill clinton on whose money and what week and what month and the russians are flying against israel and flying against our guys and training these guys to shoot down our men and all the sam missiles were russian every bullet killing every kid that week probably 100 to 200 kids died that week all killed with russian armor russian bullets russian migs russianbuilt bases and he finds it very friendly i do not think this man has the moral authority to be president of the united states i am going to stay on his case and i will close with this prediction mr speaker here is a coin of the 18th cay that pat buchanan forgot to mention is about 20 or 25 percent black i went out in the field with them 2 days after buchanan went out and i wish i could rewrite pats speech for him because i know it did not come out the way he meant it to there motto is swift and deadly first squadron 18th cav 40th division california guard swift and deadly in latin that is velox et mortifer swift and deadly that is the way i am looking at this clinton mission of mine now swift and deadly i am going to find out the truth here if it takes every minute before this election and i predict that by next week with perot back in the race and more revelations about what he did in moscow that we are going to send a sidewinder right into symbolically of course into the clintongore bus and i hope my friend al gore survives because he went to vietnam as a reporter we want to descend into anarchy we must with an engineering unit i think with rely on our imperfect virtue and abide by our stars and stripes got a quick 6month imperfect system which churchill called the tour but still 6 months in hell worst form of government except for all i think mr clinton is not going to those other forms no group better exemplified that spirit president of the united states he does than unitedstates military leaders whose advice was not have the moral authority as i keep disregarded but who still faithfully followed saying to tell the army band or the the orders of their civilian leaders marines own presidents own to even those draft dodgers who fled to canstrike up the star spangled banner he ada fully expecting that theywould never resure as blazes does not have the moral turn home were more honorable than clinauthority to tell anybody to go in ton whose hatred of unitedstates policy overcame harms way anywhere around this dan his professed love of democracy so when clinton asks the american people gerous world to sacrifice just remember what happened thank you and god when the american people asked clinton to bless those wives and every wifer wh sacrifice lost their hero in vietnam clintons shameless use of his family coni am inserting at this nections to get senator william fulbright to point in the record an article i have help young bill beat the system also smacks written why the draft issue is im of elitism it is perhaps the ultimate irony prtt 1 that it was fulbright who steered the gulf of p nt tert stonkin resolutionwhich was the legislative whty the draft issue is important impetus for the wars escalationthrough by unitedstates congressman robert k dornan the senate it has been called a nonissue and a dis and what about the three other men who traction but bill clintons draft dodging is didnt have the political clout clinton did an important issue consider and who served in his place did they die in in his infamous letter from oxford clinton some vietnamese jungle fighting for freedom explains how he had come to loathe the while clinton demonstrated in london military and what does it say about clinton when this reveals a woeful lack of understand he defends his actions by saying he was just ing of our system our military did not make a boy at the time a 23year old is not a policy in vietnam our politicians did never boy but a man when i was that age i was was a war so controlled by civilian author married with two children and flying fighter ity every tuesday lyndon johnson held a aircraft in the air force and how many lunch at which targets and bombwelghts boys do you know who think in terms of were determined he bragged that the mill political viability tary couldnt bomb an outhouse without the draft issue raises other questions as his okay the military repeatedly advised well would clinton lead the unitedstates into some that victory would require a much larger reckless military adventure just to prove his commitment but was routinely ignored machismo could a man who has professed clintons hatred was therefore misplaced loathing for the military ever really trust it more recently before the vfw clinton or would he follow the examples of kennedy stated that unitedstates policy in vietnam was and johnson in vietnam both of whom went wrong and i still believe that given it alone with disastrous results could he what has transpired in southeast asia since ever command the respect of his troops americas withdrawalthe killing fields ever has clinton told the truth reeducation camps the boat people etc some argue that all of this is ancient histhat clinton doesnt see vietnam as a noble tory however clinton has never renounced cause is appalling it is said that hindsight any of his actions or opinions at that time is 2020 in clintons case it is myopic and it is time people started asking pertinent nearly blind questions about bill clintons draft dodging in a nutshell the most important lesson of when they discover the answers i am sure vietnam is that the wrong side won yet they will reach the same conclusion i have clinton cant even admit to something that clinton has lost the moral authority to send is so morally and historically obvious in men into combat and has disqualified himstead he prefers to remain mired in the anti self for the highest office in our land war rhetoric of the london demonstrations september7 1992 he helped organize and leadl memorandum for record through his conniving clinton also sought subject bill clinton and the university of to put himself above the system he now arkansas rotc program seeks to lead betraying an attitude that the there have been many unanswered quesrules established in a democratic society tions as to the circumstances surrounding dont apply to him his excuse the nation bill clintons involvement with the rotc wasnt threatened by communism in viet department at the university of arkansas nam prior to this time i have not felt the necesbut a democratic nation doesnt sacrifice slty for discussing the details the reason i its young men unless it believes itsnational have not done so before is that my poor interests are threatened and in fact unitedstates physical health a consequence of articipa vietnam policy enjoyed widespread support tion in the bataan death march and the subamong all age groups until after the 1968 sequent 3 years internment in japanese election by which time the decision to with pow camps has precluded me from getting draw had been made throughout the viet into what i felt was unnecessary involvenam war was more popular than the korean ment however present polls show that war there is the imminent danger to our country it was only when he was out of harms way of a draft dodger becoming the commanderthat clinton submitted to the draft and only inchief of the armed forces of the united then for a selfish reason to maintain his states while it is true as mr clinton has political viability stated that there were many others who but where clinton acted selfishly george avoided serving their country in the vitbush acted selflessly volunteering to serve nam war they are not aspiring to be the his country and going on to become a war president of the united states hero the tremendous implications of the possidemocracies occasionally do wrong things bility of his becoming commanderinchief abortion being a perfect example but unless of the united states armed forces compels me now to comment on the facts concerning mr clintons evasion of the draft this account would not have been imperative had bill clinton been completely honest with the american public concerning this matter but as mr clinton replied on a news conference this evening september 5 1992 after being asked another particular about his dodging the draft almost everyone concerned with these incidents are dead i have no more comments to make since i may be the only person living who can give a first hand account of what actually transpired i am obligated by my love for my country and my sense of duty to devulge what actually happened and make it a matter of record bill clinton came to see me at my home in 1969 to discuss his desire to enroll in the rotc program at the university of arkansas we engaged in an extensive approximately two 2 hour interview at no time during this long conversation about his desire to join the program did he inform me of his involvement participation and actually organizing protests against the united states involvement in south east asia he was shrewed enough to realize that had i been aware of his activities he would not have been accepted into the rotc program as a potential officer in the united states army the next day i began to receive phone calls regarding bill clintons draft status i was informed by the draft board that it was of interest to senator fulbrights office that bill clinton a rhodes scholar should be admitted to the rotc program i received several such calls the general message conveyed by the draft board to me was that senator fulbrights office was putting pressure on them and that they needed my help i then made the necessary arrangements to enroll mr clinton into the rotc program at the university of arkansas i was not saving him from serving his country as he erroneously thanked me for in his letter from england dated december 3 1969 i was making it possible for a rhodes scholar to serve in the military as an officer in retrospect i see that mr clinton had no intention of following through with his agreement to join the army rotc program at the university of arkansas or to attend the university of arkansas law school i had explained to him the necessity of enrolling at the university of arkansas as a student in order to be eligible to take the rotc program at the university he never enrolled at the university of arkansas but instead enrolled at yale after attending oxford i believe that he purposely deceived me using the possibility of joining the rotc as a ploy to work the draft board to delay his induction and get a new draft classification the december 3rd letter written to me by mr clinton and subsequently taken from the files by lt col clint jones my executive officer was placed into the rotc files so that a record would be available in case the applicant should again petition to enter into the rotc program the information in that letter alone would have restricted bill clinton from ever qualifying to be an officer in the united states military even more significant was his lack of veracity in purposefully defrauding the military by deceiving me both in concealing his antimilitary activities overseas and his counterfeit intentions for later military service these actions cause me to question both his patriotism and his integrity when i consider the caliber the bravery and the patriotism of the fine young soldiers whose deaths i have witnessed and others whose funerals i have attended when i reflect on not only the willingness but eagerness that so many of them displayed in their earnest desire to defend and serve their country it is untenable and incomprehensible to me that a man who was not merely unwilling to serve his country but actually protested against its military should ever bein the position of commanderinchief of our armed forces i write this declaration not only for the living and future generations but for those who fought and died for our country if space and time permitted i would include the names of the ones i knew and fought with and along with them i would mention my brother bob who was killed during world war u and is buried in cambridge england at the age of 23 about the age bill clinton was when he was over in england protesting the war 04 have agonized over whether or not to submit this statement to the american people but i realize that even though i served my country by being in the military for over 32 years and having gone through the ordeal of months of combat under the worst of conditions followed by years of imprisonment by the japanese it is not enough im writing these comments to let everyone know that i love my country more than i do my own personal security and wellbeing i will go to my grave loving these united states of america and the liberty for which so many men have fought and died because of my poor physical condition this will be my final statement i will make no further comments to any of the media regarding this issue"], [0.001623034244403243, 0.001623034244403243, 0, "for the last month i have repeatedly come before the house and questioned why the democrat leadership insists on pursuing an investigation of the unsubstantiated and wholly discredited october surprise allegations these allegations are not new they first surfaced after president carters overwhelming defeat at the hands of ronald reagan but the allegations were proven to be spurious and without merit then and every single time they have since resurfaced yet for apparently partisan reasons they seem to have taken on a new life of their own as evidenced by both newsweek and the new republic in their extensive coverstory articles on the subject if this were truly a bipartisan congress this abuse of power simply would not happen why then please tell us why democrats have chosen to drag this investigation out yet again can it be that such a congressional investigation is merely a thinly veiled preelection year attack on a popular republican president by a frustrated democrat majority have they so little faith in their own candidates abilities that they feel more comfortable smearing the president with unfounded allegations than debating him on the issues if you want a juicy investigation full of treasonous tidbits and deceit you should look closer to home start with documented contracts between members of the democrat leadership and the totalitarian communist sandinista government in nicaragua but with foreign policy priorities currently being exhibited by congressional democrats it is no wonder the american people will not put a democrat in the white house"],

taxpayers money when that money could go back into jobs in our economy a cause that the gentleman defends every day let me quote from the new york times a new york times inquiry over the last three months involving interviews with more than 100 present and former intelligence agents and others with direct knowledge of aspects of the operation found no link between the israeli arms sales to iran in the early 1980s and the october surprise allegations i would ask the gentlemen on both sides of the aisle to come and read newsweek and come and read the new republic both magazines say that this is a bunch of bunk let me say right up front that i am opposed to this rule and the derrick democrat substitute it makes in order i say this not because i am opposed to learning the truth about the october surprise but because these resolutions have been designed to avoid learning about the whole truth after 4 years of secret october surprise investigations by democrat members and staff at taxpayers expense we are now being asked to believe that the majority wants a totally objective and nonpartisan inquiry i was almost prepared to accept the majoritys sincerity in that until it become apparent that the democrats behind this have not changed their spots consider the following facts the democrat leadership refused to negotiate a bipartisan compromise resolution with our republican leader we all sat down together and tried to work it out mainly because it did not want to include the armsforhostage efforts of the carter administration the rules committee democrats refused the minoritys efforts to obtain the testimony of a democrat committee consultant who was quoted as saying he had substantial evidence the rule committee democrats turned down every amendment offered by the minority in markup on party line votes no matter how reasonable those amendments were after the government account office which is supposed to be nonpartisan told us that a thorough investigation of october surprise must include any hostage negotiations by the carter administration the rules committee democrats adopted a substitute to preclude any inquiry into such carter efforts when rules committee republicans moved an open rule or one that at least made in order certain reasonable amendments the democrats again rejected all of those motions on party line votes despite majority party appeals for bipartisanship the rules committee has left the house with just two optionsa derrick democrat substitute and a michel republican substitute despite appeals for bipartisanship we learn from the media that a democrat committee staffer cut a deal just last month with a federal court to spring a violent convicted gunrunner from jail in exchange for information on october surpriseall without house or committee authorization or prior notification of the minority after considering all these facts its not even fair to ask what we are supposed to think it really doesnt take any thought to figure out what is going on here one can only be left to conclude that this whole thing is highly partisan that it has been designed to coincide with this years presidential election campaign and that it is aimed specifically at president bush one can only conclude that this deck is stacked and the jokers are running wild at the expense of the overboard fund tax payers who will foot the bill for this multimilliondollar ripoff i think we have already been treated to more than our share of tabloid journalism in the past few weeks and yet by authorizing this multimilliondollar partisan conspiracy chase this house will be engaging in the same kind of seamy sensationalism as the tabloids who knowsmaybe bill casey sightings will soon replace elvis and ufo sightings as the hot tabloid topic of the week vote down this partisan rule and the partisan resolution it makes in order we dont need more negative publicity over spending millions of taxparyers dollars chasing after decadeold rumors that have been discredited by every cridible news source instead we should be spending our time and resources on constructive efforts to solve todays economic problems this resolution hardly sends an encouraging signal to the american people as the first official response of the house to the presidents state of the union appeal for a bipartisan approach to our problems vote no let me just conclude by saying this the michel substitute is going to ask for 300 000 and even that is too much to carry out this investigation let us limit it to 6 months and include the carter administration so we can see how all this was integrated together we are being precluded from doing that here and that is why this rule should be defeated let us defeat this rule so we can bring back a reasonable

time as i understand the gentleman from maryland for organizing these special orders and feel very pleased and privileged to be part of it second i would say that it is always with a profound sense of pride that i stand with a group of people that i consider the most progressive and compassionate legislators in the united states i have had the great privilege of serving with members of the congressional black caucus now for nearly 21 years faces now lined with gray hair and deep lines but over the course of that time it has always been with a great sense of strength and pride that i rise with the congressional black caucus as we on numerous occasions have taken to the well to challenge to advocate to inspire to energize indeed to have the audacity to attempt to prevail on behalf of our respective constituents so i feel great pride in rising this afternoon i rise today to speak out on behalf of the poor and the powerless in our society the young the elderly the physically disadvantaged the single mothers striving against increasing odds to maintain the social fabric of the family and the majority of our minorities who still suffer the tortures of discrimination and deprivation in the classroom the workplace among other places and in their access to affordable housing and health care i speak out this afternoon with a combination of personal pain persistent anger political and professional commitment to intensify the struggle to secure social equity and economic justice for all in our society regardless of race national origin religion age gender economic condition or political preference the pain and anger have multiplied with each succeeding year during the past decade because of the disastrous shortterm and longterm consequences of what came to be known as reaganomics sadly the congress has been unwilling to stand up with courage and conviction to challenge the ascendant administrations philosophy of greed selfishness selfaggrandizement by the privileged and the powerful at the expense of americas middle class and working poor the overwhelming but powerless majority of our citizens ten years ago after mr reagan submitted his first budget to the congress i wrote the following analysis to my constituency in the eighth congressional district in california i quote in part the new administrations budget is the most flagrant systematic assault by government on the economic wellbeing of americas middle class working poor and unemployed in this century the proposed cuts from social service programs for the poor the elderly the unemployed and the handicapped will be transferred directly to the pentagon this is a deliberate escalation of the international arms race on which this administration plans to spend a minimum of 1 3 trillion in the next 5 years the administrations plan to stop runaway inflation and revitalize our economy will produce even greater budget deficits and more longterm unemployment than its carter counterpart tragically those prophecies have become reality during the past decade for those who refuse to believe consider the following during the reaganbush era the tax rate for the highest income earners was decreased from 70 to 28 percent the corporate tax rate for the largest corporations was reduced from 56 to 34 percent the capital gains tax was reduced to 28 percent and the current administration is lobbying to have it reduced even further to 16 percent a decade ago the dow jones average of leading industrials was 954 01 the day after reagans inauguration yesterday it was 2 982 56 during the past decade the united states spent more than 3 trillion on the military budget 2 958 trillion in budget authority 2 780 trillion in outlays and foreign military assistance and transfer programs 118 44 million during the past decade the national debt has almost quadrupled it is currently in excess of 3 528 trillion the projected budget deficit for fiscal year 1991 is 279 billion 336 billion in fiscal year 1992 due in large part to the catastrophic nature of the s l crisis and continued excessive military spending during the same decade the following fiscal social and economic injustices were inflicted on the american people the total tax burden including increased social security state and local taxes for middle class and working poor has actually increased almost a fifth during the past decade revenuesharing and ceta funding were totally eliminated during the past decade hudassisted housing programs and urban aid programs were both cut by more than 70 percent during the past decade while the inflation rate rose more than 40 percent cumulative food and nutrition assistance to the poor and needy increased less than 20 percent the food stamp program less than 5 percent elementary secondary and vocational education assistance less than 15 percent higher education assistance less than 12 percent veterans nonserviceconnected pensions less than 2 percent during the past decade health care costs and insurance for middle class and working americans have more than doubled more than 37 million americans currently have no health insurance whatsoever on any given day that number is even astronomically beyond 37 million the united states and south africa very interesting juxtaposition remain the only industrialized nations in the world without a national health insurance program this explains in part why the united states currently rankshere is a superpowerranks 21st in the world in terms of infant mortality and no longer is in the top 10 in terms of life longevity in 1979 the total unemployment rate was 5 9 percent in 1980 in the wake of the second arab oil boycott it averaged 7 percent in august of this year 6 8 percent for black america the current crisis borders on the catastrophic consider the following realities in august of 1991 black unemployment was still double that of whites at 12 3 percent for hispanics almost as grim 9 9 percent the latest official unemployment statistics for blacks 39 7 percent and hispanics 23 8 percent teenagers have increased from what they were a decade ago they have almost tripled and doubled respectively the rate of their white tenage counterparts while white poverty fell marginally during the past decade black poverty has significantly increased more than one of every three blacks in america live in poverty or worse the current census projections of the black populationlisten to thisthe current projections of the census on the black population in america means that at this very moment there are somewhere in the neighborhood of 14 to 15 million black americans living in poverty living below thd poverty level the number of blacks who are among the poorest of the poor those who have income less than half of the official poverty level has increased by almost 75 percent in the past decade the poverty rate for black children is now hovering around 50 percent the highest rate since the great depression even worse for black children below the age of 6 years black female heads of families are 4 times more likely to be poor as black married couple families the ratio is even worse for families headed by women between the ages of 15 and 24 the poverty rate for blacks lacking a high school diploma exceeds 40 percent the poverty rate for blacks with a high school diploma is four times as great as their white counterparts there are more black males madam speakercheck this outthere are more black males between the ages of 18 and 25 incarcerated in americas prisons thanin every single 4year institution in this entire country a nightmarish statistic with alarming implications for the present and the future homicides by guns already alluded to by others or other weapons are now the leading cause of death among black males from ages 16 to 25 because of the fiscal and social horrors that i have just cited and those are only a few to just paint a partial picture of the nightmarish realities that are the realities of the black condition in america and because of the dramatic changes in the international security situation in recent months i believe it is imperative that the congress take the lead in rethinking our national and international priorities and reordering our spending priorities both at home and abroad during the past decade this group the congressional black caucus has continually tried to address these critical issues in the context of a changed and changing world through the proposals contained in its annual qualityoflife budgjet alternative budget proposals that clearly were visionary and forwardthinking for we have the audacity to carve out a new role for this country in a rapidly changing world now in the wake of the budget summit agreement last year and recent events i and other concerned members of the house are firmly convinced that we must now seize this historic moment to address these new realities in a constructive and enlightened manner we must go beyond the limitations and the constraints of last years agreement to forge new programs that address the challenges and crises of today and tomorrow the world has changed if we are all telling the truth here we are about the business of losing an entire generation of our children this country does not look the same it does not feel the same and it does not smell the same these realities combined mean that we must seize the moment to bring change last years budget resolution is an antiquated idea that has to go with the evolving and changing world the cold war and the warsaw pact and the berlin wall are history and our national security budget ought to accept and respond to these realities there will continue to be problems caused by the disintegration of the soviet empire and the reemergence of national ethnic and religious animosities but these absolutely must be addressed within the context of the united nations and collective security agreements we cannot be the police officers to the world old myths can no longer be utilized to justify the continued escalation of the nuclear and conventional arms race nor further unitedstates unilateral overt or covert intervention in third world countries accordingly the congress should give serious consideration to further responsible orderly reduction in nuclear and conventional forces if these proposals that many of us are prepared to present to debate to advocate and to push forwardif these proposals were adopted and implemented during the next 4 years this government could cut military spending from the current 292 billion per annum to less than 150 billion over the next 4 years that is in constant 1992 dollars this would result in budget savings of almost 600 billion over the next 4 years it staggers the imagination to consider the extraordinary compassionate innovative and marvelous things we could do to make this world a better place for our children and our childrens children with 600 billion not dedicated to ending life on this planet with the insanity and the absurdity of nuclear weapons and conventional forces that are obsolete given the changing world as an initial commitment to the changed national and international priorities congress should take the first step by further reducing the military budget in fiscal 1992 1 am quite aware that the budget summit agreement of 1990 provides that 50 percent of any reduction in the military budget must go to deficit reduction but given the realities of the changing world and the huiman needs that are going to be neglected and that need to be reconsidered that figure it seems to me is too high i think we need to bring down the budget deficit but 50 percent of the cuts that is a figure i think we need to change there are critical human needs that must be met in the year ahead if america is to endure as a compassionate nation besides budget reduction i propose that a portion of the reduction should be spent through international relief agencies to the former soviet republics most in need of food energy and health care assistance an equal or greater amount should be directed through these same international relief agencies to the starving and displaced millions of subsaharan africa because their needs are even greater and more acute we indeed do have international responsibilities i believe in the global responsibility it is good politics it is compassionate politics it is a role that a major power like the united states should play however i hasten to point out that i believe the overwhelming portion of these dollars should be promptly redirected back into the human needs social services educational programs there were cut by 50 billion in last years budget agreement this should serve as a prelude or the basis for a new budget summit that will honestly deal with longterm solutions rather than shortterm fiscal fig leaves the proper reordering of our national priorities will then enable us to work toward the rebuilding of our national infrastructure in order to make us more competitive in the new world marketplace that in turn will necessitate the rehabilitation and revitalization of our inner cities and long overdue improvements of our mass transit systems et cetera however this can only be achieved by a massive commitment by the national government to quality education programs at all levels from preschool to professional school so as to provide the properly educated work force to meet the challenges of a new century this must be accompanied by massive but necessary outlays for substantive improvements in housing and health care this commitment to education to jobs to housing to health care must be made to all of our people especially our minorities particularly our constituency the bottom line reality is this we will either pay now or we will pay later but we will pay we must be willing to pay now to increase constructive educational and job opportunities for all of our youth or we will pay later in the form of more racial and economic segregation more taxes for more prisons more police and tragically yes more violence predicated upon class as well as race it is time that we as a nation give up to the promises and dreams inherent in the declaration of independence and indeed the bill of rights this nation was founded as a representative democracy for more than two centuries many of our forefathers forebearers of all colors and both genders have struggled to make this a more inclusive society with increased opportunity for all now it is incumbent upon us to elect people to the presidency and to the congress who will respond to the needs and aspirations of all to make this a better society for our children and for our childrens children we are at a critical crossroads in our historical future we cannot afford to step back or step away from the path of national purpose and collective effort that will help us achieve racial harmony and economic justice for all i ask you assembled in this place and those not assembled in this place to join with us in making these dreams a new national reality as a final comment i simply say again to my distinguished colleagues who comprise the congressional black caucus this has been my family for 21 years we have fought here together we have cried here together we have felt pain we have felt anger here together but i am renewed and energized by our efforts today and the fact that i know that we will continue to struggle over the days ahead to continue to challenge this institution and

foundation was bequeathed the bulk of its assets under the will of james graham brown among these assets were several operating businesses including three facilities which were engaged in the treatment of wooden poles with creosote and other chemicals in order to preserve them for extended use the foundation dissolved the wood treatment companies and liquidated the assets nearly 15 years later the foundation was advised by the epa of a hazardous cleanup problem at one of the sites the foundation trying to fulfill its responsibility to the public health and welfare of the area

through a 30 billion direct appropriation putting the cost on the taxpayer without any real reform the leadership does not want any discussion of the fact that my taxpayers in my state and the taxpayers in some 36 other states are paying to clean up a mess that they did not create the truth is that nearly half of the s l failures were in statechartered institutions let me repeat that the truth of the matter is that nearly half of the s l failures were statechartered institutions and most of those failures were a handful of states which did not properly regulate their institutions why should our taxpayers have to pay for that these few state governments fostered a wideopen anythinggoes frontiertown atmosphere that attracted thousands of crooks con artists financial gunslingers and plain ordinary incompetents these few states must share the onus for the biggest regulatory failure in american history but the leadership of this house wants to stick most of the cleanup bill on the taxpayers in other states states which did not cause this problem states which properly regulated their s ls like those in my state and whose citizens pay most of the taxes in this country we have an

have foreign aid well i think we live in a new world we have to think anew and we have to act anew we are facing in our own country this year over 300 billion in deficits i ask you is it fair to our children is it fair to the future of this country to take money and to pour it overseas now some people say it is hard to vote for foreign aid dont you believe it the easiest vote we can cast in this house is foreign aid there are 900 registered lobbyists for foreign aid right here in washington dc we have to look at the future where we want to take this country you know yesterday new york city did not have enough money to pay for a victory parade for our own soldiers but we are going to sent 25 billion overseas the day before yesterday we were told that bridgeport ct the largest city in connecticut is going bankrupt or has gone bankrupt but we are spending 25 billion overseas we are cutting back on our senior citizens medicare on roads cuting back on education but we are increasing the foreign aid budget that does not make a lot of sense to me you know sometimes the countries that we give the most money to are the most difficult with which to deal benjamin franklin said if you want to make a man your enemy loan him money i think that is what happens with countries many times now we have to analyze this bill we have for example 87 million in this bill so that we can go all

library week it has been my custom in the past that i also begin the discussion by reading a letter from the president with respect to the declaration of national library week and i will do that again this year from the president the white house henry david thoreau rightly observed that books are the treasured wealth of the world and the fit inheritance of generations and nations indeed when we unlock these wonderful stories of knowledge creativity and wisdom we enrich our minds and often our hearts as well for example reading enables us to transcend time and space giving us means to explore the past or the vast frontiers of science reading can also broaden our sympathy by helping us to understand the experiences of persons from different backgrounds and i continue to quote the president in addition to providing us with access to books our nations libraries also offer access to information and ideas through a wide range of periodicals audio and videotapes electronic data bases and educational and research services whether helping children to learn how to read or supporting adult literacy programs librarians play a great role in making america a nation of students which is one of our national education goals because an educated and informed public is the lifeblood of democracy librarians also help to preserve our nations great experiment in liberty and selfgovernment and i continue to quote the president for all of these reasons i am pleased to join with the american uibrary association in celebrating national library week barbara and i encourage all americans to visit their local library and to exercise their right to know the letter is signed by george bush i am including the letter in its entirety in the record i always begin by reading the presidents statement on national library week because i would like for all of the librarians in the nation to know and i would like for all of the people who use libraries whether they use school libraries public libraries special libraries college libraries i would like for them all to know that this administration understands the value of libraries they understand that libraries are at the heart of the education process they understand that i want everybody to know that they understand it because the contrast between their understanding and what the president says in his letters and the actions that are taken by this administration are indeed appalling there is a great gap between words and actions when it comes to libraries indeed this president this administration is not as bad as the last adndnistration for 8 years the previous administration placed zero in the budget zero dollars in the budget for aid to libraries from the federal government this administration has not been quite as bad but it is almost as bad this administration despite its flowery words about libraries placed 35 million in the budget for aid to libraries under the library services and construction act the library services and construction act is the primary vehicle for providing aid to public libraries and various other projects related to public library service 35 million that is down from what the present appropriation is the present appropriation for the library services and construction act is 132 million 132 million is the present appropriation and that is totally inadequate that is the only federal aid directly to public libraries the american library association is asking for 207 million contrast what the president put in the budget 35 million with the request of the american library association for 207 million even the 207 million is a very moderate request consider for a moment the fact that 207 million to aid all of the libraries throughout the entire 50 states the entire nation 207 million consider what that means in terms of modern costs just compare for a moment the fact that 207 million if that were granted would not even be onethird of the costs of a bi bomber a b1 bomber is estimated to cost now about 700 million so 207 million would not even be onethird the cost of one b1 bomber when you consider the fact that the cold war is over the evil empire of the soviet union has been defeated you might ask yourself the question why are we continuing to build seawolf submarines seawof submarines cost 2 billion 2 billion and we are continuing to build weapons that could fund the library services and construction act for 10 years consider how paltry the sum of money is that is being proposed by the administration or how small the sum of money we are requesting is a moderate request for the needs of libraries i would like to continue by beginning to show again that the administration has a great gap between its words and its deeds as we all know the administration is proposing a set of programs for rescissions a rescission means that they will take back money that has already been put in the budget the administration has the right to come to the congress and recommend rescissions that we not spend the money for programs that have already been appropriated i was shocked to find that under consideration at present they have not offered the list yet but the second list is on its way i understand and under consideration are several programs relating to libraries library programs of tiny amounts of money are being called pork barrel projects pork barrel i think that the very fact that the term pork barrel could be applied to tiny very sparsely funded library programs is an indication of the depth to which common sense has fallen in this city there obviously is no common sense no decency anymore in terms of terminology when you call public library programs and other programs funded for libraries programs that are pork barrel programs but there is a rescission list which includes library programs the administration has begun proposing certain fiscal year 1992 program projects for rescission and 68 rescission requests have already been sent to congress and no library education projects are included in the first 68 but the library programs are on the second list to continue with my special order on libraries i was noting the fact that the administration which by its letter shows that it recognizes the importance of libraries nevertheless by its actions on the budget is demonstrating a lack of concern a lack of really understanding the role that libraries play in the educational process we are at an hour now where education is on the list of everybody in washington we have heard of america 2000 and the presidents strategy for improving education and numerous proposals for improving education we have six goals that we are trying to meet all those goals require that libraries be involved nevertheless the same administration that proposes the six goals and so many other forward movements on education is recommending to cut libraries on the hit list for libraries is the lsca5 program this is the library services and construction act title 5 program which provides direct competitive discretionary grants to state and public libraries for the acquisition of foreign language materials foreign language materials become very important as we move into a new world order where the obvious global coming together will take place at a faster rate without the evil empire without the competition between communism and capitalism it is likely that we are going to have a speedier rate of interaction between cultures and nations foreign languages have become far more important than they have in the past not just to people in universities and colleges but there should be a lot of distribution of foreign language books in general only a small amount of money is involved we are talking about 32 states requesting a total of about 4 billion that is on the hit list as a pork barrel project the higher education act title 6 section 607 which also deals with international and foreign language studies that is on the proposed hit list of pork barrel projects it is unfortunate that at a time when the term new world order has been coined by the president and by this administration we are taking steps backward from our preparation for the new world order merely by understanding languages and cultures of various nations throughout the globe i ask unanimous consent to enter the entire text of this
