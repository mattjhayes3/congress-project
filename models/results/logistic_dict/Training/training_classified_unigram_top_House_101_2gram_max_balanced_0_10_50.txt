that all americans are created equal today more than 25 years since the passage of the 1964 civil rights act we will be passing the americans with disabilities act we will thus ensure that persons with disabilities are finally granted the same equal protection of the laws enjoyed by all other americans this action by the congress is long over due the discrimination which disabled americans and their families historically have faced has resulted in shattered dreams of untold numbers of people yes discrimination the supreme court in the 1985 alexander versus choate decision said discrimination against the handicapped was perceived by congress to be most often the product not of invidious animus but rather of thoughtlessness indifference and of benign neglect it is not the malicious violent ugly discrimination experienced on account of ones race national origin or religion but the barriers society has erected and our tolerance of them has resulted in denial of opportunities the rest of us take for granted and the types of discrimination faced by disabled people are pervasivemore pervasive and extensive than i could have imagined we take for granted activities of daily living denied many disabled americans imagine living every day of your life not being able to get out of your home because of steps not being able to go to the bathroom alone because the door is too narrow not being able to call a friend because you are deaf and there is no relay service not being able to operate an elevator because the floors were not marked in braille not being able to go to stores for fear of being denied entrance because you have cerebral palsy not being able to get on a bus because it is not accessible being afraid to apply for a job because you have experienced discrimination but had no way of redressing it the americans with disabilities act acknowledges that these denials of opportunities have been unjust and must no longer be tolerated today more than 66 percent of working age persons with disabilities in our country are unemployed they are unemployed for many reasons inaccessible public transportation inaccessible work facilities and pervasive job discrimination the americans with disabilities act will help put an end to this staggering unnecessary problem for the past year much attention has focused on the cost of meeting such standards as reasonable accommodation and readily accessible but what of the costs of continuing to be indifferent to the denial of opportunities experienced by 43 million disabled americans we pay more than 60 billion a year to disabled people who are not working yet polls tell us 80 percent of persons with disabilities who are not working believe they are capable of working and want to work the disabled know that the obstacles they face are not inherent in their disabilities car the cost of any reasonable accommodation compare to what we are paying to keep qualified people unemployed this bill was introduced in 1988 it has passed the senate and gone through four committee hearings on the house side this bill has been debated exhaustively the president and his staff have worked toward the passage of this monumental piece of legislation the civil rights community labor womens organizations the religious community disabled people their friends families and advocates have fought for the passage of this bill leaders on both sides of the aisle have worked long and hard on the provisions of this legislation the americans with disabilities act deserves to pass it will rectify many of the wrongs that have been committed against americans with disabilities it will at long last enable people to become contributory members of our society ada will also help to end the fears people have of becoming disabled we will finally see that it is not disability which limits ones ability to participate in life but it is societal barriers this bill aims at opening up opportunities for all persons with disabilities at the same time the bill does not put an undue burden on employers businesses or the community at large it strikes a balance i understand that there are concerns from the business community that the bill goes too far and from the disabled community that the bill does not go far enough the responsibility of tfxc congress is to ensure the protection if the rights of disabled people and to ensure that the community at large ii not unduly financially burdened thiz bill does just that not all will be happy but i know that we have reached a balance for justice the disabled only seek the same opportunities as all other americans we acknowledge the barriers we have tolerated it will take time but full implementation of the americans with disabilities act will also result in society no longer seeing the needs of persons with disabilities as special ramps door width braille will become part of all our lives as we no longer consider accessibility as special we cannot help but increase the selfworth of the disabled this bill will help guarantee the rights of disabled people to live anywhere they choose in this country with the knowledge that they will be treated equally under the law one will be able to go the movies eat in a restaurant shop in a store get a job stay in a hotel use the telephone system and use transportation in any state in the union disabled people will know that should fear and prejudice result in the denial of equal opportunity they will be protected the americans with disabilities act will tell children with disabilities young adults and seniors who acquire a disability that they should not be ashamed they should not fear coming out of their homes and into their communities we as a society will no longer permit actions that cause people to be treated as secondclass citizens because they have a disability this is important for disabled people to know this is important for our

65 9 miles away from the piedmont triad international airport in greensboro nc which the department of transportation classifies as a small hub and it is more than 70 miles away from raleigh durham

lot of americans are leaving the rural parts of our country moving to the big cities those big cities are getting bigger and of course we see more and more problems which cost more and more money we think it is time to reverse that trend with this legislation i have a very special interest in title ix which i would like to share with members of the committee our concern is for national forest dependent communities and they are a separate package in this particular bill i think these are often the least sophisticated of the communities that we seek to help through rural development these communities face now a very special economic problem and that is that there are changing attitudes in this country toward the harvest of oldgrowth forests and concern about endangered species that are really sending economic shock waves through these communities these communities by the way have served the united states very effectively they have harvested they process national forest timber which returns billions of dollars to the unitedstates treasury the title ix provisions utilize the unitedstates forest service these are the people that should be involved in these communities they know what the forest plans are for the future they can best predict what is going to happen and under our plan they work with local and government and state government leaders they come up with an action plan at the request of the communities involved and it utilizes a number of tools with which we are familiar in economic development partnerships costsharing loans and grants all subject to approval by the secretary of agriculture the goal is to understand their future and the options to retool local mills if that is in their future and it is the most efficient step in encouraging the development of new industries and new job opportunities and provide retraining this measure brings its own source of funding to rural development by utilizing some of the timber revenues actually generated by these communities that do not overlap with the remaining features of the bill in other words we are not tapping the same source of funds twice i think it is high time that we provide recognition to these timber dependent communities that have served our country so well they perform a vital service as i have indicated and now they desperately need help and i am pleased with the leadership we have seen in the committee on agriculture in giving us this opportunity the unitedstates forest service has had rural development packages and authority in the past those are terminated in the 1991 budget
