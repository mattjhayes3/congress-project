this bill and we might want to give serious consideration to some other kind of legislation the gentleman who just spoke raises a very good point about local responsibility while not denying that i would rise immediately to say that we cannot ignore the federal responsibility either we do have difficult times with our budget problems right now some would seem to stagger the imagination and the ability of both the congress and the administration to resolve nevertheless the federal responsibility does not go away for example we do not have enough prisons to detain the federal prison ers we have had an arrangement in my district at least whereby the overflow of federal prisoners was kept in local jails that is a nice arrangement except that there is a problem we are under a federal court order that the local jails cannot take any more prisoners because they are overcrowded that raises the question well then why do you not build more jails and the answer is we do not have the money with real estate as the sole tax base upon which to finance both the city and the countyi am sure that is a problem all over the countryyou run up against the wall as to what you can do what you are able to do then you run into an additional problem and that is as in south florida as my distinguished colleague the gentleman from florida mentioned you get an impact which is beyond local capability yes there is a responsibility at the local level with respect to drug enforcement however the drug enforcement and the drug problem is international in scope as well as certainly interstate and intrastate my goodness if this bill could reach just one small part of this major national difficulty notwithstanding the fact that it impacts tremendously on south florida and is beginning to impact heavily on other jurisdictions we will have made tremendous strides even though in terms of dollars what we are trying to do is insignificant i supported leaa at first but i voted against it ultimately because it was not doing the job i think we have to face that problem in the congress we have to be able to adopt new programs and reject old ones and we have to keep trying i do not have any simple solution but i rise in strong support of this bill i think it is a step that is absolutely essential the ultimate responsibility for federal problems rests here and in the administration we have to be able to fund them and we have to have the policy and the execution and the implementation without that you can lay all of the burdens on the states and local communities you want to and they will struggle and they will do the best they can but without this kind of input it ultimately will result in disaster the circle that we are dealing with is so aggravating has persisted so long and has been ignored for so long i am not sure that we can solve it all but at least we can say at the federal level that we are trying to measure up to our responsibility within the amount of money we have got available 0 131e i hate to rise against this amendment we need the jails we need federal jails we need state jails we need municipal and county jails but at least let us take this first step without adding this burden to this bill give us a chance to get some kind of federal responsibility to assist local law enforcement i rise in strong support of h r 4481 the justice assistance act and urge our colleagues to carefully consider the importance of this legislation to our local communities it is essential to recognize that we must have a unified federal law enforcement program to assist local communities at times when outside support is temporarily required we can no longer afford to wait until crises befall us before preparing a wellconsidered effective plan to deal with emergency situations for too long we have been put in the position of slapping together a program under pressure and time constraints in order to meet real and urgent needs of our communities this is unacceptable the federal government has to be ready to offer assistance and support as soon as a community crisis takes shape and it is clear outside help is needed and requested this bill offers law enforcement grants to state and local governments for community anticrime programs programs for drugdependent offenders training for criminal justice personnel and coordinating activities among law enforcement agencies in particular title ii addresses the problem of getting assistance to local law enforcement authorities in a quick organized and effective manner yet in meeting these urgent needs h r 4481 recognizes that state and local governments have the primary responsibility for combating crime within their own jurisdictions this bill simply provides the means whereby in special situations such as the mariel boatlift in 1980 the continuing influx of illegal aliens in south florida and the escalating criminal activities due to increased drug trafficking these authorities may apply to the federal law enforcement community to step in quickly with assistance that augments but does not override the local efforts in the past there have been successful efforts to obtain additional funds from the federal government to assist with extraordinary expenses incurred by local police agencies as a result of the refugee influx however such support came sparingly and with too much obfuscation and delay h r 4481 facilitates this entire process by permitting application to be made in one step directly to the justice department we in south florida know only too well the price we pay for a lack of coordinated efforts and assistance from the federal level i say it is time we stop asking one small group of citizens to cope with crime bear the burden of the refugees and hold the front line against drug smuggling we must attack crime on every front with strong effective tools this bill not only represents an important step toward streamlining the process of getting needed assistance to deserving local communities but also helps provide those necessary tools i urge your support of this legislation"], [3.8623809814453125e-05, 0.5000386238098145, 0, "some have accused

after one reviews this amendment as enticing as it looks on the surfaceafter the smoke clears awaywe can easily discern that it is not a thinking persons amendment why my real concern and i know yours too is jobs and a secure defense the t5 tanker program would mean 5 300 more years of american jobs over a 3year period the program would generate more than 152 million to the shipbuilding industry and support services this would in turn generate 3 million in state income tax and another 5 million in sales tax this along with our nations defense is a compelling argument for the t5 tanker notwithstanding the jobs concern there is the question of whether the navy should be saddled with equipment and technology which taxes their mission and is behind the curve of current technology the only american alternative to foreign engine on the t5 propulsion system would cost in excess of an additional 100 million and be well behind the current technological stateoftheart i ask you to remember the navy is leasing this ship and will not have to pay for the fuel and maintenance on these engines and i think it is the least we can do for them and our fellow taxpayers that we give them the powerplant that will do the most for the least money the sponsor of this amendment is trying to impose one policy on the navy when it has ships built for purchase and another on a civilian company when it builds a ship for navy charter the author of the amendment wants to tell a private shipbuilder who builds a ship for lease to the navy that when they build a ship it must be 100 percent domestically built but on the other hand if the navy were having it built for purchase we would be willing to settle for a mere 51percent domestic content totally illogical as the navy is not buying these vessels but leasing them it certainly has no interest in circumventing any buy america act provisions instead unlike the alleged buy america banner the sponsor of the amendment waves the proposed domestic content of the t5 tanker is 92 percentyes 92 percent the act cloaks himself in passed by this congress requires 51 percent that is why i allege this amendment is not a thinking persons amendment basicallyi want to save these 5 300 manyears of american jobs involved in the construction of the t5 tanker yes i am as much a proponent of buy american as the next person but
