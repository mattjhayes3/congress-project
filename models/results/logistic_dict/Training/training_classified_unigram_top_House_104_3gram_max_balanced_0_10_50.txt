frankly this is one of the worst pieces of legislation i have ever seen in the 40 years i have served in this body the bill includes both medicare and medicaid cuts and tax breaks our republican colleagues said that they were not tying the two together well they are tying them together in this bill the poor and the aged are going to understand that the contributions that they are making of about 500 billion is being made so that a tax cut can be given to the wealthiest americans that is finally proven in this piece of legislation the pernicious approach violates the contract we have with seniors who have paid for their medicare benefits it means seniors will pay more and get less choice of doctors poor quality lab tests and nursing homes that do not meet common standards of decency by separating action on medicare from the rest of reconciliation republicans tried to convince us that 270 billion in medicare cuts do not pay for 245 billion in tax breaks for the rich but americans can perform the simple math required they know when someone is pulling the wool over their eyes the bill also destroys medicaid under the mantra of states rights republicans are pulling the safety net out from under middle class families poor children women seniors and the disabledthe most vulnerable of americans up until last night the republican bill arbitrarily cut 182 billion from medicaid now they say they have fixed it by cutting only 170 billion but this midnight deal does not change the fact that this bill abdicates the federal governments role in medicaid reduces health care for the most needy and invites abuse by states it takes away vitally important guarantees under current law protection from having to sell the family home or farm to pay for a loved ones nursing home care guaranteeing coverage for seniors with alzheimers setting minimum standards of safety cleanliness and decency for nursing homes and guaranteeing health care for children and pregnant women i and other members tried to correct one of the most glaring defects in the bill by offering an amendment on behalf of mr gingrich in debate last week the speaker obviously was under the misimpression that his new medigrant program does what current law guaranteescovering the cost of medicare premiums for seniors under the poverty line in fact this bill repeals what current law provides our amendment would have restored provisions the speaker erroneously relied on and guarantee that the poorest of seniors have medicare coverage but the rules committee gagged us from amending the bill so that it will do what the speaker says it does i also want to point out the devastating impact that this bill has on health care for veterans the secretary of veterans affairs says that the harsh spending caps in the republican plan will require 41 veterans hospitals to close their doors as a result more than 1 million veterans will be denied health care by 2002 i do not share the misguided view of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that the best way for veterans to stay healthy is not to get sick this bill walks away from responsible government to help people in need in favor of lining the pockets of the wealthiest americans with unneeded tax cuts in addition to health care cuts this bill slashes education job training and other programs upon which we empower people to help themselves most americans will get nothing or pay more under the gop tax break the small percentage of the tax cuts that will go to families earning less than 50 000 a year will be more than offset by spending cuts these families stand to lose 648 a year or more under the gop plan those earning more than 350 000 the richest 1 percentwill get 14 050 a year for the tax cut i find it curious that my republican colleagues who criticize the president for not cutting middle class taxes enough are rushing to raise taxes on many low income families i must confess i am not surprised however that they would follow through on their threats to slash programs vital to the financial security of working americans finally i must object to the cavalier manner in which the republican leadership has included massive changes in farm programs the socalled freedomtofarm proposal was found to be so objectionable that the house agriculture committee failed to get it out of committee on an issue as vital as our nations food security this bill shreds responsible legislating for partisan game playing and makes rural americans the pawns this is not the way to legislate and it is a dangerous way to govern this is the biggest and the most important bill to be considered by the house this year the cuts are too large it hurts terribly the health care coverage of millions of americans i strongly oppose the bill i now look forward to hearing from my republican colleagues about what a great piece of legislation this is i reserve the balance of my time"], [7.62939453125e-06, 0.9999923706054688,

bringing us a 500 billion economic package have proposed a 500 billion economic plan tax break package mostly for the wealthy that will result in more cuts to medicare more cuts to student loans more cuts to medicaid and more cuts to environmental programs let us look at a bit of history as we discuss this dole economic plan and as we discuss the cuts in medicare and what all of that means and what that meant last year last year the plan of the speaker the gentleman from georgia and senator dole was to give some 245 billion in tax breaks mostly for the wealthy and they planned to pay for this plan by making 270 billion of cuts in medicare and several billion about 180 billion cuts in medicaid several billion worth of cuts in student loans and several billion of cuts in environmental protection this 245 billion tax break mostly for the wealthy which would result in the 270 billion in medicare cuts was the beginning of the unraveling of the medicare program let me quote what speaker gingrich said about medicare and let me quote what thensenator dole said about medicare last october speaker gingrich speaking to a group of insurance executives all of whom would benefit greatly from this dismantling of the medicare program said now we didnt get rid of medicare in round one because we dont think that is politically smart we dont think that is the right way to go through a transition but we believe that medicare is going to wither on the vine the same day speaking to another group a group called the american conservation union thensenator dole who was leading the fight for the medicare cuts in the senate said i was there fighting the fight voting against medicare one of 12 because we knew it wouldnt work in 1965 since that time the same people that tried to on the one hand say they are here to try to defend medicare and save medicare are attacking medicare under their breath attacking medicare behind closed doors in republican caucuses and occasionally letting it slip and attacking medicare in public one prominent member of the committee on ways and means called medicare socialized medicine the majority leader the gentleman from texas said that in a free society medicare would not exist whatever that means other prominent republicans have labeled medicare a program of socialism a program that does not make sense for people a program that we simply do not need the point is that this crowd gingrich dole the gentleman from texas mr armey the leadership of the republican party not mainstream republicanism which most people in this country that are republicans i think are more likely to believe in and not the mainstream republicanism that supported medicare in past decades but this new extremist crowd of gingrich and armey and the gentleman from texas tom delay and some of the other leaders in the other house are simply opposed to medicare they wanted it to wither on the vine they bragged about voting against it it is pretty clear that this 245 billion tax cut they proposed last year and paid for by the 200some billion tax cuts in medicare are the way they can end the program of medicare end the programs of student loans end some of the environnlental protection measures that brings us to the point today to the dole program today he has proposed in the presidential race i might add that senator dole and his running mate mr kemp came to the republican caucus today to talk about how they were going to pay for the major tax break mostly for the wealthy and talk about how they were going to do the medicare cuts a few republicans have stood up and been honest about what the dole economic plan means if you are going to provide 500 billion in tax breaks mostly for the rich then you are going to have to cut medicare even more than thensenator dole and speaker gingrich proposed last year that simply means that if it was 270 billion in cuts in medicare last year they are going to propose even more cuts this year once they are honest with the public what that really means is those senior citizens that are now paying 46 a month for medicare premiums will have their premium at least doubled to 90 or 100 or maybe 110 a month to pay for their premium it also means that deductibles will be higher it also means that copays will be higher so that this party this gingrichdole party that says they are against tax increases clearly want to put this senior citizen tax on medicare beneficiaries it is not 46 a month which is what it used to be or 5 or 10 copayments what it used to be or 50 deductible what it used to be all of a sudden it is probably going to be double that in order to pay for this huge 500 billion in tax breaks mostly for the wealthy at the same time they are going to go right at the heart of student loans and end the student loan program that students in this country have been accustomed to raise the prices on other kinds of student loans and student grants cut student grants and raise the prices on other student loans and in order again to pay for this 500 billion boondoggle mostly for wealthy taxpayers to go after programs that protect the environment something the american people clearly will not stand for i yield to the gentleman from texas"], [8.821487426757812e-06, 0.9999911785125732, 1, "i want to address the house about the fact that increasingly and persistently we see efforts on the part of the republican leadership in the past in 1995 again this year and i suspect unfortunately to continue through the rest of 1996 efforts to cut medicare and medicaid i also want to remind my colleagues on the republican side and particularly the gop leadership about the need to pass health insurance reform my colleagues on the democratic side are aware of the fact that we have within our caucus a democratic health care task force part of our effort has been to try to preserve medicare and medicaid and to oppose the drastic cuts in medicare and medicaid that would negatively impact americas seniors if the republican proposals were to go forth in the house of representatives and in the senate similarly our democratic health care task force has been supportive of legislation that was originally introduced by senator kassebaum who is a republican and senator kennedy who is a democrat and here in the house by one of my colleagues on the republican side the gentlewoman from new jersey mrs rouxema that would try to reform the health care system to provide coverage insurance coverage for those people who lose their jobs or have to change jobs and also those americans who suffer from preexisting medical conditions who are unable to get health insurance now because of restrictions in the private health insurance market i just wanted to say very briefly before i went into a few details about why it is necessary to keep up this battle against cuts in medicare and medicaid to say very briefly that on the issue of medicare the republican plans have basically been to eliminate provider choice to seniors to allow doctors to overcharge seniors to force seniors to pay more out of pocket and to get less under medicare and basically to cut medicare and medicare programs for seniors in order to use the money for tax breaks primarily for wealthy americans on the issue of medicaid most of the republican plans have been to eliminate benefit guarantees to seniors for the disabled children and also many other american families and to allow states to cut an additional 178 billion on top of the congressional republican cut of 72 billion i wanted to start out this evening though by talking about the kennedykassebaum bill and the effort to provide health insurance reform this year that has basically been spearheaded here in the house of representatives not only by democrats but also some republicans who feel that modest health insurance reform is the way to go in this congress before we adjourn the president president clinton pledged his support for the bipartisan kennedykassebaum bill in his state of the union address earlier this year and congressional democrats have tried to work with moderate republicans to get the bill on its way to the presidents desk the senate passed the kennedykassebaum bill 100 to 0 unanimously but what is holding up this bipartisan health insurance reform bill is the republican leaderships insistence here in the house on adding medical savings accounts a special perk for the healthy and wealthy that lets them opt out of traditional health plans and drives up costs for everyone else who remains in traditional health plans the senate voted not to include the medical savings account perk in their version of the bill but house republicans and rightwing senate republicans still demand that it be included in the final version sent to the president i am asked over and over again why is that the speaker speaker gingrich and his republican colleagues in the leadership are so determined to include msas or medical savings accounts in an otherwise bipartisan bill the reason i believe is because of the 1 2 million in political contributions to the gop over the past year i should say over the past 5 years that have come from j patrick rooney and other executives of the of the golden rule insurance co which will reap massive profits if the republican medical savings accounts plan becomes law a few weeks ago the consumers union which is a group that puts out reports from time to time on health care issues issued a report actually on june 26 of this year that is entitled medical savings accounts a growing threat to consumers health care security i am not going to get into all the details of this consumers union report here this afternoon but i just wanted to touch on the executive summary which begins the report and explains why msas or medical savings accounts are harmful to most consumers it says in the executive summary of this consumers union report that the medical savings accounts would basically not only be a roadblock to congressional enactment of modest health insurance reform that addresses the issue of portability when people change jobs or when they have a preexisting medical condition but basically would devastate consumers in the health care system so here we have a situation where we are moving or we are trying to move those of us who support this kennedykassebaum bill in a way that would include more people who now do not have health insurance we know that many americans have no health insurance and we are trying to get more of them coverage so we are saying if you lose a job or you transfer a job or you have a preexisting medical condition we want you to be able to get health insurance but msas or the inclusion of msas in this bill would do just the opposite it would drive up the costs of health insurance and make it more difficult for more americans to get insured because of the increased costs that health insurance would have a key conclusion of this consumers union report says and there are three one that the proposed msas will mean severe financial hardships for families that use msas because they are devoid of essential consumer protections families with average income would have to pay 9 percent to 23 percent of annual income for health care before msa coverage kicks in now understand that when you talk about msas it is a high deductible policy it basically says when you have a catastrophic problem that your health care needs would be taken care of but if you have anything less than that your ordinary daily medical needs then you have to pay out of pocket the consumers union report says second that millions of consumers will find that the health insurance that they want the most the traditional lowdeductible comprehensive coverage is no longer available to them and third that msas are likely to increase the already large number of uninsured and underinsured americans making it even harder for congress to make health care affordable and accessible i wanted to cite 10 ways that the consumers union mentions why msas harm consumers they list them as follows first msas expose individuals to paying the first 5 000 for health care each year before insurance coverage kicks in this is the high deductible for families it is 7 500 second msas allow insurance compaifies to charge consumers 30 percent on all covered expenses after the deductible is met so even after you go beyond the deductible you are talking about a 30 percent outofpocket cost third msas allow insurance companies to include low lifetime limits in their policies leaving families unprotected against the cost of catastrophic illness fourth msas do not provide a cap on outofpocket costs fifth msas would lead to drastic premium increases for traditional comprehensive policies ultimately promoting the elimination of these policies in some markets what you are doing here if you are healthy or you are wealthy you buy this high deductible msa but because the healthy and wealthy people are now taken out of the insurance pool the costs for those who are left in the insurance pool goes up premiums go up and a lot of people simply cannot afford traditional health insurance anymore the sixth point that consumer union makes is that msas leave benefit design up to insurance companies allowing policies that exclude preventive care and conditions such as pregnancy seventh msas do not require insurance companies to accept all individuals who apply for coverage or to charge them a fair price eighth msas do not require employers to contribute to the high deductible insurance policy or the employees msa in other words contributions from your employer are voluntary ninth msas do not require employers who offer them to also offer employees a choice of a traditional low deductible comprehensive health insurance plan your traditional health insurance plan and lastly tenth msas do not require employers to continue to spend the same amount on health care coverage that they do today essentially the conclusion in brief that the consumer union report makes is that congress should keep msas out of health insurance ieform legislation i could nothave said it better if we are going to see comprehensive health insurance reform passed this year in the house in the senate and be signed by the president that addresses the issues of portability and makes it possible for people with preexisting conditions to get health insurance that they need msas cannot be included i have to hope that between the house and the senate over the next few weeks or the next few months before we adjourn that an effort is made on a bipartisan basis to simply move the original kennedykassebaum bill without msas otherwise there will be no health insurance reform passed in congress and signed into law this year which i think would be a tragedy for so many millions of americans who need health insurance and cannot get it now because of the restrictions that exist under existing law i wanted to spend a little time on the medicare issue and also a little bit on the medicaid issue because medicare and medicaid are so important not only to senior citizens not only to lowincome people but also hospitals because so many of our hospitals and our health care institutions are heavily medicare and medicaid dependent and if we make the kind of drastic cuts in medicare and medicaid that the republican leadership has been proposing for the last 18 months our hospitals and our health care institutions in general will suffer many of them will actually close because they will not have sufficient funds to continue to operate medicare right now provides quality health care benefits for over 32 million senior citizens but again the republican leadership wants to transform medicare into a program of substandard care the republican leadership says that medicare is in crisis we hear that time and time again on the floor of this house they say that that is because it is running a deficit but i would argue that minor adjustments not a major overhaul could insure medicare solvency when democrats were in the majority we made sure that medicare was being adequately funded in 1982 the medicare trustees predicted that the medicare trust fund would run out of money by 1986 but obviously that did not happen democrats protected medicare and maintained a level of quality care for senior citizens into the 1990s now that the republicans are in the majority they are scaring senior citizens by saying that medicare is again going to go bankrupt in the early part of the next decade and using words like reform to disguise their efforts to destroy the medicare program if you listen to speaker newt gingrich i would maintain that his real motives lie in a speech he gave during last years medicare debate where the speaker said he wanted to see medicare wither on the vine that is a sign i would say of the misguided republican leadership that medicare would be led to wither on the vine so many of those who are now in the leadership speaker gingrich mr dole now the republican presidential candidate in particular did not support medicare when it was first voted on the floor here of the house of representatives 30 some odd years ago i think it is a sign of the misguided republican leadership that medicare has run its first ever deficit in its 31 years as a health care program for senior citizens now when the republicans are in control of congress the republican budget that was passed just a few weeks ago or perhaps a month ago now calls for over 168 billion in cuts reductions or whatever you want to call them in the medicare program i do not want to get into this debate on whether it is a real cut or a cut in the growth of the program but in any case it is a 168 billion cut basically the republican leadership is proposing to take money out of the medicare program in order to pay for tax breaks for wealthy americans although the amount of money being taken from medicare is significant i do not want to downplay that the devil is really in the details because the republican leadership is proposing a major overhaul of medicare to make it less efficient and more costly for seniors as much as we decry as democrats the cuts in medicare more significant is what the republicans are trying to do to restructure the medicare program basically their proposal calls for coopting senior citizens into managed care i do not have a problem with managed care per se but i do not believe in speaker gingrichs attempts to force seniors into managed care and somehow say that that is giving senior citizens more choices the only choice that the republican leadership is giving to seniors under their medicare plan is the choice to receive substandard health care where medicare historically offered patients their own choice of doctors protected against high outofpocket costs and offered a guaranteed level of coverage the republican leadership proposal would essentially take that all away in addition and this goes back to what i was saying before the republicans are proposing to incorporate the medical savings accounts what we discussed before in the context of health care reform they want to incorporate the msas also into the medicare overhaul last year the nonpartisan congressional budget office stated that these tax breaks the msa tax breaks would actually cost medicare several billion dollars again an effort to restructure medicare and i would maintain overhaul it in a way that has a very negative impact on americas senior citizens i would urge really that senior citizens again take notice of what is happening here and what is being propqsed by the republicans and call on congress to protect medicare from any further raids by speaker gingrich and the republican leadership lastly this afternoon i want to talk a little bit about medicaid medicaid many people think of as the program for poor people but it also pays about 50 percent of all nursing home care for senior citizens the republican budget makes extreme cuts 72 billion over 6 years to the medicaid program and allows states to cut an additional 178 billion for a grand total of 250 billion in medicaid cuts these medicaid cuts are over and above the medicare cuts i discussed before without medicaid many middleclass adult children of nursing home parents will have to pay for their parents expensive care while trying to send their own children through college so keep in mind and i say that to those americans who would have parents or grandparents that are in nursing homes if you have to end up paying for a lot of their care that means less money out of your pocket that you might not have available to pay for your own children your own childrens education or other programs recently the commerce committee voted on the medicaid repeal act the republican medicaid proposal i am a member of the committee on commerce and i fought very hard against this bill when it came to our committee the republican medicaid repeal act will eliminate all current guarantees of health care coverage and eliminate current guarantees of nursing home benefits to the elderly i offered an amendment during the markup in the committee on commerce that would return these guarantees in this terrible legislation but it was rejected by every republican on the committee other democrats offered similar amendments to continue health care coverage for the disabled for children for pregnant women again all of these were defeated by the republican members of the committee on top of all this the gop medical repeal act will sharply reduce payments to hospitals for care i said before i do not think a lot of people realize how dependent many of americas hospitals and health care institutions are on medicare and medicaid in new jersey my state a lot of hospitals have the majority of their income from those two federal and state programs what i am concerned about is with these steep cuts that are being proposed in both programs a lot of hospitals in new jersey and throughout the country will simply have to close their doors i think at a time when congress should be seeking ways to decrease the number of uninsured and underinsured the republican leaderships answers will make these problems worse what we are talking about here is an effort to try to provide quality health care for seniors and for all americans the bottom line is that more and more americans today and you can make a comparison with last year 2 years ago 5 years 10 years ago every year more and more americans and the percentage of americans are uninsured and have no health insurance if we make these drastic changes in medicare and medicaid if we do not do what is necessary to reform health care insurance along the lines of what senators kassebaum and kennedy have proposed then we are going to see more and more americans be uninsured and not have health care the consequences to our society are severe not only today but certainly tomorrow the irony really too of the republican budget which was passed in this house not too long ago is that in addition to making these cuts in medicare and medicaid it also increases the deficit in the past democrats were able to decrease the deficit and still preserve medicare and medicaid i think that this is just a strong indication of the misplaced priorities and values of the republican leadership if they find it necessary to cut medicare and medicaid and in the same context are actually increasing the deficit i remain committed to fighting these republican efforts that would raise the deficit while slashing medicare and medicaid and i know that myself and many of my democratic colleagues will continue to speak out over the next few weeks and the next few months until this session ends to remind american seniors that we cannot make these drastic changes in the medicare and the medicaid program and that we need to pass health insurance reform now and certainly before the end of this session of congress"], [9.059906005859375e-06, 0.9999909400939941, 1, "today i rise to voice my dismay at the ongoing assault taking place on some of the most important educational programs in this country

promises and if you go back to the 1992 presidential campaign you will recall that the president campaigned on a promise of ending welfare as we know it and a promise of reducing middleclass taxes we want to do both we do both in the balanced budget act of 1995 which he vetoed yesterday so i want to say again the president with one stroke of the pen yesterday vetoed tax cuts for families and do noti know the american people see through this smokescreen this constant class warfare demagoguery that they hear daily on the floor of this congress and i think that is evidence of just how intellectually bankrupt the congressional democratic party has become at times but i know the american people see through that but i simply want to stand here today and tell you that threequarters of the tax relief we provide in the balanced budget act goes to families with dependent children we think that is very important we think it is fundamentally important to give american families an economic dividend from the first balanced budget in 25 years yes we do philosophically believe that the american people are entitled to keep more of their own hardearned money that they are in a better position to determine how to spend that money than the federal government and the federal bureaucracy back here in washington so we give tax relief to families we have especially helped middleclass families which have felt the burden the twin whammy the pinch if you will of rising taxes and stagnant or even declining wages in recent years so our tax relief is targeted to middleclass and lowincome families and in fact our tax relief would completely eliminate the federal tax liability of 4 7 of the lowestincome families in america that is what the president vetoed yesterday he vetoed a 2 5 trillion increase in federal spending in the next 7 years over the last 7 years as i mentioned earlier how much more money does the president want to spend we will not know until we get a detailed proposal a counter proposal if you will from the president i will point out that when the president vetoed the balanced budget act yesterday he vetoed the american people because in the largest public opinion survey ever taken 7 200 registered voters with a margin of error of 1 percent on the issue of a balanced budget the american people said yes to our plan to balance the budget fiftyseven percent of the american people surveyed embraced our plan after being given a few facts a few facts not the rhetoric not the distortions not the demagogery facts about how our plan treats programs like medicare student loans which increase from 24 billion to 36 billion a 12 billion increase over the next 7 years social security which has always been off the table and i think that is one of our biggest accomplishments balancing our budget while providing tax relief for american families and without touching social security in fact i think as other members have pointed out we have to generate a budget surplus here in washington by 2002 or sooner so we can begin paying down and ultimately paying off the national debt and repaying the money to the social security trust fund that we have borrowed over the years in fact i think our constituents and our colleagues need a reminder that 1 5 trillion of the 5 trillion national debt that we have today is money borrowed from the trust funds of the federal government chiefly social security so we have to repay that money the only way we can do that obviously is to balance the federal budget and then generate a budget surplus year in and year out i still get wideeyed looks when i raise the idea of budget surplus from my constituents in my town meetings but we are going to do that as i told one of my constituents at the beginning of this year who asked me in a town meeting congressman will i ever see a balanced budget in my lifetime i said yes you will you will see it this session of congress and you will see in your lifetime budget surpluses in washington that go to pay down and pay off the national debt so our children do not inherit thatdebt so 57 percent of the american people embraced the plan after they learned the facts 86 percent believed that the president and congress should deal with the budget issue now that is the language of the shortterm congressional the continuing resolution that expires next friday we said shall not maybe not if we said we shall deal with the budget now seventyone percent of the people surveyed agreed that president clinton should submit a 7year balanced budget plan scored by the nonpartisan congressional budget office as he himself once promised to do in a state of the union address standing at that podium right there behind me my what a difference an election makes and the hypocrisy quotient begins to go up again seventythree percent of the people surveyed agreed that the president and congress will not balance the budget unless they stick to the 7year deadline again that is from the largest public opinion survey ever taken in the history of our country so i wanted to try and stress a couple of those points i wanted to take a moment again just to look at what the president said yesterday when he vetoed the balanced budget act h r 2491 and i quote from a transcript of his veto message which was on the unitedstates news wire yesterday the bill seeks to make extreme cuts and other unacceptable changes in medicare and medicaid i am here on the floor tonight to say to the president to my colleagues to my constituents and to the american people that there are absolutely no extreme cuts in the balanced budget act of 1995 total federal spending as i have already mentioned over the next 7 years when compared to the last 7 years actually increases 2 5 trillion specifically there are no extreme cuts and i quote now from the president there are no extreme cuts and other unacceptable changes in medicare and medicaid a spending increase is not a cut as the president himself said in 1993 when he also proposed slowing the rate of growth of medicare today medicaid and medicare are going up at three times the rate of inflation the president recognized that was an unsustainable rate of growth in both of those programs then he went on to say we propose to let it go up at two times the rate of inflation that is not a medicare or medicaid cut from a speech he gave to aarp the american association of retired persons on october 5 1993 what has changed if anything medicare and medicaid are in worse condition worse shape today than they were back on october 5 1993 but what do we do in our bill we increase medicare spending 6 percent a year between this year fiscal year 1995 and fiscal year 2002 medicare spending in actual dollar numbers increases from 178 to 289 billion a 62percent increase here is the real news to the american people the difference between our proposal on medicare part b premiums and the presidents proposal is 4 a month 4 a month in the year 2002 that is what the president calls an extreme unacceptable cut of course the flip side of that is to make american workers including minimumwage workers pay even more taxes so that medicare part b recipients do not have to pay a slight increase in premiums it just astounds me again the cynicism and hypocrisy that we see and the evolution here of the presidents position over the last couple of years medicare spending never differs more than 2 percent under the two plans and in two of the next 7 years our republican balanced budget actually spends more on medical care than the presidents budget overall the difference in total medicare spending betweenthe two plans is 32 billion or 1 9 percent the other program the president singled out was medicaid yes we will no longer allow medicaid to be an individual entitlement a universal individual entitlement we make it instead a block grant program to the states at the request of the governors i pointed out earlier that the president when he was the governor of arkansas requested these same innovations i would also like the american people and my democratic colleagues to understand that we are working very closely with the governors in developing our plans and in developing the particulars of the balanced budget act of 1995 why are we doing that we now have 31 republican governors in america representing 71 percent of the american people are we not going to consult them are we going to leave them out of the equation are we not going to treat them as equal partners in developing the balanced budged act of course not we have been acting on their bequest here as we craft a plan for reforming medicaid instead we have a medigrant proposal which gives states more money greater flexibility less bureaucratic redtape just as the president wanted when he was a governor and which increase medicaid spending by 55 percent there is nothing extreme and unacceptable about lowering interest rates giving american workers more takehome pay saving medicare from bankruptcy ending welfare as we know it increasing spending and giving more power to the american people that is just what i said earlier i want to repeat it for emphasis because that is what the president vetoed yesterday i see i am joined by my very good friend and colleague the gentlewoman from california i wanted to point out to her she probably already knows this but with our medicare reforms california which is a highcost highgrowth state will get even more funding for medicare recipients medicare recipients 4 n california are going to realize and receive an increase of 5 000 per beneficiary today to over 8 000 per medicare beneficiary in california in the year 2002 our plans to balance the federal budget in 7 years anticipate that we will spend over 50 000 per medicare beneficiary in california over the next 7 years that is what the president apparently feels is extreme and unacceptable i yield to the gentlewoman from california mrs"]], "top_incorrect": [[0.9951392412185669, 0.9951392412185669, 0, "in the house at over 178 billion let us just understand that i say to our senior citizens mr president the 178 billion they want for tax breaks for wealthy individuals and corporations where are they getting it by squeezing the medicare system it is wrong and the seniors understood that it was wrong last year and it is wrong this year as well just as there is nothing really new in this years trustees report there is nothing really new in this years republican retread as they did last year republicans try to justify their deep medicare cuts by claiming they are needed to preserve medicare against the insolvency of the hospital insurance trust fund the hypocrisy of this claim is so transparent that no senior citizen should take it seriously last year a few weeks before they proposed their massive medicare cuts house republicans passed a tax bill that took almost 90 billion in revenues out of the medicare hospital insurance trust fund over the next 10 yearsand brought it that much closer to insolvency understand republicans took 90 billion out of that last year for the purposes of their tax breaks we did not hear a word then about the impending bankruptcy in medicare the presidents economic recovery plan in 1993 extended the solvency of the trust fund for 3 years it passed without a single republican vote when we had the opportunity to provide for additional kinds of solvency we were unable to get a single republican vote we did not hear a word from the republicans then about the impending bankruptcy of medicare like last year the republican plan proposes deep cuts in medicare to fund new undeserved tax breaks for the wealthy like last year the republican plan is designed to cause medicare to wither on the vine in the words of speaker gingrichby forcing senior citizens to give up their family doctor and join private insurance plans majority leader dole has said that enacting medicare was a mistake from the beginningand he is trying to use this budget to correct that mistake last year republicans tried to justify their excessive medicare cuts with a large array of misguided arguments this year they are repeating the same arguments as if repetition can somehow substitute for reality the american people were not fooled last yearand they certainly will not be fooled this year when republicans took up the issue last year they proposed to cut medicare by 270 billionthree times more than the amount the medicare trustees said was needed to stabilize the trust fund this year republicans are proposing to cut 16 7 billion from medicare by contrast the presidents plan cuts medicare by 116 billion44 percent less but it guarantees medicare solvency for 10 years and it funds medicare at the level necessary to assure that quality care will be available for senior citizens when they need it even worse republicans support an inflexible ceiling on medicare spending consequently if inflation is higher or medical needs are greater than anticipated medicare spending will not go up and many senior citizens will be out of luck and out of care an estimated 20 percent of all medicare hospitalization can be avoided by relying on better preventive services and more timely primary and outpatient care so if we have interventions earlier if we have better home care if we have the investment in our seniors to avoid the more costly expenses when they must come into the hospital that can save billions and billions of dollars we ought to be thinking about that without reducing the services for our elderly and actually improve the quality of health care for our seniors as much as 10 percent of all medicare expenditures may be due to fraud and can be reduced or eliminated by better oversight the work senator harkin has been involved in in reviewing medicaid and medicare fraud is absolutely powerful and absolutely convincing about the tens of billions of dollars that can be saved you go to any hall in this country and ask our senior citizens where there can be savings any senior citizen can give you chapter and verse about how there can be savings in the medicare system many of them can tell you about the fraud that is being perpetrated upon them at the present time we ought to address that kind of issue before we are talking about reductions in essential services medicare could save 20 billion annually if senior citizens have assistance in monitoring their medications more carefully in order to avoid adverse drug reactions we spend billions and billions of dollars a year from adverse drug reactions where the senior will go to a doctor and receive various medications receive other medications from another doctor and find there is an inconsistency in terms of taking both medications and then find they have an illness there are ways to remedy that problem to save billions and billions of dollarsagain to improve the quality of health we do not hear that issue raised or discussed or debated we do not have to destroy medicare in order to save it congress will never allow the medicare trust fund to become bankrupt i know that and the american people know it it is time for the republicans to stop raiding medicare and join in sensible steps to improve and strengthen it for the future another false republican argument in defense of their medicare cuts is that the reductions are not really cuts because the total amount of medicare spending will continue to grow but every household in america knows that if the cost of your rent the cost of your utilities and the cost of your food go upand your income stays the same or goes up more slowlyyou have taken a real cut in your living standard republicans speak of a cut in defense even though defense spending has remained stable apparently the same republican logic does not apply to spending on medicare that applies to spending on guns and tanks a cut is a cut is a cutwhether it is in medicare or social security or national defense republicans also claim that deep cuts in medicare are necessary to balance the budget but that argument only proves that republican priorities are wrong democrats favor a balanced budget and president clinton has proposed a balanced budgetbalanced fairly not balanced on the backs of senior citizens or children or workers there is a right way to balance the budget and a rightwing way and unfortunately the republicans continue to pick the rightwing way republicans deny that their medicare cuts will fund tax cuts for the wealthy this time the leopard claims that it really has changed its spots but their budget clearly envisions 60 billion in revenue increases from tax extenders and closing of selected corporate loopholes in order to fund 60 billion in new tax breaks for the undeserving rich without those new tax breaks they wouldnt need to cut medicare by 167 billion the democratic amendment eliminates these new tax breaks for the wealthy and uses them to protect medicare the medicare trust fund should not be a slush fund for republican tax breaks for the rich republicans can run as hard as they want in this election year but they can not hide from these facts even more damaging than the loss of the billions of dollars that republicans would slash from medicare is their attempt to turn medicare over to the private insurance industfy the republican budget contains a number of changes to force senior citizens to give up their own doctors and join private insurance plans once they are forced into these plans senior citizens will be stripped of many of the protections they enjoy todayprotection against overcharges by doctors and other health care providers protection against premiumgouging and profiteering by insurlance companies protection of their right to keep their own family doctor and go to the specialist of their choice republicans claim they only want to offer senior citizens a choice but this is a choice no senior citizen should be forced to make the harsh cuts in medicare contained in the republican budget are also a repudiation of our historic commitment to social security because the distinction between medicare and social security is a false one medicare is part of the same compact between the government and the people as social security that compact says contribute during your working years and we will guarantee basic income and health security in your retirement years any senior citizen who has been hospitalized or who suffers from a serious chronic illness knows that there is no retirement security without health security the cost of illness is too high a few days in an intensive care unit can cost more than the total yearly income of many senior citizens the low and moderateincome elderly will suffer most from these medicare cuts eightythree percent of all medicare spending is for older americans with annual incomes below 25 000 twothirds is for those with incomes below 15 000 no budget plan that purports to be part of a contract with america should break americas contract with the elderly it is bad enough to propose these deep cuts in medicare at all it is even worse to make these cuts in order to pay for an undeserved and unneeded tax break for the wealthiest americans everyone knows that the real vote on medicare is not on the floor of the senate or the floor of the house of representatives the real vote will be cast in november by the american people and they know that the future of

has just completed an analysis of the republican contract with america and the impact which it will have on my home state of illinois i would like those from this state to listen but from other states to consider there will be similar impacts on their own home state if the republican contract with america is in fact enacted we took a look at just four or five areas that i think are critically important first is in the area of health services for children and seniors to reach the necessary 30percent cut in federal spending required by the republican contract medicare and medicaid funding in illinois and across the nation would be slashed in illinois by 27 billion over 7 years what it means is that literally thousands of poor families in my home state now under medicaid the government health insurance program for poor people would become uninsured and it means that many hospitals particularly smaller and rural hospitals which are greatly dependent on medicare patients would be forced to close their doors i have spoken to some of the hospital administrators what i have just said is not an exaggeration a 30percent cut in medicare would hurt seniors it would close hospital doors in many of our rural areas and in many of our inner city areas the second area of real concern to me is in the area of education my home state of illinois would take abig hit from the republican contract with america under this contract programs for disadvantaged students would take a 30percent cut some may ask why kind of program is that it is a program like chapter i a special tutorial program that takes a child about to drop out or fall behind and puts them through special training to catch up with the class and stay in school these programs work in my county of sangamon county il and downstate illinois we would lose with the republican contract with america 900 000 a year in federal aid to education madison county nearby would lose 1 9 million it would mean school administrators would have to either eliminate or cut back the programs or ask for increases in local property taxes something i am sure we all agree is not popular and something we would not want to encourage take a look at highway construction a lot of states and localities are used to the federal government building highways and building bridges and rebuilding and repairing them and think nothing of it if the republican contract with america goes through and we see a 30percent cut we will see a dramatic downturn in the amount of money available for illinois and other states for highway construction mass transit is the same in the city of chicago the republican contract with america will raise the fares for chicago workers using mass transit every day 15 cents a day you say well 15 cents a day is not much two people working in a household add it up and then put it against the supposed tax break the republicans are offering there is not much there to show for it when it comes to nutrition services we can expect cuts in the wic program a program which serves 40 percent of the infants in america brings the mothers in during their pregnancy gives them nutrition information and good guidance for a healthy baby then brings the mother and baby in after birth and says here is the way to get that baby off on the right foot with immunizations good nutrition a healthy baby something i think every american wants to see the republican contract with america will cut that program will basically eliminate mothers and infants from the program it follows as night follows day the same thing is true for meals on wheels how many senior citizens do we know whose only contact with the outside world is meals on wheels it drops by once a day to say hello how are you doing how are you feeling do you need a helping hand those start to go away with this republican vision of a new america in my area of the world a lot of our farmers depend on federal spending not just for their feed grains programs but also for soil and water conservation these programs help farmers to avoid runoff which can contaminate our water supplies and lead to real problems downstream as the republicans contract for america cuts back on this kind of spending we are literally taking a gamble and a chance with our own health in the future these are but four or five examples of what happens

for the tax breaks americans across the board overwhelmingly oppose using medicare as a cash cow to pay for the republican plan to offer tax breaks to the very wealthy a recently released harris poll suggests that the opposition is even stronger among the wealthiest americans when the question was asked do you favor or oppose cutting the future costs of medicare to pay for a tax break 86 percent of americans with income of 50 000 or more said they did not favor doing this while only 83 percent of all americans said they opposed the plan to cut services for our children and our senior citizens for a tax break for the wealthy while the tax break for the wealthy is being given attention the tax break for the working poor has been taken away it seems to me that we are not listening perhaps

retire and reach their days on a fixed income they would have available to them a fund that they have paid ilito for health care while medicaid was essentially passed as a program for our children almost 70 percent of those dollars are being paid for longterm care for our seniors and why is that it is because our seniors do not have the money now they are very stretched with what is being offered and we are about to swipe that away from them who are we listening to are we the only persons listening to the people of this nation i am hearing desperate voices why are the republicans not listening because the polls are not made up by us it is an independent poll and i hear the question we want to save our childrens future well if we want to save our childrens future they must have a healthy present if we do not provide for our children just the basic health care they will not have a good future they are being cheated out of the dollars even set aside for them now because most of

are giving this the due process which the american people desire and deserve"], [0.00015997886657714844, 0.5001599788665771, 0, "i move to strike the requisite number of words i appreciate the statement made by my friend justa moment ago but some of us are concerned about this amendment and we do not want to leave it unanswered tonight because this amendment does sound seductive it sounds palatable it sounds as if it is a compromise and someone mentioned just a m6ment ago it sounds as if we are auctioning off a basic constitutional right until you stop and realize that some of us believe thab any taking any loss whatsoever should be compensated by the federal government but as was explained earlier by the gentleman from california mr pomo in the debate he put the 10percent figure in the legislation as a sensible offer to settle some loss by the property owner a loss that was greater than just some de minimis loss i think it is important for people to understand that this is a visceral issue with many of us we have seen the effects of takings both in terms of endangered species and in wetland declarations and the effect this has had on families property owners basic property owners average men and women in our congressional districts i think it is important to think about this just a moment i literally have thousands of small property owners in my congressional district people who own say 100 acres when you talk about the loss of 10 percent which is in this legislation that is a lot to swallow by some people a tenth of their property but when you bump that up double it to another 10 percent arriving at 20 percent that is even more difficult and we are taking about property that has been in some families for generations my family is an example of that i think it is also important to look at some of the large effects some things that have happened judge bunton a federal judge in texas ruled that texas had to develop a plan to regulate the flow of water in the comel srpings and the san marco springs they did this for a one inch fountain the ruling presented a real problem because the edwards aquifer which was affected by this particular decision was the sole source of drinking water for one and a half million residents of san antonio which is our nations 9th largest city it has been estimated that complying with the judges ruling could result in a 68 percent reduction in available water it would have a devastating effect on san antonio baxer county and six other adjacent jurisdictions not to name the farmers and ranchers west and in that particular area when i start thinking about 10 percent or 20 percent how do you allocate some of the costs of a decision like that because there is no alternative source of water to replace the edwards aquifer it is estimated it would take five to ten years for significant amounts of nonaquifer water to become available at a cost of 500 million to 1 5 billion that is clearly unacceptable i furthermore if you look at some of the initial estimates of trying to maintain water flow at the comel springs based on the worst case scenario of a drought you could have an expense of 9 6 billion annually in spending 5 2 billion in an annual reduction in total output for the city of san antonio a 3 3 billion annual reduction in personal income in san antonio a 2 6 billion annual reduction in wages and salaries a 1 3 annual reduction in retail sales you can lose 136 000 jobs in san antonio because of one federal court decision based on endangered species a decision that goes to the heart of basic and fundamental water rights in our particular state how do you go about allocating all of these costs whether itis 10 percent or 20 percent so when some people say it is insignificant and here we are at a late hour on the floor of the house of representatives trying to suggest that an amendment to ratchet that percentage from 10 to 20 percent does not have an effect causes no harm i find that hard to deal with i come back to what i said earlier what do we say to our constituents i think that is an important question that all of us must answer now because we aregoing to have to answer that question when we go before our rotary clubs our chambers our town meetings"], [0.00018531084060668945, 0.5001853108406067, 1, "and energy costs skyrocketed we had long lines shortages and energy prices skyrocketed but the gentleman also correctly observed that interest rates followed the inflation rate up and the reason they do that obviously is because money like any other commodity is affected by inflation and the payback the amortization the payback of the price of the money is keyed to the differential between what our inflation rate is and what our cost of money is and that is the real cost of money the real and as the gentleman knows notwithstanding the fact that the interest rates were nominally high in the late 1970s in point of fact as
