7 billion from labor with cuts to workforce development and safety investments and cuts more than 1 billion from critical health programs and next week we will be forced to vote on this bill that undermines so many of our nations priorities why because the republican house leadership passed a bad budget resolution that puts tax cuts for the wealthiest americans above investments to promote americas education workforce and health services their 175 billion tax cut exceeds the projected budget surplus and requires deep cuts in nondefense discretionary appropriations and here we are again voting on a measure that would provide over 50 billion to the wealthiest 2 percent of taxpayers how much is enough when will republicans be satisfied with the amount of money they have given to the wealthy and turn their attention to the majority of americans who want a good education a strong work force and a healthy future this bill will cost 50 billion per year when fully phased in this monstrous hole in the federal budget will undoubtedly translate into cuts from areas that the american people care about just as the proposed 175 billion republican tax cut translated into cuts in yesterdays proposed labor hhs education appropriations bill when we prioritize tax cuts over health education and labor we make sacrifices and these sacrifices affect everybody the repeal of the estate tax does nothing for working families most american families would not receive a single dollar of tax relief from this bill so i want the american people to know what they are sacrificing in order to provide a tax cut to the wealthiest two percent of their fellow citizens republicans have proposed cutting 1 billion from targeted investments in education to improve teacher quality and recruit new teachers denying afterschool services to 1 6 million kids and eliminating headstart assistance to 50 000 kids they have also proposed cutting nih 439 million below current services and cutting 16 million from clintons request for battered womens shelters these are the kinds of sacrifices that americans are being asked to make in exchange for a tax cut that would give 300 billion to the 400 richest americans 300 billion is enough to pay for a prescription drug benefit for seniors for 10 years the republican majority placed the needs of big business over working people yesterday by voting to once again delay the implementation of new ergonomics regulations which protect working people from repetitive motion injuries and here they are again asking working families to make

rightwing friends h r 4577 fails to make needed investments in public education and the domestic workforce and as the result would undermine american competitiveness in the 21st century this bill has already received what has now become its customary and welldeserved veto threat from the clinton administration it is clearly going nowhere and should be soundly defeated this bill was doomed from its inception because the economic premise upon which it is based is flawed earlier this year before the appropriations process began the republican leadership decided to resume its efforts to push for big tax cuts for the rich they attached hundreds of billions of dollars of these tax cuts to the minimum wage bill and the budget resolution this decision to squander the surplus rather than invest it severely reduced the funds available to meet many of our nations critical needs overall the bill provides 2 9 billion less than the president requested for the department of education and 1 7 billion less for the department of labor as the result education job training workplace safety and other programs are either frozen or cut significantly reducing the level of services that can be provided for example the bill would slash title i funding forcing school districts to cut back on assistance to disadvantaged students the clinton clay class size reduction initiative is gutted leaving school districts without the resources to hire and train 20 000 more topquality teachers adequate funding is denied for afterschool and summer programs intended to improve student achievement and reduce juvenile crime and no funds are provided to renovate crumbling and unsafe schools at the same time efforts are ongoing in the congress to erase limits on theimmigration of foreign workers to fill hightech jobs this bill would make steep cuts in the funding of training programs aimed at helping domestic workers fill them and other positions dislocated workers and atrisk youth are particularly hard hit by these cuts even though they are the one most in need of skills training by failing to adequately invest in our own workforce the republican leadership is jeopardizing american

efforts to eliminate the marriage tax penalty many of us over the last several years have asked a very basic fundamental question that is is it right is it fair that under our tax code a married working couple where both a husband and wife are in the workforce that they pay higher taxes just because they are married is it right that 25 million married working couples 50 million taxpayers pay on average 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married we call that 1 400 the marriage tax penalty it affects married couples who because they have two incomes they are forced to file jointly they are pushed into a higher tax bracket and they pay higher taxes it is a marriage tax penalty and it is wrong let me introduce to the house some constituents of mine michelle and shad hallihan two public school teachers from a community of manhattan just south of joliet illinois shad is a teacher at joliet high school michelle at manhattan junior high their combined income is about 62 000 they are middleclass teachers they are homeowners of course since they were married they have since had a child little ben remember their family someone new in their lives and they are so proud of little ben here who is growing very quickly their marriage tax penalty is about 1 000 a year that they pay just because they are married i think it is a fair question is it right is it fair that shad and michelle hallihan two public school teachers who work very hard every day have a new little boy in their lives have to pay higher taxes send money to washington just because they are married i am proud to say this conference report before it eliminates the marriage tax penalty that good people hardworking middleclass people like shad and michelle hallihan pay every year because they are married under our conference report we help those who itemize their taxes as well as those who do not now my friends on the other side of the aisle say that if one is middle class and one itemizes ones taxes usually because one is a homeowner or one gives money to ones institutions of faith or church or synagogue or charity one is rich and one does not deserve marriage tax relief well republicans and fortunately 48 democrats believe we should help the middleclass homeowners who give money to charity they are not rich they work hard shad and michelle hallihan make 62 000 a year they itemize their taxes now we help those who do not itemize their taxes in this conference by doubling the standard deduction that is used by those who do not itemize their taxes we double that for joint filers to twice that as singles for those who are itemizers like michelle and shad hallihan and little ben who are homeowners so they are forced to itemize we widen the 15 percent bracket that is the basic tax bracket that affects everybody we widen that so joint filers married couples like shad and michelle with two incomes can earn twice as much as a single filer and be in the same tax bracket the same 15 percent tax bracket what i think is most exciting about this bill not only do we help middleclass families who are homeowners and give money to church and charity who itemize those taxes as well as those who do not is that it is effective this year when we pass this legislation and put it on the presidents desk today the president will have an opportunity if he signs it into law to help married couples 25 million married working couples this year because i would point out that doubling the standard deduction which helps those who do not itemize and widening the 15 percent tax bracket which helps those who do itemize such as homeowners and those that give money to church and charity that they will receive marriage tax relief this year because this legislation is effective january 1 of 2000 think about that when my friends on the other side of the aisle and bill clinton and al gore raised taxes in 1993 they made their tax increase retroactive which meant they went back in the tax year and took ones money well this year we have an opportunity to give marriage tax relief this year which means we go back to january 1 of this year if one is married one of 25 million married working couples who suffer the marriage tax penalty one is going to see marriage tax relief this year in tax year 2000 that is a great opportunity if one believes in fairness in the tax code as we do it is time to make the tax code more fair and more simple we want to eliminate the marriage tax penalty now my friends on the other side of the aisle have been making lots of excuses they really do not want to eliminate the marriage tax penalty because they would much rather spend shad and michelles money they believe it is better spent here in washington than shad and michelle hallihan can spend it back in joliet illinois think about it the average marriage tax penalty for good hardworking middleclass married couples like shad and michelle hallihan 1 400 1 400 is 1 years tuition at joliet community college our local community college it is 3 months of day care for little ben at a local child care center in joliet illinois it is a washer and dryer for their home it is 3 000 diapers for little ben the marriage tax penalty of 1 400 is really money for real people let us do the right thing let us pass this rule let us pass this legislation let us wipe out the marriage

work period conducting 15 town meetings and i wanted to report today on really the response to the republican agenda of good schools and low taxes and a secure retirement for all americans i have the privilege of representing a very very diverse district the south side of chicago in the south suburbs of cook and will counties as well as a lot of rural and bedroom communities and one always listens for the common concerns when they represent a diverse district of cities suburbs and country during the last two weeks i got a pretty good response people were very supportive of the republican agenda of strengthening our local schools of lowering the tax burden for the middle class of making for a secure retirement for all americans by strengthening medicare and social security i would like to take a few minutes just to talk about some of those specifics of our republican agenda and of course let me begin with the republican efforts to strengthen social security and to strengthen medicare for the next three generations i am often asked a common question over the last several years that i have had the privilege of being in the congress and that question is when are you politicians in washington going to stop raiding the social security trust fund i was pleased to tell my constituents that this is the year we are going to do that this is the year we are going to wall off the social security trust fund and say hands off and my constituents frankly were pretty shocked when they learned that the clintongore budget actually raids the social security trust fund by 351 billion i think it is important to note that when we compare republican efforts to wall off the social security trust fund which means 100 percent of social security according to this chart for social security versus the clintongore proposal for 62 percent of the social security trust fund going to social security and the other 38 percent being spent on other things that is what this means the president wants to spend 38 percent of social security on new government programs republicans of course want to wall off the social security trust fund essentially putting trust back in the trust fund with 100 percent of social security for social security and that is a big victory i also want to note that the republican budget sets aside almost 400 billion more than the clintongore budget for medicare and social security now our second priority in our agenda of course is lower taxes for the middle class and i am one who believes that when the tax burden for the average family in illinois is about 40 percent of their income going to local state and federal government for taxes that that tax burden is too high and we need to lower the tax burden particularly for the middle class and when we talk about the tax burden i find that constituents whether it is at the union hall or the vfw or the local chamber of commerce they tell me that the tax code is too complicated requires too much paperwork and the majority of people have to hire someone else to fill out the tax forms and i also point out that the tax burden is really unfair as we work this year to lower the tax burden i believe that our top priority should be to simplify the tax code to address the unfairness in the tax code and of course we need to begin by eliminating the marriage tax penalty is it right is it fair that 21 million married working couples on average pay 1 400 more in higher taxes just because they are married 1 400 more than an identical couple living together outside a marriage that is wrong that our tax code punishes marriage the marriage tax elimination act has 230 cosponsors let us get it done this year let us simplify the tax code and eliminate the marriage tax penalty of course the republican agenda a secure retirement and lower taxes also includes strengthening our local schools and we want to strengthen our local schools by empowering our local school boards and our local teachers and our local parents to run their schools and giving them the flexibility of course to meet the needs of local communities and that is an important shift because previously for 30 to 40 years all the power was moving to washington and i talk with local school administrators and school board members they tell me maybe in illinois 6 percent of our public schools budget comes from washington but so does twothirds of the paperwork and almost 100 percent of the mandates micromanaging how our schools are run we want to let local schools run themselves and meet the needs of their local communities and that is why we want to pass the ed flex legislation my hope it will be on the presidents desk fairly soon the other concern that local school board members also share with me is they say as my colleagues know youve increased funding at the federal level by 10 percent even while youve been balancing the budget increasing funding for education but if you look at how those dollars have been spent only 70 cents of every dollar actually reaches the classroom thirty cents is lost in the washington bureaucracy our goal is to ensure that more dollars get to the classroom with a goal of 95 cents on the dollar reaching the classroom and if we compare that to the current cost of delivering those funds to our looal schools that is a 25 percent funding increase above and beyond what they are currently receiving we are providing 22 billion in federal funding for our local schools it is just wrong that 30 cents on the dollar currently is lost in washington let us help our local schools

deeply regret that we have reached this point and i am deeply disappointed by what has happened to americas education priorities in the last 72 hours on sunday night after 3 days of no negotiations republicans met facetoface with democrats on a good faith basis to resolve our differences on education democrats asked republicans whether they had full authority to negotiate a final deal and they answered yes in an example of bipartisan compromise both sides came together and both sides sought common ground negotiators toiled late into the evening each side made concessions as must be done in a bipartisan compromise and consensus was reached through sensible dialogue i give great credit to the gentleman from florida and i give great credit to the gentleman from wisconsin and the senators who were involved the bill that came out of that room was a bipartisan bill that would have lifted up every community and every school in this country this bill included full funding for 100 000 new

ripped this deal apart as a favor to a business lobby the republican leadership bowed to business lobbyists who according to the washington post were making and i quote urgent calls to the hill to try

of this house an effective and enforceable patients bill of rights and it has been stifled in a conference committee because i guess the insurance companies did not want it we could have had targeted tax cuts for college and longterm care and child care but instead we passed huge tax cuts for the top 1 percent of americans instead of getting something done in a bipartisan way that we could have gotten done we fought for sensible gun safety legislation but it is stifled in a conference committee i guess as a favor to the national rifle association we have tried to get a sensible increase in

absolutely agree that it is a tragedy for a woman to lose a pregnancy during a crime and i strongly support the approach that many states have taken to toughen penalties for an assault against a pregnant woman and that is in fact the approach that my colleague is taking in her substitute however h r 2436 would do nothing to protect the woman further but instead would create for the first time a legal definition that a fertilized egg is entitled to protection under the law as a person this bill is indeed breathtaking in its scope while the examples used are drawn from criminal assaults of women in advanced stages of pregnancy its real concern reaches to the impact of the violence on the embryo roe v wade makes a distinction between the embryo in the first trimester and the post viability embryo and that is the distinction that state laws honor this bill makes no such distinction because it deals with the fertilized eggs at all stages of development and therefore it opens the opportunity that if a woman is assaulted in sort of a routine assault and battery case and 3 weeks later has a miscarriage that miscarriage can up the assault and battery charges to murder though she did not know she was pregnant at the time and neither did the assaultant so this bill goes way beyond what it appears to do and while i certainly think that a woman in an advanced stage of pregnancy who is assaulted and the fetus killed that assaultant deserves a punishment that is far more severe than if he had not been attacking a pregnant woman i think this bill goes way beyond that by dealing with a fertilized egg and opening up the kinds of possibilities i cite and the next step which is not contained in this bill but it is the only logical next step is to disregard the intent of the assaultant why if it is a criminal assault should it be seen as a crime when it is simply the destruction of the fetus it should not be seen as a crime that is why those of us who support a womans right to abortion are deeply concerned about this legislation it does clearly in its language exclude abortion but the only difference between an abortion and a criminal attack is the criminality of the attacker and the criminal intent but the effect on the fetus is the same and all my colleagues focus on in this bill is the fetal effect and they define fetus as fertilized egg even before the

present and future long before california was admitted as the 31st state of the union ventura county was home to native americans and europeans father junipero serra founded one of his missions in ventura an area already known to the chumash for its great fishing and abundant flora as california progressed through the 1800s and early 20th century so did ventura county first the stage coaches and then the railroad connecting los angeles to san francisco came over and through the santa susana pass snaking along the simi valley and on out to the coast many who passed through ventura county were captured by the golden hills and lush soil they stayed and raised cattle planted apricots and walnuts citrus trees and avocados or they harvested the soil in other ways black gold is also among ventura countys riches and you can actually see oil seeping out of the soil today as you drive up highway 150 between santa paula and ojai and in other parts of the county when hollywood began to blossom in the los angeles hills ventura county became a prime film location fort apache with john wayne columbias jungle jim series with johnny weissmuller and tv shows such as the adventures of rin

appropriations bill an emergency a telecommunications emergency and who is declaring the emergency the chairman of the authorizing subcommittee it is an emergency we do not have time to introduce a bill we do not have time to have any hearings we do not have time to give any consumer groups an audience so they can complain about this bill by the way the consumer federation of america opposes the bill as does the consumer union as does the national retail federation every business in america opposes it as do the states by the way my colleagues this is quite a coalition but we do not have time because we are in a telecommunications emergency and i can tell my colleagues why because senator enzi from wyoming attached this amendment over on the floor of the senate he is not a member of the committee on appropriations over there he is not a member of the telecommunications committee over there he attached this to a senate appropriations bill so we have to debate it with no time and no hearings thank god senator enzi has not gotten his own tax proposal he would wrap this chamber in knots for weeks we would have to consider what senator enzi did on the senate floor as an emergency i can tell my colleagues what the emergency is under the existing accounting standards the fcc found that the telephone companies the monopolies in america were hiding 5 billion worth of assets that they could not find that they had on their books and were telling regulators were there for purposes of billing consumers across the country that is their emergency and this accounting standard that we are going to take off the books found that 5 billion we are concerned about tax breaks out here multiply that out by 10 years my colleagues we are talking chump change compared to most of the

gentlewoman from california i think the two of them although it was difficult on some of the issues work together very well i do not want to forget the staff and i am not going to start naming them but the work that they have done is something that we should all be cheering about and saluting there are many things in this bill that deserve to be highlighted first this bill provides important funding for countries in the middle east to help support peace in that region now at this most difficult time this funding is as important as it has ever been the united states has reiterated its support for israel egypt and jordan countries which have successfully n6gotiated peace agreements by providing significant economic and security assistance i am pleased also that we have provided 35 million to help the people of lebanon i must point out that this money will not be sent to the lebanese government rather this money will be used to expand the usaid program in southern lebanon o that american ngos nongovernment organizations will be able to directly provide services to the lebanese people while monitoring the results of our efforts the bill also provides important funding for countries of the former soviet union including 90 million for our ally armenia in addition we are financing confidencebuilding measures for the countries of the southern caucasus to help build a foundation for peace among armenia nagornokarabagh and azerbaijan i am also pleased that the cuts made to foreign military financing during consideration on the house floor have been restored this

amendment the specifics of the amendment deal with a corporate welfare program that exists in the united states of america as bad as any corporate welfare program that exists in this country it specifically applies to ranchers specifically to a function that there is no justifiable policy reason that taxpayers across this country should be subsidizing these ranchers that is the program that is what we are talking about we are not talking about whether or not coyotes should exist or whether or not ranchers should have the ability to do animal control that is not what this amendment is about what this amfendment is about is taxpayer money being spent on a private function without a public purpose that is what it is about and that is why i urge the adoption of the amendment in a sort of hobson effect though this is a program which is not even effective which is one of the weird things about this that there are in fact more effective ways to deal with animal control that have been done in many places without the use and the methods that are used by the animal damage control program this is a program that the public holds in poor regard because it reflects a callous attitude and a waste of taxpayers dollars this program amounts to nothing more than corporate welfare i urge the adoption of the amendment"], [0.00020262598991394043, 0.49979737401008606, 0, "on rolicall no 335 i
