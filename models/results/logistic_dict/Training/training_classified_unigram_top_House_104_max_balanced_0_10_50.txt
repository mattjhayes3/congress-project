reconciliation conference report the bill represents a reckless restructuring of nationa priorities which advocates a shift of resources and commitment away from working american families and granted to the most affluent segments of our society this republican gingrich reconciliation bill abandons the goal of equality of social health education and economic responsibility for members of our american society i have supported in the past and will continue to support responsible deficit reduction policies i voted for the alternative coalition budget a difficult vote but appropriate which would reach a budget surplus in 7 years end corporate subsidies and permit higher spending on crucial national investment priorities without lavishing tax breaks on the wealthy i supported the 1993 reconciliation measure which has to date exceeded its targets with 3 straight years of deficit reduction resulting in the lowest annual deficit as a percent of gdp since the late 1970s i certainly do not support the republican reconciliation bill which slashes proven programs that ensure economic and health security for working americans families and seniors in order to finance tax breaks principally for investors corporations and affluent individuals the legislation includes deep cuts and new fees for student loans and deep cuts in medicaid and medicare further it includes provisions to put american pensions at risk and promote environmental degradation this measure disassembles the federal commitment and structure that has built and empowered our nation to unprecedented economic and social achievement at the same time this reconciliation measure cuts deeply 270 billion from medicare the bill gives 245 billion in tax breaks to the wealthiest members of our society and corporate america in fact the wealthiest 12 percent of american families those with an income over walker walsh wamp ward waters watt nc watts ok waxman weldon fl weldon pa weller white whitfleld wicker 100 000 will get 45 percent of the tax break benefits over 110 billion in tax breaks the republicans continue to insist on a cut in the capital gains tax rate for big investors a reduction of the alternative minimum tax for corporations and a limited child tax credit which is actually denied to 33 percent of kids because they are low income in addition the republican gingrich reconciliation bill cuts the existing earned income tax credit by over 32 billion thereby producing a tax increase for the working poor in fact the joint committee on taxation reported that families with under 30 000 in income will actually pay more in taxesthats right pay more under the republican gingrich tax break measure some break its more on the backs of hardworking families policymakers who are serious about deficit reduction do not push a package which includes 245 billion in tax breaks skewed to the wealthiest in our society not only is it unwise to reduce revenues in this time of fiscal constraints but it is unfair to dole out benefits to the wellheeled when everyone else in society is being told they must sacrifice the new republican gingrich majority in the house has made the medicare and medicaid programs its target for nearly 50 percent of the total spending cuts contained in the republican reconciliation package medicare is one of our nations most successful programs it was established over 30 years ago as a national commitment to assure seniors health care coverage the republican gingrich scheme is going to threaten the integrity of this program and make seniors pay more for less health care coverage with 270 billion in cuts overall medicare spending will be cut by a cumulative 6 795 per senior over the next 7 years meaning that in 2002 there will be 1 700 less in medicare dollars per senior in that year alone even the trustees of the medicare trust fund strongly oppose the republican plan because the extensive cuts go far beyond program reform or trust fund stability the republican plan is not designed to save medicare it is a scheme to let medicare wither on the vine in the name of balancing the budget the republican reconciliation bill not only creates a social deficit in our nation but also creates a serious environmental deficit this legislation amounts to a wholesale degradation of americas natural resource legacy evoking the tradition of 19th century robber barons who exploited the west we see the imprint of special interests including the mining oil and gas industries throughout the republican reconciliation measure in particular the decision to destroy forever the arctic national wildlife refuge anwr by permitting oil and gas exploration and drilling demonstrates the true spirit of the republican majority anwr is the last great piece of american wilderness and opening the refuge area to drilling will assure destruction of this pristine wilderness folding this measure into this bill is a sleight of hand way to circumvent the process and force this wholesale policy change upon the american public without open debate on its merits the question really is about the direction our nation should be heading and what values we want to cultivate to enhance our future this republican gingrich reconciliation bill reveals a significant change in national priorities and values under the gop leadership republicans misplaced priorities are to pull back from proven albeit not perfect policies for health care housing education and the environment in order to give tax breaks to the wealthy and placate special interests we in congress should do better surely we should know better a balanced budget mantra does not disguise the true intent or effect of the republican reconciliation bill which polarizes and balkanizes our society reneging on the basic social contract and abandoning families and the very programs that have permitted us to take care of those who are vulnerable and in need in essence to take care of one another when we face crisis in our lives apparently the gop thinks that if they claim to balance the budget anything goes but they are wrong the american people care the american people do not want an abandonment of valued principles and policies which allow the most vulnerable in our society to live with dignity they also do not want a redistribution of wealth which makes it more difficult for working american families to get ahead while giving special benefits to corporations and special interests this republican reconciliation bill is an affront to all who believe in the concept of community and the commitment of the federal government to protect americans health environment and economic security i urge my colleagues to vote against this bill"],

one of the worst pieces of legislation i have ever seen in the 40 years i have served in this body the bill includes both medicare and medicaid cuts and tax breaks our republican colleagues said that they were not tying the two together well they are tying them together in this bill the poor and the aged are going to understand that the contributions that they are making of about 500 billion is being made so that a tax cut can be given to the wealthiest americans that is finally proven in this piece of legislation the pernicious approach violates the contract we have with seniors who have paid for their medicare benefits it means seniors will pay more and get less choice of doctors poor quality lab tests and nursing homes that do not meet common standards of decency by separating action on medicare from the rest of reconciliation republicans tried to convince us that 270 billion in medicare cuts do not pay for 245 billion in tax breaks for the rich but americans can perform the simple math required they know when someone is pulling the wool over their eyes the bill also destroys medicaid under the mantra of states rights republicans are pulling the safety net out from under middle class families poor children women seniors and the disabledthe most vulnerable of americans up until last night the republican bill arbitrarily cut 182 billion from medicaid now they say they have fixed it by cutting only 170 billion but this midnight deal does not change the fact that this bill abdicates the federal governments role in medicaid reduces health care for the most needy and invites abuse by states it takes away vitally important guarantees under current law protection from having to sell the family home or farm to pay for a loved ones nursing home care guaranteeing coverage for seniors with alzheimers setting minimum standards of safety cleanliness and decency for nursing homes and guaranteeing health care for children and pregnant women i and other members tried to correct one of the most glaring defects in the bill by offering an amendment on behalf of mr gingrich in debate last week the speaker obviously was under the misimpression that his new medigrant program does what current law guaranteescovering the cost of medicare premiums for seniors under the poverty line in fact this bill repeals what current law provides our amendment would have restored provisions the speaker erroneously relied on and guarantee that the poorest of seniors have medicare coverage but the rules committee gagged us from amending the bill so that it will do what the speaker says it does i also want to point out the devastating impact that this bill has on health care for veterans the secretary of veterans affairs says that the harsh spending caps in the republican plan will require 41 veterans hospitals to close their doors as a result more than 1 million veterans will be denied health care by 2002 i do not share the misguided view of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that the best way for veterans to stay healthy is not to get sick this bill walks away from responsible government to help people in need in favor of lining the pockets of the wealthiest americans with unneeded tax cuts in addition to health care cuts this bill slashes education job training and other programs upon which we empower people to help themselves most americans will get nothing or pay more under the gop tax break the small percentage of the tax cuts that will go to families earning less than 50 000 a year will be more than offset by spending cuts these families stand to lose 648 a year or more under the gop plan those earning more than 350 000 the richest 1 percentwill get 14 050 a year for the tax cut i find it curious that my republican colleagues who criticize the president for not cutting middle class taxes enough are rushing to raise taxes on many low income families i must confess i am not surprised however that they would follow through on their threats to slash programs vital to the financial security of working americans finally i must object to the cavalier manner in which the republican leadership has included massive changes in farm programs the socalled freedomtofarm proposal was found to be so objectionable that the house agriculture committee failed to get it out of committee on an issue as vital as our nations food security this bill shreds responsible legislating for partisan game playing and makes rural americans the pawns this is not the way to legislate and it is a dangerous way to govern this is the biggest and the most important bill to be considered by the house this year the cuts are too large it hurts terribly the health care coverage of millions of americans i strongly oppose the bill i now

proves that the presidents budget makes medicare solvent for the same number of years as the republican budget but does so without making such deep cuts so why would the republicans cut so deeply the answer is 176 billion in tax breaks for the wealthiest in our country the american people rejected out of hand the extreme agenda of the republican resolution when speaker gingrich tried to take the

higher in 1998 than this years deficit i ask why the reason is because the gop are intent on their large tax breaks for the wealthy part of which are paid for through excessive medicare cuts in 1992 the deficit was 290 billion and in 1993 it was 255 billion under democratic leadership the deficit has actually dropped 4 years in a row to the projected 130 billion of this year what is the reason for the republican deficit increase misplaced priorities tax breaks for their wealthy friends and a slush fund for future unnecessary tax breaks while the republicans claim to be deficit hawks and the saviors of medicare the facts indicate that they are intent on pushing this country further into debt and making large and unnecessary cuts in medicare this republican deficitincreasing budget also makes extreme cuts of 72 billion over 6 years to the medicaid program and allows states to cut an additional 178 billion for a grand total of 250 billion in medicaid cuts we are talking about major cuts in medicaid as well as medicare many people look at the medicaid program as primarily for the poor and of course it does assist poor people but it also pays about 50 percent of all nursing home care for senior citizens without medicaid many middleclass adult children of nursing home parents will have to pay for their parents expensive care while at the same time trying to send their own children through college last thursday the committee on commerce of which i am a member voted on the medicaid repeal act which i vigorously fought the medicaid repeal act will eliminate all current guarantees of health care coverage and eliminate current guarantees of nursing home benefits to the elderly this is the medicaid repeal act that the republican leadership is putting forward i offered an amendment to this act that would return these guarantees in this terrible legislation but it was rejected by every republican other democrats offered similar amendments to continue health care coverage for the disabled for children for pregnant women but again all those amendments were defeated by the republicans on top of all this the gop medicaid repeal act will sharply reduce payments to hospitals for care compounded with the extreme gingrichdole medicare cuts to hospitals many will be forced to close their doors especially hospitals that receive a majority of their income from medicare and medicaid many hcspltals in my home state of new jersey are in this situation they are highly medicare and medicaid dependent i am very concerned about their being able to survive these

decrease the number of uninsured and underinsured the republican leaderships answers will make these problems worse i thought it was interesting to see speaker gingrich take the floor this morning and talk about how he is trying to increase portability and also increase health insuiance for those with preexisting health conditions through the kennedykassebaum legislation but that reality is that the speaker and the rest of the republican leadership have been insisting on including medical savings accounts in this kennedykassebaum health care reform what that will mean is that the healthy and the wealthy will opt out of the traditional health insurance programs and the cost for everyone else for health insurance will go up so again even though the republican leadership talks about how they are trying to expand health care options in fact what they are doing is making those options fewer because more and more people will not be able to afford health insurance i just wanted to say in conclusion that in the past democrats were able to decrease the deficit and preserve medicare and medicaid the republicans have misplaced priorities and values the democrats have a proven track record of reducing the deficit and ensuring that senior citizens have adequate health care i remain committed to fighting these republicans efforts that would raise the deficit while at the same time

fiction that proposes to dramatically increase spending for 5 years and then slash spending in the last year to balance the budget that proposal is a joke that mocks the efforts of those who are serious about addressing our chronic budget deficits to save the future of our children recent testimony before the house and senate appropriations committees on discretionary spending illustrates the budget games being played by the clinton administration in short the administration budget proposes to increase spending for 1 year in areas such as veterans and space programs putting off all the cuts to the following years the administrations own representatives claim that these budget numbers are not serious that the president only cares about the first years spending proposal and that cuts in the coming years will be abandoned each year as the time comes in this way the budget is scored as reaching balance in 6 years but the administrations own officials say it will never come to pass

medicare at the level necessary to assure that quality care will be available for senior citizens when they need it even worse republicans support an inflexible ceiling on medicare spending consequently if inflation is higher or medical needs are greater than anticipated medicare spending will not go up and many senior citizens will be out of luck and out of care an estimated 20 percent of all medicare hospitalization can be avoided by relying on better preventive services and more timely primary and outpatient care so if we have interventions earlier if we have better home care if we have the investment in our seniors to avoid the more costly expenses when they must come into the hospital that can save billions and billions of dollars we ought to be thinking about that without reducing the services for our elderly and actually improve the quality of health care for our seniors as much as 10 percent of all medicare expenditures may be due to fraud and can be reduced or eliminated by better oversight the work senator harkin has been involved in in reviewing medicaid and medicare fraud is absolutely powerful and absolutely convincing about the tens of billions of dollars that can be saved you go to any hall in this country and ask our senior citizens where there can be savings any senior citizen can give you chapter and verse about how there can be savings in the medicare system many of them can tell you about the fraud that is being perpetrated upon them at the present time we ought to address that kind of issue before we are talking about reductions in essential services medicare could save 20 billion annually if senior citizens have assistance in monitoring their medications more carefully in order to avoid adverse drug reactions we spend billions

and the american people know it it is time for the republicans to stop raiding medicare and join in sensible steps to improve and strengthen it for the future another false republican argument in defense of their medicare cuts is that the reductions are not really cuts because the total amount of medicare spending will continue to grow but every household in america knows that if the cost of your rent the cost of your utilities and the cost of your food go upand your income stays the same or goes up more slowlyyou have taken a real cut in your living standard republicans speak of a cut in defense even though defense spending has remained stable apparently the same republican logic does not apply to spending on medicare that applies to spending on guns and tanks a cut is a cut is a cutwhether it is in medicare or social security or national defense republicans also claim that deep cuts in medicare are necessary to balance the budget but that argument only proves that republican priorities are wrong democrats favor a balanced budget and president clinton has proposed a balanced budgetbalanced fairly not balanced on the backs of senior citizens or children or workers there is a right way to balance the budget and a rightwing way and unfortunately the republicans continue to pick the rightwing way republicans deny that their medicare cuts will fund tax cuts for the wealthy this time the leopard claims that it really has changed its spots but their budget clearly envisions 60 billion in revenue increases from tax extenders and closing of selected corporate loopholes in order to fund 60 billion in new tax breaks for the undeserving rich without those new tax breaks they wouldnt need to cut medicare by 167 billion the democratic amendment eliminates these new tax breaks for the wealthy and uses them to protect medicare the medicare trust fund should not be a slush fund for republican tax breaks for the rich republicans can run as hard as they want in this election year but they can not hide from these facts even more damaging than the loss of the billions of dollars that republicans would slash from medicare is their attempt to turn medicare over to the private insurance industfy the republican budget contains a number of changes to force senior citizens to give up their own doctors and join private insurance plans once they are forced into these plans senior citizens will be stripped of many of the protections they enjoy todayprotection against overcharges by doctors and other health care providers protection against premiumgouging and profiteering by insurlance companies protection of their right to keep their own family doctor and go to the specialist of their choice republicans claim they only want to offer senior citizens a choice but this is a choice no senior citizen should be forced to make the harsh cuts in medicare contained in the republican budget are also a repudiation of our historic commitment to social security because the distinction between medicare and social security is a false one medicare is part of the same compact between the government and the people as social security that compact says contribute during your working years and we will guarantee basic income and health security in your retirement years any senior citizen who has been hospitalized or who suffers from a serious chronic illness knows that there is no retirement security without health security the cost of illness is too high a few days in an intensive care unit can cost more than the total yearly income of many senior citizens the low and moderateincome elderly will suffer most from these medicare cuts eightythree percent of all medicare spending is for older americans with annual incomes below 25 000 twothirds is for those with incomes below 15 000 no budget plan that purports to be part of a contract with america should break americas contract with the elderly it is bad enough to propose these deep cuts in medicare at all it is even worse to make these cuts in order to pay for an undeserved and unneeded tax break for the wealthiest americans everyone knows that the real vote on medicare is not on the floor of the senate or the floor of the house of representatives the real vote will be cast in november by the american people and they know that the future of medicare is too important to be decided by a republican congress or a republican president"], [0.9885706305503845, 0.9885706305503845, 0, "i rise is recognized during today with great concern about an ar morning business for 5

of my colleague who just spoke again we could see a definite cut of 4 percent in our texas program and a halfmillion dollars in the houston independent school district the largest school district in the state of texas the school breakfast and lunch programs as estimated by the texas education agency will lose for the children of texas 261 million in 1996 on the committee on economic and educational opportunities we tried to strike the nutrition programs from the republican reform bill but we were outvoted on a party line vote by the republican majority i will go to that in a few minutes let us look at what this new amended contract for america talks about not only cutting children nutrition programs and the wic program let us see now we are having 11 million for two new executive airplanes for the army that they did not request 20 million more for a new runway for a base that is on the base closure commission list a million dollars for a bike trail in north miami beach one thing that is apparent in this new amended contract with america there is no clause that our children will have a hot nutritious meal or a clause that oihr children will have a safe and drugfree school or that our children may have a summer youth job program let me continue with the childrens nutrition a tv consumer reporter in houston just last night said that it took the republican majority 40 years to gain control of the house but only took them 40 days to cut food to children the schoolbased nutrition grant program overall funding would be 104 million less in fiscal year 1996 101 3 billion would be transferred out of the block grant in 1996 for nonfood programs which would compromise the health of children the schoolbased nutrition block grant would eliminate the standards that guarantee americas children access to healthy meals there was an amendment adopted in the committee last week that said for the first year the states can all come up with 50 nutritional grant programs but at the end of that year there would be some national standards well we already have some national standards that apply whether you are in texas or new york or california we are building in additional costs into this program by having 50 states to develop their nutrition plans and then have to comply with some national standards the new schoolbased nutrition block grant would not respond to recessions or recoveries if this bill had been enacted in 1989 it would have resulted in the 70percent reduction in funding for school meals in 1994 alone between 1990 and 1994 the number of free lunches served to lowincome children increased by 23 percent during that period the number of free meals served in child care centers increased by 45 percent the block grants would not eespond to the change in the school population which is expected to increase by 4 to 6 percent in the state of texas alone we would lose 4 percent of our funding every september and all during the year we have new children who show up at our doors and qualify for these programs we are not only cutting 4 percent but if those new children show up they would not have it yesterday morning before i left houston i went to a nutrition program in the heights part of my district at the field elementary school that is a school that has 90 percent of their children have free or reduced lunch what 4 percent would we cut from those 90 percent of those children and next year when we have at least 20 more kids who show up or are qualified are we going to tell that principal or that teacher or that food service worker who does a hard job there that they cannot serve those children there are reforms we can do in the program but not cutting off the meals that those children have i saw that meal they had cereal they had the option of orange juice and milk a number of kids actually drank both the orange juice and the milk they had some little sausages i noticed this last friday the committee on agriculture cut the effort for the food stamp program i am glad they are concerned about that but i know we have some concern about the food stamp abuses but i know i saw those children eating that

overwhelmingly oppose using medicare as a cash cow to pay for the republican plan to offer tax breaks to the very wealthy a recently released harris poll suggests that the opposition is even stronger among the wealthiest americans when the question was asked do you favor or oppose cutting the future costs of medicare to pay for a tax break 86 percent of americans with income of 50 000 or more said they did not favor doing this while only 83 percent of all americans said they opposed the plan to cut services for our children and our senior citizens for a tax break for the wealthy while the tax

examined there is no basis the president to concede to a balanced whatsoever to make an accusation budget because his liberal agenda does against the clintons not include balancing the budget only paying off liberal interest groups plus he is being dragged down by members of his own cabinet currently secretary oleary in the department of energy is falling under fire it started out with gao reports as early as the first part of this year when they reported that she had a mission a minute quoteunquote a mission a minute that there were very large management problems within the department then vice president gores national performance review came out which said that portions of the department of energy like of the environmental management portion was 40percent inefficient and it could cost taxpayers 70 billion over the next 30 years then we started to see travel problems with the secretary of the department of energy having the highest travel budget per trip of anyone inside the presidents cabinet staying at fourstar hotels traveling first class taking along large staffs for her domestic travel but that was all based on her current responsibilities in the department of energy which are all domestic then we started to hear about the international trips secretary oleary has taken 16 international trips taking along as many as 50 staff members as many as 68 guests often ceos who do not pay their portion of the travels one trip cost 720 000 with 16 of them it is in the millions of dollars the costs of this often she travels on the same plane as madonna leases so the material girl of clintons cabinet is spending unwisely taxpayer dollars in these travels she hires photographers and video crews to come along because she wants to be caught at her best she is very worried about the public image she is presenting and has been quoted as trying to bring the second term of the presidents campaign the ideals of it to the forefront now in the zeal to project a good public image secretary oleary has hired a personal media consultant at a cost of 75 000 per year to the taxpayers she also employs inside the department of energy more than 520 public relations employees at a payroll of over 25 million per year she has even hired a private investigative firm to investigate reporters and congressmen who are tarnishing her favorable image she has developed a list of unfavorables well it is going to be hard to hit the budget target especially when you are unable to control spending like this this is excessive it is unnecessary and it is a waste we are so concerned about the poor and yet we allow firstclass travel within members of the cabinet overseas on the same airplane that is leased by madonna that is not the lifestyle that is projected by the administration when they are trying to speak for the poor it is quite the opposite so i would encourage president clinton to ask for the resignation of secretary oleary i would urge him to get back into some honest negotiations on the federal budget so that we can enjoy christmas as a government get everyone back to work and also preserve a future for our children strengthen our economy and just

if we had dictatorial powerwe would do things differently butbasically it is workable and i commend the chairman the ranking member of the subcommittee and the minority and all of the staff for working with us on this bill one of my main concerns about the original bill was the retroactive provisions that was until i obtained a copy of the 615 regulations issued between november 9 and december 31 of last year and read them the more i read the more i believed that this bill was necessary if every member of congress were required to read every federal regulation i am convinced that all of you would have a different view of the federal regulatory process the longer i worked on this bill the more convinced i was that a wholesale attitude change was necessary in the regulatory process i became convinced that what was needed was a 2 by 4 between the eyes of the federal regulatory bureaucracy h r 450 is just that a 2 by 4 which serves as a wake up call putting the bureaucracy on notice that buzi ness as usual is over this bill was crafted taking into account the failures of the bushimposed moratorium it is meant to be wide in scope and to avoid narrow exclusions h r 450 exempts routine regulations it exempts regulations which reduce or streamline the regulatory process it gives the administration the full authority to exempt regulations that are a threat to health and human safety and is limited to those regulations that need to be looked at and reassessed h r 450 places a temporary hold on regulations until common sense risk assessment and costbenefit analysis is passed and signed into law furthermore h r 450 gives the committees of jurisdiction time to look at regulations and lets them ask the question do these regulations really make sense the bottom line is that business as usual will be over with the passage of h r 450 it is a message that needs to be sent to the bureaucracy the american people want a change in our inflexible and overburdensome

gentleman from michigan john dingell fills that bill one the other hand in pursuing that objective to undermine businesspeople who are doing a fair and honest job is wrong that is what the gentleman from virginia seeks to address i applaud his efforts and support them"], [0.00010013580322265625, 0.5001001358032227, 1, "thank you very much jerry i would like to read something that i read many

that anyone who opposes this amendment is for the abortion of an unwanted child that is absolute baloney the gentleman is perfectly entitled to describe his own motives he certainly by no means has any right to describe mine i am opposed to abortions period i just do not happen to think that i ought to be making the decision for every woman in this country that is a distinction which i think the gentleman from illinois is bright enough to understand i also want to say that with respect to the china issue i want to read the language of the amendment that the gentleman who just spoke voted against the last time it was before us on the floor my amendment said in section 518 a notwithstanding any other provision of this act or other law none of the funds ap propriated by this act may be made available for the united nations population fund unless the president certifies to the appropriate congressional committees that one the united nations population fund will terminate all family planning activities in the peoples republic of china no later than may 1 1996 or two during the 12 months preceding such certification there have been no abortions as a result of coercion associated with the family planning activities of the national government or other governmental entities within the peoples republic of china now that language is very clear and my statement was very clear at the time i wanted us to end funding for the u n population program if it does not pull the plug in china because i believe and most of us believe on this side of the aisle that china does have a coercive program and we have no business being associated with a program that does not recognize that i feel that very strongly and have felt that way for 5 years the gentleman from new jersey says that he thinks the language in this amendment is a compromise well that is very nice the fact is the senate does not think it is a compromise because they have already voted against it all i am suggesting is that if the gentleman wants to move this bill forward the gentleman will find some other formulation than the one in this bill we have already tried this route the senate has already voted it down and the hardheadedness that is demonstrated by insisting on everyones first principles is a clear demonstration of why 10 out of the 13 appropriations bills still have not become law and we are sitting here today with the government in a situation where it is shut down i would suggest that if the gentleman wants to compromise it has to be a compromise somewhere other than in your own mind it has to be a compromise which is generally recognized"], [0.00012153387069702148, 0.499878466129303, 1, "my 7th grade class is studying water use overuse and contamination we would like to know
