surreal i am an eyewitness to history and it is surreal i will not tell any of what i would assume might be classified although i cannot think of anything but i will tell you what the secretary of state said when he came out of the speakers dining room into the hall that 1 500 to 2 000 sandinista communist forces under the command ofhe has general officer rankof daniel ortegas brother humberto

he had just gotten off the phone with the suspended priest who is the figurehead foreign minister of nicaragua the intelligence people i believe in tell me the real foreign minister is a hardcore communist this was confirmed by maj roger miranda who moved in the high communist circles as a then communist himself the nain foreign minister is the socalled deputy victor hugo tinico but when they need a mouthpiece who speaks fluent english it is mike brockman who was born in the united states and lived in hollywood ca mike brockman otherwise known as miguel descoto calls up the mouthpiece the front man the socalled foreign minister and tells the speaker of this great deliberative body that the troops are being withdrawn and i heard you say that if they are being withdrawn this is a whole

whether you would be the next speaker third in line to the presidency of the united states cod forbid something should happen of a fatal nature to both the president and the vice president you would be the president and you stood out there and told me that you were being hammered on by the far left forces of your party and that your votesthose were the days when you had to vote as speaker you only have to vote when you feel like it or to break a tieyou said that your votes were not reflective of your true feelings on national security and defense i said i am going to remember this conversation jim and i am going to remember this moment and right where we are standing because i expect you to start acting like a texan who loves his country once you are the speaker and i think you are going to make it and you did but coming from the shadow of that alamo which does not stretch with any difficulty from san antonio up to fort worth the great district you represent i cannot believe that you feel as did the 183 texans and tennesseans under davy crockett who died in the alamo i am now getting this constant image of the frenchman who when colonel travis drew a line in the sand with his saber and said if any body wants to leave because it looks like we are all going to die step across that line that one frenchmanand i am going to find out from the library of congress if he was an american citizen by thenstepped forward and said colonel mr travis i was at the battle of waterloo in 1815 i have seen enough killing for one lifetime and ill take the story out to the world and he left the alamo if that man is your hero that you want to opt from this slaughter that is going on right now of these boys and girls i said this morning before the mikes were cut off on meand that is a first in the history of the housethat i saw these boys and girls down there whose eyes i looked into with my 28yearold son just a few weeks ago and told them i would never forget them and i said i would never stand by and see them slaughtered well those boys and girls are dying for freedom just as certainly as those tennesseans and texans did at the alamo when patrick buchanan wrote that the liberal leadership of the house had become the indispensable arm of the communist expansion in this hemisphere i sent a message to patrick that i thought those words were too harsh i do not know whether it was 1 year ago or 6 months ago but i do not think those words were too harsh right now the leadership of this house has become the indispensable arm of the soviet unions intent to lock in

problem the administration c congress and the educational commu n nity are all looking at it and each has c come up with a different solution the administration through educa d tion secretary bennett proposes to v identify schools with the highest de v fault rates and then penalize those d schools if their default rates are not t decreased t some membersof congress are sug e gesting that we change the current s program by offering only grants to b students in their first 2 yearssince many defaulters are students who i have dropped out of their training s programs before they finished then i we would allow only loans for students i in their third and fourth years of post secondary education c a third plan is being offered by proprietary schools owners they have put together a manual for school officials which gives stepbystep instructions for setting up a student loan counseling program with followup activities each of these groups is focusing on this serious problem of student loan defaults but as we can see its difficult to agree on a single solution each approach has some merits and i am going to address them in more detail later but before i get to that id like to give you a little background on gsl the guaranteed student loan program was created in 1965 and has grown to a national program which last year provided 8 6 billion in loans to 3 5 million students during the last 6 years the loan default rate has ranged from a high of 9 7 percent in 1981 to a low of 8 3 percent in 1984 last years rate was 9 4 percent which represents a cost to the agency of 1 6 billion since college costs have been rising at twice the rate of inflation throughout the 1980s its becoming harder and harder for students and their parents to pay with all of the recent cuts and limitations on grants and student aid the gsl program has become i vital for millions of students but unfortunately some of these students are defaulting on their student loans the administrations solution was pror posed last month by secretary of education bennett his plan involves targeting schools with students who are i at high risk of defaulting based on data kept by the gsl program i once the schools have been identi fled the secretary will work with them to reduce the default rates of s their students if the students fail to repay their loans then the school might lose its guaranteed student loan eligibility d shortly after bennetts plan was proposed a report by the department l of educations inspector generals r office found that the default data e which the secretary used in his prob posal contained significant errors and that use of the data will result in the iepartment of education making inorrect decisions in monitoring and nanaging the multibilliondollar luaranteed student loan program in spite of the unreliability of this ata secretary bennett is going ahead rith his plan to try to targetschools ith high default rates if the stuents from these targeted schools coninue to default on their loans then he department of education will ither limit suspend or terminate a chools guaranteed student loan eligiility one of the criticisms of bennetts lan is that the burden is on the chool to prove that it should not lose ts eligibility to qualify for gsl loans eligibility decisions are also not suffiiently reviewed and many schools could be dropped from the gsl program unfairly another problem with the secretarys default reduction proposal is that it fails to mention that school officials cannot easily and accurately identify students who have defaulted on loans because school officials are denied access to loan default information if schools cannot identify defaulting students then they should not be held responsible for their students who default but that is exactly just what secretary bennett proposes schools should possibly shoulder some of the responsibility for student loan defaults but its basically not their fault since after all schools dont default on loans students do in congress my colleagues on the education and labor committee and i are primarily focusing on students as we consider various options to control student loan defaults as i mentioned earlier one of the bills restructures the federal student grant and loan programs to allow firstand secondyear students to receive only grants and no loans students would be eligible for gsl loans only after the completion of their second year but for all students the loans and grants would be provided on the same need basis another alternative might tie the grant and loan programs more closely to family income so that we establish two income levelsa low one for grants and a slightly higher one for loan eligibility for example we might determine that applicants for postsecondary education whose family income was below 20 000 a year might be eligible for grants alone while families with an annual income which falls between 20 000 and 30 000 might be eligible for loans with adequate funding either of these congressional proposals might improve the student loan and grant programs and ensure that all worthy students receive the postsecondary aid they need a third approach to the default problem has been developed by the orhl11472 ganizations and associations which they are helping them become proteach students who have the highest ductive taxpaying citizens risk of defaulting in fact a recent comprehensive this program is called the private study by the university of arkansas career schools default management indicated that even if every student in initiative and it was started by the na the country defaulted on his or her tional association of trade and tech guaranteed student loan the governnical schools and the association of ment would still benefit on the avertrade and technical associations age taxable earnings increase with they have been joined by the nation education so the government would al association of health career receive enough in increased taxes from schools the national association of these educated students to pay for accredited cosmetology schools and their loans the national home study council congress and the adtwo weeks ago they released their ministration need to work together default management manual to with members of the educational and suggest ways for schools to reduce the vocational training communities to number of gsl defaults design a fair and workable plan for reafter the manual outlines who de ducing defaults on guaranteed student faults and why it describes a model loans default prevention program that can i encourage all of my colleagues to easily be adopted by any school which work with members of the education uses gsl loans it is extremely practi and labor committee as we look critical and its sponsors are going to spend cally at secretary bennetts proposal the next 5 months explaining their de and as we develop more equitable and fault management program to schools realistic alternatives the individual across the united states followup and loan counseling procethe default management manual dures contained in the default manis clearly written it can be easily agement manual are very good steps adapted to any type of school and it to reducing the default problem which gives sound advice to students and could be adopted by federal loan schools involved with the gsl pro agencies gram in light of cuts in government instead of reducing the number of spending for academic and vocational highrisk students in the gsl pro education we need to work to gram as secretary bennett proposes strengthen and improve the gsl prowe should use a more reasonable and gram the millions of students who recompassionate approach similiar to ceive gsl

a previous order of the house the genof education proposes to eliminate tleman from indiana is from the gsl program recognized for 60 minutes now i wont deny that there are mr burton of indiana mr

dent is throwing down there and we will try to make this as brief as possible today the state department and the defense intelligence agency and the cia released and declassified some information given to the government of the united states by the defector major roger miranda bengoechea who was a very high official in the communist sandinista government major miranda has served as the deputy chief of the sandinista forces the personal administrative assistant to minister of defense humberto ortego and aid to the chief of the general staff miranda became chief of the secretariat in early 1982 the secretariat is the only entity that reports directly to the defense minister humberto ortego giving then major miranda more executive power than the chief of the general staff who is the major general miranda defected after visiting the nicaraguan battlefields where he says he noted that the resistance forces were not mercenaries but compesinos from the local population the nicaraguan resistance forces are the legitimate representatives of the interests and hopes of the nicaraguan people that is the contras he said after being out in the battlefields miranda said in an interview since his defection he also said he was disgusted with the corruption that is destroying the sandinista cause on october 25 he went to mexico for a physical a supposed physical and he and his wife went to the american embassy and defected since that time he has been meeting with our government officials telling them what the intentions of the communist sandinista government really are not what they tell the press not what they tell the people who believe in them but what the facts really are today when they declassified this information i became very concerned and thought this ought to be conveyed to all my colleagues and to the america people some of the major revelations are these there is going to be a continued military buildup that calls for increased soviet bloc military aid over the next 7 years the soviet union sent 14 000 tons of military assistance into nicaragua 3 years ago 18 000 tons of military supplies 2 years ago last year they sent 23 000 tons of military supplies in and this year it is going to be between 32 000 and 36 000 tons it is a tremendous military buildup major miranda says the soviet union has promised the sandinistas mig21 high performance aircraft now our government has said they will not allow that kind of aircraft on the northamerican continent because of the possibility of spying on the western coast of the united states the possibility that they could build up a military force big enough to take over all of central america and up into mexico and force the united hl11473 states to defend our southern flank nevertheless they have signed a secret agreement with the soviet union that will require that the sandinistas by 1991 get mig21 and possibly mig23 high performance fighter aircraft the migs are now expected to come sometime around 1991 or after the sandinistas also have requested more mi25 hind helicopters as if they do not have enough already that is the flying tank mi17 hip helicopters and an an26 transport aircraft the sandinistas intend to build an army and militia totalling a half a million men we were told up to now that it was going to be a quarter of a million men far in excess of all the other governments of central america combined and now we are told it is going to be a half a million man army humberto ortega in a speech delivered on saturday said they were going to increase them to 600 000 men in the military service many more armored personnel carriers selfpropelled howitzers antitank weapons surfacetoair missiles and antiaircraft guns are expected or already have been delivered they requested and are going to get three new 400ton naval vessels miranda said the sandinista commandante think that the only way of guaranteeing the development of their marxist program in nicaragua is to construct a powerful army one can sign agreements one can appear to be more flexible in the political system but they will never negotiate the development of their massive army they know that their power rests in the long run in the size of that army miranda went on that the sandinistas do not have any desire to negotiate the size of that army that they plan to have in nicaragua yes they are going to sit down and talk but after months of discussion they are going to say that they did not arrive at any agreement they are just trying to buy time to kill the contras let them die on the vine i think that is the most vulnerable point where they show the least desire to reach peace in central america according to miranda the sandinistas have continued to support the salvadoran insurgents the guerrillas the communist guerrillas in el salvador in spite of the central american peace plan as a matter of fact he told us yesterday at a meeting that they were giving additional aid to the communist guerrillas in el salvador after the peace accords were signed in guatemala in august so they signed a peace agreement saying they were going to work for peace down there and follow democratic principles and not export revolution and after that they continued to export revolutionary materials and supplies into el salvador he went on that at the request of guerrilla leader joiquin villalobos humberto ortega agreed in september 1987 to provide training in the use of surfacetoair missiles to salvadoran guerrillas they are training communist guerrillas from el salvador in nicaragua today they said they were not doing that but they are in fact training communist guerrillas in nicaragua that are fighting to undermine the government of el salvador they are also exporting revolutionary supplies into guatemala and honduras in october 1987 15 salvadoran guerrillas completed a 35day course in using a variety of surfacetoair missiles the training conducted in nicaragua was approved by the sandinistas the sandinista commandantes this entire weapons supply operation is handled by the clandestine entity known as the bureau which is run by commandante bayardo arce i met with bayardo arce sunday evening at the airport in managua this past sunday he told me that they were building not to a 600 000man army but to a 1millionman army weapons bound for el salvador costa rica colombia and other latin american guerrilla groups are shipped via commercial vessels and arrive from cuba and are stored in managua and are sent on to their designated targets the peace plan they plan to use as a weapon to deceive the american people to deceive the american government and to further their attempts to undermine all of the fledgling democracies in central america here is what he had to say the sandinistas have no intention of complying with the guatemala peace accords bear in mind this gentleman was one of the chiefs in the sandinista government he was the deputy assistant to humberto ortega the defense minister of nicaragua and he brought documents with him verifying everything he said to us it has been checked out the sandinistas have no intention of complying with the guatemala peace accords cuban and soviet advisers have told the sandinistas to talk about democracy pluralism and reform the goal of building a marxist state is to be downplayed he said they the sandinistas do not have the will to achieve that peace they had already made an agreement with the soviets and the cubans on plans for the sandinista army for the next 8 years with what desire then are they going to talk of peace when at the same time in the back of their minds they are thinking about creating one of the most powerful armies in latin america with an armament that few other armies in latin america have we are talking about selfpropelled artillery we are talking about mig21s we are talking about new 400ton battleships for the navy that no other central american country has he said the sandinistas had begun to recognize that the resistance enjoys a base of support in the countryside among the compesinos the real people an important social base in fact it is one of the fundamental facts that permits one to explain why after so many of the sandinista popular army offensives they are still out there the resistance in the nicaraguan countryside is like a fish in water he said plans to invade costa rica honduras and capture united states personnel and property in response to any direct united states military action is a real probability he said in the event of direct united states intervention if we think we are threatened or we must come to the rescue of honduras el salvador or guatemala he said in the event of direct united states intervention in nicaragua the sandinistas would attempt to regionalize and protract the conflict by sending helicopters and troops to invade costa rica which has no army destroy infrastructure targets and the united states embassy in san jose a sandinista battalion will simultaneously attack honduras this has just been declassified the american people and my colleagues in the congress need to be aware of this because many of my colleagues on that side of the aisle tell us that we do not have to worry about the sandinistas going beyond the borders of nicaragua that they promised freedom democracy freedom of assembly freedom of the press freedom of religion and all the things that we hold dear i might recommend to my colleagues they read what they promised in 1979 when they took power which were the same things that they promised in guatemala in august of this year they did not keep the promises then they are not going to keep them now and mr miranda has pointed out exactly what they plan for us he said that the sandinista government the hierarchy considers both the democrats and the republicans their enemies because we both want to end the revolution down there we just have different ways to approach it he did say however that democrats are more foolish than republicans because they are more malleable he said that i did not say that some things i think that need to be pointed out tomy colleagues are what is really going on down there as respects the poor people who are having to endure this communist totalitarian government we were in a town called leon on sunday for a rally i thought there were going to be 400 or 500 people there we ended up having 7 000 i went into a crowded movie theater and it seated about 1 800 people we went in there and instead we could hardly find room to get in the place they hl11474 were waving flags they had a little local band they were beating drums and singing patriotic songs every person who spoke from the local area from the opposition parties said that the sandinistas and their repression was intolerable they were killing the country after the meeting we went outside and we marched down the streets with these people who were waving their flags and chanting for freedom seven thousand people were involved in that little town when they passed the headquarters of the communist sandinista military they were waving their fists and saying sandinistas must go and they were making other comments as well we met with some of the business people at the conclusion of that meeting and i want to tell my colleagues what they said has happened to this economy since the sandinistas took power in 1979 cattle production and beef sales for export has gone from 70 million pounds to 10 million pounds a 700percent drop the cotton growers in 1979 exported 650 000 bales of cotton this year it is going to be 189 000 bales of cotton a drop of about 600 or 500 percent the small producers who produce cotton went from 5 000 to 270 they talked about the loss of techhology they had 2 000 engineers in the country 1 500 have fled they talked about in 1979 the exports from the government of somoza when he fled was 200 million in exports and now it is 10 million a drop of 2 000 percent they had 22 multinational corporations in nicaragua in 1978 and 1979 and that has now dropped to six in 1979 when the sandinistas took power they communized 75 percent of the industry there is no foreign currency to replace the aging industrial base and equipment now there are no technical advisers to help with the technical problems of the country the average worker down there the average worker is now making between 5 and 17 a month and for that he has to work 48 hours a week plus he has to donate 12 hours to the sandinista government that is a total of 60 hours of work for 5 to 17 a week that means that the one person who works will be able to feed himself probably twice a day and that does not include his famly as a result of this the black market has gone wild on the black market 70 percent of the commerce in that country is conducted while i was down there i bought some currency on entering the country one must buy currency at the airport or one cannot get into the country i have here an old cordoba currency when the sandinistas came into power shortly after this piece of currency was printed and this is a 20cordoba bill i bought this one which is the same bill but my colleagues will notice over the top of it is printed 20 000 when i was down there 2 months ago the exchange rate was 7 200 cordobas for 1 unitedstates dollar when i went back this weekend it was 15 000 cordobas for 1 unitedstates dollar and that is the official rate on the black market it is double that 30 000 cordobas for 1 unitedstates dollar one cannot buy anything the money is worthless the money is getting more worthless all the time it is only worth a few cents now this 20 000cordoba bill is worth 67 cents and when somoza the tyrant fled the country it was 10 cordoba for 1 unitedstates dollar each cordoba was worth 10 cents now 20 000 cordobas are worth 67 cents is it any wonder the people cannot eat they are starving they are dying on the vine we need to make our colleagues in the unitedstates congress and the people across this country aware of that fact humberto ortega in a speech this weekened after major miranda made these revelations said yes they are building toward a 600 000man army yes they are exporting revolution yes they are training guerrillas in their own country and yes they are planning to get soviet mtg21s and other aircraft major miranda has been supported by the defense minister himself in what major miranda has said this morning in the washington post the speaker of this house of representatives said that the speech was preposterous the speech by the defense minister humberto ortega he described the speech as outrageous and counterproductive he said that it was it was intemperate and irrational i would like to conclude by saying what does it take to convince the leader of this house what does it take to convince the majority of the congressman in the democrat party in this house to believe what these people are all about a defector a military major the assistant to the secretary of defense down there of nicaragua the defense minister humberto ortega has told us of the vast military buildup that they are planning humberto ortega himself has told us the same thing and yet members on that side of the aisle still do not believe my concern is are we going to wait until el salvador is undermined and falls are we going to wait until honduras falls and costa rica falls are we going to wait until they get into guatemala and southern mexico before we respond we should be supporting the contras who are fighting not only for their own freedom and the promises of democracy made to their people in 1979 and again in august in esquipulas guatemala but also for the freedoms and the security of the united states as well we have a 1 980mile border between us and mexico we cannot even keep illegal aliens out all of my colleagues know that last year we passed the simpsonmazzoli immigration reform bill and in that bill we allowed anybody who has been in this country illegally for 5 years or more to get permanent resident status because we could not find them and get them out this year we said if they had been here 5 years or longer and they wanted to bring their families up here they can bring their families up even though they came in illegally we are going to give permanent resident status to them because we cannot control the border and we will make them unitedstates citizens and it is going to cost us dearly in welfare costs housing costs social security costs and jobs because a lot of those people work for a heck of a lot less so we have a lot of pressure on us because we cannot keep illegal aliens from coming across the border can my colleagues imagine what it is going to be like if humberto ortegas prophecy in what he promises to do takes place if they can consolidate power and crush the contras in nicaragua and accomplish that because we do not act in this body then they will rapidly export revolution or even more rapidly export revolution into el salvador costa rica honduras guatemala and up into mexico they told us time and again what they plan to do yet the leadership in this house and the majority in this house continues to believe that it aint so well it is so if we have to defend that 2 000mile border it is going to cost us dearly in manpower our young boys are going to be down there fighting and dying to defend that southern flank the soft underbelly of america it is going to cost us billions of dollars and we are going to get 5 10 20 million people fleeing those countries and coming into this country as refugees not as illegal aliens as refugees we are going to have to deal with that it is going to cost us dearly it is estimated if we get 5 million to 10 million refugees coming into this country it will increase unemployment among americans by 5 percent to 7 percent and for each 1 percent of unemployment it costs the taxpayers of this country 30 billion that is 150 billion to 210 billion in just lost jobs not to mention the vast amount of expense it will cost to defend a 2 000mile border between the united states and mexico or if we have to to send them down into honduras when i met with president azcona in tegucigalpa honduras he told me face to face that if the peace process fails and if the contras are destroyed because of lack of will in this body that they do not get any more aid from us to fight the fight for freedom down there that he is going to have to hl11475 request 50 000 americans be stationed in honduras and he is going to ask for 250 million in additional military aid he has told us that is what he will have to do in el salvador that fledgling democracy is going to need assistance so is costa rica which does not have an army and guatemala will need assistance as well either we do what is necessary now by helping the contras or we are going to have to pay dearly later many people had doubts about this before and i can understand that because we have been debating it a lot and we have heard different stories coming across the national news media but now we have the facts the defense minister of nicaragua himself has told us what he plans to do major miranda has given us secret documents that show the secret agreements that they have signed with the soviets there is no question about it now the unitedstates congress when we come back after the holidays must vote for additional contra aid if we do not we are going to rue the day it is that old statement that has been made in television commercials for years when they show a guy with a fram oil filter on television and he says you can either pay me now or pay me later the implication is if you buy fram oil filters you are going to keep your engine in good shape and you will not have to pay for major repairs for your automobile engine someplace down the road the statement i am making tonight is you can pay now by helping the contras fight for freedom and give them the wherewithal to put that country into the free column as was promised them in 1979 and again in august of this year at esquipulas or later it is going to cost us billions of dollars and a lot of young american lives we need to deal with this problem we can no longer dillydally the time is late they told us what they plan to do and this congress must act for the american people and for the people of central america"], [0.9679077863693237, 0.9679077863693237, 0, "i ask unanimous consent that all members may

adjourning soon some of the boobirds are demanding a vote i have been there and needless to say we all miss our families my family is many hundreds of miles away and i miss them deeply and i am looking forward to seeing them soon to celebrate christmas i must also say that i am very proud as one member of congress to participate in this wonderful mosaic that is congress each one of us representing a district of 518 000 people all different kinds of people all different kinds of americans we are blessed and as we approach christmas in just a few days i think it is worthwhile to consider that we in fact are blessed with living in the greatest and most powerful democracy that has ever existed on the face of this planet with that blessing come certain responsibilities this wonderful mosaic of the unitedstates congresshas come together to agree on a plan for spending 600 billioh next year and within that plan are some things that some of us agree with and others of us disagree with i do not want to suggest that anyone who participated in the conference on this continuing resolution has any superior moral insight or is on a higher moral plateau than anyone else who participated in the conference but i would submit that just as my parents came to this country and had certain hopes and dreams for me and my brother parents all over the world have the same hopes and dreams for their children that someday they are going to havea better life than their parents were able to enjoy i think we come to this continuing resolution at a critical time when all of us everyone of us in this congress regardless of our political parties are hoping to see peace established we come to that question with different points of view and different views as to how that peace will be brought about i submit that within this process initiated by a learned man a student of history named president arias who has won the nobel peace prize he has attempted to bring about a process that will stop the killing in central america it is easy for us to sit here with the fruits of democracy going home for christmas with our families to perhaps avoid the fact that there is death taking place that there is a major military offensive being undertaken at this moment by the contras as they attempt to demonstrate that they are in a position to show power when i look at each of those nations and particularly the nations where most of the killing is taking place in nicaragua and in el salvador i would submit that not a great deal of progress has been made in either country the killing goes on in el salvador and in nicaragua on january 15 the presidents of the five central american nations who have taken a certain amount of pride in establishing a peace process are going to meet again it is a very tenuous peace process it has not really taken hold let us face that point it has not taken hold we hope it will take hold and we all i suppose have different views on how we can strengthen that process i hope that the process we take will be constructive rather than destructive president arias has made it clear that he thinks it would be a mistake to continue military assistance at this juncture to the contras there are many members here in this chamber who are convinced that it is necessary to maintain that commitment to the contras in order to put pressure on the sandinistas i wish that i could tell the members that i had some clearcut view on how to deal with this issue any more than anyone else in this chamber generally i tend to support those who have the same questions that i have rather than those who seem to feel that it is a black and white situation and that they have some kind of superior insight i must vote against this continuing resolution and i know many others in this chamber are going to vote against it because we believe that the avenue to an honorable peace in central america and the way to strengthen the tenuous initiative undertaken by president arias relies on our putting faith for the first time in our neighbors in not deciding that we as the unitedstates congress or we in the united states of america have a superior insight to the five central american presidents i sat opposite men of good faith in hour after hour of negotiations on this conference as it related to what kind of package we would provide for the contras and we are going to provide a package that does involve the transportation of lethal assistance to help them continue their military initiative that is taking place at this moment in central america it is my hope and i know it may very well be a vain hope that if we were to defeat this continuing resolution i and likeminded colleagues would not be in a position to go back and convince ted stevens and warren rudman or general powell or president reagan that we should fundamentally change the agreement we made on contra aid in this resolution but it would be my view that if this cr was defeated we might get a 30day temporary cr maybe a lot of members would not vote for it but it would be a cr that allows us to see whether that tenuous peace initiative could somehow be strengthened by the men and women of good faith in central america who are trying to make it stronger again at 1 42 this morning as we hope to adjourn and go to see our families i can only say as one member of congress as much as i would like to see my family after having visited central america as so many of us have the greatest christmas blessing i can think ofand i know i brought up the name of someone on this floor last year and was criticized for itin my view the greatest message that we could deliver on this night a few days before the birth of jesus christ is a message that says there is hope for peace in central america and that we are going to try to find an avenue that will allow that initiative to be strengthened that is the reason why i as one member of congress chose to take the position i did"],

jurisdiction one of the issues raised was the matter of trade or the lack of it with the republic of korea particularly with regard to beef exports i offered as an amendment to the trade bill an amendment that essentially states that it isr the sense of the congress of the uhited states of america that the current ban of beef imports into the republic of korea was a direct violation of that

congress section of my amendment will be available for all our colleagues to read we have heard a great deal about the problems we have had with japan and the exports of our products including beef into that nation the republic of korea has decided apparently that it wants to join the ranks of those who would keep out our beef because they know that if given the choice between quality and price their consumers would readily buy our beef products we are not here to ask for some kind of an unfair advantage over other beef producers around the world we just want a chance to compete i hope that the republic of korea will take note of the actions of the house agriculture committee and the members of the congressional beef caucus participating in this special order by opening up their markets

today to speak in support of legislation to repeal the fuel use act the fuel use act was adopted in 1978 during an era of short supplies and rising prices for oil and natural gas the act was intended to reduce the nations dependence on imported oil to encourage greater reliance on domestic coal and to preserve oil and gas for uses such as residential heating for which few substitute fuels were available the act further prohibited the use of oil and gas as primary energy sources in new electric powerplants and new major fuelburning installations and required that new powerplants be capable of using coal or another alternate fuel the oil and gas shortages that supported the act have not developed instead there is a growing consensus that interfuel price competition among oil gas coal and other fuels is beneficial and should be encouraged in reality this act effectively shuts off several efficient uses for natural gas creating inflated utility rates both producers and consumers suffer because of this legislation today the total resource base of the lower 48 states is estimated to be 835 trillion cubic feet or 50 times the current annual production repeal of the fuel use act would provide a badly needed shot in the arm for the gas industry a strong incentive to find additional supplies and a hedge against a cutoff of imported oil it is important to understand that unitedstates domestic oil production is currently declining at a rate of 6 percent per year while consumption in 1986 increased at 3 percent if these trends hold the united states will be importing more than 50 percent of its oil by 1990 and the organization of petroleum exporting countries will be operating at 90 percent of capacity this is almost the identical situation that existed at the time of the second oil shock in 1979 for these reasons removing federal statutory restraints on the use of natural gasa clean abundant american fuelis essential to lessen our dependence on foreign oil the repeal

as the most modern specialty steel industry in the world no question about it yet they cannot compete and every one of those presidents had to put a limitation on imports coming in there is a reason
