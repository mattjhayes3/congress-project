this has the potential to put this country back on the wrong fiscal track of increased deficit spending and an exploding national debt although the majority claims to support retiring the publicly

honoring the national institute of standards and technology and its employees on the occasion of its centennial the national institute of standards and technology was chartered by congress on march 3 1901 as the federal governments first physical science research laboratory scientists engineers and industrialists first advocated the establishment of a standards laboratory pointing to the new challenges facing the unitedstates as a rapidly industrializing world power beginning with just a staff of 12 nist has grown to become a vital arm of the department of commerces technology administration in its first 100 years nist has partnered successfully with industry science and government to establish the foundations for this countrys technological advances the resolution we are considering today appropriately calls nist a crown jewel in the federal government emphasizing its contributions to the nation in particular i would like to draw attention to the work of nists laboratories in boulder colorado in my district in 1950 to address the lack of laboratory space nist established a cryogenic engineering laboratory and radio facilities on land donated by the citizens of boulder colorado nist facilities were expanded in the mid1960s when nist and the university of colorado joined forces to create the joint institute for laboratory astrophysics known as jila a cooperative effort that has gained widespread recognition in atomic physics and other fields this partnership between nist and the university of colorado has led to some amazing discoveries beginning in the 1970s the discipline of cooling and trapping atoms was established in part by experiments with electrically charged atoms by researchers at the nist boulder campus this work inspired dr william phillips and his team to demonstrate both the trapping and the cooling of atoms well below the temperature limits generally believed possible dr phillips was awarded the nobel prize in physics in 1997 for this work in 1995 using the same techniques of laser cooling and trapping of atoms scientists at jila cooled rubidium atoms to less than onemillionth of a degree above absolute zero this was 300 times lower in temperature than ever achieved before and created a new state of matter predicted decades ago by einstein and the indian physicist bose the boseeinstein condensate is widely hailed as one of the centurys major achievements in physics this research has enabled the design and construction of one of the worlds most accurate clocks which is used by nist in cooperation with the naval observatory to maintain the nations time standard this clock which is called the nist f1 is so accurate that it will neither gain nor lose a second in 20 million years something that is almost incomprehensible if we think about this precise time information it is neededby electric power companies radio and television stations telephone companies air traffic control systems the global positioning system participants in space exploration the internet and navigators of ships and planes all need to compare their own timing equipment to a reliable internationallyrecognized standard which nist provides these are just some of the contributions nist has provided to the nation in the half century of their existence as we approach the 50th anniversary of these labs in boulder i would like to raise my remarks on another issue in regard to the current state of the labs some know and the gentlewoman from maryland just mentioned it nist celebrated the completion of the nist advanced chemistry science laboratory in gaithersburg after an 80 million investment nist can now boast another worldclass facility in which to conduct more worldclass research also at gaithersburg just last year ground was broken for the advanced measurement laboratory which has projected costs of over 200 million now that gaithersburgs needs have been addressed boulder is next in line to receive critical funding for construction and maintenance projects this according to nists published plans lists construction and maintenance project priorities for the labs i am very hopeful that the new administration will recognize the value of the boulder labs contributions and the necessity of upgrading these facilities so the scientists in boulder can continue to contribute topflight research nists boulder campus as has the campus in gaithersburg has done much for the nation and for colorado and it will continue to do so in the future but in order to get the full value from the asset we must invest in its upkeep i am glad that congress is acknowledging today the critical role nist has played in helping build this countrys science and technology infrastructure in the 20th century this

duty to alleviate the suffering of the poor and oppressed in our own communities some of the most effective organizations for meeting the needs of impoverished americans are faithbased yet these are the very groups that face discrimination by corporate america according to leslie lenkowsky in last months edition of commentary in 1998 only some 2 percent of the money donated by the nations largest foundations went to religiously affiliated institutions and much of that was earmarked for institutions like hospitals and universities the capital research center found that six of the ten largest

most effective charities at a time when congress has taken a leading role in knocking down discriminatory barriers that prevent faithbased charities from competing for government grants and contracts on a bipartisan basis congress first started the work of expanding charitable choice in 1996 with welfare reform and followed up with the welfaretowork grant program in 1997 in 1998 congress added charitable choice to the community services block grant program and in 2000 we added charitable choice to substance abuse treatment and prevention services under the public health services act we know that these programs work and the states are also finding great success a study of indianas faith works program which allows welfare recipients to get assistance from faithbased charities instead of secular providers found that those opting for such charities came from more distressed family situations and had deeper personal crises than those opting for the secular alternative the studyconcluded that what these people found at faithbased charities was more emotional and spiritual support than what could ever be offered by a secular institution in some personal situations that additional support might be the difference between life and death i predict that congress will knock down more barriers against faithbased charities in programs like the community health centers program this
