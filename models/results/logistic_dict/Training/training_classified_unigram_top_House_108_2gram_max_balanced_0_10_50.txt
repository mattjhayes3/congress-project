money out of the pockets of working families so that they may line the pockets of their fat cat friends this budget is a betrayal to working families across america to seniors veterans and especially to our children and grandchildren who will be left to clean up this administrations fiscal disaster i am amazed that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have managed to turn record surpluses into record deficits in a mere three years this budget does nothing to remedy the situation and continues further down the same road by using a 5year budget instead of a traditional 10year budget my republican colleagues are attempting to hid the real costs of their outrageous plan after five years the cost of making the tax giveaways permanent will grow drastically over the next ten years the tax giveaways in this plan will cost 1 2 trillion my republican colleagues will not even apply the payasyougo method to their tax giveaways because they know we cannot afford them these budget gimmicks and rascality cannot be tolerated the american people deserve to know the outrageous credit card bills the bush administration is racking up in their name and with their credit in addition this budget does nothing to protect the social security trust fund five years from when the first of the baby boomer generation reach retirement age these republicans fiscal mismanagement will squander the entire 1 trillion social security surplus adding to the ballooning deficit and throwing the long term economic security of millions of americans into doubt the republican budget doesnt provide any money this year to protect medicaid in fact it cuts the program as a result states are going to be forced to cut benefits and coverage for the more than 50 million of our most vulnerable seniors children pregnant women working families and disabled americans who rely on medicaid for vital healthcare services more than 3 7 million have already lost coverage under bushs watch we should be shoring up the programs that provide health insurance coveragenot cutting them on the medicare side republicans offer no proposals to improve the inadequate and disingenuous medicare drug benefit enacted last year just yesterday a new stud concluded that the medicare hospital fund will be bankrupt in 2019 seven years sooner than predicted a year ago partly due to the new benefit which funnels money into private health plans also absent from this budget are other proposals that could improve the medicare program such as funding for increase nursing home staffing and quality improvement or fixing the flawed payment system for doctors nor are there any proposals to protect the medicare program from being overcharged and defrauded by private insurance companies and health maintenance organizations and of course there is the similarly outrageous effort of this white house to hide from both democratic and republicans the true cost of their medicare privatization bill which truly makes me wonder whether any of their budget numbers can be trusted in education no child left behind is already dramatically underfunded and this budget will continue this indignity we cannot leave the states to pick up the tab for this federally mandated program special education after school programs teacher training pell grants perkins loans and vocational education are all either frozen or cut under this dreadful budget i wonder if my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are trying to ensure that public schools fail so they can privatize the entire system this budget continues the republican war on the environment the president and republicans will try to sound like they are environmentalists but the truth is in this budget which contains drastic cuts to major environmental protection programs budget cuts will be felt in a variety of areas including enforcement inspections less money available than needed for safe drinking water inadequate funding for cleanups of superfund sites and leaking underground storage tanks and fewer brownfields grants than authorized by the new law signed two years ago my colleagues would rather give tax cuts to their buddies than invest in clean air clean water and cleaning up toxic waste sites for the next five years the republican budget provides 10 5 percent less than what is needed just to maintain services at the current level more noteworthy their funding levels in 2009 will still be 901 million below the 2004 enacted level my republican colleagues obviously fail to keep our nations commitment to a healthy environment our troops and veterans are also betrayed by this draconian budget we made a promise to our service men and women serve your country and we will take care of you this budget is yet another promise broken by this administration and republican congress these men and women are willing to risk their lives for this country and this congress and president will not even guarantee basic benefits for healthcare and housing we cannot treat our men and women in uniform with such disregard and disrespect particularly during this time of war we must treat our veterans and soldiers with the utmost honor and dignity thirty thousand veterans are waiting six months or longer for an appointment at a va hospital this is a total outrage and this budget does nothing to help in fact this budget raises healthcare costs for up to 1 million veterans in addition my republican colleagues refuse to eliminate the disabled veterans tax which forces disabled military retirees to give up one dollar of their pension for every dollar of disability pay they receive the republican budget continues to require nearly 400 000 military retirees with serviceconnected disabilities to continue to pay the disabled veterans tax i strongly support the democratic budget and urge my colleagues to do the same because it will keep the promise we made to the american peopleunlike the budget being served up by our republican colleagues the democratic alternative will cut the deficit in half by 2007 and balance the budget by 2012 the democratic alternative matches the administration request for defense spending and adds funding for homeland security we need to get back to fiscal responsibility and get the nations economy back on track we need to take care of our veterans and our children and our environment we need to make sure our citizens have healthcare and education opportunities the democratic budget is responsible and sensible and i urge my colleagues regardless of party to support it the republican budget is not worthy of support by any responsible american"], [1.4424324035644531e-05, 0.9999855756759644, 1, "the assault on overtime pay is nothing less than an attempt to pick the pockets of millions of hardworking americans by stripping 8 million workers of their right to be paid for the hours they work republicans have issued another callous insult to families struggling to make a living since many of those who will be affected are nursing professionals police firefighters and other first responders it sends another stinging message to the people we turn to and who routinely undertake the most thankless tasks in our times of need over 3 million americans have lost their jobs since president bush took oflice and countless others dont appear in the employment statistics because they have given up hope o tinding a job isnt in enough that the bush administration has presided over the loss of 3 million privatesector jobs it has failed to raise the minimum wage it is allowing millions of older workers to lose half their private pension benefits it has denied unemployment benefits to millions of workers who exhausted their federal unemployment benefits it has gutted worker safety protections and denied working familys tax cutsincluding the child tax creditwhile showering hundreds of billions in cuts to the wealthiest of americans as an experienced nurse i want to draw your attention to serious dangers posed by this measure which threatens not only the pay of millions of nurses and other health care workers but also the safety of patients in our health care facilities healthcare professionals particularly nurses are working an increasing amount of mandatory overtime patient care and contributing to the ranks of the over 500 000 trained nurses who have left their field the current nursing workforce is aging the shortage of registered nurses in my home state of texas is becoming more critical texas will experience a deficit of 10 000 rns by 2005 16 000 by 2010 and 50 000 by 2020 according to a july 2002 report from the health resources and services administration i am afraid that this will lead to drive even more nurses away from clinical settings at a time when the nation is struggling to develop policies that will keep todays nurses at the bedside and attract more students into nursing for the future it is unrealistic to imagine that nurses will remain in jobs where they have lost the guarantee that they will be paid premium wages or any wages at all when they are forced to work overtime hours what in the world is it about americans who are working hard to provide for their families that this administration just cant stand i urge my colleagues to vote yes on the motion to instruct conferees to accept senatepassed

young americans are fighting for our country even as we speak they are in harms way and deserve our full attention and support today instead the republican house leadership has us debating a partisan bill that cuts taxes for the wealthiest americans who sit safely here at home and astonishingly pays for those tax cuts by cutting benefits to warwounded veterans to do so at any time would be wrong to do so during the first 4 hours of our war in iraq is shameful is the altar of dividend tax cuts so sacred to our house republican leadership that it is even willing to cut veterans benefits by over 28 billion on the day our future veterans are risking their lives for our country tax cuts for the wealthy paid for by benefit cuts to veterans is this the new republican model for the long timehonored american tradition of shared sacrifice in time of war i hope my colleagues will pay attention to the words of the national commander of the disabled american veterans the honored and

for its defenders i urge you commander heath said to the speaker to reconsider the inequitable and illadvised course proposed in the committees partisan budget proposal i believe the sentiments expressed by the national commander of the disabled american veterans reflects the values of americans everywhere i understand that in this budget last night or so they made a fig leaf change so that now they are only cutting veterans benefits by 28 billion rather than 30 billion i think mr heath and our veterans all across this land of ours will recognize that as nothing but a political fig leaf

all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only on tuesday the committee on rules met and granted a modified closed rule for the marriage penalty relief act h r 4181 amends the internal revenue code of 1986 to permanently extend the increased standard deduction and the 15 percent individual income tax rate bracket expansion for married taxpayers filing joint returns it will also make permanent the increase in the phaseout of the earned income credit for joint filers before 2001 the tax code penalized many married couples by forcing them to pay higher taxes just because they were married the 2001 tax relief bill enacted by president bush brought fairness to the tax code by phasing out these penalties this law increased the standard deduction in the 15 percent tax bracket for married couples to twice as much for individuals the relief was accelerated in the tax relief that was signed into law last year thirtyfive million couples currently benefit from the elimination of the marriage penalty however this relief will be reduced next year and will expire in 2010 and we cannot let that happen unless the relief is extended 27 million married couples will face an average tax increase of 300 in 2005 and over 35 million will see a tax increase of more than 700 starting in 2011 h r 4181 ensures that the marriage penalty relief is not reduced next year and that it stays in the law permanently we all know our economy is starting to rebound businesses are beginning to hire workers again and americans are starting to spend their money with more confidence if we do not eliminate the marriage tax penalty and prevent other tax increases our economy might slow down and prevent job creation married working couples will be able to use this tax relief to benefit their families which always helps the economy they will be able to spend this money to improve their home or buy something they want like a ndw washing machine or a new tv and the more money they spend the more jobs they will help create for their neighbors and friends this is what the bill is all about the most important thing we can do today is revitalize our economy here at home and we do this by

thank the distinguished ranking member for yielding me this time he is extremely kind i came to the floor on several very brief points one i would like to associate myself with the outstanding work of the democratic caucus and the substitute budget that is going to be offered by the gentleman from south carolina and our caucus let me also associate myself with the congressional black caucus budget resolution because it embraces if you will the understanding that we are all our brothers and sisters keeper let me just say to my colleagues that in listening to the 91 testimony one of the key elements that mr tenet said and i disagree with him more than i agree is that our law enforcement have to be a part of the war on terrorism i am disappointed that the budget offered by the president and the republicans has faltered in protecting the home front it has faltered in giving opportunity educationally to those who are most in need by depleting the pell grants i am disappointed in its work on health care and the providing of opportunities for a guaranteed medicare prescription drug benefit i ani disappointed in its lack of support for veterans in the united states and i am disappointed in its overemphasis on defense by not allowing us to be able to support the needs of this nation i ask my colleagues to vote for the democratic substitute i rise today being very disturbed with the direction that the republican party and this administration is taking our great nation the prime reason for my concern is the national budget which will come before this body tomorrow the nussle budget clearly does not improve upon the severely flawed bush administration budget the needs of average americans are still ignored the interests of a wealthy few outweigh the needs of an entire nation in this budget i say this not out of partisanship but from a statement of the facts i want to highlight a few areas in this budget that are particulary egregious this president and the majority party in this body have spent so much time talking about their record on education and as hard as i try i can not see what they have to be proud of it is one thing to address areas of critical need with rhetoric but to advocate a policy and then not fund it sufficiently is plain irresponsible at the top of the list of my concerns is the no child left behind act nclb and the fact that it has become an unfunded mandate the house republican resolution provides at least 8 8 billion less than the 34 3 billion authorized for education programs under the no child left behind act for 2005 this low funding leaves millions of elementary and secondary school students without the services congress and the president promised just two years ago for example the republican budget denies title i services to 2 4 million students who qualify under the act but the irresponsibility does not end with no child left behind for the third straight year the republican party has frozen the funding level for pell grants both the republicans and the president freeze the maximum pell grant award at the 2003 level of 4 050 with an average grant of 2 399 such small pell grants make college unaffordable for millions of students the college board reports that tuition and fees at 4year public colleges today average 4 694 in any market this gap would be hard to swallow but with the current state of joblessness that the republican partys agenda has created it is near impossible for so many american families to send their children to college i fear that this agenda if allowed to continue will cause a perpetual state where our american families arent able to succeed our brave american veterans are another group who were outraged by the presidents budget and will unfortunately be disappointed with the republican house budget i hear so much in this body from the majority party about the greatness of our armed forces and theyre right but again its just empty rhetoric on their part those brave men and women fighting on the front lines in our war against terror will come back home and find that the republican party looks at them differently once they become veterans almost all veterans need some form of health care some will need drastic care for the rest of their lives lecause of the sacrifice they made in war but the republican party continues to turn a blind eye to their needs on a bipartisan basis the committee on veterans affairs recommended that 2 5 billion more than the presidents budget was needed to maintain vital health care programs for veterans nevertheless the house republican budget provides 1 3 billion less than what the committee recommended for 2005 the entire department of veterans affairs is going to suffer because of the republican agenda over the next five years the money allocated to the department of veterans affairs will not even be able to maintain these programs at their current levels in 2007 the budget is 227 million less than what the department of veterans affairs needs to keep pace within inflation over five years the republican budget cuts 1 6 billion from the total needed to maintain services at the 2004 level ive heard from veterans groups throughout my district in houston and im sure each member of this body has heard from groups in their own district because veterans are one group that come from all parts of this nation these brave veterans have told me their stories of how they are suffering now with the current state of veterans affairs i am going to have trouble telling them that not only will things continue to stay bad but if this budget passes this body things will only continue to get worse that is not what our returning soldiers from iraq and afghanistan should have to look forward to a future where their needs are not only not provided for but are in fact ignored education and veterans affairs make up only two areas where republican budget fails americans the truth is there are many other programs and services vital to our rlation that are at risk because of the repriblican agenda at this point an average american may be asking why the republican party finds it necessary to cut so many fundamental programs the answer is simple yet disturbing the majority party is cutting important programs in order to finance all their irresponsible tax cuts they will continue to make the argument that tax cuts provide stimulus for our economy but millions of unemployed americans will tell you otherwise in fact the congressional budget office itself said tax legislation will probably have a net negative effect on saving investment and capital accumulation over the next 10 years while the republican party continues its offensive for irresponsible tax policies they allow our national deficit to grow increasingly larger the deficits are so large and their policies are so irresponsible that they wont even make deficit projections past 2009 its clear that the republican party is hiding from the american people this president and this majority in congress have yet to advocate a fiscal policy that helps average americans special interests have become king in this budget at the price of sound fiscal policies the truth about the budget is that a sound fiscal policy that funds needed programs is possible the democratic alternative budget and the cbc altemative budget are both examples of how we can get out of the quagmire that the republican agenda has put this nation in the democratic budget achieves balance within eight years through realistic policy choices that protect funding for key services the democratic budget also has a better bottom line than the republican budget every year meaning a smaller national debt and fewer resources wasted paying interest on the national debt chronic deficits crowd out private borrowing run up interest rates and slow down economic growth in addition the democratic budget provides 1 3 billion more than the republican budget for veterans programs for 2005 and 6 6 billion more over five years the democratic budget provides 2 1 billion more for appropriated education and training programs than the republican budget for 2005 and 9 8 billion more over the next five years the democratic budget also provides 3 7 billion in mandatory funding to make up the current shortfall in funding for pell grants and additional funding to make college loans cheaper for students these programs are all funded while maintaining a sound fiscal policy the democratic budget achieves balance within eight years through realistic policy choices that protect funding for key services the democratic budget also has a better bottom line than the republican budget every year meaning a smaller national debt and fewer resources wasted paying interest on the national debt republicans will surely try to counter this by touting the benefits of tax cuts however most americans are waking up to the fact that mass tax cuts targeted toward the wealthiest americans will only bog down our national economy the democratic budget accommodates the extension of marriagepenalty relief the child tax credit and the ten percent individual income tax bracket these tax cuts provide relief to middleclass families whose incomes have stagnated under the current administrations economic policies this is what a sound fiscal policy really stands for this body was made to stand for the will of all americans if we allow this budget proposal to take effect we will have failed our mandate i for one will not stand by silently i have a duty to my constituents and indeed to all americans to work for their wellbeing and i will continue to honor that duty i feel it is a sad day when the issue of our national security is compromised by a lack of proper funding i was deeply concerned when i saw the amount of funding allocated to homeland security under the presidents budget but i am appalled at the further cuts taken from homeland security in this republican budget resolution this republican budget cuts a further 857 million from nondefense homeland security budget that the president proposed that statement in itself is the height of fiscal irresponsibility somehow the programs the republican leadership sought to cut were the same ones that all americans are looking towards protecting their security as a member of the homeland security committee i know the shortfalls in our national security system and i am prudent enough to know that under funding these programs will not resolve our vulnerabilities first responder programs are under funded by 900 million and represent a critical element in our national security apparatus first responders make up the local presence that are our first line of defense against possible terrorist attacks in a way every american is a first responder because we all must stay vigilant to truly avert future attacks however there are groups of people who go beyond vigilance and act as a professional presence to keep america safe among the first responder programs that i believe are so critical is the community orientated policing services cops program the cops program has helped nearly 12 950 jurisdictions through 277 different grant programs since 1994 in september 2002 cops had provided funding for 116 573 community policing professionals across the country another critical first respender program is citizen corp which provides citizens with volunteer opportunities to help their communities prepare for and respond to emergencies first responders are not just used to prevent terrorist attacks they fulfill the security needs of so many americans dealing with local emergencies for example citizen corps is now playing a critical role here in the district of columbia helping communities deal with the lead contamination that currently affects their water supply clearly first responder programs like the cops program and citizen corp are vital unfortunately they require funds that are not being provided for in the republican budget resolution port security grants are under funded by 566 million and may be our greatest vulnerability in our efforts to prevent future terrorist attacks as the representative of a congressional district in houston texas i know personally the importance of proper port security the port of houston is one of the largest in america the workers on those docks have an incredibly difficult job managing thousands of ships a year which is aside from any additional security concerns i fear that if we do not provide the proper funding for port security we leave ourselves open to another catastrophic event the numbers attributed to the traffic on our seas is staggering there are 361 public ports in the united states that handle over 95 percent of unitedstates overseas trade approximately 7 500 foreign ships manned by 200 000 foreign sailors enter unitedstates ports every year to offload approximately six million trucksize cargo containers onto unitedstates docks this means that our ports are extremely valuable to our national economy but with so much ship traffic coming through they are also extremely vulnerable as a member of the homeland security committee i have been briefed on how few of those six million trucksize cargo containers are actually inspected in an age where we are told that nuclear components can be launched from a suitcase i am loathe to think about the damage that could be caused by a cargo container that has been compromised by a terrorist it must be clear to every member of this body the importance of homeland security but we can not pay mere lip service to the needs necessary to maintain our national security the risks are too high and the lives of americans are too important it is imperative that we fully fund homeland security in all its facets we can not just allocate all our money towards fighting terrorists broad we must use the necessary funds to truly make our homeland secure"], [2.8967857360839844e-05, 0.9999710321426392, 1, "165 years ago conservatives in the house of representatives passed a rule to prohibit and

has the opportunity to get a great start in life with a first rate education they want a country where every american has access to quality health care they want an america where there is a job for every individual ready to roll up their sleeves and go to work and they want to know that their government is taking all reasonable steps to protect our homeland and be prepared to respond to national emergencies these are the simple things we want for our families our neighbors and our follow americans we are a great nation we can do these things unfortunately the republican budget before us does not begin to meet the needs and priorities of our nation just a short time ago i had the privilege of sitting in this chamber when the president gave his state of the union address at the outset of his speech he made the following statement we will not deny we will not ignore we will not pass along our problems to other congresses to other presidenls and other generations unfortunately neither the budget submitted by the president nor the republican budget committee proposal before us today passes that test in fact the budget before us today does exactly what the president says he does not want to do it does ignore our problems and if we dont fix those problems we will be simply passing the buck to future congresses future presidents and future generations look at education last year with great fanfare the president signed the leave no child behind bill at the white house yet the ink was barely dry before the administration submitted a budget that fell well short of the promised funding well when you leave the funding behind you leave millions of children behind with nothing but broken promises and the republican proposal falls 9 billion shortdlmost 25 percent of the funds authorized that is a terrible message to send to our school children and teachers look at health care the republican budget contains no meaningful proposal to address the problem of the 41 million americans who have no health insurance apparently the republican budget proposes to leave this problem to future congresses and generations how about domestic security the republicans proposed budget ignores many of the needs outlined by the agency heads at the unitedstates customs service the coast guard the department of energy and elsewhere they have said they need far more resources to meet the threat than what is proposed in the republican budget so what have the house republicans proposed what is their top domestic priority another huge tax cut that overwhelmingly benefits the super wealthy uke the president the house republicans have decided that the most pressing domestic problemthe one issue that cannot wait is that the super wealthy are paying too much in taxes that comes on the heels of the 1 4 trillion tax cut from 2001 that disproportionately benefits the very wealthy and what will be the result of the republican tax cut plan directed mostly to the wealthy even administration officials have conceded that it will do vittually nothing to stimulate the economy right row the real result will be rivers of red ink and rising interest rates the republican plan would result in a 324 billion deficit this year and lead to one of the sharpest reversals in americas fiscal fortunes in history and that doesnt even include one penny of the cost of the ongoing war with iraq and its aftermath the presidents policies would take us from a projected 5 6 trillion surplus over 10 years to a projected 2 1 trillion deficit the republican budget committee proposal masks these longterm deficits by calling for huge and unrealistic cuts the actual result of their tax cut proposals will be exploding deficits whos going to pick up the tab for this growing mountain of debt the american people of course its simple there are only two ways to deal with it in the long run either we substantially raise taxes on the next generation or we dramatically cut the areas of largest expendituresocial security and medicare already funds from the social security trust fund are going to pay for the presidents last round of tax cuts remember that lock box well the lock has been picked and the raid is on the republican budget plan makes the problem even worse it is a guided missile aimed at the heart of social security and its not just money in the trust fund that will be lost we will also lose the trust of the american people so i am very concerned with the reckless economic course proposed in the republican budget it does exactly what the president said in his state of the union that he does not want to doit ignores our very real current needs and passes on the burdens of huge tax cuts to social security medicare and future congresses and generations i believe the republican budget plan is out of touch with the true hopes and aspirations of the american people we have an obligation to confront our needs squarely now we need to talk straight to the american people the democratic budget alternatives we are debating tonight all reflect the values and priorities of the american people better than the republican plan they correct the serious defects in the proposed republican budget all of them provide a great national investment in education health care homeland security and prescription drug coverage for seniors and they all do so without running up the huge deficits and debt contained in the republican plan one shortcoming in the democratic plans however is thatalthough they all provide a greater investment in our childrens education than the republican proposal none of them reach the full level of funding promised in the leave no child behind legislation full funding for leave no child behind idea and the other educational commitments we have made must be a top priority i will continue to press for a budget that keeps all the prom ses we have made americas children while i am disappointed that the democratic alternatives do not provide for full funding of these educational commitments they come far closer than the republican proposal they also meet many other needs that are neglected in the republican budget i hope this congress will adopt an economic plan and a budget that reflects the true priorities of the american people and does not pass the buck to future generations"], [3.552436828613281e-05,

for the wealthy those who are obsessed with the cause often cannot absorb enough information or focus on new emerging challenges this republican budget is the price inflicted on the american people by the republican obsession with tax cuts for the wealthy one enormous emerging challenge is the bleeding of the american manufacturing jobs overseas this administration has no plan to save american jobs we have lost 3 million private sector jobs in 3 years business investment is down longterm unemployment is up so how do the republicans respond to this emerging crisis of job loss in this country this budget will follow president bushs proposed cuts in job training the presidents proposed cuts in vocational education the presidents proposed cuts in sba programs including a microloan program that has been very important and effective in my state we will force a 60 percent reduction in the manufacturing extension partnership which is there to try to help manufacturers startup manufacturers get a foothold in this economy and this republican budget at a time of economic crisis in this country will pull the rug out from under small businesses who are trying once again to start up and compete globally in manufacturing all of this to protect tax cuts for people in this country who earn 1 million a year it is unbelievable and outrageous that they would do this back in my home state of maine my state legislature my governor are struggling with the impact of medicaid medicaid is very tough to maintain and this republican budget will lead to medicaid reductions this republican budget will make the economic plight of our state much worse than it is today and why are we going down this path because we cannot possibly even consider according to the republican majority a refusal to continue these tax cuts for the wealthiest people in america this is the most distorted sense of priorities that i can imagine and as i said before this is the price inflicted on the american people by the failure of this congress to be honest with the numbers that were proposed and put forward in its tax cut last year this republican budget will do no good for the american people by contrast the

underfunding our health care education and homeland security or borrowing from our retirement and leaving the bill for our children i have all of these wishes but simply wishing will not make it so our job is to listen to the american people as they talk about their needs and their desires and then set and fund our nations priorities our job is to keep our homeland safe and our job is to protect our freedom and liberty the war in iraq is the wrong priority conducted in the wrong way at the wrong time we all were shocked and horrified by the attacks of september 11 all americans faced a new sense of vulnerability one that could find them here at home out of the blue it was natural foi us to be afraid our reaction as americans was to demand action our reaction as national leaders was to act to confront the threat and protect our homeland all americans were united in the desire to seek justice by finding and punishing the perpetrators of september 11 the world came together in solidarity with our loss working with us to find the perpetrators to break up a qaeda arrest its leaders and to interrupt the flow of money to terrorists it should have been crystal clear that fighting terrorism and protecting american security would require friends and allies cooperation not confrontation yet the bush administration instead engaged in a singledminded drive to achieve its iraq objectives at any cost instead of developing a policy to deal with iraq by working with our allies and the entire world community it is particularly troubling that the very rationale used by the bush administration to try to win the endorsement of the united nations security council the urgent threat of iraqs use of weapons of mass destructioncannot now be verified some in the bush administration have even suggested that the imminent threat of wmds was not the main reason for the war the shifting justifications for war and the lack of wmd evidence undermines unitedstates credibility around the world if the intelligence that colin powell brought before the u n security council now appears inaccurate how will future intelligence presented by the unitedstates be received will it be believed throughout our history the united states has been viewed by the world as a beacon of freedom and a pillar of democratic principle following the devastation of world war ii the united states showed tremendous leadership as we created international institutions and a framework of intemational law to prevent war and to sustain and maintain peace we were the leaders in promoting a world where conflicts could be resolved peacefully and cooperatively while never perfect this system of intemational institutions has been remarkably effective the united states was seen as a constructive force in the world right now we are seen by many as a destructiveforce in the world that is not the vision for america that i have and it is not the vision that americans have many around the worid are shocked and dismayed by the unilateral confrontational approach that the bush administration has taken in the world arena i share their concern we must recognize the consequences in the world community of our rejection of kyoto of the international criminal court of the treaty to ban land mines our failure to ratify the nuclear test ban treaty and the convention to end all forms of discrimination against women and our own withdrawal from the abm treaty we must be mindful about how our criticism of the un and nato are heard throughout the world community calling longtime allies old europe is terribly counterproductive the war in iraq is seen against this larger backdrop i stand here today to urge this president and this congress to return to our tradition of constructiveness rather than destructiveness we should be builders rather than destroyers before the war started i wrote to president bush asking a series of questions concerning possible unitedstates military engagement in iraq one question asked was what is the exit strategy and how do we know when the campaign has successfully concluded i still have not received an answer to this critical question nor have the american people in may the president dramatically declared an end to major combat operations in iraq it may have made compelling television but nearly 170 000 american troops are still in iraq or the immediate region facing attacks and wondering when they are coming home no doubt they are doing the best they can to carry out their mission all americans should be proud of their dedication hard work and professionalism we must give our troops every tool they need to protect their safety as well as provide them with every possible comfort during their incredible service in this military campaign the problem is that the military campaign continues with no end in sight since the end of major combat operations the bush administration has been reacting to events and improvising it is becoming apparent that they still do not have a plan and they should have had a plan prior to the war most experts were saying that military conquest was the easy part rebuilding the peace was the challenge while i am very critical of the rosy scenarios painted by the defense department purposely spread to allay the concerns of americans about the costs and consequences of war the real problem here is the lack of leadership it is unacceptable to claim that events in iraq could not have been anticipated it is simply not true that the extent of damage to the electrical and water systems in iraq were unknown prior to the war the united nations conducted a detailed assessment of iraqs infrastructure which clearly delineated the problems and the requirements for repair and rebuilding the report was unheeded there was planning for a postsaddam hussein iraq the state department organized the future of iraq project that brought together exiled iraqis to develop detailed plans for iraqs economy security and governance a series of working groups completed these comprehensive plans so what happened to the recommendations of the future of iraq project the first civilian in charge of postwar iraq reconstruction general jay garner has said publicly that he was instructed to ignore those proposals it should be no surprise that so many american troops are still in iraq attempting to maintain order and begin reconstruction of iraqi society army chief of staff eric shinseki testified to congress that several hundred thousand soldiers would be needed for a year or more what did deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz say about general shinsekis estimate he testified that it was wildly off the mark it should be no surprise that the costs of the war and reconstruction are running far higher than suggested by the administration when asked about the likely cost of a war with iraq thenchairman of the white house council of economic advisors lawrence lindsay said it would cost between 100 million and 200 million budget director mitch daniels and economic advisor glenn hubbard immediately said the cost would be much less if we approve this 87 billion request well be approaching 140 million so far and with no plan there is no end in sight my heart is heavy today because the president of the united states is coming to this congress and asking us to appropriate 87 billion to a policy without a plan and a military commitment without an exit strategy the american people have so many questions about our mission in iraq but they have received so few answers i have no doubt that there has been progress in iraq our servicemen and women are working hard to restore security in the streets nobid contractors are working on the electrical system and water treatment facilities i have heard from iraqis that progress is being made but i have also heard their fears and concerns despite our best efforts too many streets are unsafe for women to walk along jobs are scarce leaving people with few options to earn a living gas lines are long and telecommunications are mostly inoperable the problem in iraq isnt that the stories of our successes are not getting out in american media the problem is were not making progress fast enough no pr campaign will fix the electrical system purify the water make the streets safe restore oil production reconstitute a representative iraqi government create jobs restore hope or bring our troops home any sooner failure to convey a positive message is not the problem the policy or rather lack of policy is the problem emblematic of the policy failure is the 87 billion emergency supplemental spending request submitted by the bush administration it contained essential funds to support our men and women involved in the military campaign but even that amount was insufficient in crucial areas like bulletproof vests and spare parts for bradley fighting vehicles and humvees at the same time the administration requested 400 million to construct two new prisons at a cost of 50 000 per bed 20 million for a fourweek business course at 10 000 per student 100 million to enroll 100 fiveperson families in a witness protection program at a cost of 200 000 per person 100 million to finance 500 experts to investigate crimes against humanity at a cost of 200 000 per person 9 million to create zip codes and 4 million to create area codes 100 million to build seven new model communities and 900 million to import petroleum products like kerosene and diesel to one of the largest oil producing nations in the worid the need to import millions of dollars of petroleum products to iraq speaks volumes about how poorly the administration of postwar iraq was planned officials did not expect oil refineries and pipelines to be sabotaged or unitedstates troops to be continually ambushed their revenue projections for iraqi oil production were off the mark deputy secretary wolfowitz testified that oil revenues could bring in between 50 and 100 billion over thecourse of the next two or three years now we know that this year the revenues are only going to be a few billion dollars today defense department comptroller dov zakheim told the house budget committee that revenues are now projected at 31 billion for the next two years even if these oil revenues are achieved it will not all be available for reconstruction since a large portion will need to be used for essential govemment services like police health care education and transportation i am glad that the house appropriations committee dropped many of the most outrageous spending items requested by the administration however i still have major concerns about how much of the reconstruction funds will be used it is impossible to evaluate whether or not or how much money is needed in each area iraqs needs are great it is a country that has gone years under a brutal dictatorship and subject to debilitating international sanctions by virtue of being the occupying power under international law the united states is responsible for what happens in iraq we have no choice but to meet our legal responsibility beyond legal requirements we have a moral obligation to help iraq rebuild as new york times columnist thomas friedman has said you break it you buy it by unilaterally attacking iraq we have assumed the task of ensuring it is reconstructed i hope that the administration will succeed at the international donors conference later this month iraq needs more help than the united states alone can provide debts owed by iraq taken out by saddam hussein should be forgiven rebuilding iraq will be hard enough without large debt payments to wealthy countries absorbing iraqs oil revenues in deciding to go to war in iraq with few international allies the bush administration has left the united states in a very difficult situation and with a very large financial obligation it should be no surprise that those nations that never supported our war with iraq remain at this juncture unwilling to pay for rebuilding it because of iraqs great need i hope that other countries will reconsider and provide the iraqi people with the generosity they so desperately need the administration has come back to congress for 87 billion on top of the 62 3 billion we previously appropriated it is difficult for those of us who opposed the presidents decision to attack iraq to now give the administration a blank check a downpayment on an occupation without an exit strategy and a rebuilding fund without a real plan based on the administrations track record this funding request is just the tip of the iceberg recently ambassador paul bremer who is the unitedstates administrator for iraq said the country would need 100 billion for rebuilding efforts only 20 billion of that is included in the presidents current 87 billion request for emergency funding since current estimates of likely foreign contributions total a few billion dollars at best there are huge bills coming due just a short way down the road the bill we have before us today is inadequate in so many ways i think that this house could have significantly improved the bill many of my colleagues proposed amendments that if considered would have improved the bill the bill could have been improved in many ways but there are two changes that i believe are essential first the bill should require a detailed report from the president describing how funds in the previous war supplemental have been spent how funds appropriated in this bill will be spent and the level and types of funding needed for future years for both military and reconstruction activities second the bill should require that congress be notified of noncompetitive contracting require a report from the general accounting office on accountability and tighten public disclosure requirements the initial iraq reconstruction contracts were issued without a standard competitive bidding process these contracts went to firms closely connected with the bush administration one large contract went to brown root kellogg a subsidiary of halliburton the company formerly headed by the vice president cheney the halliburton nobid contract was worth an initial 948 million because of this contract halliburton has a competitive advantage over other businesses during future rounds of bidding another large contract was awarded to bechtel a company that is lead by former officials from the first bush administralon we need to make sure that every cent of the 20 billion for iraq reconstruction is awarded fairly and openly what is wrong with the house voting on these and other amendments i wish someone would tell us unfortunately the republican house leadership used procedural roadblocks to prevent debate on most of these altematives and improvements the administration is going to get the bill they wanted with few amendments requirements or limitations i believe it is a mistake to reward their previous poor estimates bad planning withholding of information and refusal to provide cost estimates with a blank check now it is time for some accountability as i said earlier the iraq supplemental must be considered within the context of our national priorities we do not have unlimited funds to spend with our federal budget in deficit every dollar we spend in iraq is money that we are borrowing from our children even under the most optimistic scenario for iraq in which this is the last request for funding we will add 178 billion to our nations budget deficit of that 178 billion 66 billion will be interest payments on that debt a more realistic scenario in which our military remains in iraq until the end of 2006 we draw down our force over that period and we spend an additional 5 billion for reconstruction would add 238 billion to the debt 84 billion just in interest its almost surreal to live in a time when our budget deficit is growing by leaps and bounds the wealthiest 1 percent of americans get massive tax cuts in the midst of economic difficulties and now this huge unpaid bill is being amassed in iraq we have very real domestic priorities that need to be addressed we must get our people back to work we must provide funding for no child left behind we must to take care of our veterans we must protect our homeland each of their priorities requires resources the situation in iraq does not mean that we should not move forward at home this administration spends a lot of time talking about fiscal discipline yet they have spent more than any administration in our nations history instead of fiscal discipline and instead of providing funding for our nations key priorities they squandered our budget surplus and continue to amass greater and greater debt to pay for tax cuts that we cannot afford this does not serve our nation well our funding priorities must include protecting our brave servicemen and women in iraq and taking care of their families back home with hazard pay and other tools to make the separation easier to bear this supplemental bill only takes modest steps to help them i opposed authorizing the use of force in iraq i urged the president to not use that authority after it was gronted by congress this is not a war that i support putting tens of billions of dollars into an inadequate plan with no end in sight makes no sense i cannot in good conscience vote for this supplemental spending bill what i suggest is that the administration go back to the drawing board and work to develop a real plan with iraqis the united nations and other countries after we have a real plan with better cost estimates the president can come back to us with a detailed proposal i strongly support our troops we must ensure they have the resources they need it is fortunate that a vote against this bill will not harm our troops an analysis by the congressional research service estimates that already appropriated funds will last until at least early april 2004 that is plenty of time for this administration to regroup figure out what they are doing and return to congress with a better proposal my vote today will be cast with a heavy heart but i cast it with confidence that it is the best vote to serve our country"]], "top_incorrect": [[0.9900702964514494, 0.009929703548550606, 1, "i ask

involving aircrafts and aircraft engines it lowers the risk to financial lenders and manufacturers alike to engage in new markets to put it simply passage of the cape town treaty will help americal companies compete in foreign markets it puts manufacturers in the situation to compete for foreign contracts for example the boeing 717 built in my district of long beach california would benefit from the leasing requirements negotiated in this treaty this translates into jobs and economic activity locally the boeing 717 plant in long beach employs 3 000 men and women and the plant also contracts with 320 suppliers currently the 717 plant produces one plane a month i have been told however that this plant is capable of producing 60 planes a year if the 717 plant were to double their production to 24 planes a year that would translate to upwards of 400 jobs created in long beach i thank the gentleman from alaska"], [0.00034937262535095215, 0.49965062737464905, 0, "i yield myself such time as

arizona from the republican side are doing i want to explain as to some of the speeches i have heard tonight this is an effort i go back myself i hate to talk about myself but for 2 years i have been trying to get this death gratuity tax removed in fairness to the leadership both democrat and republican we have passed to the senate five times over 2 years a bill a larger bill than this bill that would have removed the death gratuity and also some of the other issues that would have been fair to our military as it relates to tax fairness that the gentleman from texas my fiend mentioned i do not know about the recent bill but the bills that we passed in the last five times in the last 2 years would have accomplished some of these considerations for our men and women in uniform i just want to mention very quickly that this year and i want to thank the gentleman from massachusetts my bill dealt with removing the death gratuity 2 years ago but it was 6 000 that was the cap on the death gratuity amount i am glad that the mcgovern bill and the renzi bill both move it up to 12 000 it is what it should be but for me when i started this effort 2 years ago i say to the gentleman from texas it dealt with eliminating the death gratuity tax so again i want to say that i am pleased tonight that we are all both republican and democrat believing that the military tax fairness bill that has been sent over a few months ago has not been taken up by the senate side and i do not know the status on this side of a second bill"], [0.0011046528816223145, 0.5011046528816223, 1, "any potential changes to the vietnam memorial or any of these magnificent memorials on our national mall must be considered very carefully the wall is an incredibly powerful tool for reconciliation and healing as we have heard and as i have heard from many of my constituents it is also a permanent record of sacrifice and loss millions of americans feel a deep and personal connection to the wall and we in congress are its stewards in this instance a visitor center would allow the national park service and the vietnam veterans memorial fund to provide visitors to this wall a context that might further their understanding of the war for many visitors the list of over 50 000 names inscribed on black granite is certainly moving but their personal understanding of and connection to the events surrounding the conflict is very limited a small underground visitor center would become an a powerful tool in expanding visitors connection with the memorial and its subject matter certainly there is more work to be done even after this legislation is enacted how best to design and construct the center so that it will not intrude upon the wall itself or any other memorial on the mall as well as how best to fund staff and maintain the center must all be explored however development of this legislation has become a cooperative process as we have heard and the bill contains certain provisions that will provide guidance on each of these issues as the process of establishing the center moves forward once completed the vietnam memorial visitor center will be a welcome and informative addition to our national mall the gentleman from california the gentleman from west virginia and all the cosponsors of h r 1442 are to be commended for their efforts on this important legislation in addition the contributions of the administration and the vietnam veterans memorial fund were vital during this process i urge my colleagues to support h r 1442 as amended i reserve the balance of my time"]]}
