admonition is being fully practiced by our friends of the republican side of the aisle that is exactly by the way what their position was in 1977 when the gentleman from wisconsin a foresightful gentleman who has already spoken at some length and with eloquence brought before this body a similar concept of an administrator it was sponsored by the way by our speaker the gentleman from washington and it was opposed unanimously by the republicans they took the same position then that they take today and that is that they do not want to share in the burden or the blame of running this institution and why should they they are the minority the minoritys job is to become the majority and they use every opportunity they have to win that battle i think we understand that perhaps some of us on this side do not understand it as well as others maybe we have not served in the minority capacity in prior legislative service some of us have i think we all understand that we get as much as we can in negotiation and if we do not get a little more we come back and try again i understand the strategy of our minority here i think we dealt in good faith with people on this task force who were never in position really to make the kind of deal that was acceptable in the middle of a legislative session to the majority given the temperature in the republican conference it certainly was not likely that any sort of compromise would be readily agreed to there that is why legislative bodies deal with these issues at the beginning of a session i think it is most important that we understand that the gentleman from washington speaker folzy and the leadership of the democrats in this house of representatives have embraced publicly the hamiltongradison proposal that would study needed reforms because within it lies perhaps the outlines of some changes in the way this institution functions and i believe in the content of the incoming congress which is going to be a volatile institution those suggestions may well be in some form brought before us for adoption but had we had the foresight in 1977 to have the kind of administrative structure in place that we did not have in recent months we could well have avoided problems in our governance we would not be embarrassed as some of us are we would not be seeing some of our better members on both sides of the aisle throwing

honor a great pennsylvanian and a great american john heinz he was an outstanding senator and i think we all recognize that he was an extraordinary american those members who served with him from pennsylvania i think also recognize that he was an enormously effective champion of and advocate for the commonwealth of pennsylvania since his tragic death a few weeks ago it is really almost impossible to describe the almost universal sense of grief that has taken hold of the people of the state he was loved and admired by people from all walks of life all political persuasions liberals and conservatives young and old it really ran the gamut i do not believe i have found any person who really felt hostile toward john heinz because i think he was recognized as being someone who fought for pennsylvania all the time he took leadership as has been mentioned here he took strong leadership roles in many areas of public policy the area that i think is most often alluded to certainly the senior citizens the older americans of this country owe a great deal to john heinz who was tireless in working for their best interests and working for their concerns and focusing the attention of the american people on the concerns of the elderly and his role as chairman of the committee on aging in the senate and later as the ranking member i think he had a continuity of interest in that issue which is another thing that needs to be said about john heinz he was not a person who grabbed an issue milked it for publicity and moved on he stuck with the issues when he took an interest in something he stayed with it to the conclusion i think that the other thing i would stress again where he was a spokesman on on many national issues and very effective spokesman on the issues he was really a premier promoter of pennsylvania who worked with great skill to advance the interests of pennsylvania i had an opportunity to learn about the persistence that dedication firsthand back in 1976 at which time i was serving as chief counsel for the economic development administration when a new piece of legislation called the local public works act was passed i was asked to come down to the senate office building to meet with senator heinz at that time it was on a saturday morning and john wanted to find out what that bill was about how pennsylvania could get the maximum advantage and we spent 5 hours going through the regulations going through the law so that john understood very very clearly exactly what he needed to do to be sure that pennsylvania was going to be taken care of going to be well served by that piece of legislation in fact he was so thorough in his examination of me that the regulations which i had actually written there were a couple of times he stumped me on what they actually meant he used to kid me about that ever after that time he was a good friend to me a good friend to practically all members he campaigned as he did for me and as he did for other members as i suspect for most republicans in the delegation he campaigned for all members he certainly knew pennsylvania and its people exceptionally well he was very very close to thousands of pennsylvanians and he listened to people that was another important aspect of john heinz we politicians are often said to talk too much and not to listen john heinz was a listener that was one of his great strengths he did not listen to just people of his own social class he did not listen just to pittsburghers where he was from or philadelphians the major cities but he listened to people all across the commonwealth he listened to people from bradford bellefonte emlenton and tidloute in my district and small towns and hamlets across the state he listened and absorbed he took what he heard and translated it into legislation oftentimes but certainly into a program that benefited the commonwealth of pennsylvania and the nation many have pointed out here today that john heinz came from a family of great wealth that he could indeed have opted to pursue a life of privilege a life of leisure instead he opted for a life of publ ic service with all that entailed which it does entail certainly the rough and tumble of politics we are not going to be all universally loved we will be criticized we will have to take tough decisions and defend them joan heinz was willing to do that he lived a life of public service and i think because of that pennsylvania because of his selection to live a life of public service pennsylvania and this nation are fortunate indeed that he did i join with all members here today in extending our deep condolences to the family as my colleague mr mcdade said i think all members recognized in the sons of joirn heinz who spoke at the very moving and very profound funeral service that was held in pittsburgh that all of the sons reflect a bit of john heinz we have not heard that last of the heinz name in public service and in contributions to this

unitedstates congress to fight for the economic interests of the people of pennsylvania to protect the environment to create more affordable housing opportunities and to improve the lives of senior citizens his causes were noble and his commitment was genuine john heinz excelled at everything he did he was in the top 10 percent of his class at harvard business school he was a master politician who never lost an election he was elected to the unitedstates senate three times each time with a higher margin he was an outstanding athlete he was an expert on 16th and 17th century european art he left his legislative mark on countless public laws dealing with such diverse subjects as trade health insurance tax reform the environment and age discrimination it is rare when a man of such

contributions as a public servant we mourn his death but are grateful that we were able to know such a remarkable man at his funeral senator john danforth of missouri reminded us that the life of a christian is represented by the act of giving typified by the father giving his son for our redemption senator heinz represented that christian attitude through a life of giving through public service
