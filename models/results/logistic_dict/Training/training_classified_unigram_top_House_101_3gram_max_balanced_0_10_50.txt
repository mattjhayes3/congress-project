rights guaranteed that all americans are created equal today more than 25 years since the passage of the 1964 civil rights act we will be passing the americans with disabilities act we will thus ensure that persons with disabilities are finally granted the same equal protection of the laws enjoyed by all other americans this action by the congress is long over due the discrimination which disabled americans and their families historically have faced has resulted in shattered dreams of untold numbers of people yes discrimination the supreme court in the 1985 alexander versus choate decision said discrimination against the handicapped was perceived by congress to be most often the product not of invidious animus but rather of thoughtlessness indifference and of benign neglect it is not the malicious violent ugly discrimination experienced on account of ones race national origin or religion but the barriers society has erected and our tolerance of them has resulted in denial of opportunities the rest of us take for granted and the types of discrimination faced by disabled people are pervasivemore pervasive and extensive than i could have imagined we take for granted activities of daily living denied many disabled americans imagine living every day of your life not being able to get out of your home because of steps not being able to go to the bathroom alone because the door is too narrow not being able to call a friend because you are deaf and there is no relay service not being able to operate an elevator because the floors were not marked in braille not being able to go to stores for fear of being denied entrance because you have cerebral palsy not being able to get on a bus because it is not accessible being afraid to apply for a job because you have experienced discrimination but had no way of redressing it the americans with disabilities act acknowledges that these denials of opportunities have been unjust and must no longer be tolerated today more than 66 percent of working age persons with disabilities in our country are unemployed they are unemployed for many reasons inaccessible public transportation inaccessible work facilities and pervasive job discrimination the americans with disabilities act will help put an end to this staggering unnecessary problem for the past year much attention has focused on the cost of meeting such standards as reasonable accommodation and readily accessible but what of the costs of continuing to be indifferent to the denial of opportunities experienced by 43 million disabled americans we pay more than 60 billion a year to disabled people who are not working yet polls tell us 80 percent of persons with disabilities who are not working believe they are capable of working and want to work the disabled know that the obstacles they face are not inherent in their disabilities car the cost of any reasonable accommodation compare to what we are paying to keep qualified people unemployed this bill was introduced in 1988 it has passed the senate and gone through four committee hearings on the house side this bill has been debated exhaustively the president and his staff have worked toward the passage of this monumental piece of legislation the civil rights community labor womens organizations the religious community disabled people their friends families and advocates have fought for the passage of this bill leaders on both sides of the aisle have worked long and hard on the provisions of this legislation the americans with disabilities act deserves to pass it will rectify many of the wrongs that have been committed against americans with disabilities it will at long last enable people to become contributory members of our society ada will also help to end the fears people have of becoming disabled we will finally see that it is not disability which limits ones ability to participate in life but it is societal barriers this bill aims at opening up opportunities for all persons with disabilities at the same time the bill does not put an undue burden on employers businesses or the community at large it strikes a balance i understand that there are concerns from the business community that the bill goes too far and from the disabled community that the bill does not go far enough the responsibility of tfxc congress is to ensure the protection if the rights of disabled people and to ensure that the community at large ii not unduly financially burdened thiz bill does just that not all will be happy but i know that we have reached a balance for justice the disabled only seek the same opportunities as all other americans we acknowledge the barriers we have tolerated it will take time but full implementation of the americans with disabilities act will also result in society no longer seeing the needs of persons with disabilities as special ramps door width braille will become part of all our lives as we no longer consider accessibility as special we cannot help but increase the selfworth of the disabled this bill will help guarantee the rights of disabled people to live anywhere they choose in this country with the knowledge that they will be treated equally under the law one will be able to go the movies eat in a restaurant shop in a store get a job stay in a hotel use the telephone system and use transportation in any state in the union disabled people will know that should fear and prejudice result in the denial of equal opportunity they will be protected the americans with disabilities act will tell children with disabilities young adults and seniors who acquire a disability that they should not be ashamed they should not fear coming out of their homes and into their communities we as a society will no longer permit actions that cause people to be treated as secondclass citizens because they have a disability this is important for disabled people to know this is important for our nondisabled children and adults to know weas americanswill no longer tolerate discriminationbenign or overtagainst persons with disabilities in closing credits are due the signifi cant efforts of the

what is the connection logically if there is one between the elections being held in november and the flag the flag does not belong to the election process in fact to politicize the flag to me is as bad as to burn the flag it seems to me that we desecrate the flag in a number of ways and burning it only one of them for pollticans to use the flag as a cheap means of glorifying themselves and that is as much a desecration of the flag as anything else what has the november election to do with this flagburning amendment and with the flag protection act i suggest nothing except someone wants to use it for political purposes in the november election that to me is desecration of the flag we set a poor example for the people in this country when we politicize the flag the flag is not the

parenthetically that i think one of the most important things that we do is to perform oversight i think we have really two basic duties one is to legislate and the other is to oversight the government operations committee is the oversight committee of the house of representatives even though most of the committees do have oversight subcommittees but their oversight is within the jurisdiction of the committee our oversight is administrationwide we cover all the agencies the special agencies the regulatory agencies that is a very important function one of the most important things we did years ago was to establish the general accounting office which is very helpful in helping us to fight waste fraud and abuse then more recently the gentleman from texas and i authored legislation to create inspectors general the committee on government operations passed that legislation and now we have inspectors general in all of the federal agencies making reports to the committee on government operations that also is a very important tool in this oversight function the office of management and budget was established and the mmanagementis a very important function that management function has not been carried out like it should be carried out that is what the substance of this bill is about today i want to commend the gentleman from michigan mr conyeasl for his cooperation we have had some differences and i will explain those differences and what we have worked out in this bill this could be one of the most important bills that we pass in this session of the congress for most of the last 2 years members and staff of the government operations committee have conducted detailed research into the financial management structure of our federal government they have studied the foundations of the management morass which currently exists throughout the departments and agencies some very spectacular breakdowns in management are by now very well knownthe hud scandal and the savings and loan mess are two examples but waste fraud and abuse goes on every day in our vast government this waste occurs because of a lack of effective management organization in the executive branch and a real absence of accurate and timely management information which would help us in that function the bill before us today is designed to set up a structure and a set of disciplines which would help remedy these problems i believe that the bill could go even further than it does in the matter of statements and audits but i do look upon this bill as an important first step in the right direction it is high time for financial management legislation i would also like to point out that the bill which is offered here as an amendment in the nature of a substitute is quite different from the bill which was passed out of the committee on government operations last month many changes have been made some rather fundamental therefore the report which accompanies h r 5687 does not necessarily reflect the committees present understanding of several sections of the present bill and certainly does not reflect mine which i will explain later the bill creates the position of deputy director for management at a very high level executive level 2 within the office of management and budget this individual will function as the governments chief financial management officer below this position would be an office of federal financial management headed by an executive level 3 controller who would be the deputy directors own deputy in the cabinet departments and in eight independent agencies the act would create chief financial officers who would report to their agency heads and be responsive to the management direction of the omb deputy director there are appropriate qualification requirements in the bill for each of these positions assuring that these individuals will possess competence as well as clout the other major feature of this bill is the series of reporting requirements that it contains two are especially crucial first the omb would report each year to congress with a comprehensive 5year plan for management activities and reform second the bill would institute the statutory requirement that by the end of 1991 agencies issue yearly audited financial statements for those portions of agency business involving revolving funds trust funds or commerciallike activity also six specific agencies with experience in this area would be required to issue comprehensive agencywide statements by the end of 1991 as part of a pilot project congress would receive a series of reports on how those statements and audits are working and vote by the end of 1993 on whether the statementand audit regime can proceed on a comprehensive basis throughout government there is a provision in the bill which would assure that this vote would be taken i understand that the administration has problems with this bill because it does not immediately create a regime of comprehensive agencywide financial statements i share this concern and my own choice would be to put comprehensive statements and audits in statute this is why h r 5492 which i introduced in august contained such provisions i am satisfied though that the slower approach of this bill h r 5687 is based on a defensible premise in drafting this bill and in hearings that our committee held last month the gentleman from michigan and i became aware that adequate accounting standards necessary to create meaningful audited financial statements did not exist at this time for a large percentage of government activity the omb acknowledges this and recently signed a memorandum of understanding with the treasury department the general accounting office and other agencies to create an accounting standards advisory board i believe as a practical matter that until standards are developed for noncommercial government activity the federal government has better uses for its scarce resources than spending them on audits of those areas on a widespread basis because of this situation i would ask the administration to consider the invitation to work within a more gradual and mea sured schedule especially since the alternative is probably no schedule at all on the other hand it has always been my belief that omb can administratively do what it wants in internal executive branch management according to my understanding of constitutional law the bill does not and can not change that if passed into law this bill could not prohibit such activities as financial statements and audits in the agencies however such activity would have greater clout and effectiveness with a statutory backing which is what this bill is all about the administrations statement of position lists a few other provisions of this bill with which it disagrees since this statement was written several of these concerns have been completely accommodated specifically the bill would no longer create a 4year term for the omb controller nor would it require the accounting standards study furthermore the description of the deputy director for management as the chief financial officer of the united states has been changed to chief financial management officer of the united states we believe that these changes indicate congress desire to work with the administration in this important area through all the recent fussing and fighting about revenue enhancers and spending cuts which kept us here until the wee hours of several mornings and earned us the scorn of our constituents i heard very little about a third option cutting waste h r 5687 provides an opportunity for congress to allow the federal government to shine light into some of the dark corners where waste fraud and abuse occur i would ask this house to finally turn the light on and support this bill again i want to commend the gentleman from michigan for his willingness to cooperate to bring this bill to the floor so we can get it through and hopefully get it signed into law before this congress recesses i have no further requests for time and i yield back the balance of my time"], [7.456541061401367e-05,
