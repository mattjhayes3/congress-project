vast majority of our constituents want us to do something about preventing more gun violence in this country mass shootings have become unacceptably commonplace in the united states of america and we have a responsibility to do more to keep guns out of the wrong hands the shooting in orlando was the largest mass shooting in our countrys history this is a moment of truth and we cannot have another moment of silence without some action we are pleading with the speaker of the house and we are pleading with our republican colleagues to allow us to bring two bipartisan bills to the floor for consideration so that we can debate them and vote on them one is the no fly no buy legislation if you are too dangerous to fly on an airplane because you are on the terrorist watch list according to the fbi then you are too dangerous to buy a gun it shouldnt be controversial the second is to eliminate the loopholes in our background check system which says that you have to go through a background check if you go to a licensed gun dealer but that you can get around that by going to a gun show or by buying a gun online overwhelming numbers of democrats and republicans according to the latest public opinion polls think both of these ideas are smart commonsense approaches the only thing that is standing in the way is the republican leadership in this house please schedule these bills for a vote no we will not be satisfied with the nra bill that you want to bring to the floor this week that basically is nothing but a press release but will not keep guns out of the hands of people who are
