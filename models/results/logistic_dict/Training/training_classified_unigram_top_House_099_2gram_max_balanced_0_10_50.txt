face with the war against freedom being waged by the soviet union and its communist allies i want to focus on two major areas one is the gorbachev propaganda offensive trying to set the stage for geneva it is an attempt to create an environment in which there will be more pressure on president reagan to appease the soviet union than there has been in any western leader since neville chamberlain went to munich in 1938 in addition to talking about the gor bachev offensive and what i think is the correct american response to that propaganda offensive i want to talk about recent developments in central america and in particular the ways in which the nicaraguan communists are threatening costa rica i also want to talk about the ways in which as the el salvadoran communists find they are unable to win they are reverting to terrorism in their efforts to defeat the government of el salvador let me first talk about the gorbachev peace offensive the fact is that marxistleninist parties in particular led by lenins own writings are very oriented to psychological intellectual warfare they think that words are very very important one of the reasons why in most communist countries there is a dramatic increase in education as soon as a communist government takes over is because they regard education as the key to brainwashing the population they believe that brainwashing that teaches people the right words is the key to controlling people in the long run so it is natiiral for a communist government to think that a psychological political offensive is a part of warfare indeed unlike the west if you study leninist warfare or soviet warfare manuals they have an entire section on psychological political intellectual warfare in which they have invested very heavily and in which they train a great number of people in the past i have cited from the grenada documents documents which were captured when we liberated the island of grenada documents that are based on a communist government and a communist party in grenada in those documents i have quoted examples of the very serious planning that goes into a communist government trying to mislead both the american people and the american news hedia and the careful planning which goes into propagandizing their own people it is clear from the grenada documents that there is a serious longterm communist effort to understand the american news media and to know how to manipulate it an effort to understand american church groups and to know how to manipulate them in that setting i think the gorbachev offensive is part of a long pattern of soviet willingness to lie and deceive in order to try to communicate their values in the recent time magazine interview with gorbachev there were two fascinating examples of the soviet modern techniques of manipulation the funnier of the two was a line where gorbachev was quoted as saying god in his infinite wisdom i found it fascinating here you have the leader of the communist government an avowedly atheist movement a man whose wife teaches marxist philosophy at the university of moscow cheerfully for purposes of western newsmen citing god a god which technically he cannot believe exists if he believes the teachings of lenin but because he knows that we feel comfortable with people who cite god he is perfectly willing to make us feel more comfortable second we had in the very same interview a reference which gorbachev said we would never start a war unfortunately no one on the time magazine editorial board saw fit to say to him what about afghanistan where you are currently fighting a war what about czechoslovakia which you invaded in 1968 what about hungary which you invaded in 1956 what about the occupation of the army in poland instead they passed over it allowing a communist leader with a totally straight face to say to them we of course would never start a war i promise you that one has to wonder how naive you must think americans are if you can get away with that kind of baldfaced lie since he is in the middle of fighting a war in afghanistan the pattern of this offensive is very simple we know from a variety of works of which possibly john barrons books on the kgb are the best shevchenkos work on fleeing from moscow as a soviet senior official telling us the inside story is helpful and there have been a number of other studies we know from these works that the soviet government systematically and consistently goes after the penetration of western news media a recent novel the spike is another example of that its coauthor is arnaud de borchgrave the editor of the washington times a former srnior columnist for newsweek magasine as you study these books whether they are fiction or nonfiction you learn that the kgb the soviet secret police spends a great deal of money bribing some reporters influencing some editors establishing some academic centers setting up a framework of thought it is i think fair to say that not since adolf hitler manipulated the western news media in the late 1930s have we seen an offensive designed to convince manipulate and dupe western people as sophisticated as gorbachevs current offensive what then should the correct american answer be when the new york times prints an ad paid for by the soviet embassy as it did recently should we censor that ad i do not think so when gorbachev offers to be interviewed should we stop the interview i do not think so it would be helpful if the news men were a little more tough minded if they asked better questions if they were more aggressive in crossexamination but basically if we are going to be a free society we have to allow people who are going to lie to us to tell their lies out in the open and then we have to hope that our intellectuals our news media our politicians our citizens will pay attention and learn who is telling the truth and who is lying rather than talk about censorship i would like to suggest just the opposite we have an opportunity in the third week of october to lay out for the entire world to see who the communists are and what the system is rather than arguing with gorbachev as a person or discussing whether or not his wife dresses well it seems to me far more appropriate for us to look at the underlying question of the nature of the soviet system the nature of the communist government i think there is no better time to do that than the third week of october which is the second anniversary of the liberation of grenada i think it is important for two reasons first of all the liberation of grenada was the first time that a communist government was overthrown and people regained their freedom in that sense the experience of the grenadian people now free now with a free market now with a democracy now with a free press now with freedom of religion the lesson of grenada in ceasing to be communists offers hope to people all over the world it offers hope to the afghan freedom fighters it offers hope to the nicaraguan freedom fighters it offers hope to the angolan freedom fighters it offers hope to people in poland in the ukraine in estonia in latvia in lithuania and throughout the soviet union second in liberating grenada and saving some 800 american students from possibly becoming hostages we also captured 35 000 pounds of communist documents the records of the communist government the records of the communist party so we know a great deal about grenada unfortunately because the american intellectual community is largely leftwing because it does not want to learn about communism because it does not want to study the soviet union in reality very little has been done with those documents qnly a few books have been written of which the most notable was edited by romerstein and ledeen and published by the state department as the grenada documents in addition a book by paul seabury studies the grenada documents but when one looks at all of the leftwing intellectual effort to discredit el salvador the philippines south africa chile and then you look and ask how many ph d s rush down to the national archives to look at these documents how many people have been busily studying and trying to tell us what we can learn about communism and the grenada lesson the answer sadly is very few therefore i think it is very very important that we take the third week of october the week of october 25 and we focus america on looking at the lessons of grenada and asking ourselves what do they tell us about today what do we learn about communism in grenada that teaches us about gorbachev nothing could better prepare america for geneva than to study the real nature of communism and look at the real lessons of the grenada documents that is why i urge my colleagues to cosponsor house resolution 313 which congressman iks skelton of missouri and i have introduced as a bipartisan resolution it already has over 165 cosponsors and it is designed to make the week of october 25 a week in which high schools colleges sunday schools synagogue classes civic clubs veterans groups everyone who has an interest in understanding the world we live in and the nature of communism might look at the lessons of grenada that is why i would urge every citizen to look at their own civic clubs their own classes their own opportunities to study the lessons of grenada i think it helps to get the local news media to ask the question what have we learned about communism by getting editorial writers before they interview gorbachev to study the way in which lenin has practiced the art of lying to western news media to look at the lessons of disinformation and deception as practiced by the soviet union i think that helps all of us so i would urge all of my colleagues to cosponsor house joint resolution 313 and help us make the week of october 25 a week to learn the lessons of the grenada documents i would also urge every group around america that is interested in and concerned about communism or about the survival of freedom to take the opportunity that week to study the lessons of grenada i would urge those citizens whose congressmen have not yet cosponlored that resolution to contact their congressmen and ask them to cosponsor house joint resolution 313 in addition to handling propaganda as it relates to the soviet union i think it is also interesting to look at what has been happening around the world that the american news media does not cover very aggressively there is a tendency in the american news media if an american ally does something to put it on page 1 and if a s6viet puppet does something to either not print it at all or put it on page 30 therefore i have asked that we put together some major eveits and on a weekly basis on thursday i am going to try to link together differeit news stories you may ndt have seen im going to show how they relate to the war against freedom being waged by the soviet union and its communist empire here are some examples first the communists have been linked in nicaragua to 700 costa ricans training in cuba at least 700 costa ricans linked to leftist groups have received iilitary training in cuba with assistance from the communist sandinista government of nicaragua according to costa rican deputy minister johnny campos notice that this is not a citation from an american source this is the deputy security minister of costa rica he said in a recent interview in la nacion campos broached the magnitude of local and foreign espionage in his country he also stated that this training had been going on foi 4 years he divided the espionage activities into three groups which included the involvemeht of the ortegaled communist government of nicaragua the deputy minister described the situation as dangerous and he is very concerned about it an example of what has been happening around the world the communist terrorists in el salvador are changing their behavior according to radio venceremos the communists in el salvador have again bragged about their sabotage activities for example over the fourth of july weekend the communist guerrillas carried out important sabotage against power lines in this central area of the country these power outages affected san salvador and large parts of central el salvador the broadcast also went on to boast that on july 5 guerrilla units of the julio armando climaca detachment downed three high voltage power pylons in las gorritas canton san jorges jurisdiction san miguel department we continue with more activities to sabotage the war economy of duartes government sabotage is victory i think every american needs to look at that and ask themselves these are communist guerrillas they claim that they are for the people yet their strategy as they grow weaker and are unable to field a military unit is to engage in terror and in sabotage imagine the nature of a group which would say that sabotage is victory sabotage is destruction the breaking up of the economy the destroying of jobs the wiping out of civilized amenities then when american reporters go to a major city and the power goes out because the guerrillas have successfully sabotaged the power lines instead of reporting on guerrilla brutality on the senselessness of their campaign of their unwillingness to vote instead the reporter talks about how weak the government is let me suggest that if we had guer rillas trying to knock out power lines around washington we could appreciate better the challenge to president duarte not only his daughter kidnaped by terrorists but he is faced with a guerrillamovement which as it loses the main war against his army reverts more and moreto terrorist tactics and to guerrilla warfare to the south of nicaragua costa rica finds itself increasingly in difficulty for example costa rican president luis alberto monge has said definitely that there will be no dialog between costa rica and the communist regime of nicaragua because the communist regime has refused to apologize and give explanatioi for actions to costa rica concerning their aggressions directed against his government monge referred to three separateincidents in which nicaragua waged uriprovoked attacks over its border into costa rica the events at las crucitas on may 31 when two costa rican civil guardsmen died the july 3 incident in the same area when communist troops attacked the costa rican guardsmen who were trying to recover the body of one of the slain guardsmen and the july 26 incident at barra del colorado when three communist air force planes entered costa ricas airspace and dropped bombs the point i want to make here is that of all of the countries in central america costa rica is the most peaceful the most democratic the most open costa rica disbanded its army in the late 1940s it literally has no army anymore it has been observed by one expert on central america that costa rica is the greatest danger to nicaragua precisely because itis a democratic country with a free market and a free press that means that every possible younger nicaraguan will flee to costa rica just like in western europe we see people flee from east germany to west germany from czechoslovakia to austria from hungary to austria and so forth the point this expert had made was that as long as costa rica is alive as long as it is a free country as long as it is a better place to live than nicaragua it will be an active threat to the communist government of nicaragua precisely because it drains away people here we have the president of costa rica a country which does not even have an army reporting on three incidents in which the communist government of nicaragua entered costa rican territory the costa ricans are concerned in part because as they look to the north toward el salvador they have some sense of how a country can be torn to pieces by communist guerrillas communist guerrilla commander joaquin villalobos in a statement concerning the increased terrorists use of land mines and urban terrorism has threatened more violence on the people of el salvador our aim is to convert every road into a river of blood with mines each stone into a mine and every helicopter into a coffin villalobos said in a recent rebel radio broadcast the farabundo marti liberation froit the communist terriorist organization bent on destroying the democratically elected government of president duarte is increasing its activities due to decreased support in their insurgency efforts over the past year the subversives have planted a lot of mines in the last few months because they can no longer confront armyunits directly said maj omar vaquerano an infantry battalion commander the mines are a demonstration of the subversives weakness the increase in the effectiveness of the governments efforts against the communists activities has broken up the terrorists into small pockets of subversives taking much of their support base supplied by the masas the point i want to make is this here we have communists in el salvador saying that we are going to rely on sabotage i quoted earlier sabotage is victory they have said here we have them saying their aim is to convert fvery road into a river of blood with mines each stone into a mine and every helicopter into a coffin imagine you were living in democratic costa rica that you were looking up the road to el salvador that you saw that kind of bloody viscious anticivilian guerrilla warfare sabotage and terrorism going on you can appreciate why the costa rican government the most democratic most open and decent government in central america is increasingly angry with the nicaraguans because it sees in nicaragua a country which is supporting guerrilla warfare with communists in el salvador a country which is itself a communist dictatorship and costa rica sees an increasing willingness to launch raids against them president monge in an august 13 letter to daniel ortega the communist dictator of nicaragua said that costa rica was a peaceful people and blamed nicaraguas warmongering attitude for the border crisis let me emphasize this this is the president of costa rica the neighbor of nicaragua a democratic country which does not even have an army his 117462attitude toward the communist government of nicaragua he said it was a warmongering attitude this is not ronald reagan talking this is not some rightwing republican this is the democratically elected free president of costa rica he went on to say that we costa ricans are a peaceful people and have never attacked anyone the costa rican president stated that if there is no peace in nicaragua then his nation is affected by this however monge stated costa rica is not responsible for nicaraguas peace costa rica cannot achieve or impose peace in nicaragua in clear reference to the unprovoked border aggressions launched by the marxistleninist regime monge said thatthe various border incidents on costa ricas northern border specifically the painful incident at las cructas and the violation of our national airspace by your governments military forces can be protested as acts of aggression we will not tolerate and which if repeated will force us to defend ourselves we demand a satisfactory explanation because these incidents are the result of nicaraguas warmongering attitude and of the lack of peace in nicaragua which is an issue that your government cannot evade therefore steps toward peace both inside and outside nicaragua should be taken by your government monge said he also stated that he considered nicaraguas international propaganda aimed at tarnishing costa ricas real position in relation to the nicaraguan conflict unjust and illintentioned so again we have on august 13 the president of the democratic demilitarized free costa rica complaining saying to the nicaraguan communists to let us alone quit trying to provoke us yet what happened on august 25 a communist army patrol from nicaragua was spotted by civil guard units inside costa rican territory in the boca de san carlos region marking the third unprovoked border incident within a week against this democracy according to the panama city acan report from the northern region of costa rica the sandinist peoples army patrol fired at the civil guardsmen with their rifles and the civil guardsmen fired back area residents told reporters that apparently the communists had seized a farm but then abandoned it after the clash with the costa rican public forces public security minister benjamin piza carranza has explained that a police patrol discovered the communist group in costa rican territory and for this reason obeyed the order to fire at them costa rica has no standing army he said that the civil guard remains on alert in the border area which has been the site of recent unprovoked and illegal attacks launched by the marxistleninist regime this is the third incursion the communist forces have carried out on costa rican soil in 1 week according to official reports issued by the government of president luis alberto monge on august 22 five communist aircraft violated costa rican airspace and fired shots only 24 hours after the costa rican government denounced an attack by the nicaraguan communist forces on the boca de san carlos police post these events have been unfolding during the nicaraguan socalled peace dialog propaganda campaign in other words where the nicaraguans are publicly in interviews with american television talking to american church groups they pretend they favor peace there are three times in 1 week in late august that the nicaraguan communists violated costa rica and attacked costa rica in fact things have gotten bad enough that costa rican foreign minister carlos jose gutierrez said that the interamerican reciprocal treaty might be requested if unprovoked communist border attacks continue citing that regimes expansionist objectives as a possible cause for these incidents i think that if these aggressions continue we may resort to the tiar costa rica has not done so thus far because it believes the aggressions do not meit it gutierrez said in a telephone interview with radio cadena nacional nevertheless he noted that their frequency and constant repetition might lead costa rica to resort to a step of that nature gutierrez said that the communist attacks on costa rica could have various explanations among them that the communist regime may be trying to intimidate the costa rican people this could be one of the reasons he said he explained that perhaps the attacks seek to prevent costa ricans living in the border area from continuing to express support for the antisandinists second it might be that the attacks are the result of the arrogance of the sfndinist army which wants to show its military might to its neighbors gutierrez added we also think the attacks could be part of the expansionist objectives of the nicaraguan government which does not hide its aggressive intentions with regard to the countries that border nicaragua let me make this point for all of our friends who belong to church groups that say why can there not be peace in central america here he is the foreign minister of costa rica a country which is a democracy a country which is free a country which does not even have an army all it has is a border patrol and a civil police and now what is the foreign minister of costa rica saying he said that the government of nicaragua has and i quote expanionist objectives and does not hide its aggressive intentions with regard to the countries that border nicaragua in other words the foreign minister of costa rica is trying to say to all of the world you cannot deal with the communist government of nicaragua because it is trying to expand itself nicaragua is an enemy to its neighbors and it is supporting guerrilla war what do the people of costa rica think in a poll conducted by an affiliate of the international gallup organization it was found that 89 percent of the costa rican population consider the marxistleninist regime of nicaragua a threat to peace in the region the poll which was published in the san jose daily la nacion also found that 87 percent of the population have an unfavorable opinion of the communist government in addition 63 percent said that neutrality ought not to apply if nicaragua violated the costa rican sovereignty according to the results of the survey most costa ricans approve of the way president monge is handling the nicaraguan crisis but are displeased with the way the contadora group is resolving the problems between the two nations also 83 percent of the costa ricans polled said they were confident the united states would help defend costa rica if they were invaded on a similar subject oscar aguilar presidential candidate of the national union party has said that in view of the new communist attacks against costa rican territory which were confirmed by the costa rican government the country should break diplomatic ties with the marxistleninist regime if only temporarily his statement which was on san jose radio reloj on august 22 also explained that firmness does not mean aggression but that the country cannot continue to defend the national sovereignty with protest notes that no one pays attention to i think there are two messages here for americans first of all the next time someone says to you but why do you think the nicaraguan communists are dangerous ask them if 89 percent of the free people of costa rica are scared of their neighbor should that not worry you if the folks who are down there who are natives who are local and who speak spanish who have friends in nicaragua if 89 percent of them are scared of the communist next door should not that be a sign to us that maybe they know more than the local politician or your local reporter who once spent 2 days there on a trip second what would our friends on the left do to save costa rica if in fact the communists in nicaragua are violating costa rican sovereignty i have just indicated there were three times in 1 week in august that the nicaraguan communists were occupying part or acting on parts of costa rican territory what would we do are our neighbors in fact the costa ricans right when 83 percent of them say we would help them if they were attacked by communists or are they wrong i wonder i wonder in this house how many of our more leftwing members woyld in fact find some excuse for explaining away communist aggression some way of indicating that it was really caused by costa rica even though costa rica is unarmed has no army and could not attack anyone in fact the costa rican government is considering seriously breaking relations with nicaragua costa rican foreign minister carlos jose gutierrez has said that president monge and his administration has not ruled out a break in relations with nicaragua on various occasions and in view of repeated attacks and violations of the sandinist army we have been on the verge of breaking relations with nicaragua but the situation has always been reconsidered the foreign minister said government sources say that the possibility remains considering recent territorial violations and the air attack august 21 we now have to think of more drastic measures gutierrez said he went on to say the conditions for signing the peace document do not exist and added that the tension mentioned by mexican foreign secretary bernardo sepulveda is not the result of the position adopted by costa rica which is willing to sign the document if it includes all the aspects necessary to achieve peace it is not a matter of signing the peace document but of fulfilling all its provisions if this is not done the efforts would have been useless each country that signs the peace document must comply with its provisions it is not a matter of simply signing the document so as to form part of a group of countries that will subsequently not comply with it the foreign minister concluded i began tonight talking about the propaganda offensive of gorbachev and of the soviet union and that there is a parallel propaganda offensive by the nicaraguan communists one of the comforting systematic natures of communism that does not seem to change overi time you can count on it is that they can lie with a straight face they can tell you they are for law and order while picking your pocket so it is not at all uncommon for a communist government like nicaragua in a peace offensive have their president giving peace speeches while their army and air force are violating costa rican territory here we have the costa rican government telling us about the event again the costa ricans are worried in part because of nicaraguan communist direct activity and they are worried in part about what they see just up the road in el salvador as recently as late august we have seen examples of the kind of communist terrorism in el salvador which frightens the democratic disarmed country of costa rica according to an august 24 san salvador la prensa grafica report new acts of vandalism and terror have recently been carried out by subversive groups of the communist fmlnfdr terrorist insurgency organization on the highways to santa ana atiquizaya sesuntepeque tejutla usultan ilobasco and other places the terrorist groups attacked buses injuring at least 20 civilians in another unprovoked attack official reports say that on august 23 the communist extremists machinegunned a bus truck and pickup truck in deliclas de concepcion canton san juan according to the report several passengers were wounded and all were taken to hospitals in that capital and zacatecoluca as the communist subversives were preparing to set the vehicle on fire a military patrol arrived and the rebels immediately opened fire and fled from the army the communist terrorists organizations goal is to overthrow the democratically elected government and replace it with a marxistleninist regile similar to those currently in control in cuba and nicaragua now notice the style here now that the communist guerrillas in el salvador cannot stand up to the army what do they do they shoot the civilians they machinegun a bus they machinegun a pickup truck this is the kind of banditry which can break down a free society but which is very hard for us to fight where are our freinds on the left those who are upset because the cia mined nicaraguan harbors those who talked about atrocities from the right where is anyone from the left in this body standing up and saying it is wrong for communist guerrillas to shoot innocent civilians we have not heard a single person from the left in this house complaining about communist guerrillas yet we recognize that there are all sorts of terrorists from the left who are engaged throughout central america in trying to destroy proamerican and prowestern gov ernments there is one final point i would like to make tonight about events in central america and that is that there is some evidence that nicaragua is working in concert with drug trafficking there has been considerable evidence that cuba works with drug traffickers but there has been a recent report worth looking at in terms of the nicaraguan communists an agreement that allowed colombian coccaine lords to process and ship narcotics through nicaragua was described july 31 by a pilot working undercover for unitedstates authorities adler barryman seal described an april 8 1984 meeting at the colombian mountaintop home of jorge ochoa attended by several members of the ochoa smuggling cartel they had struck a deal with some lofficials in the sandinista government in nicaragua seal said were not communists we dont agree with their philosophy but they serve our means and we serve theirsthen they made gestures indicating money seal 45 said he was initially worried about being arrested if he landed in a plane full of cocaine in a communist country but he said he was assured that there would be no problems with nicaraguan officials united states authorities concluded that the operation had at least the tacit approval of highlevel sandinista officials the point that i think really ties together drug trade terrorism the propaganda offensive and nicaraguas attacks on its neighbors in costa rica is that from a communist standpoint all of this fits together gorbachev as a communist leader sees the united states as the enemy the soviet union and its marxistleninist leaders are very open in saying that we are the enemy anyone who has studied the grenada documents can find the thencommunist leader of grenada maurice bishop saying in a secret speech of course we are communists of course this is a dictatorship of course we are against the americans but if we told them the truth then they will know what we are doing sowe are goingoto lie to them it is amazing since 1917 we have had an opportunity to study what lenin wrote in creating the soviet state to study how stalin behaved as a dictator or to look at what now is almost 70 years of systematic warfare against the west it is remarkable to see them spy against us to have americans who are arrested as spies to see west germans who turn out to be spies to recognize that the british are expelling spies right this very day to see that all over the world gorbachev is involved in country after country in systematically spying to try to undermine the west similarly we see as we look around the world a communist offensive there are russian troops in afghanistan killing free afghans this evening as i speak there are cuban troops in ethiopia in angola in mozambique killing people who want to be free there is a communist government in nicaragua trying to impose a dictatorship on its people there is a communist army from vietnam in cambodia trying to impose a communist government on its people there is a communist army holding down the people of poland in the middle of all this gorbachev appears on the cover of time magasine and explains that he is really a nice guy who is just misunderstood in the middle of all this we have a socalled peace offensive sometimes you have to ask yourself how naive is the american and european news media how naive are our intellectual elite how easy it seems to be for the communists almost by the flick of a wrist to change and say oh please forget everything we are doing in afghanistan ignore the people we are killing the men women and children who are being butchered the villages that are being bombed the atrocities that are being committed we really mean well please ignore the spies that you are uncovering in your country that we send there we really mean well why dont you come to geneva and just talk to us in a pleasant way i believe the president should go to geneva i agree with winston churchill who once said jaw jaw jaw is better than war war war still we should recognize what is going on neville chamberlain went to munich in 1938 thinking if you could appease a dictator somehow things would get better neville chamberlain might have given up radar in order to make adolph hitler happy and the british would have lost the battle of london the president has the 21st century equivalent of radar the strategic defense initiative it is vitally important that all of us in america and in europe and in japan and all of the free countries recognize who is going to geneva on the one side there is a communist empire there is a man whose armies are currently trying to conquer afghanistan there is a man who is spying against all of us who is supporting terrorism and who represents the dark forces of the secret police the gulag archipelago and the concentration camps of political prisoners that is gorbachev we should recognize that we should remember it and we should go to those negotiations starting with a question since this is a man who will lie with a straight face who will quote god even though he is an atheistic communist who would tell us he would never start a war even whole he has 120 000 troops fighting in afghanistan let us be clear what is happening it is vitally important the american president talk with the communist leader it is equally important that the american president not try to appease the communist leader if we can reach reasonable agreements that are enforceable that is worth doing i hope that on the week of october 25 we will study the lessons of the grenada documents and we will celebrate for free people everywhere and people who would like to be free everywhere the fact that for the first time a communist nation has become free again as we look at the lessons of that second anniversary it is my hope that across america and through the unitedstates information agency across the world the people who are free will be able to look once again at the lessons of communism and the nature of communism and what really was happening in grenada and that that will give us a much more sober a much more realistic a much more reasonable balance as we move toward geneva it is vitally important that geneva occur but it is equally important that geneva not become another munich while ronald reagan is a churchillian figure a man of great resolution a man who understands communism a man who as a former labor union president knows how to negotiate it is very important that he not have neville chamberlains style news media neville chamberlains style elite neville chamberlains style advisers neville chamberlains pressure from his own public to make unwise concessions by asking your congressman to cosponsor house joint resolution 313 to help us look at the lessons of the grenada documents by asking your civic club your sunday school or your synagogue group your high school or college class to take time that week to look at the lessons of grenada i think it is possible to educate ourselves and i think that in the long run an educated free people will survive despite the threats of dictatorship and that we can achieve peace through

which i serve as a commissioner makes it clear that romanias human rights record continues to be poor there is a growing sensitivity on the part of many members of congress and the american people that religious repression and violation of human rights have not improved in romania if the conference of mfn is to be meaningful from a human rights perspective only performance serves as a genuine

been in the congress i want to just share with my colleagues two experiences i had with george obrien they were both memorable i will certainly remember them always it reminds me in many ways of what my colleague from illinois ken gray said about george he said he was always doing something for someone else when i was first elected to the congress i came with that largebob i know you will remember this classthat large democratic class of the 94th congress and there were so many people on the floor on opening day when we took the oath of office that i and my two children had to sit over on your side of the aisle because this side was packed i remember sitting right there in the middle of your colleagues and sitting there right beside me was a friendly teddy bear of a man as mr crane said and he turned to me and he said hi im george obrien he said what is your name i introduced myself he took a special interest in my children and from that day until the last he always inquired about how stacy and kelly were doing he would remember the details of what their activities in school were the colleges that they selected and the caring this man showed was truly remarkable george also knew and made it a matter of his own personal concern that i came down with a kidney condition about 4 years ago and no member of the house on either side of the aisle has inquired more often as to how i was doing and i am grateful that i have done well george was always concerned and always asking that is the kind of guy he was in fact we worked together he was a member of the laborhhs committee we worked together on something else that will be a monument to george obrien and that is regional kidney research centers around the country george understood the problems of kidney disease and he worked very hard and i worked with him on this and i was amazed that the day after georges death after the markup was complete i got a call from his staff because his staff said george wanted me to know that the funding for those centers that we had worked for for some 4 years was in the bill heading to the floor george obrien holds a special place in my heart and if i were to use a word to describe him and maybe it is an important thing to state at a time when there are so many tensions across this center aisle that divides these two parties is that he was a teacher he taught us that we are democrats and we are republicans but we are more than that we are human beings real people with real needs real wants real hopes real dreams and he reached out and touched each one of us in that sense too as long as we can remember that lesson i think we will be a better body and better individual members as a result i am glad the gentleman has taken out this time and i am glad that i have
