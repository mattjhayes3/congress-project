bureaucracies we have done nothing to take power from hardworking americans and give it to washington bureaucrats however we have balanced the budget for the first time in 30 years we have cut taxes on hardworking americans for the first time in 16 years saved medicare reformed welfare and reformed the irs at the same time we have lowered interest rates on student loans the liberals are right we

condolences to the family of our colleague mr capps i cannot count how many times my wife has said to me that she hopes that our 24 years of marriage will allow other folks around us to see that it is all right to find the right person in your life and to spend your entire life together we also have 3 kids and i am sure listening this evening that mr capps certainly provided a role model for many many many people not only in california but all across america married to the same woman for 37 years is something that many people should look to in this nation for a role model again i cannot count how many times my wife sue has said lets hope people see that it is all right to be married to the same person that that is the way things should be again my condolences to their family and to the kids that are involved here this evening i had reserved the hour primarily to talk about some budget matters i guess last week we had a situation develop in our district where we were in dire need of some help from some folks i gave my parents a call my mom and dad said well we are going to be there instantaneously they said they were going to drop everything they were doing so to start tonight rather than start on the budget stuff i thought i would talk about a matter that is of the utmost importance not only to my parents but to other seniors like them all across america it is an issue that has almost been put on the back burner out here in washington and many different fronts and that is social security i thought i would start tonight by talking a little bit about what is happening in social security and then go to a solution as what we need to do about it first what is happening in social security i know many senior citizens rely on social security all across this great nation of ours the social security system in 1983 was set up so that it started collecting more money than what it pays out to seniors in benefits the idea with social security was they would collect this extra money put it aside in a savings account and then when the baby boom generation hit retirement they would go to the savings account get the money they need and still make good on the payments to our senior citizens so it is kind of like you do in your own house where when you have got extra money coming in you put it in a savings account then when you overdraw your checkbook you go to the savings account get the money out and make good on it that is how the social security system is set up in fact in 1996 the social security system collected 418 billion in taxes that is they went into the paychecks of working families all across america and they collected they brought out here to washington 418 billion they only sent out checks to our senior citizens of 353 billion again this is a program that basically is working they collected 418 billion they sent out 353 billion in checks to our senior citizens and that left 65 billion that was supposed to be set aside into the savings account this program if it was run properly if this is what would be happening and it would be run right is working just fine the problem and it should serve as no great surprise that out here in washington when they got that extra 65 billion here is what they did we get the money out here in washington we put it in the big government checkbook in the general fund out here in washington they have been overdrawing the general fund that is the deficit they have overdrawn the checkbook out here where this money has been put every year since 1969 so what they do is they get this 65 billion put it in the general fund then they overdraw the general fund or the checkbook so there is no money left to put into that savings account for social security so what they do instead is simply put an iou down here in the social security trust fund what has happened out here is they have collected this extra money like the system is supposed to work they have paid out the benefits to seniors paid out less than they collected but instead of putting the money into the social security trust fund the way it is supposed to be done they have put it in the general fund instead they spend all the money out of the general fund then at the end of the year they simply make an iou entry into the social security trust fund we have developed legislation in our office and to many of my colleagues this will not seem like it took einstein to figure this out it really did not it is the same thing that every business across america does with any king of a pension fund that is similar to social security here is what our legislation does it simply says that this 65 billion that is collected in social security over and above what is paid out to our senior citizens in benefits be put directly into the social security trust fund it is a very very simple concept and it is what i used to do back when we had a business in the business world before i ran for office again what our legislation would do and it is called the social security preservation act is simply take the extra money that is coming in for social security and actually put it aside in the social security trust fund let me be a little more specific what we would do with this extra 65 billion is we would buy negotiable t bills like any senior citizen in america can go to any bank and buy right now today so instead of having ious down here in the trust fund we would then accumulatd these negotiable treasury bonds a t bill much like anybody in this nation can go to the bank and buy the idea in doing this would be to accumulate this kitty of money the way it was set up the way this system was set up and designed to work if we were to accumulate that kitty of money social security would be safe all the way to the year 2029 by not accumulating that kitty of money there is a shortfall in social security not later than the year 2012 let me say that once more if this money were collected and put down here in the trust fund the way it is supposed to be instead of put into the big government checkbook if it went straight to the trust fund social security as we know it today would be solvent all the way to 2029 under the current system where the money is put into the general fund instead of into the trust fund and all the money is then spent out of that general fund and ious are put in the trust fund that is the current system social security is in serious trouble not later than the year 2012 we can see the urgency of this sort of activity again this bill is called the social security preservation act it seems very fitting tonight that we would mention that when we have cosponsors from both sides of the aisle supporting the social security preservation act i would like to point out also how this impacts the budget process out here in washington because it is very important to understand we are on the verge of having our first balanced budget since 1969 every year since 1969 the people that have been out here in washington have spent more money than what they had in their checkbook that is they overdrew the checkbook when they overdrew the checkbook they went to borrow the money to make good on checks and they have been borrowing money every single year since 1969 here is how the social security system relates to this budgeting process in washington since this extra 65 billion is in their checkbook they call their checkbook balanced even though they are using the social security money as opposed to putting it away where it belongs let me show that in picture form when washington talks about a deficit and they were talking about a fiscal year 1996 deficit of 107 billion what they do not tell you is that in addition to that there is 65 billion that has been taken out of the social security trust fund so the real deficit for 1996 was 172 billion not 107 billion that was reported to the american people what does all that mean balancing the budget for the first time means getting rid of this blue area by washington definition when we say in washington we are going to balance the budget by 2002 we mean the blue area is going to be gone but in that year 2002 to get to a balanced budget they are still taking in that year it would be 104 billion out of the social security trust fund it is very important for people across america to understand that when washington says they are going to get to a balanced budget they will still be using the money out of the social security trust fund in their big general fund checkbook to make that checkbook look balanced so even after we get to a balanced budget we4have a long ways to go to actually restore the social security trust fund i am happy to say we have legislation currently pending that we have written in my office that will put this money that has been taken out of social security back into the social security trust fund we have written the social security preservation act that will start putting the money away immediately in addition to that we have written what is called the national debt repayment act the national debt repayment act looks ahead sees that when we are going to have surpluses takes the surpluses onethird for tax cuts twothirds for debt repayment and as we are repaying that debt the money that has been taken out of the social security trust fund would get put back in the social security trust fund and social security would once again be solvent for our senior citizens i want to turn from there and address the bigger problem and look at just how far we have come in the last 2 years i think it is very important as we talk about this to understand where we were in 1995 when for the first time in a long long time 40 years to be exact republicans took control of the house of representatives and the senate what i have got with me here is a chart that shows the growing debt facing this great nation of ours it is important to see that from 1960 to 1980 the debt grew very little but from 1980 forward this debt has grown right off the chart as a matter of fact in 1995 when we got here it was my first year in office the debt was all the way up here it was a very very serious problem and it was growing fast just to take this out of the partisan realm i realize that when i point to 1980 as the year this thing started climbing rapidly and it is very clear in this picture ttat that is the year it started climbing very rapidly i understand that all the democrats say well thats the year ronald reagan was elected to office therefore its the republicans fault and i understand all the republicans say well its that democrat congress that could not control their spending habits and therefore its the democrats fault the facts are it does not matter whose fault it is it is our responsibility as americans to solve the problem we are here in this chart and it is time that we as americans accept our responsibility and do what is right for future generations in this great nation h9794 c that we live in and solve the problem i used to be a math teacher i guess it is fitting tonight to have another former professor here on the floor i used to teach some college classes as well as junior high and high school we used to use these numbers in our class to talk about how large the debt really is we used to talk about these in our math class and use it for a number of placement discussions this is the amount that the united states government has borrowed on behalf of the american people this is our debt today it iss5 3 trillion again this is what we used to do in our math class we used to divide the debt by the number of people in the united states of america and in fact we would find that the united states government has bor= rowed 20 000 on behalf of every man woman and child in the united states of america let me say that once more because it is a pretty staggering number the united states government on behalf of the american people has borrowed 20 000 on behalf of every man woman and child in the united states of america for a family of 5 like mine that means they have borrowed 100 000 let me say this a different way that means they collected 100 000 less in taxes than what they spent out here in washington basically over the last 20 years for a family of 5 like mine they borrowed 100 000 here is the real kicker in this thing a lot of people out in america go so what so what if the government has borrowed all this money well there are a bunch of answers to the sowhat not the least of which this is our responsibility as a nation to pay back but the sowhat is more immediate than that a family of 5 like ours is sending an average of 580 a month to washington to do nothing but pay the interest on the federal debt a lot of people out there say well thats not us we dont pay 580 a month in taxes they forget that when they walk into the store and do something as simple as buy a loaf of bread that the store owner makes a profit on that loaf of bread and part of that profit gets sent out here to washington d c an average family of 5 in the united states of america today is sending 580 every month to washington to do absolutely nothing but pay the interest on the federal debt that is a very real problem it is a problem that is taking money out of the pockets and the paychecks of workers all across america and it is a problem that we as a nation need to address this is where we were in 1995 and this is really the problem that we came into i think it is important to understand how we got there to point this out i think it is important to think back to the late eighties and early nineties what was going on what sorts of promises were being made to the american people many folks remember the grammrudmanhollings acts s they did the first one in 1985 the second one in 1987 lots of folks remember the promises of the grammrudmanhollings acts so i brought that with me tonight this blue line shows what the grammrudmanhollings act promised to do with the deficit i think it is important to note by 1993 under grammrudmanhollings they promised we would have our first balanced budget since 1969 the red line shows what happened if i get upset when i talk about this it is because this is what brought me out of the private sector and caused me to spend 4 days a week away from my family as opposed to home doing the things i normally do living with my family in janesville wisconsin this red line shows what they did they did not keep their promises they promised we would balance the budget along this blue line but the people here decided they could not control spending and the red line is what they actually did so we get out here to 1993 they see that they have broken their promises and what do they do they say well we cant control spending out here in washington so there is only one thing left to do and that is raise taxes in 1993 we got the biggest tax increase in american history they raised the gasoline tax by 4 3 cents a gallon the kicker with the gasoline tax increase they didnt even spend it to build better roads they spent it on washington spending programs so they got to 1993 and looked at this picture and said well this debt is really growing we have to do something about it the right answer i am going into the pockets of the american people we will collect more money out of their paychecks get it out here to washington and surely surely that will lead us to a balanced budget that was the 1993 solution it was not only the gasoline tax senior citizens might recall that they increased social security taxes on thesocial security money they received all sorts of tax increases were implemented as part of that 1993 tax increase package so this was the picture we were looking at in 1993 promises of a balanced budget that had clearly been broken and the biggest tax increase in american history the american people rose to the occasion and said enough of this we are not going to tolerate this anymore and they sent a new group of people to washington well we have been here for 3 years now came in with that group that came in 1994 and was sworn in in 1995 we have been here for 3 years i think t is reasonable that the american peo i ple start asking what has that group done are they any different or just the same old thing doing the same old thing breaking their promises like i what was going on before 1995 the facts are the american people should be evaluating this congress and s they should be asking the question have they done anything different well i brought the chart with me to show what is going on when we got here in 1995 we laid out a plan to balance the budget as well this blue line shows the promises we made to the american people in fact the blue line shows we were going to get to a balanced budget in 2020 and i have to tell you when i went home to my district and i said we are going to balance the budget by the year 2020 they all went yea sure because they were accustomed to this and the broken promises but the facts are we are now in the third year of our plan to balance the federal budget we are not only on track but ahead of schedule we are so far ahead of schedule in fact that we will have our first balanced budget since 1969 probably in fiscal year 1998 if everything continues the way it has during our first two years in office for one more year we will in fact have our first balanced budget since 1969 we didnt do this while raising taxes we in fact did this coupled with the first tax cut in 16 years i want to spend a little time on the tax cut in just a minute but before i do i wanted to talk about why this picture is possible because when you look at this picture and you understand what led to the change in 1993 that was broken promisesand raising taxes then you look at this picture and you see we are on track balancing the budget probably 4 years ahead of schedule and at the same time reducing taxes a lot of my constituents go mark the economy is so good you guys are out there trying to look good in the face of the great economy we are in that is nice but not entirely true the economy is doing really really well but the reason this picture works is not just cause the economy is doing well we have had good economies between 1969 and today every time in the past when the economy got good in the past washington saw extra money coming in and thiswill not be hard to convince the peopre of because it is so obvious when the econqmy was good in the past and extra money came into washington washington simply created a new washington spending program and spent the money it is important to understand that being in the third year of a sevenyear plan to balance the budget getting to balance four years ahead of schedule and lowering taxes the at the same time partly it is the economy but there is more to it than that the growth of washington spending before we got here was 5 2 percent annually this is how fast spending was growing before we got here in 1995 this is how fast spending is growing now this is a very different picture in the face of a very strong economy with nore revenue than expected coming nto washington this congress said we lre going to slow the growth rate of washington spending we didnt go out lnd come up with a whole bunch of new washington spending programs just the opposite we are squeezing the growth rate of washington spending at the same time there is extra revenue coming in in fact let me give you a couple very little known facts in 1996 our first fiscal year we actually spent 28 billion less than as promised in our second fiscal year we spent 25 billion less than was promised i challenge each one of my colleagues to go and get the budget resolution that we passed back in 1995 do not take my word for it go and get it then see what was promised and see how we actually spent less again when i am out with my constituents and i tell them this i swear half of them get it and check it out because they cant believe it actually happened washington said what they were going to spend and actually spent less money than they said they were going to spend at the same time we were spending less money than we said we were going to spend 100 billion plus of extra revenue came in that is why we have the picture where we are able to both balance the budget ahead of schedule and reduce taxes at the same time this picture is absolutely essential in understanding that it is not only the good economy and the good economy is certainly part of it it is also washington slowing the growth rate at the same time that extra revenue is coming in in fact in real dollars we have slowed the growth rate of washington spending from 1 8 percent to 0 6 percent the growth rate has been slowed by twothirds in two short years this is a monumental accomplishment especially in the face of all the extra revenue that came in here that was unexpected now i am going to go to the next item with this picture still here i am going to go to the next thing that most of our constituents do not understand when i am talking with them out there it is like you are going to cut taxes mark is that another political promise is that where we are at no that is not where we are at the taxes have been cut the bill is signed for the first time in 16 years people should start keeping more of their money rather than sending more of their money to washington d c let me be specific first off this tax cut package is heavily weighted towards education as it should be education is extremely important for the future of this nation it is heavily weighted towards families let me start with the families in january of next year the families with children under the age of 17 keep 400 per child more in their own home rather than sending it out here to washington translation if you have a child under the age of 17 in your home you should go to your place of employment and start keeping 33 a month more in your takehome pay instead of sending it to washington d c 33 a month well that is 400 divided up over the 12 months you can start keeping the extra money in january of next year there are 550 000 families in wisconsin alone eligible for this 400 per child tax cut but i have a fear i have a fear that people will not believe the tax cut package is real and they will send all that money out to washington instead of keeping it in their home they will not make the effort in january to go in and actually keep the extra 33 in their own paycheck instead of sending it out here i am very much afraid of what is going to happen if washington gets their hands on the money so i would strongly encourage all of our constituents to go in and change their withholding so they keep that extra money in their own home education we would hope a lot of families and i know i was talking with a family at church with three kids i know the first thing they said to me is mark when i get that 400 i know exactly what i am doing i am putting it into a savings account to save for my kids education good news we have established something called an education savings account that works much like an ira you can put up to 500 per year per child into an education savings account to save up for the kids as they are growing up for when they reach college age now i a lot of times call this the grandparents account there are a lot of grandparents that talk to me ard say we wish we could do something for our grandkids well the account is set up so that the grandparents could literally put up to 500 per grandchild away to save up for the kids education when they reach the age of 18 what better gift from a grandparent to a grandson or a granddaughter so the education savings accounts i think are very very important but we did not stop there we understand that for many working families out there when the first or second or third child goes off to college paying those college tuition bills are very very difficult and a huge burden on our families so the tax cut package also contains a college tuition credit of up to 1 500 per college student in the vast majority of the cases if you have a freshman or a sophomore in college next year you will send 1 500 less to washington you will keep it in your own home and use to help pay for the kids college education for a freshman or sophomore you get the first 1 000 plus half of the second 1 000 or 1 500 total for juniors and seniors it is 20 percent of the first 5 000 up to 1 000 total it is interesting with this 1 000 college tuition credit i was out at a meeting i believe in waukesha wisconsin and somebody came up to me and she said well we are married we are both working and i am going back to school does the college tuition that i pay this is now a young couple does the college tuition that i pay qualify for a 20 percent reduction in my taxes do i get my 20 percent back the answer to that question is yes the answer to that question is if you are a young married couple and one or both of the spouses has returned to college or tech school for purposes of bettering themselves and making themselves also qualified so they can get a job promotion and provide a better life for themselves and their family if that is going on does that college tuition cost qualify for the 20 percent tax credit the answer is definitively yes it does i want to make it very clear here we are not talking about a tax deduction we are talking about a tax credit you fill out your taxes you figure out how much you would have paid in taxes and you subtract this number off the bottom line this is not a deduction this is a tax credit figure out how much tax also you owe subtract 400 per child let me put this another way for a family of five whether they be in janesville wisconsin or wherever in this great nation of ours you have two kids at home and one off at college that family will be pay 2 300 less in taxes next year this is real money this is not a political promise this is a bill that has been signed into law the tax cut package is passed a family of five three kids one is a freshman in college and two still at home will literally pay 2 300 less in taxes next year translation instead of sending 2 300 to washington out of their paycheck you keep the 2 300 in your own home i would like to have anyone stand up and explain to me why it is they think that washington can spend that 2 300 better than that family of five out there in america because that is what this is really all about there are very few people that voted against the tax cut package on either side of the aisle i might add i had a call this morning or yesterday actually and i was reading it this morning from one of our constituents that talked about how there is help all the way through government except for those hardworking families struggling to make ends meet well i would point out that the 400 per child the college tuition tax credit the education savings account those are all aimed specifically at those folks let us try one more thing though for the young couples or for the young singles that are working because i hear a lot about this that there is nothing in this for a young couple or a single who is working there are actually several things that impact that group very specifically there is what is called the roth ira you see we find many of our young couples or singles that are saving for either future education or to buy their first home in the roth ira it works much like an ira you can put up to 2 000 per year per person into the roth ira if you do not take the money out between then and retirement the money accumulates the interest and dividends whatever you have put it into accumulates taxfree all the way to retirement and at retirement you take the money out absolutely tax free however for those young couples or for those young singles in the work force if you decide that you would like to buy a home you can take out up to 10 000 out of this account specifically for the purpose of buying your first home if you decide you want to go back to college and further your education or tech school and further your education so that you can qualify for a job promotion a better life for yourself and your family you can literally go into the roth ira take the money out and use it so you put the money away into a savings account the money accumulates taxfree and then you can take it back out for a firsttime home purchase for education or if you do not take it out at retirement you can take it out then absolutely taxfree this is also a very important feature for many of the emptynesters the folks whose kids are grown and gone typically they are in a 401 k at their place of employment already and they are looking at this tax cut package going saying what is there available for me the roth ira is the real answer even if you are in a 401 k and this is very new as it relates to iras even if you are in a 401 k already you still qualify for the roth ira you can start saving additional money for your own retirement remember whatever accumulates in this roth ira when you reach retirement you take it out absolutely taxfree a couple of other things in this taxcut package that i think are worth mentioning always keeping this picture in mind and understanding that the reason we are able to cut taxes is because we have slowed the growth rate of washington spending at the same time the economy is very strong it is this picture that has put us in this position where we can have this great discussion about the fact that the budget is balanced for the first time since 1969 and we are lowering taxes for folks that own their own home and have lived in that home for 2 years or more and this affects many many senior citizens you may now sell that home and not owe any federal taxes in the vast majority of the cases let me say that once more for your personal residence if you have lived there 2 years or longer in the vast majority of cases there will be absolutely no taxes due this affects all sorts of folks in our society if a person is in a place of employment and they have an opportunity to take a better job and provide a better life for themselves and their families and they take this job transfer that requires them to sell their home in the past they may have suffered a capital gains debt to the federal government when they sold their home now if they have lived in that home for 2 years there are no taxes due it also affects senior citizens in many many many cases many senior citizens took their onetime exclusion when they reached age 55 they then sold the bigger house that probably they raised theirkids in and bought a smaller home and they are still in that home but since they have used their onetime exclusion when they sell that home that home has appreciated in value and they would have owed taxes to the federal government on that appreciation not anymore there is no more onetime exclusion at age 55 even if you took the onetime exclusion our senior citizens can now sell that home that they moved into after the age of 55 at the appreciated value and pay no money to the federal government in taxes this is a major major change capital gains we are finding today that more and more people are starting to save for themselves and their own retirement the capital gains tax rate in most cases has been reduced from 28 to 20 percent for the folks in the lower income bracket who have saved for their retirement to take money out that has been in a capital gains situation it has been lowered from 15 percent to 10 percent so if you are in a 41 000ayear income bracket and you take money out that is treated as capital gains the rate dropped from 15 to 10 if you are over the 41 000 the rate dropped from 28 to 20 the good news is it is going down to 18 i would be remiss not mentioning the changes for farmers and small business owners passing those businesses to the next generation i cannot tell members how many folks have talked to me in my district about the fact that when they want to pass a farm on from one generation to the next but the tax burden is so great that they cannot possibly do it under the tax code that has been changed and 90 percent of all farms may be passed from one generation to the next without paying federal tax on it this tax break also applies to many of our small businesses i have kind of stopped in the middle of this bigger discussion of what was going on back in 1993 and before broken promises and not getting to a balanced budget the tax increases of 1993 and how things have changed in fact we have slowed the growth of washington spending in the face of a very strong economy and that in fact has actually led us to both a balanced budget 4 years ahead of schedule and the opportunity to have these tax cuts that i just talked about this is a wonderful wonderful situation to be in in terms of a change that has occurred out here in washington in 3 short years the next thing i get from my constituents back home is typically well mark it is not your doing if you had done nothing this all would have happened anyhow so i brought aibther chart with me to show exactly what would have happened if in fact when we got here in 1995 we played golf and tennis or basketball and did not do our job this red deficit line shows in my first year this is where the deficit was going when i got here this red line shows what would have happened had we not done our job the yellow line shows where we were at the end of 1 year so after a year of struggle we had brought this red line down to the location of the yellow line but we had a dream we had a dream that we could actually balance the budget and lower taxes at the same time restore medicare for our senior citizens that was our dream this green line shows that dream that green line shows how we were going to get to our balanced budget by 2002 the blue line shows what is actually happening again we can see what would have happened had we done nothing what would have happened had we quit at the end of 12 months what we hoped to do that is the green line and what is actually happening again we are in the third year of this plan to balance the budget in 7 years we are so far ahead of schedule that it would now appear that in the fiscal year 1998 we will reach our first balanced budget in more than a generation i was a sophomore in high school the last time the federal budget was balanced so this is good news i think it is important that we understand that we are winning we are winning the battle of getting to a balanced budget but i do not think we should forget the earlier conversation about social security i began the hour this evening by talking about social security and how the money that is supposed to be in that social security trust fund that extra money that has been collected that was supposed to be set aside has been spent on all sorts of different washington programs and how even after we get to a balanced budget they are still using that social security money i would like to now present the longterm solution to getting that money that has been spent back into the social security trust fund and the bigger picture here is to not only get the money back in the social security trust fund but to pay off that 5 3 trillion debt that has been run up so that our children can in fact leave this nation absolutely debtfree that is my dream for the future of the country my dream for the future of the country and for the next 10 15 20 years of our generations time here serving our nation my dream is that we will actually pay down the federal debt restore the social security trust fund and continue to lower taxes on our working families and our workers all across america here is the plan here is how it works it is called the national debt repayment act remember it has three purposes for workers lower taxes for senior citizens restore the social security money and most important of all for our children give them a nation that is debtfree let our legacy to the next generation be that we have actually paid off the federal debt much like you would pay off a home mortgage in the business i used to be ih where we used to build homes here is how it works after we reach a balanced budget we cap the growth of washington spending at a rate at least 1 percent lower than the rate of revenue growth after we reach balance that is this point in the chart we cap the growth of washington spending that is the red line at a rate at least 1 percent slower than the rate of revenue growth that is the blue line that in fact creates a surplus it is pretty easy to see in this chart if spending is going up at a slower rate than revenue grows it does in fact create this surplus we use the surplus in two ways onethird of that surplus is dedicated to additional tax cuts for the workers i might add while we are on this onethird there is a bill introduced here that i am a strong supporter of and a cosponsor of that would literally sunset the irs tax code as we know it today when i went through all of these tax cuts a lot of my constituents back home will say mark that is very complicated to understand all that they are right there are 20 volumes of tax code today there are 20 000 pages of tax code i challenge anyone to fully understand what is in that tax code so as we talk about these tax cuts as we talk about using onethird of this surplus and dedicating that to additional tax reductions for workers all across america as we have that discussion i think it is important that we throw in the mix that we would like to sunset the irs tax code as we know it today and replace it with a system that is simpler fairer and easier for people to understand the bill currently would sunset the tax code as we know it today in the year 2001 i think that is a great idea why 2001 instead of tomorrow i think we need to have a discussion and come up with a system that is in fact simpler fairer and easier to understand when i am out in our town hall meetings a lot of my constituents start nodding their head with the yes sure thing again but the reality is if we can actually balance the budget 3 or 4 years ahead of schedule if we can lower taxes for the first time in 16 years and make that tax cut very very real is it that hard to believe that we can also change the irs system so it is simpler fairer and easier for folks to understand certainly redoing the irs code is easier than getting to a balanced budget certainly redoing the irs code is easier than getting the people in this community to start spending at a slower growth rate it has got to be easier to redo the irs it is going to get done i am very optimistic as we talk about using onethird of these for tax cuts it will facilitate that move to an easier simpler tax system a fairer tax system the other twothirds of this surplus remember we cap the growth of washington spending at least 1 percent below the rate of revenue growth that creates a surplus onethird is dedicated to tax cuts twothirds is used to repay the federal debt this works much like paying off a home mortgage i used to be a homebuilder when folks would buyone of our homes the last thing we would do is go to a bank and they would sign a mortgage on their home and they would then start making payments on their home on a very regular basis over a 30year period of time they would pay off the mortgage that is exactly what we are suggesting that we do with the federal debt in fact under this bill if we enact it the way it is written cap the growth of washington spending at least 1 percent slower than the growth rate of revenue we would in fact pay off the entire federal debt by the year 2026 it is a 29year period of time folks are very familiar with the 30year home mortgage so it is like you set up on a repayment plan of the home mortgage and whatever is left over gets returned the people in the form of tax cuts that is what our bill does again it is called tv national debt repayment act i think it is real important for us to understand that as we are repaying that federal debt as we are paying off the 5 3 trillion part of that 5 3 trillion is the social security trust fund so as we go through this plan and we actually pay off the federal debt the money that has been taken out of social security and spent on all kinds of other washington programs in fact gets repaid to the social security trust fund in repaying the money to the social security trust fund social security once again becomes solvent for our senior citizens all the way to the year this has another impact and it is a very very real impact remember the 580 a month that an average family of five is paying to do nothing but pay the interest on the federal debt as we go down this road and we start paying down the federal debt each time we make a payment on the federal debt that means there is less interest due the next year so the idea here is that as we go through this and we start paying down the federal debt each year we should be able to cut taxes even further because there will be less interest that needs to be collected from our working families think about this for a dream for the future of our country think about a dream where we actually pay off the federal debt we leave our children a legacy of a debtfree nation we restore social security for our senior citizens and each and every year as we go forward we take onethird of this surplus and we lower the tax rate on our workers all across america people talk about the problem in medicare when i came here in 1995 medicare was scheduled to be bankrupt in the year 2001 no one in america i cannot believe anyone in this entire country missed the mediscare ads that were run during the last 2year period of time whereall sorts of misinformation was put out about the medicare system but the one thing that was true was that if absolutely nothing was done it would have been bankrupt in the year 2001 we have restored medicare for at least a decade but at least a decade is not good enough for medicare i would like to point out that as we go through this program and we pay down the debt the money that is no longer needed for interest we can use for tax cuts but certainly we would prevent the medicare system from going bankrupt after that decade that it has currently been restored for so we can now count the medicare program without going into the pockets of the workers taking more money and raising taxes again this dream for the future of this country it includes a restored social security for our senior citizens it includes medicare for our senior citizens it includes a nation where our children inherit this country absolutely debtfree it includes a legacy of a debtfree nation for the workers out there they are not forgotten for the workers out there who have borne this huge tax burden taxes can come down each and every year as we go forward do not forget the other part of this where we reform the irs tax code we dump the tax code we have right now lock stock and barrel and put in a new tax system that is easier simpler and something that people can understand and maybe they can even fill out their own taxes again i would like to kind of wrap it up tonight by just summarizing what we talked about i started the hour tonight talking about social security and how the social security system is collecting more money than it is paying back out to our senior citizens in benefits each year but that money is currently being spent on other washington programs that is wrong that needs to be stopped we talked about how this thing started happening we talked about in fact how up through 1993 there had been promise after promise after promise the grammrudmanhollings bills grammrudmanhollings ii in 1993 the 1990 tax pledge our balanced budget pledge the 1993 balanced budget pledge promise after promise after promise of a balanced budget that never materialized the past contained broken promises of a balanced budget and the final straw came in 1993 when they raised the gasoline tax and they did not spend the money in building roads when they raised social security taxes that was the final straw people finally said enough we have had it with the broken promises we have had it with tax increases we want washington to get their house in order and control the growth of washington spending we want a smaller washington less involved in our lives that happened in 1994 when they put a new group in charge we are now 3 years into a 7year plan to balance the federal budget i am happy to report that in the third year we will probably reach a balanced budget this year but certainly 3 or 4 years ahead of schedule we are not only on track to balancing the budget keeping our promise but we are 3 or 4 years ahead of schedule we are going toreach our first balanced budget this year since 1969 and at the same time we are reaching that balanced budget we are providing the first tax cut in 16 years a tax cut that is heavily weighed toward families and education 400 per child under the age of 17 1 500 college tuition credit freshmen and sophomores 1 oo college tuition credit for continuing education beyond the freshman or sophomore year the roth ira to save for education for a first home or for retirement that when investors take the money out it is absolutely tax free the money accumulates tax free and when they take it out it is tax free these are very very real tax cuts not a political promise the tax cut bill has been signed into law it is done it is the law taxes are going down for the first time in 16 years think of this contrast broken promises of a balanced budget before 1995 higher taxes 1993 the biggest tax increase in american history a balanced budget first time since 1969 three years into our 7year plan we hit balance tax cut first time in 16 years it is significant it is real it is done what a changed place washington actually is as we stand here but we are not done this is not the end of the picture this is not over we still have dreams for the future of this country and where we are going our dream is not only to get to a balanced budget but to pay off that federal debt and in paying off the debt we restore the social security trust fund in paying off the debt we put ourselves in a position to allow us to pass this great nation on to our children absolutely debt free a legacy of a debt free nation for our children equally important as we are going through that process we gradually reduce the tax burden on our working families and our workers all across america that is our dream for the future of this great nation that we live in"], [0.0004155230999458581, 0.0004155230999458581, 0, "i rise tonight to talk about good news for america i just had a wonderful opportunity during the past month to see lots of folks all across wisconsin and it was very educational for me and i hope for some of the folks we saw that they picked up on some of the good things that have happened here in the last month or thereabouts out here in washington the one thing that struck me though as i talked to more and more of our families across wisconsin and our senior citizens across wisconsin and some of our young people college age students across wisconsin they did not really realize that the tax cut bill has been signed into law so i would like to begin this evening by pointing out that the tax cut bill along with the first balanced budget since 1969 and restoring medicare has all been signed it is done the ink is dry the president signed it it has passed the house it has passed the senate first balanced budget since 1969 taxes coming down for the first time in 16 years and medicare restored for at least a decade that is what was accomplished before we left for recess in august the other thing i learned is that not very many people really understood what was in the tax cut bill and i would start talking to people and i would say well the budget is balanced thats the most important thing we could do and that was our responsibility and thats done and at the same time weve reduced your taxes and they go yeah sure but that affects somebody else and then we would start through it and the first question would be do you have children and this is so important if you have children age 17 or younger for virtually all families out there 550 000 wisconsin families alone you are eligible to keep 400 more for each one of your children in your own home next year instead of sending it to washington we should make this very clear this is not somehow a gift from washington to the people this is money that the people get up in the morning they go to their jobs they work hard and they earn the money but instead of sending it to washington they keep it in their own homes to spend on their own families and the way they see fit that is the first part of the tax code and i am going to put this a little different so folks have a handle on how important and significant this is in january of next year a family with a child with one child should go into their place of employment they should talk to the person that handles the w4 forms they should increase their exemptions so as to increase their takehome pay by 33 per month it is 33 per month in increased takehome pay for each one of the children in the house and my fear is people are not going to do this my fear is what is going to happen is they are just going to go through the year and washington is going to see all this extra money coming out here that those families should be keeping in their own home and of course when washington sees money sometimes they spend it out here and i will admit as hard as we try to stop that and as hard as i personally worked to stop them from spending on new programs it would be much much better if our families out there did the right thing and again let me make this very clear starting in january of next year a family with children should go into their place of employment they should talk to the personnel director whoever it is that handles the w4 forms they should change the number of exemptions so as to allow their takehome pay to increase for 33 per month per child let me put this another way if you have three children in your family for most families you should start taking home 100 a month more in your takehome paycheck than what you were in december so the difference between your takehome pay in december and january should be 100 a month for a family with three children that is significant it is real the bill is signed you should do it in january of next year increase your takehome pay keep the money in your own home do not send it out here to washington but that is not all in the tax cut bill the other thing that people seemed when i talked with them out in wisconsin to be generally familiar with was the capital gains reduction the capital gains tax in the past was 28 percent and that has been reduced to 20 percent so the good news is that capital gains the amount of money that you send to washington is lower when you sell a stock or a bond or whatever it is that you might have held and made a profit on good news is that drops even further in the year 2000 to 18 percent and it depends on your income bracket there if you are in a 41 000ayear or higher income bracket the capital gains are 20 percent and if you are lower than that they dropped all the way down to 10 percent those two people seem to be vaguely familiar with at least out there but there is a whole bunch of others that they were not familiar with at all let me start with the first one if people own a home homeowners for the most part when they sell their home will no longer owe any federal taxes in the vast majority of the cases very few exceptions and only on the very higherpriced homes will people owe any money in federal taxes if you have lived in your residence it is your personal residence you have lived there for 2 years or more you will not owe any federal taxes when you go to sell your home this affects a whole bunch of people there were a lot of folks out there empty nesters people whose children are grown and gone who are waiting for that onetime exclusion at age 55 to sell their home and downsize that is no longer necessary the age 55 onetime exclusion is gone it is no longer there if you lived in your home for 2 years you sell the home you make a profit there is no tax on it it was interesting i was in green bay wi i was doing a radio talk show about the tax cuts and i had a young lady call in and she said well i bought my home for 22 000 and im now about to sell it for 60 000 so a period of years have gone by and she said how much taxes am i going to owe and i said well youre not going to owe any federal taxes on the sale of your home so she said does that mean i owe income taxes and i said no no you do not owe any federal taxes when you go to sell that house and she said even though it went from 22 000 im going to get 60 000 back how much taxes do i owe she asked me three times the same question because folks are having a hard time believing that washington actually did something right they actually lowered taxes instead of raising them like they were doing previously so the third part here that i would like to talk about then in the tax cut if you owned your home you have lived there for 2 years or more and you sell your home in the vasz majority of the cases the only exceptions are the very high priced homes you will not owe any federal taxes on the sale of that home this affects a lot of senior citizens also in wisconsin 74 percent of our senior citizens still own their home and it may be people that took the onetime 55 exclusion that had bought a different home at age 56 maybe a smaller home or whatever but if they have lived in the house for 2 years and they are now 60 let us say for example they can now sell that home move to a different home if they like own it for 2 years sell it again so there is no onetime exclusion you can do this as many times as you want as long as you live in the home for at least 2 years so this part was very unfamiliar with most of the people out there then i went on to the part and i started talking about saving up for their childrens education because we had a lot of families that we were talking with and we started talking about the fact that it is now possible to put 500 per year per child into what is called an education savings account the money then accumulates tax free and the student can then take it out when they reach age 18 and are ready to go off to college i talked to a lot of grandparents about this account because it seems that there are a lot of grandparents that are interested in giving their grandchildren some sort of a gift whether it be a christmas or their birthday or whatever and it makes an ideal gift from a grandparent to a grandchild and i know everybody cannot afford it but there are some grandparents out there who would like to give this sort of a gift to their grandchildren and it is certainly an ideal way to provide their grandchildren with a college education again the education savings account you can put 500 a year into this savings account the money accumulates tax free and when the kids take it out at age 18 they pay on the lower tax rate that they would be at so it is money for them for college speaking of college very very important i took my daughter to her first year of college my son had left forhe is a junior in college and of course we talked to a lot of college students and the parents of a lot of college students and there is a general lack of understanding of how this college tuition credit is going to work well it works like this if you have got a freshman or a sophomore in college and the cost of their college education is 2 000 a year or more and in wisconsin at least that is the vast majority of the cases if it is 2 000 a year or more in costs the parents get to keep 1 500 more of their own hardearned money in their own home rather than sending it out here to washington and again i would point out this is not a gift from washington this is money that the people have gotten up in the morning gone to work and earned the only thing is instead of being taxed on it instead of that tax coming out here to washington and washington spending it you keep that money in your own home so if you have a freshman in college and the costs of their college tuition is 2 000 room board and tuition is 2 000 or more you should start keeping 125 a month more in your takehome pay starting in january of next year and again that is simply 1 500 divided by 12 is 125 a month more for juniors and seniors if the cost is over 5 000 which in many cases it is for room board and tuition you should stait keeping a thousand dollars more of your own money in your own paycheck and again that should start in january this is very very straightforward and if the people do not start keeping their own money if they send it out here to washington we are not sure washington is not going to spend the money we here in washington many of us want the people to start keeping their own money next january why should you send it out here to washington when it is your money college tuition then freshman and sophomores in most cases are going to get a 1 500 credit juniors and seniors in most cases in many many cases are going to get a 1 000 credit i said are you interested in saving more money for retirement he said yes but i am in a pension funds already so none of those iras affect me i said well no that is not entirely true in fact this new ira called the roth ira you can put 2 000 per year into the roth ira per person so in this case a husband and wife could put 4 000 away for their retirement you put after tax dollars into the roth ira but when you take the tax dollars out at retirement it is tax free this might be one of the best provisions for middle age people in the entire country this might be one of the best savings accounts in terms of taking care of yourself in retirement so even if you are in a different pension fund and even if you are already doing some other things to take care of yourself in retirement you may want to take a look at the roth ira where you can literally put 2 000 per person into this savings account and at retirement you take the money out tax free it is very significant because 2 000 put in at age say 40 typically will at least triple by the time you reach retirement that means it goes from 2 000 thousand to 6 000 in value when you take it out and there is no tax on that 4 000 on increased value a very very significant change in the tax laws that people should be taking advantage of again the idea here is to encourage savings and encourage people to take care of themselves in retirement then we went on to talk to some others farms roughly 90 percent of the farms transferred from one generation to another in this nation today will no longer have any taxes due because of the tax code change so for small farmers and businessowners you will be able to pass that small business or farm on to the next generation without the tax burden that was there before it is very clear to farmers as you pass this on from one generation to another the benefit but there a hidden benefit in here that not many people have picked up on when a business is held by a family and the family has been running that business for a period of time if the owner of that business cannot pass it on to the next generation many times the business gets sold and somebody else takes over and the jobs are moved out of that community to a different community so by allowing that business to stay in the family and be passed from one generation to another many times that means jobs stay in a community that otherwise might not have stayed there there are so many different provisions in this tax code that provide benefits to the american people that i found by the time i was done we virtually could not find anyone who was not in some way shape or form going tobenefit by this tax code i have left out one other group and that is young couples or young working folks singles couples those folks have the benefit of being able to save for education and their first home in this roth ira that i was just describing where they can then literally take the money out tax free and use it for the down payment on their first home or for college education so again there is a benefit for the young workers the people in their thirties forties and fifties preparing to retire for themselves there is a benefit for seniors who own a home and who want to sell it there is a benefit literally all across the generations here and certainly there are many many benefits for our families contained in the tax cut bill again i would be remiss to talk about these taxcuts without also saying that the budget is balanced first i would like to bring the american people and my colleagues some other good news numbers have come out now that reestimate the revenues coming into the federal government and in fact as we have been saying in our office for quite some time the economy is stronger than people were giving it credit for and revenues are coming in faster what does that mean in english the budget is balanced for the first time since 1969 next year four years ahead of schedule we are on track to balancing the budget the job is done and your taxes are coming down at a great time what a great time this is in this country i never 3 years ago when i was first elected thought we would be in a position to stand here and talk seriously about a balanced budget in 1998 taxes coming down medicare restored welfare reform ablebodied welfare recipients have now to go to work and not heartlessly they are guaranteed a job in wisconsin we are seeing our welfare rolls fall dramatically good news all across the specter in terms of what has happened in the last couple years here in washington with that i would like to turn my attention now to another topic that i find is very confusing as i talk with groups of people a lot of folks are saying if the budget is balanced what about that 5 trillion debt out there it has to be smoke and mirrors because we know there is a 5 trillion debt out there let me explain the difference between two terms the first term is deficit and the second term is debt deficit is like the family with their checkbook deficit is like overdrawing your check book since 1969 each and every year washington has written out more in checks than what it collected in taxes so they have literally overdrawn their checkbook each and every year since 1969 that is called the deficit when they overdrew their checkbook what they did was borrowed the money put it in their checkbook and then of course the checks were cashed and on we went so for each and every year since 1969 they have overdrawn their checkbook and then they went and borrowed the money put in the checkbook and made good on the checks as you might imagine since they have been borrowing more and more money each and every year since 1969 the debt has been growing each and every year and that is the 5 3 trillion we have staring us in the face i am talking now about the debt and how fast it has been growing and i think it is very important that the american people realize that we still have a very significant problem staring us in the face on this chart i show the growing debt facing america from 1960 to 1980 the growth was relatively slow and relatively small that is the deficits were not big because they did not borrow lots of money in each one of those years but from 1980 forward the debt has been growing in large amounts this is what brought many members of the class of 1996 out here the republican class of 1995 we watched this debt grow and realized we were about here on this debt chart right now and that if we dont do something about this as a nation we are not going to have a future in this country that is what brought many of us here in the first place and that is why it is such good news we are going to stop borrowing the money and the red line will quit going up when we reach a balanced budget when i point to 1980 all my colleagues on that side of the aisle say sure that is the year ronald reagan was elected and all my colleagues on this year say yeah i know but that is the year the democrat congress started spending out of control the fact of the matter is it doesnt matter which side it was responsible the fact is we as a nation have this debt staring us in the face and it is not a republican problem or a democrat problem it is an american problem because this government does represent the people it is time that we as a nation solve the problem rather than pass the blame back and forth in the house of representatives and the senate and the presidency for those that have never seen this number this is the amount of money it is 5 3 trillion that is the amount of money that the federal government has borrowed on behalf of the american people this is the accumulation of the overdrawn checkbook the amount of money that was necessary to make the checkbook balance since let rpe translate that into english i used to be a math teacher so you will see some of the math still in here if we divided this debt up by the number of people in the united states of america if each and every american were to pay just their share of the federal debt they would need to pay 20 000 the federal government has borrowed 20 000 on behalf of the every man woman and child in the united states of america basically within the last 15 to 20 years the real problem you look at a family of five like mine my kids are here my wife is here we have got five of us in our house the federal government literally borrowed and spent 100 000 on behalf of my family the real problem the kicker is the bottom line number you see every family of five in the country today or the average family of five is paying 580 a month to do nothingbut pay the interest on this debt this money is owed to people it is a real debt interest is being paid on it the cost of interest alone to a family of five in the united states of america today or any group of five people is 580 a month a lot of people say i do not really pay 580 a month in income tax i dont have to worry about it but it is not only income tax if you do something as simple as walk in the store and buy a loaf of bread the store owner makes a profit on that loaf of bread and of course part of that profit gets sent out here to washington and you guessed it it goes to help pay the interest on the federal debt as a matter of fact one dollar out of every six collected in taxes goes to paying the interest on the federal debt so the real problem with this picture is that there are real people out there real families out there that are paying 580 a month to do nothing but pay the interest on the debt it would be logical to ask the question how in the world did we get into this mess and didnt anybody try to correct it in the past i wanted to talk specifically about the past the past let me define the past to be pre1995 again this is very specific what we are talking about here the american people were promised a balanced budget repeatedly this is not news that all of a sudden we have a 5 trillion debt staring us in the face as a matter of fact the grammrudmanhollings bill first passed in 1985 promised the american people a balanced budget in 1991 well we look at the deficit line in this chart and what actually happened and it is clear that the promise made from washington was broken the promise was not kept but they knew what to do when they couldnt keep the first promise washington made a series of new promises again i emphasize this is the past this is what led many of us into leaving the private sector and coming to washington this blue line shows the fixed grammrudmanhollings bill and it was promising a balanced budget in 1993 i think that 1992 and 1993 those are real important dates to look at out there because you see when the budget was supposed to be balanced instead we had huge and growing deficits so rather than balance the budget as was promised then under this bill when we got to the early 1990s instead we had huge growing deficits so what did washington do in 1993 passed the biggest tax increase in american history washington looked at this picture and concluded that the right answer was to reach into the pockets of the american people and take more money out of their pockets and bring it out here to washington why would they do that well because if they take more money out of the pockets of the american people and bring it out here to washington they can keep their washington spending programs going and still bring the deficit down you see that is what the tax increase of 1993 was all about to pass the tax increase of 1993 what it really allowed them to do is keep spentling going out here in washington again i emphasize this is the past because in 1994 the american people decided to change what was going on in washington d c in 1994 the people for the first time in many many many years elected a republican house of representatives and a republican senate this history of broken promises this history of tax increases that changed in 1995 we had this theory when we came here in 1995 that went like this rather than raising taxes on the people and taking more money out here to washington why dont we slow the growth of spending here in washington have fewer washington spending programs and get to a balanced budget because washington is spending less not because they are taking more money out of the pockets of the american people that was our theory our theory went like this if we can just get washington to spend less money that means they would borrow less money out of the private sector if they borrowed less money out of the private sector of course that means more money available in the private sector more money available in the private sector the law of supply and demand is straightforward the interest rates stay down so if we could just get washington to spend less money they would borrow less money that would leave more money available in the private sector and with more money available the interest rates would stay down if the interest rates stayed down our theory was people would buy more houses buy more cars and of course when people bought more houses and cars that meant other people had to go to work building the houses and cars and that meant job opportunities and less welfare and less cost to the government and more people paying taxes in this was the 1995 theory i think it is more than fair that the american people should at this point start asking how did they do how are the republicans doing they came here in 1995 laid down a plan to balance the budget in 7 years how are they doing i think that is a legitimate question i brought the next chart along to show exactly how the new congress since 1995 is doing the red columns in this chart show the promises that were made in 1995 these are the deficit amounts that the republican congress said we would keep the deficit to in order to reach a balanced budget by the year 2002 i am happy to say that in the first year and this is in this is not a promise an empty promise we not only hit our target but we were about 50 billion ahead of schedule so the good news is in year one the republican plan not only hit our target we were well ahead of schedule year two came year two the change was significant washington borrowed over 100 billion less than was projected out here until year two and it worked exactly the way the theory we had hoped would work that is when washington borrowed less money because their deficit was lower that left 100 billion more money available in the private sector 100 billion more in the private sector kept the interest rates down and sure enough it worked people bought more houses and cars and stoves and refrigerators and all the other things that go with it and that provided job opportunities so the unemployment rate dropped to the lowest level in years that meant job opportunities for people they went to work and started paying taxes in and of course that made the program go better the rest of this chart was kind of theory a few days ago we found out recently that the theory was way too lacking the optimism that should be there because of the strong economy we are in we are now finding we are going to reach a balanced budget this blue column the actual deficit is going to go to zero sometime between the year 1998 and the year 1999 3 or 4 years ahead of the promise that was made by the republicans back in 1995 is this a change or what before 1995 we had the broken promises of grammrudmanhollings and the higher taxes post1995 well we are 3 years into the plan and are now looking at balancing the budget 3 years ahead of schedule for the first time since 1969 and lowering taxes and restoring medicare at the same time because the idea of constraining the growth of washington spending works a lot of folks say well you are just plain lucky out there in washington you are just plain lucky the economy is booming and since the economy is booming there is more revenue coming in and you guys can get your job done and you all look great out there doing it and everybody is bragging about it i brought with me a chart to show the actual facts on that particular argument as well because i hear that quite a few different places that i go to we have had booming economies in the past in the past every time washington went into a booming economy washington subsequently went into booming spending cycles in fact all the extra revenue that came in they spent it so we never did get the deficit down we never did get to a balanced budget in fact this congress since 1995 is very different we are in a booming economy yes the revenues are coming in stronger than expected but rather than go and spend the extra money this congress has seen fit to slow the growth of washington spending by over 40 percent at the same time the economy remains strong this is how fast washington spending was growing before 1995 this is how fast it is growing since 1995 on through the year 2002 so let us make this very clear in the face of a strong economy and more revenues coming in instead of washington doing what it has always done in the past going and spending the extra money what washington did is at the same time the economy was strong they slowed the growth of washington spending so in the face of a slowed growth of washington spending and a strong economy we hit our deficit targets we are on track we are ahead of schedule and we are about to balance the budget for the first time since 1969 while at the same time lowering taxes and restoring medicare for those that are interested in inflationadjusted dollars it is even more dramatic the washington spending was increasing by 1 8 percent it has now been slowed to 6 percent we are down to a point where washington spending in real dollars has virtually stopped in terms of increasing spending that is good news and that is why we are also able to both balance the budget and reduce taxes at the same time for the good of the american people i brought one more chart with me that i think says it all because a lot of people are saying well how can all of this stuff happen at the same time you know in fact would this all have happened anyhow this chart shows what would have happened if when we got here back in 1995 we had played golf tennis and basketball instead of doing our jobs the deficit line that is shown here in the red this is what we inherited when we got here back in 1995 in fact members can see that the deficits were projected to go all the way up to 350 billion at that point in time a lot of people remember 1995 they remember the 100 days they remember the government shutdowns they remember the hassles and what seemed like a constant battle out here in washington i want to say something i was here it was a constant battle it was worse here living through it than what the american people saw out there in public put at the end of 1995 we had made progress this yellow line in the chart shows what the deficit projections were after one year of very difficult battles the green line shows what we had hoped to do we laid this out in 1995 and again we hoped to get to that balanced budget by the year 2002 the good news is here the good news is what we have actually accomplished is below either one of those projections and in fact we are now going to reach zero right here in the year 1998 or 1999 so not only are we not losing what was given to us in 1995 when we got here but we are going to reach a balanced budget in 1998 or 1999 for the first time in more than a generation again i cannot emphasize this enough the last time the budget was balanced i was a sophomore in high school my son is now a junior in college my daughter is a freshman in college and my youngest is a freshman in high school this is more than a full generation ago the last time we balanced the federal budget it is great news for the future of this country i have been real upbeat and i have been real optimistic about this as well we should be we should be celebrating this first balanced budget in a generation welfare reform taxes coming down medicare restored we should be celebrating this but we would be remiss if we did not recognize that even after we got a balanced budget we still have this 5 3 trillion debt hanging over our head remember when we say the budget is balanced that is just a checkbook all we mean is that we are taking in as many dollars as we are spending in this given year that does not pay this debt off i have good news on that front though too we are working on it we have a plan on the table right now it is called the national debt repayment act what the plan does is this it says after we reach a balanced budget we recognize we still have this huge problem we have a responsibility to future generations to do something about this problem so after we reach a balanced budget we are going to cap the growth of washington spending at a rate of at least 1 percent under the rate of revenue growth so spending is now going up slower than revenue growth with spending going up slower than the rate of revenue growth if you start a balance that creates a surplus with the surplus we take onethird of that surplus and provide additional tax cuts to the american people so the american people should expect a tax cut every year from here on out twothirds of it goes to repaying the federal debt i have great news if we were to enact this plan by the year 2026 the entire federal debt would be repaid and we would pass this nation on to our children debtfree but there is another hidden advantage to doing that as we are paying down the federal debt the money that has been taken out of the social security trust fund would also be returned social security is collecting more dollars than it is paying back out to our senior citizens in benefits each year as a matter of fact this year alone the social security system will collect about 70 billion more in tax revenue than what it is paying back out to our senior citizens in benefits the idea is that money is supposed to be set aside in a savings account so when the baby boom generation gets to retirement you can go to the savings account get the money put it in the checkbook and make good on the social security payments to our senior citizens that money though it is not in that savings account that money is all part of this 5 3 trillion debt what social security is doing is instead of putting the money in the savings account they are collecting the social security tax dollars more than what they are paying out to seniors in benefits they are putting all the money in the general fund in the big government checkbook if you like they are writing out checks out of that checkbook and of course there is no money left at the end that is the deficit then they are simply putting an iou down in the social security trust fund under the national debt repayment act as we go about paying off the federal debt we would also be putting the money back into the social security trust fund so under the national debt repayment act we create a surplus by slowing the growth of washington spending which we have already been successful doing we just continue what we have done for the last 2 years continue it on forward we create that surplus we take onethird of the surplus and work to reduce taxes further each year for the american people we take twothirds and apply it to the federal debt and when we are repaying the debt it is completely repaid by the year 2026 we are also restoring the social security trust fund just think about this it is not only the fact that we are doing the right thing we are paying the bills we have run up over the last generation it is not only that it is not only that we are going to give this nation to our children debt free it goes a step further when the debt goes away 1 out of every 6 that the federal government is now spending no longer needs to be spent that opens the door for huge tax cuts for the american people when we start talking about these tax cuts let us talk about some of the possibilities here because under the national debt repayment act as the debt gets paid down lower interest payments the government needs less money we can now talk about revamping the entire tax system i do not know how all of my colleagues feel and all the listeners this evening feel but many of us do not like the fact that the irs is so complicated it is almost impossible to understand in all fairness the new tax code did not make it any easier it did lower taxes we should not complain about the fact that taxes are coming down but the fact is the irs is far too cumbersome and far too difficult to understand as we look at these tax cuts down the road therefore it gives us the opportunity to throw out the irs as we know it and bring in a new tax system that would be a lot simpler than the one we have today until we get this in hand we cannot do that so the good news under the national debt repayment act and again i would encourage all of my colleagues that are not already on board as cosponsors to join us in the national debt repayment act what it does is it pays off the debt by the year 2026 so our children get this nation debtfree restores the social security trust fund for our senior citizens and for those people in the work force today for those people in the work force today they should expect additional tax cuts each and every year as far as the eye can see it is great news to the american people when we start thinking about the future tax cuts i opened the hour here by talking about the fact that i had listened to a lot of people out there in wisconsin what the people told me when i listened to them is two tax cuts they were most interested in the first one is the marriage tax penalty this is just totally unfair in our society today i could not find anybody who did not think we should not get rid of the marriage tax penalty that works like this if you have 4 people all working in the same place at the same time earning exactly the same salary but two of those people are married to each other and two of those people are not married to each other the two people not married to each other pay less tax than the two people that are married to each other that is called the marriage tax penalty and that is just plain wrong that is one thing i heard the other thing i heard repeatedly is mark just simplify the entire tax code just make it a lot simpler if you are going to do more tax cuts for goodness sakes just cut it across board i can tell the members we are going to look forward to eliminating the marriage tax penalty and work towards an acrosstheboard tax cut for virtually all americans out there so whatever bracket you are in it would be very easy to compute if your taxes went down by 5 percent or 10 percent or whatever the number is i would like to wrap up my part this evening by again going back and just comparing the past the present and the future the past broken promises of the grammrudmanhollings bill the higher taxes of 1990 1993 especially 1993 the biggest tax increase in american history taxes went up with a gasoline tax increase for those who were not paying real close attention the discussion went like well that tax increase is only on the rich but you were rich if you bought gasoline at a gas pump because it went up 4 3 cents a gallon so the tax increases of 1993 the broken promises of a balanced budget of grammrudmanhollings all of these deficits that ran up this huge 5 3 trillion dollar debt that is all in the past in 1994 the american people and the credit should go to the american people the american people changed what was going on they sent a new group out here to run washington under that new group where are we at i think it is a fair question to ask where are we at we are in the third year of a 7year plan to balance the federal budget we are riot only on track we are ahead of schedule we will have our first balanced budget since 1969 next year three or four years ahead of what was promised back in 1995 so for the first time since 1969 the budget will be balanced it has changed here in washington instead of the broken promises of the past we will have a balanced budget for the first time how about the higher taxes of 1993 that is not happening under this congress either as a matter of fact taxes are coming down just to run through that list of tax cuts and what is all in this bill again just briefly 500 per child startingit is 400 next year and goes up to 500 the year after capital gains going from 28 to 20 or even to 10 depending on your income bracket if you sell your home it is your principal residence you have lived there for 2 years in general there will be no taxes on the sale of your home however old you are the onetime exclusion age 55 is no longer there grandparents parents to save up for your childrens education you can put up to 500 per year per child into a savings account the interest accumulates taxfree college tuition for most freshmen and sophomores out there the parents are going to keep 125 a month more that is 125 a month more if you have a freshman or sophomore in college in most cases you keep that money in your house you earned it it is not a gift you earned it it is your money you keep it instead of sending it out here to washington 1 500 is the total for freshmen or sophomores 1 500 and in most cases for a junior or senior it is 1 000 that you keep in your own home if you are in a pension fund today wherever you are if you are saving for retirement if you would like to increase the amount that you are saving for your retirement there is a new ira called the roth ira that most everybody watching tonight my colleagues are eligible for you can put up to 2 000 per year per person into the roth ira for a husband and wife 4 000 a year you put in aftertax dollars which means you have already paid taxes on that money but the good news is the interest accumulates taxfree and when you take it out it is taxfree completely so you put the money in it accumulates and at retirement when you take the money out it is taxfree for young folks if you want to save up to buy a house or college education put money into an ira type account and you are allowed to take it out without the penalty for small businesses and i may not have mentioned this one earlier the health care deduction for selfemployed people is going all the way up to 100 percent over a period of years death taxes are reformed ninety percent of farms are passed from one generation to another with no taxes paid businesses family owned businesses will pass on to the next generation in many cases without taxes so the jobs can stay there in the community the point of this is we are in a very very changed washington dc the tax hike of 1993 versus the tax cut of 1997 that is dramatically different there has been a dramatic change that has been brought on by the american people sending a new group out here to control the house and senate and the american people have a right to understand just how far we have come the present a balanced budget for the first time since 1969 the present tax cuts the first time in 16 years the present medicare restored for our senior citizens the present welfare recipients ablebodied welfare recipients having the opportunity to work so they have a chance at a job promotion and a better life for themselves and their families that is the present it is very very different than it was just a couple of short years ago out here i do not believe the american people fully understand the magnitude of the change yet that is the present where are we going well even after we get the budget balanced even after we started with the first tax reduction in 16 years medicare restored for a decade we still have a 5 3 trillion debt hanging over our heads we have introduced the national debt repayment act which would repay the debt in its entirety by the year 2026 giving this nation to our children debtfree it would restore the social security trust fund for our senior citizens and as it creates surpluses by controlling the growth of washington spending onethird of those surpluses would be used to provide additional tax cuts think what a changed environment this is the budget is balanced taxes coming down and a plan on the table that actually talks about paying off the federal debt instead of how we are going to stop borrowing this money what a changed country this is we as the american people should start having optimistic visions of the future again for our children growth opportunities our kids are going to have opportunities in america just like we did to start from scratch and build a company from the ground up or do what they want to do in this society those opportunities will once again be there because instead of passing them an ever growing debt instead of giving them a legacy of virtual bankruptcy we are now in a position to talk seriously about repaying the debt passing the nation on to our children debtfree restoring social security for our senior citizens and additional tax cuts for people in the work force today that is what this is all about and i sincerely hope that is what my service to this country is all about because it is a worthwhile endeavor if we reach those goals"], [0.0005208849906921387, 0.9994791150093079, 1, "the reconciliation spending bill that we just passed leaves me deeply concerned about this congress and where we are heading the spending package violated the letter and the spirit of the budget agreement and hit hardest at the working and poor families of our nation that struggle every day to get by before i speak about tomorrows vote on the unfair republican tax cut package i want to say a few words about what we as a body have done in voting for this budget reconciliation spending bill while there are many serious attacks on working families in the spending bill like privatizing portions of medicaid and food stamps slashing the federal funding for those hospitals who serve a disproportionate share of lowincome patients and blockgranting childrens health care one of the most serious attacks is against the minimum wage and workplace protections for workfare participants the budget reconciliation bill condemns working welfare recipients to second class citizenship the bill specifically states that benefits provided to these workers in their jobs are not to be considered wages or compensation with this devious language the bill denies these hundreds of thousands of hardworking mothers and parents the rights that all american workers now enjoy and it denies these workers the enforcement and remedial protections of the fair labor standards act this is wrong it must not be retained in the final passage of the bill tomorrow we turn our attention to the other half of our nations budget the tax cut package the republican leadership have made their priorities known with their budget proposals their 835 billion tax cut package gives the wealthiest americans the largest tax benefits and pushes the poor further into poverty the wealthiest 20 percent of the unitedstates population would receive a whopping 87 percent of the net benefits but the bottom 60 percent would share only 4 percent of these tax benefits in fact the poorest 20 percent of the population that has only 4 5 percent of the nations aftertax income would receive none of the gain most of the tax cuts benefit upperincome people openended estate tax cuts would benefit only the richest 1 5 percent of families they give the wealthiest americans deficit busting capital gains tax breaks in addition the republicans have the audacity to propose that these tax breaks for the wealthy be indexed for inflation and this is the same leadership that is opposed to costofliving increases for working americans at the same time the republicans proposal denies the working poor the tax relief they guarantee the rich the republicans took the presidents education tax package including the hope scholarship and undermined its goal of reaching the neediest students the republican plan would cover only half of tuition costs even for the first 2 years of college the bill also denies the 500 per child tax credit to over 15 million families it does this by denying the full benefit of the child tax credit to the poorest of working poor those who are eligible for the earned income tax credit contrary to what the republicans allege it is only those that are employed and pay payroll taxes that are eligible for their earned income tax credit they deserve all the help they can get and this bill denies them this much needed help we should not forget that the budget deal was a serious compromise from the presidents original budget proposal which many of us felt fell short of the nations needs in many critical areas for example the measly 5 billion requested by the president for education infrastructure that is to fix up the nations schools schools with no air conditioning schools where the heating systems are broken schools where windows and roofs need repair all of this was denied taken off the table because the republicans said no but at the same time conservative estimates put the real cost of addressing the infrastructure problem at over 100 billion and we could not get them to agree to 5 billion and what about a real jobs program that pays a living wage instead of trying to pay the working poor subminimum wages and deny their workplace rights let us be clear this republican tax bill is an outrage we will all end up paying dearly for it in the end it will make it much more difficult it address our nations real problems i urge my colleagues to vote against this unfair tax cut bill and reject this attack on working americans and poor americans"], [0.000541273329872638, 0.000541273329872638, 0, "i would like to begin today on a solemn note and extend my condolences to the bono family and recognize sonny for the great man he was i will never forget the first time that my daughter found out that sonny bono was serving in congress and came in with the same class that i came in with in 1995 and she could not figure out what her father was doing in the same place as somebody as important as sonny bono so mary our condolences are with you and your family and our thoughts and prayers are with you and your family i for one think you are going to be a great congresswoman if you decide that is the direction you are going to go on a light and positive note i would like to extend my congratulations to the green bay packers i am from the great state of wisconsin and some think they did not win their second superbowl on sunday in fact what happened is that they just put off winning their second superbowl in the 1990s for 12 months some people around this nation and some of my colleagues do not realize that the packers are made up of a lot more than a football team there is a lot of integrity in that group of individuals people like reggie white who our young people look to as an example of leadership and for all the right reasons in this nation it is truly a pleasure to have not only the greatest football team in the country but also a team with the integrity that the green bay packers have in the great state of wisconsin on to the third topic and perhaps the most timely topic that we will address here today the state of the union address is of course this evening and as i listened to the 1minute speeches here this morning i kept hearing this one word repeated over and over and over again it was expansion expansion of this and expansion of that and expansion of the next thing the bottom line that i hear back home in wisconsin is that what the people would like is to be able to keep more of their own money to make decisions on how to spend it themselves when we hear the word expansion this evening we need to understand that what they mean is expansion of washington spending programs do some of those expansions help people sure they do of course they do but the question is are we better off expanding those programs taking money out of the pockets of people to pay for these expansions or would we be better off just letting people keep their own money and let them make decisions on how to spend the money themselves so as we go into this evening we need to understand that there is going to be a lot of new programs described and they are going to sound just like apple pie and america they are going to sound really really good and frankly if they are really really good programs and the democrats or the president would describe what it is that he is not going to do in government that he is going to end some wasteful washington spending program and reprioritize that money with something different i guess i for one would be willing to listen to that but if what we are going to do tonight is talk about how we are going to use surpluses to expand washington rather than use those surpluses to pay down the federal debt and return the money back to the people so that the people can keep more of their hardearned money then i would say it is going to be a very rough year ahead for us as we debate these issues because i for one believe that the american people support less washington and keeping more of their own money in their own homes through the tax cut programs that are being proposed out here or acrosstheboard tax cuts better yet one of the topics that we understand is ging to be discussed in great detail tonight is the topic of social security and i do understand that the president is going to suggest that taking some of the surpluses that are materializing and applying them to social security so let me start with what exactly a surplus means and what a balanced budget means here in washington that is very important o understand as we look at what we are going to do with these surpluses first what is a balanced budget washington definition it sounds pretty good on the surface washingtons definition of a balanced budget is that the amount of money coming in is equal to the amount of money going out and i would have to agree that on the surface that sounds like a pretty good definition it is important to recognize that that is the definition that has been used out here since the late 1960s the last time we had a quote balanced budget it is very significant that we have reached the point where the budget is balanced under washington definition for the first time since 19691970 and in fact it is not political rhetoric or promise or any other political jargon the facts are in from december 1 1996 to november 30 1997 for the first time since 19691970 the united states government did not spend more money than it had in its checkbook let me say that once more it is so significant and it is such a change from where we have been in the past for the first time since 19691970 and this is in the books the books are closed on this for the first time since 19691970 the united states government for a 12month period of time did not spend more money than they had in their checkbook that is to say by washingtons definition the budget is balanced on the surface this is great news and not only on the surface it is great news because before we can go on and address the other problems facing our nation social security paying down the debt lowering taxes we first had to quit spending more money than was in the checkbook and we first had to quit spending our childrens money this is great news it is a tribute to people like john kasich and newt gingrich and trent lotr let us even mention president clinton so we dont fall into the demagoguing like the other side seems to be starting i learned this real quick in washington that there is absolutely no end to what we can accomplish in this city if we are willing to give somebody else the credit for dding it so let me give credit to lots of people both sides of the aisle for getting us to where we are today but most important let me give that credit back to the american people because it is a strong economy that has generated lots of extra revenue that is as important as what has been done here in washington i do not want to downplay the significance of the washington role in this in all fairness washington has had good economies between 1969 and today and every time in the past that washington had a good economy they paw the extra revenue coming in and they spent it as fast as it came in so in all fairness this is a combination of the people in washington for a change not spending the extra revenue that is coming in at the same time the economy has stayed very very strong and we slowed the growth of washington spending by over 40 percent since 1995 when i was first elected so it is a combination of those two things and it is significant and it is important and credit should be dished out for those things but we should also understand that we are not at the end of the road we have reached a milestone but we have a long long ways to go let me explain in more detail what is wrong with the washington definition of a balanced budget i come from the business world i never held office before this one i left the business world to run for office because i did not think it was right that we were spending our childrens money i did not think it was right how social security was being handled and i thought taxes were too high and government was too big in general when we lookat the solution that we have now reached a balanced budget we need to understand the second part of this problem the second part of this problem is in social security in the private sector where i come from if we had treated a pension plan the way the united states government treats social security they would have arrested me and my business it would have been illegal let me show why that is true and explain social security it is pretty straightforward the united states government is collecting 418 billion in taxes from the workers of this country under the heading of social securityx it is paying out to our senior citizens 353 billion now obviously if there is more money coming in in this system than what is going out there is some money left over social security the way it is set up today is working they are collecting more money than they are paying out to seniors in benefits and the reason they are doing that they are doing that because they recognize that in the not too distant future the baby boomers start to retire and these two numbers are going to turn around there is going to be more money going out in benefits than there is coming from the taxpayers now at that point we are supposed to be able to go to this surplus that has been accumulating you see this extra money it is supposed to be set aside in a savings account when these two numbers turn around and there is not enough money coming in to pay the benefits to our seniors at that point we are supposed to be going to the savings account getting the money out of the savings account and making good on the social security system let me give a couple of dates if this system were working the way it is laid out here on this chart social security is safe at least to the year 2029 so as we are listening to the state of the union this evening it is very very important that we understand that if social security were working the way it was set up and designed the system is solvent at least to 2029 and potentially significantly beyond that year however and this should not come as a surprise to many americans i know out in wisconsin when i talk with folks it is not a big surprise to them that is not what is happening in washington that extra money that is coming from social security is being put immediately into the big government checkbook if this is the extra money coming in those dollars are put immediately into the general fund or think of it as the big government checkbook the government then spends all the money out of that big government checkbook and there is no money left to put down here in the social security trust fund where it belongs so as a result they put it in the big government checkbook they spend all the money out of the checkbook and at the end of the year they simply make an accounting entry and put an iou down here in the trust fund it should be clear that when we say the budget is balanced what we are really saying is that this checkbook over here equals zero or if there is a surplus there is a little bit of money left in that checkbook over there so that includes this 65 billion that came from social security was put into this account it was then spent and when they say the budget is balanced that means they have spent that social security surplus as well and ious are put down here tonight when we listen to the state of the union address what i hope we will hear the president do is talk about a bill that we had proposed first 2 years ago when i first came here in 1995 to stop this and more recently last year when we generated nearly 100 sponsors here in the house of representatives the bill is called the social security preservation act it is bill number h r 857 what the social security preservation act does bill number h r 857 is it simply takes that social security money that 65 billion and puts it directly into the social security trust fund that means the social security money is not even getting into the big government checkbook what does that mean well if we go back to this other picture if we go back to this other picture where that social security money got put into the checkbook and then they spent all ther money out of the checkbook and that is what they mean by a balanced budget utilizing that social security money the checkbook is not overdrawn what that means is that if we do not put that money in the big government checkbook we put it immediately down here in the social security trust fund where it belongs that means there is still a shortfall here so when we talk about surpluses it is important to know that what they actually mean here in washington is that there is more money in the checkbook than what has been spent but part of that money is the social security money to the extent our president tonight suggests that we take that extra money and put it down here in the social security trust fund so that social security ia once again solvent for our senior citizens i think you will find not only myself but other members of this congress supporting him there is a lot of other things going on tonight i think virtually every american at this point in time knows that there are going to be distractions from this speech tonight due to some private things that are happening in his personal life we should let these facts unfold slowly take a deep breath and see what the truth is nobody wants to downplay the significance of them but they have not been proven at this point in time so for tonight let us focus on these kinds of issues that are most important and while these facts are unfolding on the other side here let us focus on doing what is right for the future of the country let us keep our eyes where they belong focused on the good of the future of this nation that we live in i think it is very very important as we discuss the social security issue that we understand that beyond the problems the president is having again i do not want to downplay them because i do not find them acceptable but beyond those problems we do have issues facing this country that are very very important to the country and we do not want to lose track and lose sight of the vision that we have for the future as it relates to social security let me suggest a vision the first vision is this we stop washington from spending the money that is supposed to be going into the trust fund we get the money put back in the trust fund that is supposed to have been put there in the first place if we were to do that by the year 2002 there would be about 1 2 trillion sitting down here to guarantee the solvency of social security to our senior citizens at that point in time that social security money is actually down here in the trust fund there is real dollars there at that point in time if somebody wants to begin a discussion about something else relating to social security i would listen to it but before that discussion even begins we need to make sure that the money is down here in the trust fund so social security is solvent for our senior citizens i have got a couple other charts that i would like to look at just briefly to kind of remind us where we are at as we focus on the state of the union address this first chart that i have here shows the growth of the national debt from 1960 all the way up to 1995 i think it is very very important we keep this picture in mind as we keep hearing these words expansion of expansion of expansion of bigger washington washington helping people as opposed to people helping themselves washington doing it as opposed to people doing what is right for themselves washington collecting the money out of the pockets of people so washington can expand their programs we need to keep this picture in mind tonight this shows the growth of debt from 1960 to 1995 you will notice the debt did not grow very much from 1960 to 1980 but from 1980 forward it has grown right off the chart again i know all the democrats say that is the year reagan was elected and all the republicans go ff the democrats had not spent all that extra money in those years we would not be in this mess the facts are it does not matter if it is a democrat or republican problem at this point in time it is an american problem because we are right at the top of that chart right now we better do something about it before it is too late i am happy to say that the growth rate has been slowed dramatically and we are in the process of changing it but when we listen to the state of the union tonight and they talk about spending this extra money let us not forget this picture the debt today in this nation is about 5 3 trillion the number rooks like this for the folks that have not seen it before if you divide that number by the number of peope in the united states of america our government is in debt 20 000 for every man woman and child in the united states of america i have got three kids and a wife at home in wisconsin for 6ur family of five that means the united states government has borrowed 100 000 here is the real kicker it is this bottom line here that is the most significant thing on here this is real debt interest is being paid on this debt a family of five like mine is literally paying 580 a month every month to do absolutely nothing but pay interest on the federal debt a lot of people say well that does not include me i am not paying that much in taxes wrong when you do something as simple as walk in a store and buy a pair of shoes for your kids the store owner makes a profit on that pair of shoes and part of that profit comes out here to washington in the form of taxes and you guessed it one out of every 6 that they send out here goes right back here to do nothing but pay interest on the federal debt this needs to be kept in mind as we listen to the state of the union tonight we do not have a surplus that is available for spending the united states government is collecting too much taxes and doing too many things in this country and we have run up this debt that needs to be addressed i would like to talk a little bit about how we got here and i think we should give credit to how different things are right now today what i have got here is a picture of the grammrudmanhollings bill of 1986 there was also one in 1985 many americans remember grammrudmanhollings many americans remember the budget deal of 1990 h26 cc all of these things were going on in the past the grammrudmanhollings of 1987 by the way they all looked the same here is the blue line that shows how the deficit was supposed to go down to zero by the year 1993 the red line shows what actually happened out here in washington promise after promise after promise was made to balance the federal budget and in fact promise after promise after promise was broken to the americanpeople in fact in 1993 they looked at this deficit in washington and washington concluded we cannot control washington spending the only thing we can do is reach into the pockets of the american people and it was in 1993 that they decilged to close this gap what they would do is reach into the pockets of the american people and take out more taxes what exactly did they do well they raised the gasoline tax by 4 3 cents a gallon they did not even spend it on building roads they raised social security taxes on seniors earning 32 000 a year or more they raised some marginal tax bracket they raised taxes period they reached into the pockets of the american people took more money out here in washington and their idea of balancing the budget was simply collecting more money from the people as opposed to controlling the growth of washington spending i think it is important as we look back and remember the past the broken promises and ithe higher taxes that we also evaluate if there is anything different from 1995 to 1998 when the republicans took over in the year 1995 we laid out a plan to get to a balanced budget and in all fairness the president signed into this plan as well again we promised the american people a balanced budget by the year 2002 the american people yawned they laughed at us they said you are just like all the rest you will not get this budget balanced again i qualify this as we started this discussion today when they say balanced budget that means the dollars in equals the dollars being spent but i am happy to say that for the first time we are not only on track to balancing the budget but in fact we have balanced the budget for the first time statistically in the books from december 1 1996 to november 30 1997 the united states government did not spend more money than they had in their checkbook in fact this red line did hit zero is there a difference here is grammrudmanhollings of the past here is what we are doing today and in fact yes there is a very big difference i hear a lot of discussion about how this happened and how this came about there are two ways to balance the budget one thing you can do is continue washington growth in spending and just let things go up out here reach into the pockets of the american people and get more money out here in washington that was the 1993 plan that was not the 1995 plan the 1995"], [0.000599980354309082, 0.9994000196456909, 1, "i rise in opposition to this amendment on behalf of the small farmers of north carolina i oppose this attack

and honoring the contributions of virgin islanders the people from the district that i represent we in the virgin islands are proud of our history the revolt by african slaves on our smallest island of st john in 1733 is one of the earliest successful revolutions in this hemisphere on st croix our own moses gottleib buddhoe along with anna heegaard were credited with playing a major role in bringing about our emancipation in 1848 more than 10 years before our sisters and brothers on the mainland in 1878 three women queen mary queen agnes and queen mathilda continued the quest for civil rights and led a firebun revolt for fair wages later in 1916 d hamilton jackson and others continued the struggle for increased rights for virgin islanders resulting in better working conditions and freedom of the press many of our firsts have largely gone unrecognized for example we had the first black female president of a unitedstates state legislature in senator ruby margaret rouss and the first africanamerican woman to be a unitedstates attorney general in jada finch sheen we look back with pride at our first elected governor dr melvin h evans the first africanamerican to be elected governor under the unitedstates flag he was also a member of congress and a member of the congressional black caucus from 1978 to 1980 my father judge almeric l christian was our first native federal district court judge we have also shared our heroes and their contributions with our nation at large before the relationship between the united states and the virgin islands began in 1917 virgin islanders migrated to the united states for education for economics or to join family and friends already located here late in the 19th century and early in the 20th renowned panafricanist edward wilmot blyden whose written works were a mainstay of africanamerican intellectuals was born on st thomas his contemporary hubert henry harrison known as the black socrates a native of st croix was wellknown for his soap box lectures in harlem his were some of the words that fueled the careers of many early workers for civil rights including marcus garvey frank r crosswaith a native of frederiksted st croix was an early crusader for the integration of negro workers in the labor movement his work channeled thousands of africanamerican workers into many unions including those in the

other average everyday americans who made their contributions to the furtherance of civil rights it is important for us to recognize that the history of africanamericans is still being written by our hands as we celebrate this month we acknowledge that there is still much to be written and let it be written that we extended health care to everyone that we educated our children well and kept them safe and that we rid our communities of drugs as we owe this to our forbearers and to those who we now nurture let it also be written that we saw to it that the celebration of our history which was

about tax relief tax relief which in my opinion and i think in the opinion and view of the vast majority of american families is long overdue we were talking earlier with some of my colleagues about college commencement addresses some of us are asked to give a commencement address during the late spring and early summer of the year and most of us do not remember who the commencement speaker was at our own commencement particularly our college commencement i am one of the few who probably does remember because the director of the united states census was there to give our commencement address when i was in college it was interesting to look back about what it was like growing up then and the difference then i was a baby boomer i was born in 1951 the speaker that spoke at our commencement address the director of the united states census told us on that day that there were more kids born in 1951 than in any other year i represent the peak of the baby boomers i remember we were talking about what it was like to grow up in the 1950s one of the important things when we talk about taxes is to remind ourselves of how much has changed since i was growing up and since the baby boomers were growing up because when i was a child i was fortunate enough my father worked in a factory i am a blue collar guy and my folks were able to raise three boys on one paycheck part of the reason they could do that was becausethe largest single payment they made was their house payment today unfortunately the average family pays more in taxes than they do for food clothing and shelter combined let me say that again because i do not know if most people really i think they know that down in their bones but i do not know if they have really internalized what that all means but the average family in america today spends more for taxes than they do for food clothing and shelter combined so this congress has been working very hard to balance the budget to save medicare and to provide tax relief to working families we are 1iaving a rather interesting debate here the last several weeks over who would really benefit from these tax cuts frankly i think we need to spend some time talking about how relatively intelligent people can reach entirely different conclusions about who benefits most from this tax relief i would like to talk a little bit today about ourtax plan our method of coming to these conclusions how we actually do the arithmetic to come to some of these conclusions and compare it to exactly how our friends on the left are doing the calculations we are talking about real income for real families and real tax relief what some of our friends on the left are using is imputed income potential taxes and potential tax relief i think if we could all use the same set of numbers whether we are going to use one set or the other if we use just the same set if we want to use their set of numbers let us go ahead and do the calculations that way and then let us do the calculations our way and let the public decide for themselves who is right who is telling the truth and whose tax relief will benefit them the most let us go through what the tax relief package that the house has passed and sent to conference is first of all the centerpiece of our tax relief package is a 500 per child tax credit a lot of people get confused between the tax credit and a tax deduction a credit is money that you get to keep if you pay taxes you get a credit that is money that will be yours at the end of the process so this is a credit it starts out at 400 next year and it would go to 500 ever year thereafter generally now the president agrees with this formula there is also nearly 35 billion in postsecondary education incentives again as a baby boomer and i have one who just graduated from high school i have one in college and one who is just starting into high school and i can understand more than anybody the high cost of higher education i think a lot of families that have children my age understand how difficult and how expensive it is to send kids on to postsecondary education i think that is a great benefit to working families there is broadbased capital gains tax relief again what we want to do is make it easier for families to save and invest for themselves this is where sometimes our friends on the left get a little upset because they say well this is tax cuts for the rich the truth of the matter is there would be some wealthy people who would benefit from it i will get down in a later chart to show you just how much benefit the congressional budget office and the joint committee on taxation say there really is for that group of people cutting capital gains is not about helping the wealthy it is about helping middleclass farhilies become wealthy because the only way that you can save and invest for your future is if you in fact put some of that money away what we want to do is make it easier for people to do that unfortunately what washington has done for the last number of years is they have operated under a sort of an unwritten rule that no good deed goes unpunished if you work you get punished if you save you get punished if you invest you get punished what we are trying to do is reverse some of those perverse incentives we also want to make it easier for people to use iras and to withdraw from those iras for educational expenses there is also a significant reduction in the death tax this is a tax that is particularly onerous to people who own a farm who own a small business they would like to leave that farm or that small business to their families so those are the cornerstones of the tax relief package that passed the house and is currently in conference committee i would like to talk a little bit about what this tax relief package means and how the various points actually are scored and who benefits accotrding to the committee on ways and means and i think these numbers have been scored both by the congressional budget office as well as the joint committee on taxation which are the official scorekeepers on matters like this this package is aimed directly at americans in the middleincome brackets in fact we say and i think we can prove that over 75 percent of the benefit in this tax plan goes to families earning less than 75 000 i want to talk about real earnings because that is also one of the problems we have in this debate because we are talking about real earnings real taxes real tax relief for real families we will get into that in just a few minutes the way this tling has been scored and if you break it out those families under 20 000 a year will benefit to the tune of about 5 5 billion in this tax relief package those between 20 000 and 75 000 will get about 83 5 billion worth of tax relief in this package families earning between 75 000 and 100 000 will get about 19 billion worth of the benefits and those earning between 100 000 and 200 000 would benefit to the tune of 6 7 billion and those earning over 200 000 would only get 1 4 billion worth of savings under this plan as i said earlier over 75 percent of the tax relief in this package goes to families earning less than 75 000 i am not saying that that is what the joint committee on taxation has said so why do we hear so often from our friends on the left that this tax package is designed to benefit those that they call rich part of the reason i think is they use something that is called imputed income or family economic income let me try to explain how that works this all started a number of years ago i think the treasury department even under the bush administration was trying to figure out a way to calculate family income in a different way why they do this i have no idea i want to read a quote from someone most of you who are watching and most of my colleagues that are here watching back in their offices will recognize i will do this first i will read the quote and then i will tell you who it is from finally a few words aboutfederal taxes and what some of the great minds at the unitedstates treasury are thinking about the treasury likes to calculate the american peoples ability to pay taxes based not on how much money we have but on how much we might have or could have had for example a family that owns a house and lives in it the treasury figures if the family didnt own the house and rented it from somebody else the rent would be 500 a month so they would add that amount 6 000 a year to the familys socalled imputed income imputed income is income you might have had but do not they dont tax you on that amount the irs doesnt play this silly game instead the treasury calculates how much they could take away from us if they decided to if that were the system consider the possibilities how about being taxed on ed mcmahons 10 million magazine lottery you didnt win it you say but you could have the treasury department must have something better to do if not there is a good place for clinton to do some spending cuts now that is what david brinkley said on this week with david brinkley on february 28 1993 and as our friend ronald reagan would say former president ronald reagan there they go again we are starting to use imputed income or family economic income to calculate how many people are wealthy that is why the difference between what the census says and what the treasury department says are so is so different the census department says there are about 11 million american families that are above 100 000 in income the treasury department says that number is 22 million americans sitting at home wonder how in the world could two federal agencies come to such incredibly different answers the reason is and the answer is family economic income or imputed income that david brinkley talked about now some of the people have said again you have probably heard it on the house floor again tax cuts for the rich but as the chairman of the joint economic committee the joint committee on taxation has said currently if you divide the population of the united states all of the taxpayers into five groups of 20 percent each the lowest 20 percent right now of the economic group in the united states pay 1 percent of all the taxes paid in america after this tax relief is calculated they will still pay only 1 percent of all the taxes paid the second quintile currently pay 4 percent of all the taxes paid in the united states and after this tax relief goes into effect they will still pay 4 percent the third quintile it is 11 percent it remains 11 percent the fourth quintile 21 and 21 and finally that top 20 percent of income earners the top 20 percent of taxpayers in the united states currently pay 63 percent of all the taxes paid in america the interesting thing is according to these calculations done by the joint committee on taxation if this tax cut plan that passed the house were to go into effect signed by the president there would be no change the top 20 percent would still pay 63 percent of all the taxes paid in america i think it is important and i will come back to this chart in a minute i want to talk about this whole notion of imputed income if you take that calculation if you take a family in fact we did a quick calculation of a family in my district if you put that all together and you can take a typical family and let us call them the joneses who live in my district that earn approximately 32 500 per year the jones mom works dad works they have a youngster that is in high school and they have one who is just entering college they make 32 500 a year that is what they really make but if you use this imputed income you literally can take that family from 32 500 a year and you can easily get that over 50 000 a year that is not money that they have that is money that they might have if they sold all their interest in their iras if they converted their pension funds to cash if they rented their house if they had a sale lease back on their house and could get the rent on their house somehow back to them it is a convoluted way to go the interesting thing is if you take that to its logical conclusion you literally could raise that family into a much higher tax bracket so if our friends on the left want to use imputed income to calculate peoples income and push more people into the wealthy brackets we are doing some calculations to find out what would they pay in terms of taxes under their tax plan with imputed income the answer is over half of the families in america if you used their calculations and their imputed income statistics over half the families in the united states of america would actually see a tax increase under the democrat tax plan that is interesting is it not that is a side of the story that has not been told the other side of the story is and we have tried to mention this but if you use imputed income to do those calculations the only people in the united states of america who may be guaranteed under their plan to get a tax cut are people who pay no taxes i submit that that is not my definition of fairness i doubt if it is the definition of fairness that most americans have i know that there is a lot in this business there is a lot of using statistics and so forth to justify a particular point of viers i do not expect the american people necessarily to believe me in fact i think the american people are cynical and they should be cynical because politicians down through the years have not always told the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth but i would encourage people to calculate the tax cut for themselves any of you who would like to get a copy of this worksheet there is one on a worldwide web page so that people can actually through their computer do their calculations themselves if you do not have access to a worldwide web page if you do not have access to the computer and the web we will actually mail one out to you if~people call us or write we will send them a worksheet so they can calculate it for themselves they can decide for themselves how much the tax relief is worth to their family it is a fairly simple calculation first of all how many children do you have in your family that are under the age of 17 you fill in the blank in 1998 you multiply that times 400 in every year thereafter you multiply it times 500 that is how much you will get to keep of your tax money line 2 amount of capital gains if you have a capital gains if you have a gain if you have sold a stock or a bond if you have income if your family income is more than 41 200 you multiply that times 8 percent because that is going to be your savings under the plan that passed the house if your family income is less than 41 200 per year you multiply that times 5 percent that is the capital gains tax relief and that is how much you will get to keep with this plan finally how many children do you have in their first 2 years of either college or vocational school those children are worth 1 500 in tax credits to you we have done some calculations for different families in our district and the differences range anywhere from obviously one child that is under 17 it is worth 400 next year but for the average family in my district this calculation works out to over 1 000 a year that that family will get to keep and spend on their family to invest and save for their future that is what this tax relief is about that is why i think it is important for america in the end one of the goals is to make certain that we have a strong economy on into the next century we have been very fortunate 2 years ago this congress when we passed our budget resolution we said that in fiscal year 1997 i am going back 2 years in 1995 this congress said that we would spend no more than 1 624 billion dollars in the fiscal year 1997 the good news is we are actually going to spend this year 1 622 billion so for the first time in my memory the congress is actually going to end up spending less than it said it was going to spend just 2 years ago the news gets even better because in that same time frame because the economy has been stronger there is more consumer confidence there is more confidence in the business community the economy has been much stronger than anyone would have predicted just 2 years ago as a result of that we have produced an additional over 100 billion in revenue to the federal treasury we have spent less we have taken in more and as a result we projected just 2 years ago the federal government would have a deficit this year of over 174 billion the truth is according to our estimates it would be about 70 billion there was a published report earlier this week that shows that the deficit could be as low as 50 billion or even less that is good news we want to make certain that that keeps going in that direction and by offering some tax relief by allowing families to keep more to spend more to save more of their money we in fact can keep this strong economy we think long into the future one of the other benefits of a strong economy is that we are moving families off welfare rolls and onto payrolls i think one of the greatest accomplishments of the 104th congress was the welfare reform that we passed that requires work that requires personal responsibility and gives the states an awful lot more latitude in how they can work to encourage people getting off the welfare rolls and onto payrolls the good news is since that welfare reform plan passed and the president talked about this a couple of weeks ago in his saturday radio broadcast the good news is there are 1 023 000 fewer families who are trapped in the welfare cycle that have moved off welfare and onto payrolls 1 023 000 fewer families are on welfare today than just 1 year ago that is a huge benefit to all of us and i have said before that the real goal of welfare reform was not about saving money even though we will save money to the federal government to the state governments and everyone else but the real goal was not about saving money the real goal was about saving people it was about saving families and most importantly it was about saving children from one more generation of dependency and despair and that is really what the welfare system was about but if we are to keep the strong economy growing we are going to have to encourage more investment we are going to have to encourage more saving and we are going to have to allow families to keep and save and spend and invest more of their own money i just want to talk briefly too about the progress we are making because sometimes it is easy to forget in the heat of the battle if we look at all of the red bars here that is how much we said that the budget would be out of balance in each of the next 7 years when we passed our original 7year budget plan in 1995 we said that the deficit for example this year would be 174 billion right now it looks like it will be less than 70 billion it could be less than 50 billion now when we update this we will probably change these numbers slightly but the good news is if we look at the blue bars in each of the years we are clearly now running well ahead of schedule and frankly i think if we can keep the economy going at anywhere near the economic growth rate that we have today we will balance the budget not by the year 2002 but in fact we will balance the budget probably by the year 2000 or maybe even earlier and when we get to that point what we have to really talk about in fact we need to begin that debate today and i congratulate my colleague the gentleman from wisconsin mr mark neumann who has offered the national debt repayment act because i think that should be our next goal it is not just about balancing the budget it has to be about paying off that 5 3 trillion worth of debt we have accrued and will fall on the shoulders of our children and our grandchildren frankly if we are willing to exercise the fiscal discipline that this congress has been willing to discipline itself to over the last several years not only could we balance the budget ahead of schedule but i think we can begin the process of actually paying off the national debt i think that that is a goal that is worth fighting for i think it is a goal that the american people can understand and i think they will recognize we can ultimately set a goal and stay on that course of actually paying off that debt so that we do not have to pay over 200 billion a year in just interest on that debt and i tell an awful lot of people back in my district when i give speeches that if we actually do all the calculations we find that all of the personal income taxes all of the personal income taxes collected west of the mississippi river now goes to pay the interest on the national debt that is a very scary statistic the tragedy is before we got to congress in 1994 the elections of 1994 that line was moving further west every single year now we are at least beginning to push that line backward and i think we should have a goal of actually paying off that debt because i think there is nothing better that we could leave our kids than a debtfree future so i encourage my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to join us in that great effort i would hope they would cosponsor the legislation of the gentleman from wisconsin the national debt repayment act because what it does is very simply it says as we begin to reach a surplus in the treasury which we think we can no later than 2002 but frankly we think if things continue to go anywhere near where we are right now it could actually be before that but when we have reached that goal and disciplined ourselves to restrict the growth in spending at 1 percent less than the growth in revenues and that does not require draconian cuts we will still see spending at the federal level growing faster than the inflation rate but it will not be growing as fast as it has in the past so if we slow the rate of growth in spending and get control of entitlements we cannot only balance the budget but we can pay off the national debt and at the same time take a third of those surpluses and apply them to additional tax relief so that american families can keep and spend more of their own money i know a lot of my republican colleagues are headed for airplanes and it is a getaway day and we are all eager to get home but i want to close by saying that i am very proud of the work that is being done in this congress i know that sometimes the american people see some of the debates and some of the arguments here on the house floor and they sometimes miss the big picture but the big picture is that before 1994 the united states and this congress was headed in the wrong direction we were spending more than we took in in fact from 1975 to 1995 for every dollar that washington took in it spent 1 22 today now we are still not quite to a balanced budget we are still spending more than we take in but we are down to 1 04 if we stay on the path we have set over the last several years we will get to that balanced budget ahead of schedule we will do it under goal and we are going to allow families to keep more of what they spend and earn because for 40 years washington had it wrong for 40 years washington believed that washington knew best that somehow they could spend money smarter than american families that a federal department of housing was better than a family department of housing that a federal department of human services was better than a family department of human services now there are still legitimate needs of the federal government and thereare still people who are dependent on the federal government and we are not talking about pulling the rug out from under people but we are talking about people getting a little gentle nudge so that we reinforce some of those timetested principles things like faith family work thrift and personal responsibility those are the things i think americans want us to underscore but for too long under the liberal agenda what we did was we undermined those values the good news is i think the tide is turning the tide is clearly turning we are on our way to a balanced budget we are saving medicare and for the first time in 16 years we are going to allow families to keep and save and invest and spend more of their own money that is the direction i think the american people want us to go that is the direction we are going and with the help of the american people we are going to

areas of critical need to our nation and people instead the gop majority has opted to put forth a measure which will force massive cuts in areas important to our nations future such as health care child care education and the environment this is not governing this republican budget clearly demonstrates irresponsibility abandons the promise to save social security first kills important investments in our childrens future and clearly neglects the american people the majority budget resolution will cut an additional 101 billion below last years budget agreement in peoples programs although the republican rhetoric attempts to characterize such cuts as simply being i cent out of every dollar over the next 5 years the reality is much more alarming than their rhetoric would lead americans to believe it takes billions from peoples programs medicaid tanf education veterans medical benefits crime fighting efforts and natural resources furthermore the gop budget does not add up at a time when our country is in its greatest period of economic growth when the budget deficit is on the way to elimination due to the major work done by the democratic majority in congress and president clinton in 1993without a single gop voteand a surplus of 40 billion is projected this year 1998 congress should be seizing this opportunity we should offer a 1999 budget which invests in working families and provides the tools and resources that increase the ability of all people to thrive in our nations booming economy and has a paramount focus on insuring social security and medicares longterm viability instead we have a gop budget that miserably fails this test and our country the proposals contained in this budget resolution continue the republicans war against health care last year congress set our medicare reductions of 115 billion for five years initial provisions in this years gop budget proposal sought more than 22 billion in yet new cuts to medicare and medicaid on top of what is already set out in law the republicans planed to use these new cuts to finance a tax cut for americas wealthiest taxpayers only after intense criticism from within their own party and democrats the gop leadership opted to drop the medicare cuts but not the cuts which savage medicaid and the new childrens health care program this change relays a negative message to the elderly and the low income families and the disabled who were promised and deserve quality health care the republican budget cuts 5 billion from natural resources and environmental protection programs this is money that could be used for the environmental protection agency superfund our national parks national forests and wildlife refuges protecting endangered species and funding important environmental cleanup protecting the environment and preseiving the earths natural resources should be a top priority in congress a close look at this budget leads to the conclusion that the gop majority is indifferent to its stewardship responsibilities to this nation and land last years balanced budget agreement explicitly assumed full funding for all section 8 housing expiring contracts through 2002 however this years budget fails to maintain the number of households who currently receive assistance by refusing to allocate funding for existing section 8 contracts as they expire this simply is a broken promise failure to renew expiring contracts will not only reduce the number of assisted households it could force currently assisted tenants to face sharp rent increases displacement or eviction in response to the concerns of the growing number of people whose section 8 housing contracts that are scheduled to expire the republicans included no outlays for that purpose in their budget virtually making the budget authority unusable furthermore according to the congressional budget office a freeze in renewing section 8 contracts would ultimately mean one million households would lose federal housing vouchers and certificates by 2003 today rental housing assistance provides section 8 tenantbased and projectbased programs to over 3 million households fortysix percent of this total are working class families with children and 32 are elderly this will force needy persons into the streets and into homelessness in additi6n the republican plan slashes education programs by 5 7 billion over the next 5 years it eliminates direct federal funding to school district by repealing title i grants and suggests that such programs be made into some sort of vouchers these grants are essential in providing supplementary education and related services in lowachieving children attending schools with relatively high concentrations of pupils from lowincome families these additional cuts deprive our elementary and secondary schools of much needed resources that could be used for more teachers in our classrooms and internet access for all schools furthermore the republican budget freezes every program it does not cut specifically veterans medical care law enforcement superfund and head start this adds up to real cuts when even a lowered inflation rate will depreciate the level support provided in this budget blueprint the reality is that 40 of these cuts impact hard working lowincome families that deserve our help and encouragement not the shabby treatment accorded in this gop budget blueprint moreover just last night the republicans dropped a special provision allowing congress to use the anticipated budget surpluses on a convoluted untested proposal offered by the speaker private retirement accounts such accounts are a unilateral premature partisan maneuver that is intended to superimpose this idea in place of a bipartisan agreement to truly strengthen and save soiall security first deciding now to use the surpluses for tax incentive private accounts before addressing social securitys longterm problems would siphon off resources that will be needed to maintain the solvency of the social security trust fund budget surpluses should be reserved until a social security commission the president and the congress address the longterm requirements of social security this represents just another step in the republican agenda to eliminate the social security insurance program and squander away the projected budget surplus upon half baked schemes while abandoning the specifics it is still the intent of this budget to tax expend the dollars so one bad idea may just be replaced with another and have a similar impact of disregarding the commitment to save social security first overall this budget fails to meet the needs of the american people the republicans are a majority in congress it is their responsibility to put forward a plan that can actually be implemented and to govem because the republican plan cuts so deeply and unfairly and because it deviates so markedly from last years bipartisan budget agreement it hopefully stands little chance of being implemented attempts to implement it will ensure confrontation with the gop senate presidential opposition and a strong no vote from most democrats after forty five days late without a budget proposal the nation has a right to expect the gop congress to step forward with a sound budget plana budget that is not just another political partisan scheme loaded with the tax break promises for special interest groups more punitive punishing cuts on the working poor and undercutting retirement health and education programs so vital to ourconstituents and nations future it seems that this gop led congress would blow a free lunch after they were handed a working model crafted by the gutsy votes of 1993 clinton democrat congress that proposal has changed the economic path from deficits as far as the eye can see to an economic path based upon sound economics and a surplus this year and hopefully in to the future here we go again after last years tax breaks and budget deal the gop majority reneges in the name of an election issue the republicans attempt to break the 1997 budget agreement and attempt to make a virtue of tax breaks for the special interests and breaking faith with social security and medicare make no mistake about it this will break the budget this is the same old gop tax break siren song that the band plays when the

concerning patient protection legislation it has been clear all along that there were major differences that needed to be worked out between the patient bill of rights the bill that i supported a bipartisan bill sometimes referred to as the democratic bill and the republican bill the patient protection act but it seemed as if at least there was some consensus on some of the basic fundamentals for instance a laypersons definition of emergency or for instance provisions related to privacy however as i warned several of my gop colleagues be careful in voting for the republican bill the patient protection act we may find that it is a pig in a poke because of the legislative language today i would draw my colleagues attention to an article in the new york times by robert pear common ground on patient rights hides a chasm looking at the details of the house republican plan shows that there are major differences even in areas where it seemed as if the two sides were in agreement for instance both sides were saying we are for a laypersons definition for emergency care we both agree in the privacy of patient records when members start to read the details of the republican plan i think they are going to be surprised for instance it would have seemed easy to have achieved consensus on a laypersons definition of an emergency after all this congress passed a year ago or in the 104th congress a provision on the laypersons definition for medicare a federal health program that provides for 38 million people but when we read the fine print of the house republicans bill the patient protection act which was introduced by the gentleman from georgia and passed 8 days later by a vote of 216tol0 we find out that there are some significant differences the patient bill of rights would require hmos and insurance companies to cover emergency services for subscribers without the need for any prior authorization regardless of whether the doctor or hospital was affiliated with the patients health plan emergency services as defined in the bill include a medical screening examination to evaluate the patient and further treatment that may be required to stabilize that patients conditions the hmo would have to cover those services if a prudent layperson who possesses an average knowledge of health and medicine could reasonably expect an absence of immediate medical attention to cause serious harm by contrast the house and senate republican bills would establish a twostep test an hmo or insurance company would have to cover the initial screening examination if a prudent layperson would consider it necessary but the health plan would have to pay for additional emergencies only if a prudent emergency medical professional would judge them necessary and under the gop bill the patient protection act the need for such services must be certified in writing by an appropriate physician the speaker said the republican bill would guarantee coverage for anyone who has a practical laymans feeling that they need emergency care but that is not what is really in the bill that bill was rushed through at the last minute there were no hearings on the bill and so what we have is a situation where the provisions that we passed in medicare for a laypersons definition have been significantly watered down there is no guarantee in the republican bill that the cost ultimately for a patient going to the emergency room with crushing chest pain severe pain would in the end be covered by their hmo the congressional budget office estimates that the patient bill of rights would require hmos to pay for emergency room visits in half the cases where they now deny payment it says the charge for emergency care outside the hmo is typically 50 percent higher than hospitals in the hmo network remember when we look at the details of the gop plan there is a provision in there that says one has to go to the hmo hospital or else one could be left with a large large

mentioned on the floor here a number of times that the united states only has a small fishingfleet related to tuna fish the reason for that is that our fishing fleet virtually became extinct because of the embargo that we have placed on importing tuna using encirclement of dolphins now while we want to protect the dolphins and this legislation will in fact protect the dolphins duke cunningham and a number of other people along the southern coast of southern california also wanted to protect the livelihood of individuals that fished throughout the pacific ocean especially the eastern tropical pacific ocean to pay their mortgages and raise their children and have a quality of life and standard of living that all of us would want to achieve and because of the mismanagement of the legisla tion and because of the lack of ability to come to an international agreement most of those people lost their jobs so what happens do we ignore that i think we as human beings are intelligent enough to do two things provide jobs for people that need to extract natural resources and also protect those natural resources and that is exactly what this legislation does a number of people on the other side of the aisle mentioned numerous times that dolphin deaths have been reduced down to about 2 500 the reason for that is the agreement reached by these 12 countries which the united states needs to now become a partnership with these other 11 countries countries like belize columbia costa rica equador france honduras mexico panama and spain how do we treat these other countries in the international community do we insult them or do we treat them with dignity and respect can we solve all the worlds environmental problems alone just the united states or do we need to have some sense of responsibility on this globe to have an agreement with our neighbors we cannot solve the environmental problems for this world in the united states alone we need international agreements this international agreement does the two things that we need to have done it provides jobs for people it raises their standard of living and it also protects the environment this protects the marine ecosystem by looking at it as a complete system now my colleagues have mentioned a number of times that the dolphin deaths have been reduced dramatically and yes that is correct because of the panama agreement this was under the marine mammal protection act when just the united statesadhered to it if you look at the chart over here each one of these dolphins represents 5 000 deaths this is under our environmental regulations themarine mammal protection act but wecould not do it alone this is what it looks like now with this agreement with 12 countries involved in understanding yes these 12 countries are going along way into understandfng the mechanics of natural processes we have to do that the next frontier on this planet is not space the next frontier is understanding how we live on this planet with a bulging population we cannot do anything about that with all our neighbors bulging even more than this country trying to understand how we can fit in with the limited resources with more people catching fewer fish we need to produce more fish and this is the agreement that will do that i would like to just go ov r some of the charges from the other side our state department our state department our unitedstates state department negotiated this deal not some foreign country our state department negotiated this deal with mutual respect for the countries involved the gentleman from hawaii said that we knuckled under to the state department because we would not negotiate a change of words in the agreement well the two words that mr abercrombia is talking about is shall and mr abercrombia wanted the word shall the agreement says the word should we looked into that and it is uhconstitutional for the unitedstates constitution to tell the state department you shall do this it is just a matter of semantics now the label dispute if you pick up a can of tuna fish i do not happen to have one right here but if you pick up a can of tuna fish it has a little dolphin on it that dolphin means that that can of tuna fish is dolphin safe but in all practicality nobody in the eastern tropical pacific the western tropical pacific or anywhere in the pacific ocean knows whether or not any of those tuna fish were caught without killing dolphins there are no observers there are no observers anywhere so we just simply do not know the present regime of dolphin safe is specific to a gear or a fishing technique it has nothing to do with whether or not dolphins were killed what we tried todo in our bill or what we do in our bill is to ensure that every single boat that sells tuna fish in the united states whether they are from panama or france or belize or mexico or anywhere every single boat must have a licensed biological observer on board and if he or she observes a dolphin being killed they cannot label that dolphin safe the gentlewoman from oregon talked about the stress of dolphins i want to show my colleagues the stress of bycatch without this legislation if you look you will see sharks you will see sea turtles you will see juvenile tuna fish you will see a whole range of marine mammals this is not stress this is death now about the stress of dolphins being encircled the national science foundation in 1992 found absolutely no evidence that dolphins were stressed when they were encircled and then pushed out of the back of the net california at berkeley biologists found no evidence of stress in the dolphins and yet we have put into this bill 31 million to further study this issue and if we find out that there is any stress at all then we are going to

which was prompted by the decision to close the glenview naval air station has been to increase by about 30 minutes the time it takes for a coast guard air rescue helicopter to reach the chicago lakefront in the case of an emergency moreover that rescue helicopter is now 1520 minutes further removed from the area north of chicago an area featuring over 60 lakes and one of americas most popular recreational waterways not to mention miles of lake michigan shoreline often frequented by boating enthusiasts as a matter of fact over 25 000 boating permits have been issued in the fox riverchain o lakes area of northeastern illinois alone the significance of these figures is this thousands of people boating near or flying over one of the most heavily populated areas of america are at greater risk than they were a year ago not only is the uscgs rescue helicopter further away but it can operate anywhere over lake michigan whereas the local policy boats and fire department helicopters usually stay within 4 miles of shore also there are two other considerations first whenever the uscg helicopter does come down to the chicago area for a search and rescue mission it cannot remain aloft as long as it did previously before it has to refuel second the uscg personnel manning that helicopter have more specialized training and equipment than do the dedicated people who operate local police boats and rescue helicopters since any one of these considerations could delay or otherwise compromise efforts to rescue people from the waters of lower lake michigan the fox river the chain o lakes and or the other lakes that dot northeastern illinois and southeastern wisconsin i think you can understand why so many people in or near that area are concerned about the basing of this uscg helicopter rescue unit to them that unit represents the margin between life and death in the event of a serious boating or airplane accident the potential for which has become increasingly apparent lately during the past year no less than 26 people have died in those waters compared to four the year before nine of those fatalities resulted from airplane crashes over lake michigan a sobering indication of what could happen if a commercial jet headed to or from either ohare airport or midway were to suffer a similar fate in such a circumstance we would want all available rescue resources on the scene as soon as possible just as we would in the event a sightseeing boat were to sink or an aircraft were to disappear but so long as the uscgs helicopter rescue unit continues to be based in a more thinly populated area across the lake 85 miles from waukegan one of those resourcesthat unitmay not be able to arrive in a timely fashion for that reason i would

less tian candid with the american people he has said that he wants to save the surplus to save social security what he really means is that he will save whatever is left of the surplus for social security after he gets all the additional spending he wants for other programs he will not use the surplus for tax cuts perhaps that is the right policy but he should own up to the fact that he is spending the surplus on other government programs the amount available to strengthen social security will be reduced by at least 20 billion in this legislation i know that negotiations between a

upper hand he knew that it was the end of the session and congress must adjourn so he demanded funding for his priorities that he could not pay for within the budget agreement congress was up against the wall and the solution was to spend more money on the presidents priorities and also spend more money on congressional priorities that is no way to govern we are setting a bad precedent and setting the stage for more increases in spending next year and the year after i dont deny that much of what is in this bill is worthwhile there is increased spending for medical research for education for antidrug efforts and to improve readiness in our armed forces if these things are needed the president and congress should tell the american people they are needed now and that we are going to use part of the surplus to pay for them we should reopen the budget agreement and set new spending caps but that is not what we are doing we are designating 20 billion of this new spending as emergency spending to get around the budget caps thank goodness the surplus is projected to be at least 80 billion in 1999 because we are spending 20 billion of it right here the president has not told the american people the full story on what he wants to do with the surplus but congress is also to blame by delaying these eight bills until the end of the session and giving the president the opportunity to set up the most expensive exit toll in recent memory a better alternative to this omnibus bill would be to pass a continuing resolution for fiscal year 1999 that fund these programs at the 1998 levels we could pass emergency appropriations for the most pressing needs of the farmers other natural disasters and possible bosnia operations at less than half the cost of the 20 billion in this bill if more spending is needed for other priorities such as the year 2000 problem or bosnia operation there should be a legitimate effort to offset that spending with other reductions in lower priority programs i helped put together a list of possible offsets they were not perfect but they did offer some options we should come back next year and craft a new budget agreement that saves social security and then recognizes whatever is left of the revised surplus and uses that for a balanced plan of debt reduction spending on other priorities like education and affordable fair tax reductions in addition we should make emergency spending part of the budget and set aside funds each year for emergencies a budget reserve account or rainy day fund is a better way to fund emergencies we know will occur each year this legislation is necessary to fund our govemment but lets not pretend that it is a great victory it is a bad compromise that relies totally on the surplus to hide an increase in spending that violates the budget agreement it may be necessary to avoid a stalemate that causes a government shutdown but it is no great policy victory we have taken the first step down the slippery slope back toward irresponsible spending i hope we learn a less from this flawed process return to sound budget practices and protect the balanced budget"], [0.00022470951080322266,

are in fact going to introduce real competition into the video marketplace the cable company remains largely a monopoly in 97 percent of our country the telephone companies after promising in the 1996 telecommunications act that they were going to by the year 2000 provide a second wire second video service in almost every community in america have pulled back from that commitment i think that in this satellite area though we have a real potential to provide an alternative not just for rural not just for the most suburban communities in america but for urban america and i think that in exploring this whole question of whether or not a local television station here in washington channel 4 5 7 9 and 50 can be carried by a satellite and beamed right back into the homes in that viewing area holds the key to whether or not we are going to give consumers cable consumers disgruntled unhappy cable consumers across this country the ability to just disconnect their cable company and instead just subscribe to an 18inch satellite dish service with the local broadcast stations as well i have introduced with the leadership of the gentleman from louisiana"], [0.00022745132446289062, 0.5002274513244629, 0, "i yield myself such time as i may consume this is a continued discussion about the way the house should be run if you will recall in our discussions yesterday and today on the rule the last time the democrats controlled the house the funds for the committee total were about 223 million notwithstanding the more than 5220 million the resources available to the minority and the total number of staff were always an argumentative point one of the concerns that a number of us in the minority had was congress after congress when the ranking member would appear before the thencommittee on house administration the chairman of the committee would say well i would like to give my friend on the other side of the aisle what he is asking for but of course it cannot come out of our resources the only way the members of the minority would be able to get the one additional staffer which would then raise the number that the minority would have from five to six would be to increase the committee budget so that they could pay for that staffer what happened over a number of congresses was that the staff on the committees grew ostensibly to provide the minority with some assistance but for some reason congress after congress with the exception of just a couple of committees notably transportation agriculture and several committees armed services historically in which it was a pooled staff rather than a majorityminority staff the resources available to the minority crept if at all very very slowly up the ladder i told members yesterday that the committee on the judiciary in the 103d congress provided the munificent percentage of 11 percent to the minority then house committee on house oversight provided 15 percent on and on and on of percentage of the staff in the teens but the staff continued to grow now members need to know that of a committee budget 85 to 90 percent of the funds of the committee are invested in the staff and so no one wants to hold their staff at no increase so you ask for a cost of living a cost of living was voted by the committee but then that was used to hire more staff so you increased your base and you came back the next year and asked for more money you increased the base what happened was we had a bloated staff structure on the committee but an enormously inequitable distribution of the staff we asked the democrats would they please begin to address it in 1990 the democratic caucus met discussed and in their caucus without any republicans to discuss how much we would like to make a change the democrats on their own behind closed doors voted that the ceiling the ceiling for republicans on investigative staff would be 20 percent and yet there was committee after committee that never even came close to the 20 percent so when we became the majority in the historic 104th congress we said we would doat least two things first cut the committee staffs we believed we could do the job and i think we proved it in the 104th with the unprecedented pieces of legislation that were moved through the committees and our continued ability to do the committee work with significantly reduced staffs what we see on this chart portrayed graphically is what we did we went from more than 1 600 staff down to less than 1 100 more than 600 staff in one day lopped off of the committee structure we reduced committee staff by onethird mindful of when we were in the minority however and our desire to have a sufficient number of staff to do the job in a fair way we said notwithstanding this red line being the democratic caucus agreement to have a ceiling on republican investigative staff at 20 percent and notwithstanding this line which was the historic percentage of the republicans share of that bloated staff we said we are going to cut the staff by onethird but we wanted to commit ourselves to a goal of sharing not just the staff but the total resources of the committees so once again in the 104th congress we said we wanted to set a goal of onethird of the resources of the committees that would be provided to the minority we wanted to accomplish in a relatively short period of time what we wanted them to provide us when we were in the minority and so in 1 day the resources to the minority as a share of the committee funding went from here to there it is fairly easy to see that that is 29 percent it is not onethird there were some committees that made it very easy to achieve onethird the democratic chairman moved over to the ranking member and the ranking member became the chairman the committee on agriculture became a good example it was onethird before and it is onethird now but those committees that provided resources to the minorities of 11 percent of 12 percent of 14 percent we have to grow that amount we have provided unprecedented percentages in the committee that we were discussing the committee on government reform and oversight prior to the republican majority it was 15 percent today it is 25 they are complaining of course that 25 is not 33 had in previous congresses the chairmen of those committees provided the minority with onethird they would have onethird today our crime is not making every committee at the same time onethird can my colleagues imagine the kinds of comments we would hear on this side of the aisle in terms of increasing the funds to do that we are committed to it we are moving every congress in that direction we are growing the minoritys share and we will continue to grow it until it is onethird for every committee of all the resources let me spend just a minute because the gentleman from virginia used this and i want to make sure my colleagues understand what it represents because it is a classic example on the part of my friends on the other side of the aisle of baitandswitch in the 103d congress we had the committee on government operations the committee on post office and civil service and the committee on the district of columbia those were three separate committees with bloated staff when we added up the budgets of those committees it equaled 26 6 million when we as the new majority collapsed committees and shrank the staff these three committees became one the committee on government reform and oversight and it was funded at 13 5 million fifty percent of the previous congress my good friend from pennsylvania our former colleague bill clinger became chairman and he said i just do not have enough resources i have to deal with all these jurisdictional areas and i just do not have enough helping hands we listened we watched we believed that to be the case so what we decided to do in this congress was to increase the amount that the committee was to receive that is the 2 7 million we said we will go up to 61 percent of what the committee used to have not even threequarters of what the committee had not even twothirds of what it had but only 60 percent of what it had then not at our doing not at our doing we began to discover what had been going on during last years election at the white house in the democratic national committee and in other areas there was a clear call for an investigation there was even an editorial in roll call last january which said although they are hearing cries of campaign finance reform it is probably a good idea to investigate first to find out what happened so that with knowledge we have the ability to legislate so we said all right we do not know how long this will go on we will take 3 8 million for 1997 alone and provide it to the committee with the jurisdiction overseeing the executive branch which is the committee on government reform and oversight so my friends the complaints on this side of the aisle are that we are taking three committees who would have shared that jurisdiction which in the 103d congress was provided with 26 6 milion and we are in the 105th congress providing that collapsed new committee with 20 million that is still only 75 percent of the resources when they have been asked to take on this much larger job than was available in the 103d congress my colleagues are complaining that we are increasing a committee yes we are increasing a committee over the 104th because we underfunded it we are new to this job we will admit we are going to make mistakes occasionally i will tell my colleagues what we have pledged when we make mistakes we will admit it and when we correct it we will correct it in public then we will go on and if we make mistakes again we will admit them and then we will correct them what we are admitting is that we underfunded this committee we are going to put a little more money in it and we are going to make sure they have minimum dollars to go ahead and carry out an investigation with which they have been charged what we have before us today is a funding resolution that makes this change that as i said instead of putting moneys into committees to have staff it creates a reserve fund so that if we have a job that was not anticipated at the beginning of the congress and we did not fund for it that money could be moved to that committee to do the job when the job is finished they will not get to keep the staff they will not get to grow their bloated committees and that money comes back to the reserve fund so it can be spent somewhere else when needed and if not needed it is not spent now that is a more perfect system so that we do not let the committees grow themselves but that we do have enough money to meet the needs of a congress over a 2year period that is what we are voting on today the other 18 committees that we have as standing committees now are going to be retained at their previous funding level we will come back in 30 days and we will examine how we fund those for the rest of the 105th i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.00024205446243286133, 0.49975794553756714, 1, "i thank the gentleman for yielding this time i wanted to ask a question of
