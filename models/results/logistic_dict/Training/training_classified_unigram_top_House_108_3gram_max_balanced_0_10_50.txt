such time as i may consume during consideration of this resolution all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only on tuesday the committee on rules met and granted a modified closed rule for the marriage penalty relief act h r 4181 amends the internal revenue code of 1986 to permanently extend the increased standard deduction and the 15 percent individual income tax rate bracket expansion for married taxpayers filing joint returns it will also make permanent the increase in the phaseout of the earned income credit for joint filers before 2001 the tax code penalized many married couples by forcing them to pay higher taxes just because they were married the 2001 tax relief bill enacted by president bush brought fairness to the tax code by phasing out these penalties this law increased the standard deduction in the 15 percent tax bracket for married couples to twice as much for individuals the relief was accelerated in the tax relief that was signed into law last year thirtyfive million couples currently benefit from the elimination of the marriage penalty however this relief will be reduced next year and will expire in 2010 and we cannot let that happen unless the relief is extended 27 million married couples will face an average tax increase of 300 in 2005 and over 35 million will see a tax increase of more than 700 starting in 2011 h r 4181 ensures that the marriage penalty relief is not reduced next year and that it stays in the law permanently we all know our economy is starting to rebound businesses are beginning to hire workers again and americans are starting to spend their money with more confidence if we do not eliminate the marriage tax penalty and prevent other tax increases our economy might slow down and prevent job creation married working couples will be able to use this tax relief to benefit their families which always helps the economy they will be able to spend this money to improve their home or buy something they want like a ndw washing machine or a new tv and the more money they spend the more jobs they will help create for their neighbors and friends this is what the bill is all about the most important thing we can do today is revitalize our economy here at home and we do this by eliminating the marriage penalty tax to that end i urge my colleagues to support the rule and the underlying bill i reserve the balance

out of the pockets of working families so that they may line the pockets of their fat cat friends this budget is a betrayal to working families across america to seniors veterans and especially to our children and grandchildren who will be left to clean up this administrations fiscal disaster i am amazed that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have managed to turn record surpluses into record deficits in a mere three years this budget does nothing to remedy the situation and continues further down the same road by using a 5year budget instead of a traditional 10year budget my republican colleagues are attempting to hid the real costs of their outrageous plan after five years the cost of making the tax giveaways permanent will grow drastically over the next ten years the tax giveaways in this plan will cost 1 2 trillion my republican colleagues will not even apply the payasyougo method to their tax giveaways because they know we cannot afford them these budget gimmicks and rascality cannot be tolerated the american people deserve to know the outrageous credit card bills the bush administration is racking up in their name and with their credit in addition this budget does nothing to protect the social security trust fund five years from when the first of the baby boomer generation reach retirement age these republicans fiscal mismanagement will squander the entire 1 trillion social security surplus adding to the ballooning deficit and throwing the long term economic security of millions of americans into doubt the republican budget doesnt provide any money this year to protect medicaid in fact it cuts the program as a result states are going to be forced to cut benefits and coverage for the more than 50 million of our most vulnerable seniors children pregnant women working families and disabled americans who rely on medicaid for vital healthcare services more than 3 7 million have already lost coverage under bushs watch we should be shoring up the programs that provide health insurance coveragenot cutting them on the medicare side republicans offer no proposals to improve the inadequate and disingenuous medicare drug benefit enacted last year just yesterday a new stud concluded that the medicare hospital fund will be bankrupt in 2019 seven years sooner than predicted a year ago partly due to the new benefit which funnels money into private health plans also absent from this budget are other proposals that could improve the medicare program such as funding for increase nursing home staffing and quality improvement or fixing the flawed payment system for doctors nor are there any proposals to protect the medicare program from being overcharged and defrauded by private insurance companies and health maintenance organizations and of course there is the similarly outrageous effort of this white house to hide from both democratic and republicans the true cost of their medicare privatization bill which truly makes me wonder whether any of their budget numbers can be trusted in education no child left behind is already dramatically underfunded and this budget will continue this indignity we cannot leave the states to pick up the tab for this federally mandated program special education after school programs teacher training pell grants perkins loans and vocational education are all either frozen or cut under this dreadful budget i wonder if my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are trying to ensure that public schools fail so they can privatize the entire system this budget continues the republican war on the environment the president and republicans will try to sound like they are environmentalists but the truth is in this budget which contains drastic cuts to major environmental protection programs budget cuts will be felt in a variety of areas including enforcement inspections less money available than needed for safe drinking water inadequate funding for cleanups of superfund sites and leaking underground storage tanks and fewer brownfields grants than authorized by the new law signed two years ago my colleagues would rather give tax cuts to their buddies than invest in clean air clean water and cleaning up toxic waste sites for the next five years the republican budget provides 10 5 percent less than what is needed just to maintain services at the current level more noteworthy their funding levels in 2009 will still be 901 million below the 2004 enacted level my republican colleagues obviously fail to keep our nations commitment to a healthy environment our troops and veterans are also betrayed by this draconian budget we made a promise to our service men and women serve your country and we will take care of you this budget is yet another promise broken by this administration and republican congress these men and women are willing to risk their lives for this country and this congress and president will not even guarantee basic benefits for healthcare and housing we cannot treat our men and women in uniform with such disregard and disrespect particularly during this time of war we must treat our veterans and soldiers with the utmost honor and dignity thirty thousand veterans are waiting six months or longer for an appointment at a va hospital this is a total outrage and this budget does nothing to help in fact this budget raises healthcare costs for up to 1 million veterans in addition my republican colleagues refuse to eliminate the disabled veterans tax which forces disabled military retirees to give up one dollar of their pension for every dollar of disability pay they receive the republican budget continues to require nearly 400 000 military retirees with serviceconnected disabilities to continue to pay the disabled veterans tax i strongly support the democratic budget and urge my colleagues to do the same because it will keep the promise we made to the american peopleunlike the budget being served up by our republican colleagues the democratic alternative will cut the deficit in half by 2007 and balance the budget by 2012 the democratic alternative matches the administration request for defense spending and adds funding for homeland security we need to get back to fiscal responsibility and get the nations economy back on track we need to take care of our veterans and our children and our environment we need to make sure our citizens have healthcare and education opportunities the democratic budget is responsible and sensible and i urge my colleagues regardless of party to support

commitment to sharing what we need to share with the american people as members of congress i think it is also important for us to remember that when we combine all these budgets together that we had a deficit before we went into iraq and i just have to continue to say that to the members of this congress and to the american people because some would lead us to believe that iraq got us into the situation where we are now but we will talk about a trillion dollar tax cut for the top i percent of americans and i must add that everyone in america has given and contributed to this war whether it be a child or a husband or a son or a daughter going to iraq to fight in this effort the president said there has been an end to major fighting i think there is major fighting going on as we speak we just lost three soldiers just today in iraq but i just want to get back to the dollars and cents i care about it because not only am i concerned about what is happening to this country domestically and i am concerned about homeland security but i am also concerned about the money that local governments are spending on behalf of homeland security the frontland security there in their cities that is not going into the things that work towards the very fiber of our country and work towards the very reason why we are americans we care about one another we care about what happens to our elderly we care about what happens to our children we care about having an honest and fair education and good public education for our children but while we are carrying out this effort that we are carrying out now with no questions answered and you better not ask a question or we will test your patriotism this is dangerous to the country but back once again to the dollars and cents the bush administration has not explained how we are going to pay for this in the long run outside of borrowing the money and making the deficit even larger and deeper the department of education in this years budget 59 7 billion transportation 51 5 billion homeland security my colleagues homeland security american people 35 8 billion the supplemental cost for the war just blows all these numbers off the table we are asking for 87 billion or the administration is asking for 87 billion now we are not asking for 87 billion to help local governments foot the bill for homeland security we are not asking for 87 billion for states to be able to protect the ports our deepwater ports that we have now we are not asking for 87 billion to bring about safe air travel here in the united states i believe someone needs to be marching to the hill to ask for 87 billion for leave no child behind for public education in this country anyone that hits the floor to say that we have to fight the war on terror in iraq so we do not have to fight the war on terror here in the united states i kind of question that thinking because i do not believe the terrorists are saying well as long as unitedstates troops are in iraq we do not have to try to penetrate the united states or we do not have to try to carry out terrorist attacks here in the united states i must say that you can pick up any newspaper now or watch any news show that says that terrorism has increased in iraq since our presence there but the red question is where is the exit plan no one has an exit plan no one wants to talk about the exit plan and i think it is important that the american people understand that we are going beyond we break it and we fix it because now with this 87 billion we are going into a new era i see my colleague the gentlewoman from texas who i am going to be yielding to in about 4 minutes because i know she has quite a bit to say about what is going on in the white house with some of the questions that have been brought about agents lives being at stake because of political terms or whatever the case may be and so we can get into that discussion but i must say that in the spring of this year we gave this administration with no questions asked a 79 billion blank check no strings attached we do not really know what the administration has spent that 79 billion on when you ask a question it is almost like how can you question me you talk to the defense department and it is we will get back to you you talk to individuals at the state department and you may or may not get a return phone call and if you do get a return phone call they are not answering the questions now the administration comes again and asks for 87 billion this congress still has not been told of what we spent the first 79 billion on our committee on appropriations will meet on this thursday i would hope that the bush administration will come forward to the congress and share with the american people and the people that they elected to serve in this congress number one what happened to the 79 billion number two with the anticipated 87 billion what is really going to happen with that and will they be back in the future to ask for more early in the spring the president and others were running around here talking about shock and awe but in the 6 months since the preemptive strike against iraq only the american people have been shocked and awed we have been shocked and awed by 79 billion and i have to keep saying it we were shocked by the fact that over 45 000 troops did not have body armor when they went on this effort in iraq that we could not armor our bradley fighting vehicles that many of the injuries at walter reed hospital and at bethesda hospital right now troops that are probably watching us on the floor right now should have had and which could have avoided their injuries the american people have been awed by decreasing jobs that are at record rates at tax cuts for the top 1 percent americans or the richest americans in this country at record rates the american people have been in shock at how easy the administration has underfunded its own program the leave no child behind that they have left millions without health insurance and watched crime increase at a rate that even makes the most patriotic american dizzy the american people are in awe at how the vice president and many others in this administration as it relates to halliburton so easily gained 3 billion in iraq contracts in just 4 months the american people are awed by the fact that 180 troops have lost their lives and another 1 400 have been seriously injured since the president made his inspirational landing on the unitedstatess lincoln to announce the end of major fighting the american people have been shocked that state and local governments are strapped to the tune of over 70 billion but the president is willing to spend over 8 billion in a foreign land the american people are also awed by the request of over 80 billion in additional spending once again the middle class are left behind we are also shocked that soldiers are ducking bullets in iraq for 26 000 or less a year but they cannot take part in the child tax credit to help their families here in the unitedstates that is a major shock and awe to the american people that this congress and this administration would leave those families behind the american people are also awed by the cost of just this single supplemental that dwarfs the money the president and this administration have asked for as it relates to homeland security for the entire year we are also shocked by the lack of diplomacy expressed by the bush administration as it jets around the globe telling countries how they should be in good grace with us versus other countries the president went to the u n and i must add this where in the new york times it reveals that he went to the u n and one would assume that after all this major effort against terrorism in iraq after going after this person that possessed chemical weapons of mass destruction which at the time in this very chamber we were led to believe in the state of the union address that these chemical weapons were going to be used and we prayed along with the american people that our troops would be safe because chemical warfare was a major concern because of what the president as he stood in the well where the speaker is now and expressed this to us and we also thought that there was some link between 9 11 and iraq and now all of that has evolved to be misleading statements well the president went to the u n and we were thinking the president would go back after we told the u n to kind of step aside and allow us to take care of things and we went with the willing which was very few willing he went back and really no one reacted to the president because of our unwillingness to use diplomacy i said here on the floor the last time i was here that cowboy politics is not going to get us where we need to be it is not just politics it is americas future i yield to the gentlewoman from texas"], [1.895427703857422e-05, 0.9999810457229614, 1, "i thank the distinguished ranking member for yielding me this time he is extremely kind i came to the floor on several very brief points one i would like to associate myself with the outstanding work of the democratic caucus and the substitute budget that is going to be offered by the gentleman from south carolina and our caucus let me also associate myself with the congressional black caucus budget resolution because it embraces if you will the understanding that we are all our brothers and sisters keeper let me just say to my colleagues that in listening to the 91 testimony one of the key elements that mr tenet said and i disagree with him more than i agree is that our law enforcement have to be a part of the war on terrorism i am disappointed that the budget offered by the president and the republicans has faltered in protecting the home front it has faltered in giving opportunity educationally to those who are most in need by depleting the pell grants i am disappointed in its work on health care and the providing of opportunities for a guaranteed medicare prescription drug benefit i ani disappointed in its lack of support for veterans in the united states and i am disappointed in its overemphasis on defense by not allowing us to be able to support the needs of this nation i ask my colleagues to vote for the democratic substitute i rise today being very disturbed with the direction that the republican party and this administration is taking our great nation the prime reason for my concern is the national budget which will come before this body tomorrow the nussle budget clearly does not improve upon the severely flawed bush administration budget the needs of average americans are still ignored the interests of a wealthy few outweigh the needs of an entire nation in this budget i say this not out of partisanship but from a statement of the facts i want to highlight a few areas in this budget that are particulary egregious this president and the majority party in this body have spent so much time talking about their record on education and as hard as i try i can not see what they have to be proud of it is one thing to address areas of critical need with rhetoric but to advocate a policy and then not fund it sufficiently is plain irresponsible at the top of the list of my concerns is the no child left behind act nclb and the fact that it has become an unfunded mandate the house republican resolution provides at least 8 8 billion less than the 34 3 billion authorized for education programs under the no child left behind act for 2005 this low funding leaves millions of elementary and secondary school students without the services congress and the president promised just two years ago for example the republican budget denies title i services to 2 4 million students who qualify under the act but the irresponsibility does not end with no child left behind for the third straight year the republican party has frozen the funding level for pell grants both the republicans and the president freeze the maximum pell grant award at the 2003 level of 4 050 with an average grant of 2 399 such small pell grants make college unaffordable for millions of students the college board reports that tuition and fees at 4year public colleges today average 4 694 in any market this gap would be hard to swallow but with the current state of joblessness that the republican partys agenda has created it is near impossible for so many american families to send their children to college i fear that this agenda if allowed to continue will cause a perpetual state where our american families arent able to succeed our brave american veterans are another group who were outraged by the presidents budget and will unfortunately be disappointed with the republican house budget i hear so much in this body from the majority party about the greatness of our armed forces and theyre right but again its just empty rhetoric on their part those brave men and women fighting on the front lines in our war against terror will come back home and find that the republican party looks at them differently once they become veterans almost all veterans need some form of health care some will need drastic care for the rest of their lives lecause of the sacrifice they made in war but the republican party continues to turn a blind eye to their needs on a bipartisan basis the committee on veterans affairs recommended that 2 5 billion more than the presidents budget was needed to maintain vital health care programs for veterans nevertheless the house republican budget provides 1 3 billion less than what the committee recommended for 2005 the entire department of veterans affairs is going to suffer because of the republican agenda over the next five years the money allocated to the department of veterans affairs will not even be able to maintain these programs at their current levels in 2007 the budget is 227 million less than what the department of veterans affairs needs to keep pace within inflation over five years the republican budget cuts 1 6 billion from the total needed to maintain services at the 2004 level ive heard from veterans groups throughout my district in houston and im sure each member of this body has heard from groups in their own district because veterans are one group that come from all parts of this nation these brave veterans have told me their stories of how they are suffering now with the current state of veterans affairs i am going to have trouble telling them that not only will things continue to stay bad but if this budget passes this body things will only continue to get worse that is not what our returning soldiers from iraq and afghanistan should have to look forward to a future where their needs are not only not provided for but are in fact ignored education and veterans affairs make up only two areas where republican budget fails americans the truth is there are many other programs and services vital to our rlation that are at risk because of the repriblican agenda at this point an average american may be asking why the republican party finds it necessary to cut so many fundamental programs the answer is simple yet disturbing the majority party is cutting important programs in order to finance all their irresponsible tax cuts they will continue to make the argument that tax cuts provide stimulus for our economy but millions of unemployed americans will tell you otherwise in fact the congressional budget office itself said tax legislation will probably have a net negative effect on saving investment and capital accumulation over the next 10 years while the republican party continues its offensive for irresponsible tax policies they allow our national deficit to grow increasingly larger the deficits are so large and their policies are so irresponsible that they wont even make deficit projections past 2009 its clear that the republican party is hiding from the american people this president and this majority in congress have yet to advocate a fiscal policy that helps average americans special interests have become king in this budget at the price of sound fiscal policies the truth about the budget is that a sound fiscal policy that funds needed programs is possible the democratic alternative budget and the cbc altemative budget are both examples of how we can get out of the quagmire that the republican agenda has put this nation in the democratic budget achieves balance within eight years through realistic policy choices that protect funding for key services the democratic budget also has a better bottom line than the republican budget every year meaning a smaller national debt and fewer resources wasted paying interest on the national debt chronic deficits crowd out private borrowing run up interest rates and slow down economic growth in addition the democratic budget provides 1 3 billion more than the republican budget for veterans programs for 2005 and 6 6 billion more over five years the democratic budget provides 2 1 billion more for appropriated education and training programs than the republican budget for 2005 and 9 8 billion more over the next five years the democratic budget also provides 3 7 billion in mandatory funding to make up the current shortfall in funding for pell grants and additional funding to make college loans cheaper for students these programs are all funded while maintaining a sound fiscal policy the democratic budget achieves balance within eight years through realistic policy choices that protect funding for key services the democratic budget also has a better bottom line than the republican budget every year meaning a smaller national debt and fewer resources wasted paying interest on the national debt republicans will surely try to counter this by touting the benefits of tax cuts however most americans are waking up to the fact that mass tax cuts targeted toward the wealthiest americans will only bog down our national economy the democratic budget accommodates the extension of marriagepenalty relief the child tax credit and the ten percent individual income tax bracket these tax cuts provide relief to middleclass families whose incomes have stagnated under the current administrations economic policies this is what a sound fiscal policy really stands for this body was made to stand for the will of all americans if we allow this budget proposal to take effect we will have failed our mandate i for one will not stand by silently i have a duty to my constituents and indeed to all americans to work for their wellbeing and i will continue to honor that duty i feel it is a sad day when the issue of our national security is compromised by a lack of proper funding i was deeply concerned when i saw the amount of funding allocated to homeland security under the presidents budget but i am appalled at the further cuts taken from homeland security in this republican budget resolution this republican budget cuts a further 857 million from nondefense homeland security budget that the president proposed that statement in itself is the height of fiscal irresponsibility somehow the programs the republican leadership sought to cut were the same ones that all americans are looking towards protecting their security as a member of the homeland security committee i know the shortfalls in our national security system and i am prudent enough to know that under funding these programs will not resolve our vulnerabilities first responder programs are under funded by 900 million and represent a critical element in our national security apparatus first responders make up the local presence that are our first line of defense against possible terrorist attacks in a way every american is a first responder because we all must stay vigilant to truly avert future attacks however there are groups of people who go beyond vigilance and act as a professional presence to keep america safe among the first responder programs that i believe are so critical is the community orientated policing services cops program the cops program has helped nearly 12 950 jurisdictions through 277 different grant programs since 1994 in september 2002 cops had provided funding for 116 573 community policing professionals across the country another critical first respender program is citizen corp which provides citizens with volunteer opportunities to help their communities prepare for and respond to emergencies first responders are not just used to prevent terrorist attacks they fulfill the security needs of so many americans dealing with local emergencies for example citizen corps is now playing a critical role here in the district of columbia helping communities deal with the lead contamination that currently affects their water supply clearly first responder programs like the cops program and citizen corp are vital unfortunately they require funds that are not being provided for in the republican budget resolution port security grants are under funded by 566 million and may be our greatest vulnerability in our efforts to prevent future terrorist attacks as the representative of a congressional district in houston texas i know personally the importance of proper port security the port of houston is one of the largest in america the workers on those docks have an incredibly difficult job managing thousands of ships a year which is aside from any additional security concerns i fear that if we do not provide the proper funding for port security we leave ourselves open to another catastrophic event the numbers attributed to the traffic on our seas is staggering there are 361 public ports in the united states that handle over 95 percent of unitedstates overseas trade approximately 7 500 foreign ships manned by 200 000 foreign sailors enter unitedstates ports every year to offload approximately six million trucksize cargo containers onto unitedstates docks this means that our ports are extremely valuable to our national economy but with so much ship traffic coming through they are also extremely vulnerable as a member of the homeland security committee i have been briefed on how few of those six million trucksize cargo containers are actually inspected in an age where we are told that nuclear components can be launched from a suitcase i am loathe to think about the damage that could be caused by a cargo container that has been compromised by a terrorist it must be clear to every member of this body the importance of homeland security but we can not pay mere lip service to the needs necessary to maintain our national security the risks are too high and the lives of americans are too important it is imperative that we fully fund homeland security in all its facets we can not just allocate all our money towards fighting terrorists broad we must use the necessary funds to truly make our homeland secure"], [1.9419738237047568e-05,

november elections and once again the republican leadership is catering to big business at the expense of the public good and once again that leadership is squandering the houses limited time with foolish misguided special interest legislation this is a bill that attempts to turn back the judicial clock by over a decade and in the process more pressing issues and priorities are ignored this simply is not needed yesterday the federal assault weapons ban died at the hands of the republican leadership president bush who during his first campaign said he saw no reason for such weapons to be on the street indicated on more than one occasion that he would sign a new bill if the republicancontrolled congress sent him one but the republican leadership refused to bring the reauthorization up for a vote i believe they prevented a vote to protect president bush from having to sign or veto the reauthorization of the federal assault weapons ban why because doing the bidding of the gun lobby is their priority apparently the republican strategy in homeland security includes defying law enforcement by making these militarystyle assault weapons more available in addition to failing to act on the federal assault weapons ban this week the republican leadership has scheduled zero time that is zero time to consider the 9 11 commissions recommendations the commission took a hard and comprehensive look at the intelligence and homeland security needs of our country they asked congress to do its job to take a hard look at the way this house organizes and carries out its works ways that potentially undercut the security of our nation and our people yet today in this house it is busineps as usual with special interest legislation on the house floor six weeks have passed since the commissions report was first issued and we still have no firm date as to when this house will take up legislation and debate the commissions recommendations will it be before congress breaks for elections will we have to wait for another september 11 anniversary to come and go before we take up the commissions findings or like today will this body continue to waste its time on frivolous legislation the republican leadership in both parties of congress has failed to pass a budget resolution but we are not talking about that today and today we begin one more legislative week without a transportation bill we certainly are not working on a bill to increase the minimum wage even though wages are stagnant and over 4 million americans have fallen out of the middle class intopoverty since george bush became president in fact the bush administration and the republican congress are on track to have the worst jobs record since the great depression all the way back to herbert hoover the average length of unemployment is at a 10year high and manufacturing employment remains at a 53year low yet this house does not seem to have the time to do anything to help the millions of americans who have lost their jobs no extension of unemployment benefits no help for the millions of uninsured americans and certainly no effort to reduce gas prices or lower the cost of college tuition or pass a highway bill that might create goodpaying jobs no we are not taking up legislation to address these issues today if the american public wants real leadership on real issues they should not look here for help indeed this body is guilty of willful neglect of americas priorities why do we not work on a bill to help the millions of uninsured americans over 70 percent of the uninsured live in households with at least one worker and yet we sit idly by as more and more americans work in jobs that provide little or no health care benefits instead here we are taking up h r 4571 the socalled frivolous lawsuit reduction act a bill that does nothing to address the real problems facing working families ofamerica yet does so much to help the special interests who fill the campaign coffers of the majority among its provisions h r 4571 would turn back the clock to the pre1993 provision of rule 11 of the federal rules of civil procedure provisions that were changed on the recommendation of the judicial conference after years of study approved by the unitedstates supreme court and reviewed by congress in accordance with the rules enabling act what will this bill change the supporters of h r 4571 contend that it would help reduce frivolous lawsuits that is what they say but in reality the bill would have a terrible effect on credible claims brought by families workers consumers and senior citizens without many of these civil lawsuits the following changes in consumer products would likely never have occurred the redesign of defective baby cribs so that they no longer strangle infants flammable childrens pajamas taken off the market the redesign of harmful medical devices the strengthening of auto fuel systems so that they do not blow up upon impact the addition of basic safeguards to dangerous farm machinery and the elimination of asbestos so that workers are no longer poisoned in their workplaces instead of providing more protections for the average american the republican leadership actually provides protections for get this the benedict arnold corporations who reincorporate in a foreign tax shelter only to avoid paying unitedstates taxes specifically this bill protects these benedict arnold corporations from lawsuits american citizens could file if they are injured by those corporations products unbelievable the bill limits the venue of a lawsuit against a corporate defendant to either the place the injury happened or the jurisdiction where the defendants principal place of business is located if a foreign corporation does not do significant business in a place where the injury occurred a plaintiff cannot sue a corporation headquartered outside the united states in other words a person injured by a defective product would be able to sue a unitedstates corporation in its principal place of business but he or she would often have no way to seek redress against a foreign corporation now the gentleman from texas attempted to fix this provi sion while the republican leadership actually made the turner amendment in order they did so only after a provision intended to hold these benedict arnold corporations accountable for their actions in the united states was removed from the amendment the provision the republican leadership removed from the turner amendment defines benedict arnold corporations as unitedstates companies that set up corporate shells in foreign countries in order to escape unitedstates tax liability and other unitedstates regulatory duties in other words the one proposal that was intended to protect people not corporations was left on the committee on rules floor last night the republican leadership does not want the american people to know that their bill puts benedict arnold corporations ahead of american consumers this is just one example of the republican leadership bending over backwards for special interests while ignoring the real issues facing the american people i hope my friend the gentleman from texas will take the time during this debate to explain to the american people why the republican leadership continues to protect benedict arnold companies instead of

sit safely here at home and astonishingly pays for those tax cuts by cutting benefits to warwounded veterans to do so at any time would be wrong to do so during the first 4 hours of our war in iraq is shameful is the altar of dividend tax cuts so sacred to our house republican leadership that it is even willing to cut veterans benefits by over 28 billion on the day our future veterans are risking their lives for our country tax cuts for the wealthy paid for by benefit cuts to veterans is this the new republican model for the long timehonored american tradition of shared sacrifice in time of

days ago in his letter to the gentleman from illinois the speaker of the house has congress no shame is there no honor left in the hallowed halls of our government that you choose to dishono the sacrifices of our nations heroes and rob our programs health care and disability compensation to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy mr heath also went on to say that this budget dishonors the service~of millions of serviceconnected disabled veterans including combatdisabled veterans and seriously erodes the nations commitment to care for its defenders i urge you commander heath said to the speaker to reconsider the inequitable and illadvised course proposed in the committees partisan budget proposal i believe the sentiments expressed by the national commander of the disabled american veterans reflects the values of americans everywhere i understand that in this budget last night or so they made a fig leaf change so that now they are only cutting veterans benefits by 28 billion rather than 30 billion i think mr heath and our veterans all across this land of ours will recognize that as nothing but a political fig leaf and that fig leaf will not work we ought to be supporting our veterans

challenge is the bleeding of the american manufacturing jobs overseas this administration has no plan to save american jobs we have lost 3 million private sector jobs in 3 years business investment is down longterm unemployment is up so how do the republicans respond to this emerging crisis of job loss in this country this budget will follow president bushs proposed cuts in job training the

percent reduction in the manufacturing extension partnership which is there to try to help manufacturers startup manufacturers get a foothold in this economy and this republican budget at a time of economic crisis in this country will pull the rug out from under small businesses who are trying once again to start up and compete globally in manufacturing all of this to protect tax cuts for people in this country who earn 1 million a year it is unbelievable and outrageous that they would do this back in my home state of maine my state legislature my governor are struggling with the impact of

most distorted sense of priorities that i can imagine and as i said before this is the price inflicted on the american people by the failure of this congress to be honest with the numbers that were

is a provision in the bill that potentially has longreaching effects on civil liberties h r 2417 includes a provision that would expand the fbis power to demand financial records without a judges approval to a large range of businesses vastly wider than their current authority right now the fbi has the authority to serve subpoenas to traditional financial institutions when investigating terrorism and counterintelligence without having to seek a judges approval the law understands the phrase financial institutions as we do banks loan companies savings associations and credit unions currently these are the types of institutions subject to administrative subpoenas the provision in this bill however uses a definition of financial institutions to decide what organizations are subject to administrative subpoenas under this bill not only are the traditional financial institutions like banks and credit unions affected but so are pawnbrokers casinos vehicle salesmen real estate agents telegraph companies travel agencies the unitedstates postal service just to name but a few winning the war against terrorism is indeed vital and we must make sure that our law enforcement officials have the tools necessary to engage this war and win these battles the fbis need for authority to subpoena these groups in order to track and find and shut down terrorist operations is not in question and i do not question that however under these provisions the fbi no longer needs a court order to serve such a subpoena on a new and lengthy laundry list of financial institutions with this legislation we eliminate the judicial oversight that was built into our system for a reason to make sure that our precious liberties are protected in our fight for our nation to

on intelligence and the senate intelligence committee on any actions taken consistent with activities outlined in the national security act i can assure the members as a member of the permanent select committee on intelligence this information is of the utmost importance to us the second is an annual report from the secretary of defense to the house committee on armed services and the senate armed

that these reports are no longer important i appreciate the secretarys concerns as a matter of fact several of us met with secretary rumsfeld as he returned to the department of defense and one of the

transportation bill was the subject of some discussion i have to tell you that if you are looking not to be partisan but if you are looking for republican principles when it comes to highway spending you can go to abraham lincoln you can go to dwight eisenhower you can go to richard nixon you can go to ronald reagan you can go to george h w bush all of those presidents recognized that you need to have a strong infrastructure in this country you need to have a strong infrastructure bill that the return on infrastructure spending is about six to one back to the government produces hundreds of

of great national division behavior that would have been perceived as patriotic if done by the majority unfortunately our history has abundant examples of patriotism being used to hurt those who express views in disagreement with that of the majority let me share with you some news stories taken from the new york times in years of great strife in america the first one i would like to read is from april 7 1917 1917 headline diners resent slight to the anthem attack a man and two women who refuse to stand when it is played there was much excitement in the main dining room at rectors last night following the playing of the star spangled banner frederick boyd a former reporter on the new york call a socialist newspaper was dining with miss jessie ashley and miss may towle both lawyers and suffragists the three alone of those in the room remained seated there were quiet then loud and vehement protests but they kept their chairs the angry diners surrounded boyd and the two women and blows were struck back and forth the women fighting valiantly to defend boyd he cried out he was an englishman and did not have to get up but the crowd would not listen to explanation boyd was severely beaten when the head waiter succeeded in reaching his side other waiters closed in and the fray was stopped the guests insisted upon the ejection of boyd and his companions and they were asked to leave they refused to do so and they were escorted to the street and turned over to a policeman who took boyd to the west 47th street station charged with disorderly conduct before the magistrate boyd repeated that he did not have to rise at the playing of the national anthem but the court told him that while there was no legal obligation it was neither prudent nor courteous not to do so in these tense times and he was found guilty of disorderly conduct and released on suspended sentence another one july 2 1917 headline boston peace parade mobbed soldiers and sailors break up socialist demonstration and rescue flag socialist headquarters ransacked and contents burned many arrests for fighting riotous scenes attended a socialist parade today which was announced as a peace demonstration the ranks of the marchers were broken up by selforganized squads of uniformed soldiers and sailors red flags and banners bearing socialistic mottos were trampled on and literature and furnishings in the socialist headquarters in park square were thrown into the street and burned at scollay square there was a similar scene the american flag at the head of the line was seized by the attacking party and the band which had been playing the marseillaise with some interruptions was forced to play the star spangled banner while cheers were given for the flag the last one from march 26 1918 i 1530 progermans mobbed in middle west disturbances start in ohio and are renewed in illinois woman among victims five businessmen of delphos a german settlement in western allen county near here accused of progermanism were hunted out by a volunteer vigilance committee of 400 men and 50 women of the town taken into a brilliantly lit downtown street and forced to kiss the american flag tonight under pain of being hanged from nearby telephone poles what do these old stories from the new york times have to do with this very important and heartfelt debate today the decision we make today it seems to me is a balancing a weighing of what best preserves freedom for americans there may well be a decrease in public deliberate incidents of flag desecration acts that we all deplore if this amendment becomes part of our constitution on the other side of our ledger if this amendment becomes part of our constitution in my opinion it will become a constitutionally sanctioned tool for the majority to tyrannize the minority as evidenced by these news stories from a time of great divisiveness in our nations history government which ultimately is human beings with all of our strengths and weaknesses will use this amendment to question the patriotism of vocal minorities will use it to find excuses to legally attack demonstrations which utilize the flag in an otherwise appropriate manner let me give an example i was at a rural county fair in arkansas several years ago and a group had a booth with a great patriotic display in addition to handouts and signs they had laid across the table like a tablecloth an american flag i knew these people thought this to be a very patriotic part of the display i watched as one of the volunteers sat on the table oblivious to the fact he was sitting on our american flag his action was a completely innocent mistake and he did not realize such behavior is inconsistent with good flag etiquette i believe that had this group been a fringe group those with views contrary to the great majority and should we have laws prohibiting physical desecration of the flag such an action as i described would not be excused as an innocent mistake instead a minority group might be prosecuted out of anger out of disgust but make no mistake the motivation for such a prosecution would be that they hold a minority view i do not think our constitution will be improved nor our freedoms protected by placing within it enhanced opportunity for minority views to be legally attacked ostensibly because of their misuse of the flag but in reality because of views that many consider out of the mainstream i urge a no vote on the proposed amendment and for the same reasons a no vote on the substitute"], [0.00046306848526000977,

a true marketbased system whereby consumers could access safe and affordable prescription drugs i find it interesting that a free trade agreement would blatantly run counter to legislation that would in effect establish a marketbased arena for prescription drugs proponents of this language have said that it is practically meaningless because australian law already bans the export of subsidized prescription drugs why then do we feel the need to include such a meaningless provision in the trade agreement let me illustrate why this language is not meaningless in fact it attempts to hamstring efforts to provide affordable prescription drugs for seniors the uninsured and consumers who continue to pay 30 to 300 percent more for prescription drugs than anyone else in 2000 the meds act included a provision that prohibited pharmaceutical manufacturers from entering into a contract or agreement if they included any language that would prevent the sale or distribution of prescription drugs i have attached this language to be included in the record because it no longer exists in unitedstates law i discovered recently that the medicare bill included a hidden provision which stripped this important language this is outrageous so while proponents of this agreement claim that this language simply restates current law current law is the result of hidden maneuvers without the knowledge of the 242 members who support open markets for prescription drugs and who exactly provided the counsel to ustr while they drafted this supposedly innocuous language twentyfive members of the advisory committee advised the ustr on intellectual property rights regarding prescription drugs of those 25 members at least 15 have interests in the pharmaceutical industry there was not one senior consumer or market access advocate on the panel with this language when prescription drug market access legislation becomes law and i believe it will we will be in breach of the free trade agreement the australian government can enter into a dispute settlement case contending the law many have argued that this is not a likely scenario it seems equally unlikely that american taxpayers would be forced to subsidize the research and development of prescription drugs for consumers around the worid and still pay the worlds highest prices but we do i sat down with ustr representatives to give them a chance to tell their side of the story when i asked who requested the prescriptiondrug language they had no answer no one but the two negotiators were in the room and no one was taking
