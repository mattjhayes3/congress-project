my service in congress representing central washington i have always voted to renew the violence against women act as a husband a father and a grandfather i strongly believe that providing protection for all women against domestic violence is a duty and a priority yet i am deeply dismayed by the manner in which the current reauthorization of this legislation which has long been a simple grant program has been hijacked in order to pursue unrelated political agendas in very harsh politicized terms to be blunt the bill is simply unconstitutional the indian tribal provisions of s 47 are the first time in the history of our country that congress will give tribes criminal jurisdiction over nonindians the provisions found in sections 904 and 905 declare that a tribes power of selfgovernment includes the inherent power of that tribe to exercise jurisdiction over all persons including nonindians as ive said these provisions are unconstitutional and contradict over two centuries of law there are three fundamental principles underlying how congress may deal with indian tribes first the indian commerce clause supplemented by the treaty making powers in the constitution give congress what the supreme court has said is plenary power over indian affairs second tribes are defined by the indian status of their members third when tribes were brought under the jurisdiction of the united states through actc treaties and executive orders they have been recognized for the purpose of selfgovernment over their internal affairs and members congress may recognize or terminate tribes with these principles in mind it is clear that the indian tribal provisions of the senate bill are unconstitutional the measures put a nonindian american citizenon american soilunder the criminal jurisdiction of a political entity to which the individual because of his race may not consent it violates the founding principle of this republic which is a government only at the consent of the governed the bill overturns all precedents set by congress and the supreme court through its extension of a unique selfgoverning power over internal affairs of a race of people into a territorial government over everyone the supreme court has long held that because tribes are not parties to the constitution the constitution including the bill of rights do not apply to tribes in tribal court an individual only has something called the indian civil rights act this provides a set of similarbut not identicalrights as the bill of rights they may be amended or repealed by mere act of congress even if the rights were meaningful however the supreme court in 1978 said these statutory rights are unenforceable in federal court does s 47 provide a defendant with the right to appeal a tribal judgment and conviction in federal court no it does not section 904 of s 47 openly allows discrimination against an individual based on race sex age or if hes an indian who hes related to where the persons an american citizen can be expelled from their home and may not have any right to appeal a claim in an impartial federal court as a result enactment of section 904 will be the first time that congress has purposefully removed a unitedstates citizens constitutional rights while on american soil so that a political entity defined according to ethnic ancestry may arrest try and punish the citizen if these arguments do not sound familiar to all it will be to those who have studied the pertinent case law and supreme court precedent from the 18th century to present beginning in modern times with oliphant v suquamish indian tribe the supreme court held that tribes lack inherent jurisdiction over nonindians congress cannot recognize and affirm an inherentthat is to say a preexisting and continuingpower in a tribe when the supreme court ruled the tribe never had it theres duro v reina in which the high court held that indian tribes lack jurisdiction over nonmember indians in the 19th century the supreme court in united states v kagama declared there are only two sovereigns in the geographical limits of the united states and tribes are not one of them case law statutes treaties and historic dealings with indian tribes support the sole purpose of federal indian law and policy to permit a racially defined group of people who were here first to continue their unique way of life according to their own customs without interference from others this is an honorable and morally correct policy one which i respect and uphold this is why i cosponsored legislation to exempt tribes from a federal law permitting compulsory union work places on the reservation and supported exempting tribes from the department of the interiors onerous hydraulic fracturing rule a rule that could devastate the economies of historically impoverished tribes for further clarification let us examine the work of the distinguished former democrat chairman of the subcommittee on indian affairs the late lloyd meeds of washington chairman meeds wrote that tribal powers have over and again been labeled selfgovernment and not sovereignty it is one thing for the congress to permit tribal indians to govern themselves and not be subject to federal constitutional limitations and general federal supervision it is quite another thing for congress to permit indian tribes to function as general governmental entities not subject to federal constitutional limitations or general federal supervisions separate dissenting views of congressman lloyd meeds dwashington vice chairman of the american indian policy review commission final report p 579 he american people have not surrendered to indians the power of general government indians are given only a power of selfgovernment they have the power to regulate only their members and the property of their members they have some governmental powers because and to the extent that such powers are appropriate to the federal policy of allowing indian peoples to control their own affairs but there is no federal policy of allowing indian peoples to control the liberty and property of nonmembers tribal powers of selfgovernment are limited by their purpose ibid p 585 our nation has appropriately recognized indian tribes right of selfgovernment tribal selfgovernment over indians and their internal affairs is important and should be respected yet selfgovernment does not and should not permit indian tribal actions to trump the constitution or violate individual rights of nonindians with the precedent being set under s 47 tribes will return to congress for more expanded power over nonindians there would be no reason to deny granting such power especially if the constitution continues to be viewed as an obstacle to addressing crime it is important to be clear about the scope of a tribes criminal jurisdiction granted under s 47 it affects nonindians who live work or travel on 56 million acres of unitedstates soil that happen to be called indian country in other words the bill makes 56 million acres of land in our nation constitutionfree zones where due process and equal protection rightsas interpreted and enforced in unitedstates courtsdo not exist what are these areas there is a misconception that indian country is just tribal trust land in fact the term indian country has a precise meaning under title 18 of the unitedstates code indian country includes not just land under tribal jurisdiction but all private lands and rightsofway within the limits of every indian reservation under nonindian jurisdiction homes farms schools businesses interstate highways state roads and secondary roads all private nonindian lands in indian country under the senate bill are constitutionfree zones there are incorporated nonindian cities and towns in many reservations and indian country like wapato and toppenish on the yakama reservation in my district take the puyallup indian reservation in washington state encompassing parts of tacoma and fife with one of the busiest highways in the nation interstate 5 crossing the reservation the ancient reservation is inhabited primarily by nonindians living and working and going to school on mostly nonindian land under the civil and criminal jurisdiction of the state under the senate bill this region is indian country on which the tribe may exercise criminal jurisdiction with no due process and equal protection rights guaranteed to the people living there under a land claim settlement taxpayers paid 162 million to the tribe in exchange for the tribe ceding most authority over its reservation however the notwithstanding any other provision of law language in the senate bill trumps and overrides the land claim agreement take the coachella valley in the state of california with a number of checkerboarded indian reservations containing nonindian populations tribes in this valley will get criminal jurisdiction over residents in towns and cities such as palm springs for offenses described in section 904 of the senate bill in tribal court the residents of the coachella valley will not have their due process and equal protection rights take the oneida reservation in new york that encompasses about 300 000 acres 99 percent of which is nonindian land with nonindian towns and farms under the senate bill the tribe will have full powers to arrest prosecute and jail residents of madison and oneida counties for the offenses described in this bill with no due process or equal protection rights guaranteed by the constitution the validity of sections 904 and 905 of s 47 will eventually come before the supreme court when this happens it wont be a question of whether these provisions are struck down but how many other tribal powers will be rolled back and how many domestic violence offenders will be set free because of the misguided legislation before us some will say that critics of the senate bill are interested only in the rights of criminal defendants then answer these questions if congress can justify stripping a citizen of their constitutional rights when accused of a crime why cant it be justified for other classes of crime like theft felony assault and murder why limit the suspension of the constitution to indian country as defined under this bill why not create new indian reservations so there are more constitutionfree zones where the bill of rights is not an impediment to law and order while the house substitute would delegate criminal jurisdiction to an indian tribe over nonindians it at least guarantees that enforceable constitutional protections are built in so that it might pass muster in court the timing of the consideration of s 47 is interesting while proponents say that people have nothing to fear in tribal court there is at least one tribe in the state of oklahoma embroiled in litigation over its denial of tribal citizenship to the descendants of the african slaves the tribes 19thcentury members owned there are also entire families of indians in california disenrolled by their tribe in a dispute over large cash per capita dividends from the tribes casino who cannot get a federal court to review their equal protection claims these cases are merely the latest example of several tribes wielding sovereign immunity to escape any liability for alleged harm caused by possibly depriving individualsincluding their own members and exmemberstheir constitutional rights on the one hand indian tribes want criminal jurisdiction over individuals like the freedmen of the five civilized tribes or the disenrolled pechangas on the other hand they want to forbid these individuals from participating in the tribes government s 47 makes more unitedstates citizens like the disenfranchised indians in california and the freedmen of the five civilized tribes it gives tribes the power to put people in jail while denying them a voice in the making of the laws that govern them the tribal jurisdictional provisions must be rejected because of the historic policy change the house is poised to make today it is necessary to elaborate on why the tribal provisions of s 47 are
