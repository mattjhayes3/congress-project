the bush administration that i called fiscal child abuse why because it was not done at a time of fiscal crisis with large unemployment that unemployment was caused by the policies of the last administration why do i say that because under the clinton administration we created 21 million jobs in the private sector just a little short of 21 million jobs 22 8 overall when you include public employment and during the bush administration how did it relate to that 20 1 million new jobs in the private sector one million how did it relate per month to job production 216 000 under the clinton administration and 11 000 per month under the bush administrations thats what their economic policies wrought their economic policies of cutting deeply not 40 billion or 34 billion borrowed money but trillions with an s of borrowed money to fund tax cuts which they did not pay for they werent continuations of the tax code as jon kyl the secondranking republican leader in the senate now argues ought not to be paid for 687 billion that we just ought to continue that for the wealthiest in our country not the little children who are worried about whether their parents are going to be able to afford the mortgage or afford to put bread on the table thats what were talking about in this bill for literally millions of people who have run out of support now will they run out of support in this moral country they will not ultimately run out of support theyll be put on welfare and food stamps and they wont be available for the insurance to which their employer and they participated in providing for the contingency that we ran the economy into the ditch the worst economy in threequarters of a century wrought by the bush economic policies to which mr sessions the chairman of their campaign committee says that they want to return to the exact agenda im so pleased i had the opportunity to come and respond to my friend from texas it does demonstrate the difference between our two parties absolutely jon kyl who says we ought to borrow 686 billion from the chinese to give to the wealthiest in america and democrats who say we want to borrow 34 billion to give to the children of america whose families are in needyes that is the difference if my friend from texas wants to make that the difference this is about saying that we have an emergency and historically from ronald reagan to today ronald reagan bush the first and bush the second what did you do when you were in charge you borrowed at times of economic trouble to give unemployment insurance we are doing the same thing why did we do that because we perceived it to be an emergency an emergency that people in the richest nation on the face of the earth were about to run out of the ability to keep their homes buy their food clothe their children a moral and great country thinks thats an emergency thats what this vote is all about this vote is also about as the gentleman from texas has said expressing our values i agree with that and im going to express my values and i urge the members of this house to express their values this day on this vote as millions of people have lost their unemployment insurance because we could not get 60 votes in the senate had almost every democrat saying we need to help now people are running out of ability to support themselves now we paid insurance for now so i urge my colleagues to vote for this legislation a few months ago we passed unemployment insurance through this house by unanimous consent the election wasnt as proximate then as it is today the

everything on the table i reiterate that today we need to put everything on the table no sacred cows i have three children three grandchildren as all of you will get tired of hearing and one great granddaughter and i owe it to her personally as a member of this house to say ladies and gentlemen of this house and of our country we have a moral responsibility to get a handle on this deficit a reporter just asked me as i was walking down the aisle did i agree with mr bernankes comment that we ought to pay if we extended the tax cuts and i said to him this at a time of fiscal crisis when our economy is struggling to get back from the ditch it was in when this administration took overhow much of a ditch during the last year of the clinton administration we added 1 9 million new jobs i tell my friend from texas last year clinton administration 1 9 million new jobs in america and it was a slowdown period during the last year of the bush administration after the economic policies that were pursued from 2001 and 2002 and 2003 and through 2009 even though we took the congress we couldnt do anything because the president would veto legislation and did in fact veto legislation 3 8 million americans lost their jobs thats a difference of 1 9 million new jobs in the last year of clinton to 3 8 million lost jobs in the last year of bush or a 5 7 million jobs turnaround is there any wonder

to be accountable for the negligence that caused millions of people to be in economic distress were not going to say sorry some people want to say sorry that the president of the united states
