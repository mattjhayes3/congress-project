imperative we fully fund programs for children with disabilities the republicans decided not to honor their commitment for putting this program and other nclb programs on a path to full funding by 2009 under this bill new york will suffer education cuts of approximately one billion dollars less than the levels authorized by the no child left behind and the idea reauthorization acts it leaves behind military dependents living near new york bases it does nothing to help lowincome college students pay for the 24percent increase in tuition while freezing funding for teacher quality grants the bush administration along with the republican led congress has passed tax cuts for the wealthy and left our nations children behind the idea reauthorization which provides funding for children with disabilities was promised an increase of 2 2 billion this appropriations bill comes up 55 percent short a promise to fund teacher quality grants falls 350 million short leaving 54 000 fewer teachers who would have received training and development we passed stronger accountability standards for schools yet this bill falls 334 million short in title i funds the nclb pledged 6 15 billion more for fy04 but this bill will leave nearly 2 2 million disadvantaged children behind we wanted to see students achieve in reading and math we wanted higher standards but where is the common sense in underfunding these programs in order to provide children with adequate facilities equipment and specially trained teachers more money must be appropriated afterschool programs play an essential role in the education of disadvantaged children but this bill falls 750 million short of the nclb promise as a result more than one million children will be denied the opportunity to participate in afterschool programs higher education assistance through the pell grant program is frozen under the republican bill every one knows the way to close the gap between the wealthy and the working poor is through affordable education historically the pell grant program allowed students to achieve their goals without accumulating large debts but this bill freezes the maximum pel grant when the pell grant program was initiated it financed 84 percent of a public university education this bill would only finance 38 percent of the tuition cost this bill stifles the national institutes of health by providing only a 0 2 percent increase for programs other than blodefense leaving cancer and other disease research underfunded with rising medical costs childhood immunizations community health

stand here once again watching my republican colleagues add billions of dollars to the deficit and public debt i watch them take money out of the pockets of working families so that they may line the pockets of their fat cat friends this budget is a betrayal to working families across america to seniors veterans and especially to our children and grandchildren who will be left to clean up this administrations fiscal disaster i am amazed that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have managed to turn record surpluses into record deficits in a mere three years this budget does nothing to remedy the situation and continues further down the same road by using a 5year budget instead of a traditional 10year budget my republican colleagues are attempting to hid the real costs of their outrageous plan after five years the cost of making the tax giveaways permanent will grow drastically over the next ten years the tax giveaways in this plan will cost 1 2 trillion my republican colleagues will not even apply the payasyougo method to their tax giveaways because they know we cannot afford them these budget gimmicks and rascality cannot be tolerated the american people deserve to know the outrageous credit card bills the bush administration is racking up in their name and with their credit in addition this budget does nothing to protect the social security trust fund five years from when the first of the baby boomer generation reach retirement age these republicans fiscal mismanagement will squander the entire 1 trillion social security surplus adding to the ballooning deficit and throwing the long term economic security of millions of americans into doubt the republican budget doesnt provide any money this year to protect medicaid in fact it cuts the program as a result states are going to be forced to cut benefits and coverage for the more than 50 million of our most vulnerable seniors children pregnant women working families and disabled americans who rely on medicaid for vital healthcare services more than 3 7 million have already lost coverage under bushs watch we should be shoring up the programs that provide health insurance coveragenot cutting them on the medicare side republicans offer no proposals to improve the inadequate and disingenuous medicare drug benefit enacted last year just yesterday a new stud concluded that the medicare hospital fund will be bankrupt in 2019 seven years sooner than predicted a year ago partly due to the new benefit which funnels money into private health plans also absent from this budget are other proposals that could improve the medicare program such as funding for increase nursing home staffing and quality improvement or fixing the flawed payment system for doctors nor are there any proposals to protect the medicare program from being overcharged and defrauded by private insurance companies and health maintenance organizations and of course there is the similarly outrageous effort of this white house to hide from both democratic and republicans the true cost of their medicare privatization bill which truly makes me wonder whether any of their budget numbers can be trusted in education no child left behind is already dramatically underfunded and this budget will continue this indignity we cannot leave the states to pick up the tab for this federally mandated program special education after school programs teacher training pell grants perkins loans and vocational education are all either frozen or cut under this dreadful budget i wonder if my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are trying to ensure that public schools fail so they can privatize the entire system this budget continues the republican war on the environment the president and republicans will try to sound like they are environmentalists but the truth is in this budget which contains drastic cuts to major environmental protection programs budget cuts will be felt in a variety of areas including enforcement inspections less money available than needed for safe drinking water inadequate funding for cleanups of superfund sites and leaking underground storage tanks and fewer brownfields grants than authorized by the new law signed two years ago my colleagues would rather give tax cuts to their buddies than invest in clean air clean water and cleaning up toxic waste sites for the next five years the republican budget provides 10 5 percent less than what is needed just to maintain services at the current level more noteworthy their funding levels in 2009 will still be 901 million below the 2004 enacted level my republican colleagues obviously fail to keep our nations commitment to a healthy environment our troops and veterans are also betrayed by this draconian budget we made a promise to our service men and women serve your country and we will take care of you this budget is yet another promise broken by this administration and republican congress these men and women are willing to risk their lives for this country and this congress and president will not even guarantee basic benefits for healthcare and housing we cannot treat our men and women in uniform with such disregard and disrespect particularly during this time of war we must treat our veterans and soldiers with the utmost honor and dignity thirty thousand veterans are waiting six months or longer for an appointment at a va hospital this is a total outrage and this budget does nothing to help in fact this budget raises healthcare costs for up to 1 million veterans in addition my republican colleagues refuse to eliminate the disabled veterans tax which forces disabled military retirees to give up one dollar of their pension for every dollar of disability pay they receive the republican budget continues to require nearly 400 000 military retirees with serviceconnected disabilities to continue to pay the disabled veterans tax i strongly support the democratic budget and urge my colleagues to do the same because it will keep the promise we made to the american peopleunlike the budget being served up by our republican colleagues the democratic alternative will cut the deficit in half by 2007 and balance the budget by 2012 the democratic alternative matches the administration request for defense spending and adds funding for homeland security we need to get back to fiscal responsibility and get the nations economy back on track we need to take care of our veterans and our children and our environment we need to make sure our citizens have healthcare and education

their right to be paid for the hours they work republicans have issued another callous insult to families struggling to make a living since many of those who will be affected are nursing professionals police firefighters and other first responders it sends another stinging message to the people we turn to and who routinely undertake the most thankless tasks in our times of need over 3 million americans have lost their jobs since president bush took oflice and countless others dont appear in the employment statistics because they have given up hope o tinding a job isnt in enough that the bush administration has presided over the loss of 3 million privatesector jobs it has failed to raise the minimum wage it is allowing millions of older workers to lose half their private pension

are working an increasing amount of mandatory overtime patient care and contributing to the ranks of the over 500 000 trained nurses who have left their field the current nursing workforce is aging

kind i came to the floor on several very brief points one i would like to associate myself with the outstanding work of the democratic caucus and the substitute budget that is going to be offered by the gentleman from south carolina and our caucus let me also associate myself with the congressional black caucus budget resolution because it embraces if you will the understanding that we are all our brothers and sisters keeper let me just say to my colleagues that in listening to the 91 testimony one of the key elements that mr tenet said and i disagree with him more than i agree is that our law enforcement have to be a part of the war on terrorism i am disappointed that the budget offered by the president and the republicans has faltered in protecting the home front it has faltered in giving opportunity educationally to those who are most in need by depleting the pell grants i am disappointed in its work on health care and the providing of opportunities for a guaranteed medicare prescription drug benefit i ani disappointed in its lack of support for veterans in the united states and i am disappointed in its overemphasis on defense by not allowing us to be able to support the needs of this nation i ask my colleagues to vote for the democratic substitute i rise today being very disturbed with the direction that the republican party and this administration is taking our great nation the prime reason for my concern is the national budget which will come before this body tomorrow the nussle budget clearly does not improve upon the severely flawed bush administration budget the needs of average americans are still ignored the interests of a wealthy few outweigh the needs of an entire nation in this budget i say this not out of partisanship but from a statement of the facts i want to highlight a few areas in this budget that are particulary egregious this president and the majority party in this body have spent so much time talking about their record on education and as hard as i try i can not see what they have to be proud of it is one thing to address areas of critical need with rhetoric but to advocate a policy and then not fund it sufficiently is plain irresponsible at the top of the list of my concerns is the no child left behind act nclb and the fact that it has become an unfunded mandate the house republican resolution provides at least 8 8 billion less than the 34 3 billion authorized for education programs under the no child left behind act for 2005 this low funding leaves millions of elementary and secondary school students without the services congress and the president promised just two years ago for example the republican budget denies title i services to 2 4 million students who qualify under the act but the irresponsibility does not end with no child left behind for the third straight year the republican party has frozen the funding level for pell grants both the republicans and the president freeze the maximum pell grant award at the 2003 level of 4 050 with an average grant of 2 399 such small pell grants make college unaffordable for millions of students the college board reports that tuition and fees at 4year public colleges today average 4 694 in any market this gap would be hard to swallow but with the current state of joblessness that the republican partys agenda has created it is near impossible for so many american families to send their children to college i fear that this agenda if allowed to continue will cause a perpetual state where our american families arent able to succeed our brave american veterans are another group who were outraged by the presidents budget and will unfortunately be disappointed with the republican house budget i hear so much in this body from the majority party about the greatness of our armed forces and theyre right but again its just empty rhetoric on their part those brave men and women fighting on the front lines in our war against terror will come back home and find that the republican party looks at them differently once they become veterans almost all veterans need some form of health care some will need drastic care for the rest of their lives lecause of the sacrifice they made in war but the republican party continues to turn a blind eye to their needs on a bipartisan basis the committee on veterans affairs recommended that 2 5 billion more than the presidents budget was needed to maintain vital health care programs for veterans nevertheless the house republican budget provides 1 3 billion less than what the committee recommended for 2005 the entire department of veterans affairs is going to suffer because of the republican agenda over the next five years the money allocated to the department of veterans affairs will not even be able to maintain these programs at their current levels in 2007 the budget is 227 million less than what the department of veterans affairs needs to keep pace within inflation over five years the republican budget cuts 1 6 billion from the total needed to maintain services at the 2004 level ive heard from veterans groups throughout my district in houston and im sure each member of this body has heard from groups in their own district because veterans are one group that come from all parts of this nation these brave veterans have told me their stories of how they are suffering now with the current state of veterans affairs i am going to have trouble telling them that not only will things continue to stay bad but if this budget passes this body things will only continue to get worse that is not what our returning soldiers from iraq and afghanistan should have to look forward to a future where their needs are not only not provided for but are in fact ignored education and veterans affairs make up only two areas where republican budget fails americans the truth is there are many other programs and services vital to our rlation that are at risk because of the repriblican agenda at this point an average american may be asking why the republican party finds it necessary to cut so many fundamental programs the answer is simple yet disturbing the majority party is cutting important programs in order to finance all their irresponsible tax cuts they will continue to make the argument that tax cuts provide stimulus for our economy but millions of unemployed americans will tell you otherwise in fact the congressional budget office itself said tax legislation will probably have a net negative effect on saving investment and capital accumulation over the next 10 years while the republican party continues its offensive for irresponsible tax policies they allow our national deficit to grow increasingly larger the deficits are so large and their policies are so irresponsible that they wont even make deficit projections past 2009 its clear that the republican party is hiding from the american people this president and this majority in congress have yet to advocate a fiscal policy that helps average americans special interests have become king in this budget at the price of sound fiscal policies the truth about the budget is that a sound fiscal policy that funds needed programs is possible the democratic alternative budget and the cbc altemative budget are both examples of how we can get out of the quagmire that the republican agenda has put this nation in the democratic budget achieves balance within eight years through realistic policy choices that protect funding for key services the democratic budget also has a better bottom line than the republican budget every year meaning a smaller national debt and fewer resources wasted paying interest on the national debt chronic deficits crowd out private borrowing run up interest rates and slow down economic growth in addition the democratic budget provides 1 3 billion more than the republican budget for veterans programs for 2005 and 6 6 billion more over five years the democratic budget provides 2 1 billion more for appropriated education and training programs than the republican budget for 2005 and 9 8 billion more over the next five years the democratic budget also provides 3 7 billion in mandatory funding to make up the current shortfall in funding for pell grants and additional funding to make college loans cheaper for students these programs are all funded while maintaining a sound fiscal policy the democratic budget achieves balance within eight years through realistic policy choices that protect funding for key services the democratic budget also has a better bottom line than the republican budget every year meaning a smaller national debt and fewer resources wasted paying interest on the national debt republicans will surely try to counter this by touting the benefits of tax cuts however most americans are waking up to the fact that mass tax cuts targeted toward the wealthiest americans will only bog down our national economy the democratic budget accommodates the extension of marriagepenalty relief the child tax credit and the ten percent individual income tax bracket these tax cuts provide relief to middleclass families whose incomes have stagnated under the current administrations economic policies this is what a sound fiscal policy really stands for this body was made to stand for the will of all americans if we allow this budget proposal to take effect we will have failed our mandate i for one will not stand by silently i have a duty to my constituents and indeed to all americans to work for their wellbeing and i will continue to honor that duty i feel it is a sad day when the issue of our national security is compromised by a lack of proper funding i was deeply concerned when i saw the amount of funding allocated to homeland security under the presidents budget but i am appalled at the further cuts taken from homeland security in this republican budget resolution this republican budget cuts a further 857 million from nondefense homeland security budget that the president proposed that statement in itself is the height of fiscal irresponsibility somehow the programs the republican leadership sought to cut were the same ones that all americans are looking towards protecting their security as a member of the homeland security committee i know the shortfalls in our national security system and i am prudent enough to know that under funding these programs will not resolve our vulnerabilities first responder programs are under funded by 900 million and represent a critical element in our national security apparatus first responders make up the local presence that are our first line of defense against possible terrorist attacks in a way every american is a first responder because we all must stay vigilant to truly avert future attacks however there are groups of people who go beyond vigilance and act as a professional presence to keep america safe among the first responder programs that i believe are so critical is the community orientated policing services cops program the cops program has helped nearly 12 950 jurisdictions through 277 different grant programs since 1994 in september 2002 cops had provided funding for 116 573 community policing professionals across the country another critical first respender program is citizen corp which provides citizens with volunteer opportunities to help their communities prepare for and respond to emergencies first responders are not just used to prevent terrorist attacks they fulfill the security needs of so many americans dealing with local emergencies for example citizen corps is now playing a critical role here in the district of columbia helping communities deal with the lead contamination that currently affects their water supply clearly first responder programs like the cops program and citizen corp are vital unfortunately they require funds that are not being provided for in the republican budget resolution port security grants are under funded by 566 million and may be our greatest vulnerability in our efforts to prevent future terrorist attacks as the representative of a congressional district in houston texas i know personally the importance of proper port security the port of houston is one of the largest in america the workers on those docks have an incredibly difficult job managing thousands of ships a year which is aside from any additional security concerns i fear that if we do not provide the proper funding for port security we leave ourselves open to another catastrophic event the numbers attributed to the traffic on our seas is staggering there are 361 public ports in the united states that handle over 95 percent of unitedstates overseas trade approximately 7 500 foreign ships manned by 200 000 foreign sailors enter unitedstates ports every year to offload approximately six million trucksize cargo containers onto unitedstates docks this means that our ports are extremely valuable to our national economy but with so much ship traffic coming through they are also extremely vulnerable as a member of the homeland security committee i have been briefed on how few of those six million trucksize cargo containers are actually inspected in an age where we are told that nuclear components can be launched from a suitcase i am loathe to think about the damage that could be caused by a cargo container that has been compromised by a terrorist it must be clear to every member of this body the importance of homeland security but we can not pay mere lip service to the needs necessary to maintain our national security the risks are too high and the lives of americans are too important it is imperative that we fully fund homeland security in all its facets we can not just allocate all our money towards fighting terrorists broad we must use the necessary funds to truly make our homeland secure"], [0.00011551380157470703,

kind of america we want for them and our children the decisions we make tonight will affect the well being of our troops and all americans for years to come we must make important decisions about the future economic health of our nation and what investments we decide to make for the common good we need to adopt an economic plan that will put america back to work and a budget that reflects the priorities of the american people just as each family must make tough decisions about their own household budgets so must we make tough decisions for our entire american family how we decide to invest our collective resources should tell us a lot about what we care about as a people and who we are the budgets and economic plans we adopt should reflect the values and priorities of the american people i have listened carefully to the people in my district i think i understand their priorities and i believe that what they care about is what every american cares about they want a country where every child has the opportunity to get a great start in life with a first rate education they want a country where every american has access to quality health care they want an america where there is a job for every individual ready to roll up their sleeves and go to work and they want to know that their government is taking all reasonable steps to protect our homeland and be prepared to respond to national emergencies these are the simple things we want for our families our neighbors and our follow americans we are a great nation we can do these things unfortunately the republican budget before us does not begin to meet the needs and priorities of our nation just a short time ago i had the privilege of sitting in this chamber when the president gave his state of the union address at the outset of his speech he made the following statement we will not deny we will not ignore we will not pass along our problems to other congresses to other presidenls and other generations unfortunately neither the budget submitted by the president nor the republican budget committee proposal before us today passes that test in fact the budget before us today does exactly what the president says he does not want to do it does ignore our problems and if we dont fix those problems we will be simply passing the buck to future congresses future presidents and future generations look at education last year with great fanfare the president signed the leave no child behind bill at the white house yet the ink was barely dry before the administration submitted a budget that fell well short of the promised funding well when you leave the funding behind you leave millions of children behind with nothing but broken promises and the republican proposal falls 9 billion shortdlmost 25 percent of the funds authorized that is a terrible message to send to our school children and teachers look at health care the republican budget contains no meaningful proposal to address the problem of the 41 million americans who have no health insurance apparently the republican budget proposes to leave this problem to future congresses and generations how about domestic security the republicans proposed budget ignores many of the needs outlined by the agency heads at the unitedstates customs service the coast guard the department of energy and elsewhere they have said they need far more resources to meet the threat than what is proposed in the republican budget so what have the house republicans proposed what is their top domestic priority another huge tax cut that overwhelmingly benefits the super wealthy uke the president the house republicans have decided that the most pressing domestic problemthe one issue that cannot wait is that the super wealthy are paying too much in taxes that comes on the heels of the 1 4 trillion tax cut from 2001 that disproportionately benefits the very wealthy and what will be the result of the republican tax cut plan directed mostly to the wealthy even administration officials have conceded that it will do vittually nothing to stimulate the economy right row the real result will be rivers of red ink and rising interest rates the republican plan would result in a 324 billion deficit this year and lead to one of the sharpest reversals in americas fiscal fortunes in history and that doesnt even include one penny of the cost of the ongoing war with iraq and its aftermath the presidents policies would take us from a projected 5 6 trillion surplus over 10 years to a projected 2 1 trillion deficit the republican budget committee proposal masks these longterm deficits by calling for huge and unrealistic cuts the actual result of their tax cut proposals will be exploding deficits whos going to pick up the tab for this growing mountain of debt the american people of course its simple there are only two ways to deal with it in the long run either we substantially raise taxes on the next generation or we dramatically cut the areas of largest expendituresocial security and medicare already funds from the social security trust fund are going to pay for the presidents last round of tax cuts remember that lock box well the lock has been picked and the raid is on the republican budget plan makes the problem even worse it is a guided missile aimed at the heart of social security and its not just money in the trust fund that will be lost we will also lose the trust of the american people so i am very concerned with the reckless economic course proposed in the republican budget it does exactly what the president said in his state of the union that he does not want to doit ignores our very real current needs and passes on the burdens of huge tax cuts to social security medicare and future congresses and generations i believe the republican budget plan is out of touch with the true hopes and aspirations of the american people we have an obligation to confront our needs squarely now we need to talk straight to the american people the democratic budget alternatives we are debating tonight all reflect the values and priorities of the american people better than the republican plan they correct the serious defects in the proposed republican budget all of them provide a great national investment in education health care homeland security and prescription drug coverage for seniors and they all do so without running up the huge deficits and debt contained in the republican plan one shortcoming in the democratic plans however is thatalthough they all provide a greater investment in our childrens education than the republican proposal none of them reach the full level of funding promised in the leave no child behind legislation full funding for leave no child behind idea and the other educational commitments we have made must be a top priority i will continue to press for a budget that keeps all the prom ses we have made americas children while i am disappointed that the democratic alternatives do not provide for full funding of these educational commitments they come far closer than the republican proposal they also meet many other needs that are neglected

funding for perkins loans by nearly 100 million the misled priorities do not stop there according to top level officials of the administration the presidents budget underfunds the department of veterans affairs by 1 2 billion and falls short on veterans health benefits furthermore for nonveterans the budget does nothing to address skyrocketing healthcare costs of lowincome individuals recklessly slashing or neglecting nonhomeland security domestic discretionary spending which comprises a mere onesixth of the total budget will not make a dent in the astronomical budget deficit that republicans have proposed that is why i support the substitute offered by the congressional black caucus which will not only restore funding to veterans and other domestic priorities but also including funding for essential priorities such as local law enforcement schools and job training we in this body have an obligation to represent all americans not just the wealthiest ones for that

regulatory commission is unconscionable i would like to bring to your attention several outstanding issues that cloud the future of the problemridden yucca mountain project key scientific issues surrounding the yucca mountain project remain unresolved sound science on the longterm viability of a deep geologic burial site for77 000 tons of highlevel nuclear waste has yet to be produced the department of energy continues to struggle to address the nearly 200 outstanding key technical issues concerning the repository numerous scientific reports highlight the potential shortcomings of the current plan including a lack of comprehensive performance tests on the manmade storage casks the presence of significant seismic activity at the proposed site and incomplete data on the effects of the waste on the surrounding communities additionally questions regarding the reliability of computer models in evaluating risks posed by longterm waste storage at the yucca site remain unanswered some have stated that only the people in nevada have a problem with yucca mountain proponents of the yucca mountain nuclear dump site claim that its needed to address security concerns at 131 nuclear reactor sites but this simply is not the case even if the department of energy receives a license to construct the repository at yucca mountain operating nuclear reactors will always have nuclear waste onsite as long as a nuclear power plant is in operation it will produce hot radioactive spent nuclear fuel the fuel must be cooled on site for 5 to 10 years before it can be moved therefore even as older fuel is shipped to a repository huge amounts of nuclear waste will remain at those 131 sites shipping nuclear waste to yucca mountain will not make these reactors any safer on the contrary it will create another potential terrorist target in nevada in addition it will also create thousands of mobile targets traveling through 43 states and as many as 360 congressional districts for more than 30 years however if approved 77 000 tons of highlevel nuclear waste would be transported from 131 sites across the united states through 43 states and perhaps as many as 360 congressional
