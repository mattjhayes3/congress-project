house republicans budget resolution for fiscal year 2014 i oppose this irresponsible budget resolution because it continues the reckless approach to fiscal policy that that the house majority championed for years with disastrous results i oppose the resolution before us because it favors the wealthy over middle class families and those struggling to enter or remain in the middle class i oppose the resolution because it asks major sacrifices of seniors who can barely make ends meet and fundamentally alters the social contract in our america by turning medicaid into a block grant i cannot and will not support a resolution that attempts to balance the budget on the backs of seniors children the poor or mortgages the future by failing to make the investments needed to sustain economic growth and opportunity for all americans mr chair we democrats have a better way we understand that we are all in this together and that our current economic situation calls for a balanced approach between increased revenues and responsible reduction in expenditures our plan will protect and strengthen our recovering economy reduce the deficit in a responsible way while continuing to invest in the things that make our country strong like education health care innovation and clean energy mr chair this republican budget is bad for america but it is disastrous for the people from my home state of texas who sent me here to advocate for their interests let me highlight a few examples 1 if the republican budget resolution were to become the basis of federal fiscal policy 3 435 336 texas seniors would be forced out of traditional medicare and into a voucher program under the republican plan to end medicare as we know it beginning in 2024 all texas seniors will receive a voucher instead of guaranteed benefits under traditional medicare 2 for the 3 435 336 texans aged 4554 the value of their vouchers would be capped at growth levels that are lower than the projected increases in health care costs previous analyses showed that this type of plan would cut future spending by 5 900 per senior forcing them to spend more out of pocket and diminishing their access to quality care 3 additionally private insurance plans will aggressively pursue the healthiest least expensive enrollees thereby allowing medicarecurrently the lifeline for 3 187 332 texas seniorsto wither on the vine 4 if the republican budget resolution were to adopted by congress 206 304 texas seniors would pay more for prescription drugs next year the republican plan would reopen the donut hole forcing seniors to pay the full cost of their prescription drugs if their yearly drug expenses are more than 2 970 for the year seniors reaching the prescription drug donut hole would pay an average of 828 more in prescription drug costs in 2014 and approximately 13 000 more from now through 5 under the republican budget 2 445 462 texas seniors would be forced to pay for preventive health services by repealing health reform the republican plan will require that the 2 445 462 texas seniors who utilized free preventive services currently covered by medicare in 2012 will face increased costs in the form of higher deductibles coinsurance and copayments for certain services including even cancer screenings and annual wellness visits 6 the republican budget slashes 31 71 billion in nursing home care and other health care services for 754 500 texas seniors and disabled who currently rely on medicaid for their longterm care needs 7 the draconian cuts included in the republican budget would have a devastating impact on the 1 191 certified nursing homes in texas that serve 91 717 seniors with more than half relying on medicaid as their primary payer as a result nursing homes would be forced to slash services turn away seniors or close their doors mr chair this budget could have invested in programs that help strengthen the middle class reduce poverty and strengthen our economic recovery instead the republican budget makes deep cuts to the area of the budget helping lowincome families put food on the table and make ends meet these are families who are already struggling with unemployment lower wages and just simply trying to make ends meet the house republican budget will push millions more americans into poverty and put a large number of lowincome children seniors and people with disabilities at risk it guts medicare and medicaid and calls for massive cuts to food assistance all in order to protect tax breaks for special interests and for multimillionaires who are not even asking for them the republican budget may be characterized in many wayscruel irresponsible shortsighted recklessbut fair and balanced is not one of them in contrast the alternative budgets proposed by the democratic caucus congressional black caucus and congressional progressive caucus which were made in order by the rules committee are each worthy of support because they fairly balance the need for increased revenues and responsible reductions in expenditures with the imperative of making the necessary investments in human capital required to move our country forward specifically the alternative budgets proposed by the democratic caucus cbc and cpc help create more jobs now replace the sequester make key education investments invest in research and development and clean energy invest in longterm infrastructure preserve medicare as we know it protect health reforms benefits for seniors protect medicaid for seniors in nursing homes preserve supplemental nutrition assistance snap reduce the deficit through a smart targeted and steady approach provides tax relief for working families and ends tax breaks for the wealthy take a balanced approach to reducing the longterm deficits and debt and put the budget on a sustainable path mr chair under the democratic budget the deficit would fall from 7 percent of gdp in 2012 to under 3 percent of gdp by 2015 and to 2 4 percent of gdp in 2023 the balanced plan put forward by the democratic caucus will bring the budget into primary balance in 2017 and complete balance by around 2040about the same time as the house republican budget last year the democratic budget alternative will generate 1 2 million more jobs this year compared to the republicans austerity first plan by investing 200 billion in creating jobs upfront strengthening the middle class creating greater upward mobility and ensuring opportunity for our children and future generations included in the democratic proposal is 50 billion to fund jobs that address immediate surface transportation priorities and 10 billion to establish an infrastructure bank as well as tax incentives to support small businesses and manufacturing additionally the democratic budget immediately ends the sequester which would otherwise cost the economy 750 000 jobs by the end of the year and replaces it with deficit reduction resulting from a balanced approach combining responsible spending cuts with increased revenues by cutting tax breaks for special interests and wealthy individuals without increasing the tax burden on middleincome americans finally mr chair as a senior member of the committee on the judiciary let me note my disappointment that an amendment i offered which would have made this dreadful budget resolution a little less hurtful was not made in order by the committee on rules the jackson lee amendment to h con res 25 would put the congress on record in support of current funding levels for crime prevention grant programs administered by the department of justice the first and most important obligation of government is to ensure the safety of the people and nothing is more destabilizing to communities and inimical to job creation and economic growth than crime that is why it is counterproductive to cut investments in crime prevention under the guise of balancing a budget to spur economic growth it is said often mr chair but is no less true that the federal budget is more than a financial document it is an expression of the nations most cherished values as the late and great former senator and vicepresident hubert humphrey said the moral test of government is how that government treats those who are in the dawn of life the children those who are in the twilight of life the elderly and those who are in shadows of life the sick the needy and the handicapped for that reason that in evaluating the merits of a budget resolution it is not enough to subject it only to the test of fiscal responsibility to keep faith with the nations past to be fair to the nations present and to safeguard the nations future the budget must also pass a moral test the republican budget resolution fails both of these standards the democratic alternatives do not for these compelling reasons i stand in strong opposition to h con res 25 and urge my colleagues to join me in voting against this illconceived and unwise measure"],

continue talking about the ongoing crisis of poverty and the impact of sequester we are well aware of the impact the sequester is having on many many communities across the country in terms of devastating some of the basic social safety networks that we have all benefited from in many many ways theyre really very very harmful to our most vulnerable nearly 50 million americans including 16 million children all across our country and in every congressional district are living in poverty yet the sequester continues to have devastating impacts on access to childhood education affordable housing hot meals for lowincome seniors head start and countless other programs that help lowincome and vulnerable americans but these draconian cuts are not enough for some of my colleagues given what took place last night at the ag committee last night the ag committee passed a 20 billion cut to our nations first line of defense against hunger in the farm bill the supplemental nutrition assistance program formerly known as the food stamp program is really a vital lifeline for millions of americans as a young single mother i relied on food stamps and public assistance during a very difficult period in my life let me tell you no oneno onewants to be on food stamps but it is a bridge over troubled water and so i am quite frankly appalled and very sad to see my colleagues attacking the integrity of such essential programs for families that need a helping hand during difficult times as we work to create hopefully a balanced reauthorization of the farm bill we must keep in mind the people the families and businesses impacted by these proposed cuts nearly half of all snap recipients are children one in five children in america are at risk of hunger and we know that nearly half of all children in america will be on snap benefits sometime during their childhood thats half of all children in america not only does snap help put food on the table for struggling families every 1 increase in snap benefits generates 1 70 in economic activity yet if the farm bill becomes law more than 2 million families will be cut off from this economic lifeline with unemployment still at 7 5 percentand in some communities its over 13 percentand the rate of poverty at 15 percentagain some communities its 27 to 30 percentongoing cuts to snap and other nutrition assistance programs will increase hunger in america and we will see even greater consequences hungry children cannot learn in school and suffer developmental delays hungry children have worse health outcomes hungry children have bleaker economic outlooks through the rest of their adult lives but the impacts dont stop there cuts to critical nutrition programs dont just hurt the hungry families who rely on them they hurt the economies of local communities as families have less money to spend in local stores allowing an increase in hunger across america will threaten our nations ability to develop the highly skilled and highly educated workforce that we will need to compete in the 21st century we must not make cuts on the backs of hungry children to balance our budgets doing so would be morally wrong and an economic disaster instead of scheduling a 37th vote to repeal the affordable care act we should come together to work to find an approach for all americans to help get everyone back to work we need a comprehensive solution to replace the sequester and to address the ongoing crisis of poverty that is why with the support of our democratic caucus we started a task force on poverty and opportunity in february which i am proud to chair we are working to build support for a comprehensive national strategy to help eliminate poverty grow the economy and create millions of new jobs and i urge all of my colleagues to join us i also hope that our colleagues will join myself representative jim mcgovern our congressional black caucus chair marcia fudge congresswoman jan schakowsky and our democratic caucus vice chair joe crowley in taking the food stamp challenge we need to raise the level of awareness of what is taking place here in washington d c and so what were going to do is commit ourselves to limiting our food budget to the average snap benefit for a week thats 1 40 per person per meal we will show how vital it is to strengthen and fully fund snap and were asking all of those who can do this to join with us weve got to protect the most vulnerable grow the economy and snap is one of the best programs to do just that so its time not to slash it but to support it"], [1.4543533325195312e-05, 0.9999854564666748, 1, "first let me thank my colleague for your tremendous leadership and yourself and congressman jeffries for leading the charge on another timely and important topic the ongoing crisis of poverty you both are continuing in the tradition of the congressional black caucus being the conscience of the congress and so thank you very much for your leadership and for your commitment to the least of these i think in your remarks congressman horsford you laid it out as clear as anyone could lay it out as the cochair of the congressional black caucus poverty and economy task force as well as as congressman horsford said the chair of the new whip task force on poverty and opportunity let me just highlight how truly important it is to continue to first fund programs that lift americans out of poverty income inequality continues to grow unfortunately too many people who are working are poor and theyre living on the edge its truly unacceptable that 46 million people in our country live in poverty in the richest and most powerful country in the world and 16 million of those are children in communities of color poverty rates are even worse a staggering 27 percent of african americans are living in poverty and so the congressional black caucus through the tremendous leadership of our chairwoman congresswoman marcia fudge has made the eradication of poverty a key priority our policies and programs addressing poverty have not kept pace with the growing needs of millions of americans it is time that we make a commitment to confront poverty head on create pathways out of poverty and provide opportunities for all yes we want to make sure the middle class is strong and survives and the middle class does not fall back into poverty but we have many many people who are not even part of the middle class and who are striving and working hard just to maintain and take care of their families and who would one day like to be part of the middle class and so the congressional black caucus and our whip task force and many in this body continue to speak on their behalf and represent them thats why many of our cbc colleagues and i came together to introduce h r 2182 which is the halfinten act of 2013 the halfinten act would establish the federal agency working group on reducing poverty the working group will develop and implement a national strategy to reduce poverty in half in 10 years as well as provide regular reports of its progress to congress and the american people our nation needs a coordinated and comprehensive plan to bring an end to poverty in america it is morally right economically sound and fiscally prudent so i urge all of our colleagues to join us and support the halfinten act its beyond time that we put the ongoing crises of poverty on the front burner for this country yet the draconian sequester and harmful budget cuts to vital humanneeds programs are only making things worse for struggling families i serve on the budget committee and the appropriations committee it was mindboggling to hear the other side talk about a commitment to reducing poverty yet they gut the vital programs the ladders of opportunity the pathways out of poverty such as the supplemental nutrition assistance program better known as food stamps the women infants and children program or wic meals on wheels the earned income tax credit and all of these programs that lift people out of poverty our chair mentioned the house farm bill let me emphasize this again the reauthorization includes more than 20 billion in harmful and fiscally irresponsible cuts to the food stamp program our nations first line of defense against hunger not only is cutting snap morally wrong its economically bankrupt cuts to nutrition programs will cost the government more money in the long run but also it is just probably the worst thing that i have ever seen proposed as a former food stamp recipient myself i know firsthand how important these safety net programs are i would not be here today if it were not for the lifeline that the american people extended to me when i was a single mother struggling to care for my kids no one wants to be on food stamps no one everyone wants a job they want to take care of their kids but there are bumps in the road and the economy has not turned around for many and so that bridge over troubled waters needs to be there so a 20 billion cut people cannot afford that our economy cannot support that hungry children do not deserve these cuts and cuts to any hunger program will have further cascading impacts that will create a bleaker future for our children communities of color again especially african american communities will feel these impacts even more african american communities have higher infant mortality rates diabetes hiv and aids and are more likely to be uninsured if we continue to balance our budget on the backs of the most vulnerable we will surely push these families over the edge that is why members of the congressional black caucus will do everything in our power to ensure that our nations most vulnerable are protected starting next week in an effort to highlight the impact of any further cuts to our nations food and nutrition programs myself as well as congressman jim mcgovern our congressional black caucus chair marcia fudge congresswoman jan schakowsky our democratic vice chair joe crowley and others are leading and taking part in the food stamp challenge we need to raise the level of awareness of what is taking place here in washington d c so we are going to commit ourselves to limiting our food budget to the average snap benefit for a week thats 1 50 per person per meal we will show how vital it is to strengthen and fully fund snap and were asking all of those who can do so to join with us we will just be on this for a day or a week millions of people will live daily on 4 50 with no end in sight finally let me just say we must protect the most vulnerable and grow the economy and our antipoverty programs like snap which is one of the best programs to do that so i urge my colleagues to reject these cuts stop sequestration and lets work together to create jobsbecause thats what everyone needs and wantsand lift the economy for all thank you again for your leadership"],

so magnificent because it is so diverse we represent districts all over the country we represent people of different backgrounds all over the country but one thing among others that we certainly have in common is that each one of us have people in our districts who depend on the snap program for their nutrition there isnt one person in this room who could rise up and say nobody in my district relies on the nutrition programs that are in the farm bill chief among them are children seniors veterans and their families they are the real faces of hunger in america and their stories are the most

looking for work catlin found that she could not afford to pay rent and purchase food each month because she qualified for the emergency food snap initiative she was able to get by get a promotion and now works full time theres brian 50 years old and homeless even though he searches constantly for fulltime employment he spends his spare time volunteering at st anthonys dining room helping other people this is a place that helps other people to find food shelter clothes and compassion in our community there he gives back what little he has to the community wholeheartedly serving our seniors veterans children and families who also rely on the generosity of people like brian to feed themselves and their loved ones like brian and catlin millions of people across america are working hard and giving all they have to lift themselves up and help others get on their feet one of my colleagues said something like if you dont work you shouldnt eat something to that effect i hope i heard it incorrectly its really important to note that because of the low minimum wage in our country a family of four with both parents working full time and earning the minimum wage are below the poverty line they dont even come close to the 130 percent of poverty they are below the poverty line so in some respects the snap program is subsidizing a low minimum wage in our country as other support does as well i wish that we could respect how hard it is for a family of four with two people working full time not making enough money to put food on the table that we respect them for their struggle and for their concern for their families and not judge them that they dont have food on the table because our country has chosen to pay a subliving wage to so many people in our country the republican

house i am going to tell you a little bit about the way we can do that these are the rules of the house i strongly recommend them as a bedtime read fortunately they have a provision called the discharge petition that provides a way that the members of this body 218 out of 435 meaning a majority of the members of this body can sign a discharge petition for a bill that means that despite a speaker or majority leader that refused to schedule that bill for debate if a majority of members sign the discharge petition it goes right to the floor for a straight upordown vote that is all we are asking for mr speaker a straight upordown vote i am confident h r 15 would pass tomorrow if we had that opportunity i call upon my colleagues democratic and republican to sign the discharge petition i call upon my friends across the country to inform their members of congress that they want to see action on this important issue in no way shape or form should this detract from the passion mr bishop has for obscure provisions of the antiquities act and the nepa process surrounding the establishment of public monuments but this simply isnt the issue that galvanizes our country this simply isnt the issue that reduces our deficit by 900 billion over two decades whatever we do to the antiquities act does not create 150 000 jobs for american citizens does not boost gdp and is not backed by an unprecedented coalition of labor and business farmworkers and agricultural companies the faithbased community police and law enforcement and the business sector we have the opportunity to do something great for our country mr speakerthe opportunity to show real leadership by of course encouraging you to bring forward immigration reform and if you prefer to bring forward several components we will work with you to ensure that we can address some if not all of the issues within our broken immigration system but failing your leadership the membership of this body under the rules of the house has asserted itself under a discharge petition to bring comprehensive immigration reform h r 15 immediately to the floor of the house for an upordown vote i reserve the balance of my time"],

issues we agree on i think this first 6 months has been a very productive session for this congress and this particular bill i think is noteworthy it is a little bit of a shame we are actually here in the early stages of the drug enforcement agencys efforts to control the distribution and abuse of controlled substances they issued a very blanket type of rule that unfortunately scooped up veterinary medicine and animals we have been able to avoid this issue for many many years it is one of those where for the last 100150 years veterinarians have gone out to the farms and ranchesnowadays even within the cities going home to home with mobile veterinary clinicsmaking sure those patients got the care with the appropriate medication that they deserve to be treated humanely dea in its exuberance unfortunately was unwilling to grant a waiver a commonsense waiver administratively and forced congressman yoho and myself to go to a statutory changelots of taxpayer money lots of time by the committees but it unfortunately is necessary the good news i think for america is that common sense does prevail a lot of times in this great congress as alluded to they have over 185 cosponsors of this legislation the veterinary medicine mobility act allowing veterinarians simply to do what they have done before which is carry controlled substances safely to treat dispense and protect their

to bring to justice those responsible for violence against peaceful protesters and to release and drop any criminal charges against those detained for peacefully exercising their democratic rights at this point the governments crackdown has led to the deaths of at least four protestersperhaps moreand throughout ukraine to numerous beatings arrests detentions abductionsincluding some from

attacked also 136 journalists have been attacked on the maidan including investigative journalist tetyana chornovol brutally beaten on christmas day and who investigators rather incredibly claimed was a victim of road rage one of the most outrageous examples has been the case of activist dmitry bulatov who was abducted for 8 days before being left in a forest outside of kyiv during which time he was tortured by his captors who tried to force him to say he was an american spy the heroism of the ukrainian people persistently demonstrating struggling and risking themselves for justice and dignity is deeply inspiring the witness of so many clergy on the maidan is a powerful reminder of the spiritual values that are at stake just last thursday i had the high honor and privilege of meeting in my office with patriarch filaret of the ukrainian orthodox church and patriarch sviatoslav of the ukrainian greek catholic church these brave and holy religious leaders are deeply concerned for the faithfuland for the whole ukrainian nationand alarmed about the potential for even worse violence perhaps even civil conflict patriarch filaret said recently i appeal to both the power and opposition to stop violence and to come to the negotiating table all of you are responsible before god for your earthly doings at the vatican pope francis called for an end to the violence and said i am close to ukraine in prayer and in particular to those who have lost their lives in recent days and to their families i hope that a constructive dialogue between the institutions and civil society can take place that any resort to violence is avoided and that the spirit of peace and a search for common ground is in the hearts of all cardinal timothy dolan of new york expressed strong support for antigovernment protesters in ukraine writing on his blog he summarized the conflict as government thugs relishing the chance to bludgeon and harass the hundreds of thousands of patriotic ukrainians and described the ukrainian greek catholic church as a church that has been starved jackbooted imprisoned tortured persecuted and martyred by hitler stalin and company that said i do want to note that there is a paradox here i know there are many outstanding people working in and for the ukrainian government who love their country and have its best interest at heart last year for example i met many times with ukrainian ministers highlevel officials and the ambassador including meetings in kyiv this was because in 2013 ukrainian foreign minister kozhara chaired the organization for security and cooperation in europe and made the fight against human trafficking a top priority for the organization in june it held a highlevel conference in kyiv to investigate and promulgate best practices and ways that the 57 osce countries can better coordinate antitrafficking efforts including through training transportation and hospitality industry employees in victim identification the kyiv call to action was serious and successful i know because i was there and what came out of that was a new osce plan of action to combat human trafficking i want to point out that this resolution does not take any position on whether ukraine should sign an association agreement with the european union that is a decision for the ukrainians to make themselves at the committee markup we decided to make that point clear and the message should be clear this is not about politics this is about human rights congress is supporting the ukrainian people in their defense of universal human values and not inserting itself into the question of what ukraine does visavis the european union the ukrainian people have endured horrific suffering over the course of the last century and this is what gives their peaceful resistance on the maidan such power two world wars were fought on their soil in the 1930s as we all know stalin inflicted a genocidal famine on them which resulted in the death of millions of men women and children to say nothing of 70 years as a captive nation in the soviet union in the 1980s many of us in this chamber and on the helsinki commission especially spoke out on behalf of ukrainian human rights activists imprisoned in the gulag called for the legalization of the thenbanned and repressed ukrainian greek catholic church and held several hearings on

the ability of the aviation security advisory committee to effectively and efficiently conduct its important work by concurring in the senate amendment to h r 1204 and sending the bill to the

latitude to develop implement and modify aviation security policies and procedures as a result in many instances tsa is not required to and does not go through the federal rulemaking process to establish new policies or modify those already on the books i have introduced h r 1204 to ensure that input from the key stakeholders is sought received and considered by tsa to that end my bill not

affect farmers first of all i would say that i think it is the right thing for us to do to eliminate the direct payment program i think that is the right policy that is in the bill and i would continue to support it i do think that we have some work to do on the crop insurance program but this is not the answer if we are trying to limit or put a means test on those whom you would define as the wealthiest farmers in the country i dont believe this is the correct way to do it look at agriculture across the country you have corn farmers in the midwest soybean farmers in the midwest you have specialty crops whether it is green beans strawberries carrots or potatoes all of these have different variables in the amount of income that comes in per acre so whether it is 10 acres or whether it is 10 000 acres i believe that the risk is still great to american farmers and producers lets also remember that the premium support is not a cash subsidy to farmers farmers dont all of a sudden open the mailbox and get a check in the mail with premium support which i think is an appropriate system for our insurance programs that the federal government can participate in but i dont believe that using the agi is the correct way to measure whether farmers should be participating at certain levels or not if we really wanted to means test we would use taxable income where farmers would be reporting certain incomes agi can vary from crop to crop from farm to farm and so taxable income would make much more sense if we are going to talk about any sort of means testing also i believe that it undermines the important landlordtenant relationship i have specifically been involved in this whether it comes to direct payments obviously with the increased cost of farmland over the past several years those relationships are very very important and very valuable almost half of the farmland in this country is rented i know that on our farm we rent almost threequarters of the land that we farm if land owners can no longer afford crop insurance they can simply transfer that risk to tenants through cash leases you end up hurting the smaller farmers that rely on rented farmland so i dont believe that this particular idea is ready for us to move forward on i think that it needs more work i think that the intentions by the author are sincere in trying to lessen the burden on the american taxpayer but at the same time lets not hurt the american farmer and create basically a system that can treat a farmer in the south differently than a farmer in the midwest or a farmer in the north lets go back and reevaluate the system i think that if you talk to the farming industry you talk to farmers they will come to the table and will try to find a reasonable way at
