chairman of the full committee the gentleman from texas jack brooks and the chairman of the subcommittee the gentleman from california don edwards who helped get this bill to the point where it can be passed today over many difficult compromises and discussions but their patience and their intelligence and their good will paid off i should mention melody barnes and alan erenbaum counsel who spent many hours working with our counsel kathryn hazeem in resolving the many difficulties inherent in this bill the religious freedom restoration act will overturn the 1990 decision of the unitedstates supreme court in employment division versus smith smith held that neutral laws of general application that incidentally burden religious exercise do not violate the free exercise clause of the first amendment to the unitedstates constitution h r 1308 will replicate the compelling state interest test for the adjudication of free exercise claims which was in place prior to the supreme courts decision in smith when this legislation was considered by the subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights and the full judjciary committee in the 102d congress i offered several amendments these amendments were designed to address concerns i had with respect to abortionrelated claims thirdparty challenges to churchrun social service programs and challenges to the taxexempt status of religious institutions since that time my concerns have been resolved either through explicit statutory changes or through committee report language a major issue of contention in the 102d congress was whether the bill was a true restoration of the law as it existed prior to smith or whether it sought to impose a more stringent statutory standard of course the label restoration is inappropriate in this context since the congress writes laws it does not and cannot overrule the supreme courts interpretation of the constitution we are unable to restore a prior interpretation of the first amendment h r 1308 is a proposed federal statute and its meaning will be determined by its plain language and to some extent by the intent of congress in enacting it several changes were made to the bill during the judiciary committee markup in late september 1992 and prior to the bills introduction in the 103d congress these changes make clear that the statutory standard of the religious freedom restoration act is the same free exercise standard that was applied by the unitedstates supreme court prior to smith the intended standard of the bill was of particular concern to me in the area of abortion rights i have been deeply concerned that the religious freedom restoration act would create an independent statutory basis to challenge abortion restrictions that does not exist under current law the bill now clearly imposes a statutory standard that is to be interpreted as incorporating all federal court cases prior to smith the one successful district court free exercise challenge to an abortion funding restriction prior to smith was rejected by the unitedstates supreme court in harris v mcrae 448 unitedstates 297 1980 in that case the court stated that none of the parties had standing to sue because none had alleged much less proved that she sought an abortion under compulsion of religious belief because free exercise challenges to abortion restrictions were ultimately unsuccessful prior to smith i am confident that although such claims may be brought pursuant to the act they will be unsuccessful individuals seeking to challenge abortion restrictions should not look to the religious freedom restoration act but to planned parenthood versus casey which describes how claims pertaining to abortion are resolved we want to make it absolutely clear that this bill does not expand contract or alter the ability of a claimant to obtain relief in a manner consistent with the supreme courts free exercise jurisprudence prior to smith language has also been added to resolve concerns about application of the act to social service programs operated by religious institutions with public funds and possible challenges to the taxexempt status of religious institu tions the new language found in section 7 of the bill makes clear that such claims are not the appropriate subject of litigation under the religious freedom restoration act the changes made to the bill as introduced in the 103d congress make clear that the religious freedom act is not seeking to impose a new and strengthened compelling state interest standard but is seeking to replicate by statute the same free exercise test that was applied prior to smith in conclusion the religious freedom restoration act will not guarantee that religious claimants bringing free exercise challenges will win but only that they have a chance to fight i wonder if i might engage the gentleman from new jersey in a colloquy i would ask the gentleman it is my understanding that prior to 1987 many courts evaluated free exercise challenges by prisoners under the compelling governmental interest test the courts considered not only the exercise of religion but also the difficulty of the prison officials task of maintaining order and protecting the safety of prison employees visitors and inmates is it the gentlemans understanding that challenges of prison regulations were generally not successful even under a strict
