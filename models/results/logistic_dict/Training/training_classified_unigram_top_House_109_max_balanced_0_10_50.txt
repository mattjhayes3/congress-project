the floor of the house of representatives as the 30something working group myself along with kendrick meek mr meek from florida and also ms wasserman schultz from florida we have been coming here now for a couple of years talking about the condition of the united states our fiscal situation our investment situation or lack of investment in the united states of america and also what we believe is the democraticf caucus and leader peloij and steny hoyer and the issues that we are trying to put forward it has been a very interesting week here for the democratic caucus we had a wonderful guest george lucas the famous writer director producer of the great star wars movies and he was here to talk about the innovation agenda that the democratiq party is beginning to put forward and we have an innovation agenda to keep america competitive in the 21st century as we look at what has been happening here in the united states this kind of breaks down into two or three separate categories one if we want to be a strong country we have got to start here at home and we got to start making the investments here in the united statep research and development education health care alternative energy technologies must start here and we must begin to grow our economy here if we are going to be of any good to anyone else here in the world unfortunately our friends across the aisle on the republican side have failed miserably in their attempt to try to balance the budget here in the united states of america we have as citizens of this country regardless of what political party you belong to we have as a country an 8 2 trillion national debt 8 2 trillion dollars each citizen in this country owes 27 000 to our national debt if a baby is born today that baby owes 27 000 to the united states government to help us pay our debt if you are a senior citizen you owe 27 000 to the united states government and if we keep going down the path that we have been on and here it is 8 2 trillion as of valentines day 2006 and your share of the national debt is 27 500 we have a real situation in the united states of america so not only do we owe this not only does each person owe that what do we do so if we are running a 400 billion annual deficit or 300 billion what do we do to fund business in the united states of america we have got to go out and borrow the money and this president in the first 4 years of his term borrowed more money from foreign interests than every single administration prior to his in the last 224 years this president borrowed 1 05 trillion from foreign interests in 4 years more than every other president before him is that making america stronger mr speaker i do not think it is i think it weakens our country and here it is this president in a republican house and a republican senate has borrowed 1 05 trillion from 2001 to 2005 and all of these presidents did not borrow as much from foreign interests as this one has and that puts us that puts us at a position of weakness because guess who we are borrowing the money from to pay the bills we borrow some from unitedstates interests but this is a chart that outlines who else we are borrowing this money from 682 billion we have borrowed from japan 249 billion we have borrowed from china 67 8 billion from opec are you kidding me we are borrowing money from opec to help fund and plug the hole in our annual deficits here meanwhile they are making money hand over fist this is a very dangerous situation that we are in because here is the end result here is where the rubber meets the road as we all take out loans to pay for our homes or our cars or our kids education unfortunately you cannot just borrow the money at zero percent interest you have got to pay interest on the money you borrow so the interest on 8 2 trillion is a lot of money so what does that mean for our annual payments that we have to make just on the interest this chart is the 2007 budget in billions of dollars this big red bar that gets up to 230 billion is what we are going to pay in the 2007 budget projected on interest on the debt just the interest we are not paying it down we are just paying the interest on it and this nice lavender bar that barely gets up over 50 billion is what we are going to spend on education and then homeland security and then veterans the irresponsible policies of this administration put our fiscal house in disorder because we are spending so much money on just paying the interest on the money we owe the chinese and the japanese and the opec countries that is a great deal for those countries great deal for them but what about us a stronger america starts here at home so until we fix this problem there is no issue we can go on addressing because it straps our hands behind our back because we want to make investments in education research and development pell grants to lower the cost of college tuition put research money into figuring out an alternatie energy source so we are not dependent on some of these opec countries but check this out this is the interest on the debt that i just showed this is what we could spend every day in this country if we did not have to pay all this interest on the debt we could invest 1 million a day into every congressional district i represent a district in northeast ohio youngstown ohio akron ohio niles ohio warren ohio portage county kent state university is in my district this is an older area in the northeast of the great state of ohio the great buckeye state 365 million i could have to go back to this area and invest in the schools head start all kinds of other different things just from my district and every other member in here would get 365 million a tremendous difference give it to the chinese banks the chiinese government give it to the japanese banks the japanese government give it to opec or give it to the kids who are trying to go to school in youngstown ohio of which 80 percentlive in poverty that go to youngstown city schools i know what i would like to choose some other things here we could provide health care to 79 925 more veterans if we would not have to pay the interest on the debt like in the late 1990s when we made the very difficult decision here and i am glad the gentleman from florida is joining us for this point a very difficult decision in 1993 when president clinton got into office we were running budget deficit after budget deficit every year and our democratic house and a democratic senate with a democratic president balanced the budget in 1993 without one republican vote i am hot saying some republicans would not vote for it now but at that time when the heat was on without one republican vote and it led to balanced budgets surpluses as far as the eye could see investments into education hope scholarship the whole nine yards and the greatest 6conomic expansion in the history of this country more important the private sector because interest rates were low the private sector was able to go out and create over 20 million new jobs we cannot create jobs here in government that is not our duty that is not our responsibility this is the chart reagan reagan reagan bush bush bush all in the red and clinton in the late 1990s after the 1993 budget was im plemented we started having surpluses in the late 1990s projected out as far as the eye could see because of fiscal discipline that is what our job is here balance the budget keep interest rates low invest in the education and research like this country has always done and the private sector will join and take over some other things if we did not have to pay the interest on the debt we could enroll 60 000 kids into head start you want to talk about being compassionate you want to talk about if you practice the christian faith being a christian i think somewhere that means making sure we can invest into those poor districts those poor children and i am so glad that mr meek is joining us because we started out here and that we being me talking about the impact of the budget deficit and the fiscal situation that we are in right now and the damage that it is causing to the american economy and the lack of investment because we are paying the interest on the debt to many of these countries overseas so thank you very much fot joining us i know you were busy in a homeland security committee hearing and i appreciate you coming up to support the 30somethings"], [0.00025957822799682617, 0.9997404217720032, 1, "it is an honor being before the house once again as you know the 30something working group we come to the floor as often as possible to not only share with the members what is going on as it relates to legislatioii here in washington d c but also what is not going on on behalf of the american people and hopefully we can put forth ideas and extending the arm to work in a bipartisan way on behalf of the american people so we are glad to come to the floor week after week also i would like to thank the democratic leader for allowing us to have this hour and also our democratic whip mr steny hoyer and mr james clyburn who is our chairman of our democratic caucus and mr larson who is our vicechair i think it is important that we come to the floor to share a unified message from this side that we are willing and able we have the will and the desire to work on behalf of the american people in general not just democrats not just republicans or independents but the american people in general to make sure the people of good will prevail in their everyday lives if they are a veteran if they are an individual that has fallen on hard times if they run a small business in this country if they have a midsized business that they want to turn into a big business we want to be able to be of some assistance as it relates to legislating here on behalf of the american people also i think it is iriiportant that we do not leave our children behind even though they cannot vote many of them are under the age of 18 years old not eligible to vote i think it is important that we stand for them there are a number of things that i am going to try to touch on today to make sure that we can cover all of just about all of what is happening and what is not happening here in washington d c i took the time when we were on break last week to really look closely at some of the comparisons because when you are trying to figure out what is happening to the issues that we all came to washington to work so hard on you have to compare it is almost like you have to have a sidebyside what we call it here in washington d c to compare it is almost like for someone who goes to the grocery store to buy an orange i am from florida nine times out of ten you are going to pick up those two oranges if they are from two different orange groves and kind of compare to see if it is an orange you are not going to grab an apple and grab an orange and start saying well which one looks like an orange but i must say here in washington d c it is almost like an orange and an apple experience because we are so far apart as it relates to working together on many of these issues that are facing our constituents back home and the american men and women that are overseas fighting on our behalf i looked at the issue of fiscal responsibility and i could not help but notice within the house gop budget that the budget calls for deficits as far as the eye can see never achieving a balance and adding another 2 3 trillion to the national debt over 5 years compared to the democratic alternative and the democratic philosophy if we can work in a bipartisan way to be able to balance this budget balance the budget over the next 5 years making sure that we can balance it over the next 6 years on a payasyougo philosophy e 1630 i will talk a little bit about that as i continue to go down this chart we believe that we can balance this budget because we have done it before unlike the republican conference or the republican side of the house which has not there was a surplus when the republicans took control of this house or when the president went into office and president bush went into office now we are into record deficits and i think it is important that we point this out and i have charts to be able to break that down for the members i think it is also important to think about making america safer here at home i looked at the republican budget and i could not help but notice that it made homeland security guts by 488 million this year and it is up to 6 1 billion over the next 5 years of cuts to homeland security and it is not much better than the presidents budget that came out of this house it estimated that port security grants and rail transit security grants will all be rolled into a smaller program and i think that that is something that is going to hurt a lot of local communities on the democratic side in our budget and our motion to recommit of our philosophy as it relates to what we should be doing by the homeland is to provide 6 5 billion more over the next 5 years for homeland security here by guaranteeing funding for border security port security and first responders which are so important to so many counties and local governments that are out there on the frontline that have to respond to the american people in their time of need adequate funding for veterans this is another point i will elaborate a little bit more during this hour of the facts like we always say during the 30something working group this is not what we came up with these are the facts and they are backed up by the congressional record or either a very credible thirdparty validator we start looking at that and we look at the republican budget that passed off this floor it cuts funding to veterans health care by 6 billion over the next 5 years the democratic alternative budget provides 8 6 billion more over the next 5 years for veterans health care then there is the gop budget it also rejects an increase in tricare which is a health care program for veterans for more than 3 million military retirees and their families these are increased costs that the republican budget has put on them and i am going to talk about that a little further it targets as it relates to tax cuts for the middle class the republican budget follows the presidents budget that goes back to the rubberstamp congress the rubberstamp republican congress that i talked so much about and it also happens to be a reality when you look at this issue you have to look at it from the standpoint of the presidents budget which provides 2 5 trillion in tax cuts over the next 10 years targeted for the very wealthiest americans the wealthiest taxpayers versus the democratic alternative that provides 105 billion for the middle class tax relief such as child tax credit marriage penalty relief and the 10 percent individual bracket i think it is also important for me to point out here as it relates to the issue of college making college more affordable and i had to look at this part of the budget and this is another area that i am going to talk a little bit more about because we have so many people and some middleaged people in america we do know that we have some americans that do not go from high school straight into college because they have to nine times out of ten get a job to be able to build up the money to go to college to be able to maybe take care of a family member that is up in age and they need that kind of assistance or they cannot go off to college or they have to go to a community college before they can go to a 4year institution everyone does not have a turnkey life so we have to look at policy that is going to be able to help all americans not just some when we look at the republican majority budget what it had in it this is straight from the budget this is not anything that i have put together to have some sort of lean towards making our proposals look better than the republican majority these are just the facts here in the house when you look at it it is identical once again and i think it is important the reason why i have this rubber stamp back here that i will proudly bring out in just a few moments is the fact that the president hands down what he would like to the policies that he would like to have here in this congress he would like for us to rubberstamp and the republican majority honors him in rubberstamping exactly the way it was written i think it is important in america in the peoples house the only housethat you have to be elected to that you cannot be appointed to over in the senate you can be appointed by a governor that the people should have an opportunity to be heard once again not just democrats not just republicans not just independents not just folks who vote but the american people should be represented and for them to be represented appropriately i think it is important that we have the kind of conversation and dialogue here that is going to benefit all americans and in this case it is identical to the presidents budget it freezes pell grants for colleges and denies more than 460 000 students lowcost loans this also is on the top of 12 billion cuts in the student loan funding that republicafis just enacted it is already there so what we are trying to do is i believe to turn that around and i am going to talk about legislation that we have to turn that around but as it relates to our alternative budget it rejects the gop cuts and higher education programs it also lowers the costs of student loans by cutting the interest rate per student loan in the fall of 2007 i think that is important there are a lot of folks that are sending their kids off to college right now there are a lot of folks that are writing letters for just 1 000 scholarships for local organizations because the costs of college have gone up when we mkke these cuts here in washington dc the state government has to make their cuts to the students and to the families that live down in those states and i think it is important that we look at this and i will talk about that a little further explaining educational opportunities i think it is important when you look at this part of the budget identical to the bush budget well that seems to be a common theme here which underfunds no child left behind by 39 percent denies extra math and reading help to 3 7 million children and shutting 2 million children out of afterschool programs on the democratic side our alternative provides 4 6 billion more dollars in 2007 and 35 3 billion over the next 5 years for education and training programs more than the gop budget i think this is important for families and parents like myself who know what it means that when your kids go to school you have to pay for aftercare and nine times out of ten that aftercare is like 150 to sometimes 200 a week some of you parents know what i am talking about unfortunately members of the republican side of this house do not understand what you are talking about and opt to invest 87 000 in tax cuts to millionaires so i think it is important that we look at this as it relates to a comparison one other thing that i think is important and justified here in this case that we roll right into what this means as it relates to the dollars and cents before we get into some of the policy issues that are called out here we can get right down to the nittygritty by saying over the last 5 years president bush and also the republican majority here came in and had a projected surplus in the next 10 years when the president took office of 5 6 trillion 5 6 trillion and that has now turned into a 3 3 trillion deficit now it would be kind of hard to say well the democrats took us down that line and they made us do this and they made us do that i can tell you that is not true that is not true we have tried to substitute a number of policies that would save this country in the future and would save our future for our children so they are not paying exorbitant tax and fees that this republican congress has put on them and have put on the american people it affects everything it affects social security it affects education it affects our way of being able to come up with alternative fuels it affects the way our troops are treated when they come back it affects our veterans it affects everyday families the decisions that are made here on this floor as it relates to the budget and as it relates to the spending affects everyone all americans it affects everyone that depends on this government to govern not to follow not to rubberstamp but to govern and i think that is very very important when you look at the tax bill that obviously the president wanted and the republican majority rubberstamped i think it is important that you look at the fact that we have now mortgaged our childrens future the republicans have passed this tax cut which has sunken us deeper 80 billion deeper into debt over the next 10 years and will benefit the few the wealthy i think it is also important for us to understand that we have to have fiscal discipline lets just talk a little bit about that because i want to make sure that everyone understands what we are talking about here well here is a chart again it is so selfexplanatory we just continue to use it and use it and use it the unfortunate part is that the numbers will change soon it will not change in the way of saying we are doing better no it will change in that we are doing worse when i say we i am saying led by the republican majority here in the house two hundred twentyfour years 1 01 trillion borrowed from foreign nations since the president has been president president bush and the republican majority has been in control over the last 4 years 2001 to 2005 president bush and the republican congress that is under his picture have borrowed 1 05 trillion i do not care there is no way you can explain how this is good no member need it be republican the one independent or democrat on this floor can explain how this can be good for the american people now time after time i have asked for an explanation from republicans during their time when they are on the floor to explain this all i hear is cricket sounds i look down the hall no one is there i am wondering where the fiscal conservatives in this house are as it relates to the republican majority i wonder where the leadership is as it relates to being able to turn this around there has been no attempt and i mean no documented attempt to be able to turn this around this is unprecedented the first time in the history of the country now this is not the first time in this century or the first time in the last 20 years or the first time in the last 200 years this is the first time in the history of the republic that any congress and any president has borrowed 1 05 trillion from foreign nations the first time the first time i mean it is not like well this happened a couple years ago no the first time in the history of this country should you be alarmed you doggone right you should be alarmed fortytwo presidents could not do it 224 years of a country with all of itg challenges could not do it but when you get president bush in the white house and you get a rubberstamp republican majority here in the house of representatives they can do it unfortunately if we continue with the same team that we have leading in this house and in the white house this is going to continue to grow and it is going to be very very unfortunate because countries are going to start to disrespect this country because we do not have not we the republican majority here in this house does not have the ability to govern and to govern in a way that it should following thepresident unfortunately on this issue where we could show clearly that this is not a winner did this chart come from the democratic caucus i think not these numbers came from the unitedstates department of the treasury so you can get on whatever web site you want to get on and you can find this you dan definitely find it on www housedemocrats gov 30something all of these charts will be there i suggest you download the chart and print it and show it to yout friends because they need to know 1645 what does it mean when i say folks start to disrespect this country we get members coming in this chamber and people giving speeches throughout the country burning all kinds of federal jet fuel talking about terror talking about what you should be scared of i can telliyou right now we need to be dealing with terror and we need to be dealing with it in a smart way and protect the homeland and that is not happening right now take it from me i am the ranking member on the homeland security subcommittee on oversight and i can tell you it is not happening right now we have not issued one subpoena to be able to rein in individuals that are stealing from this government contractors and individuals within the department that is allowing it to happen that is another special order that i will not get into right now but if you want to talk about disrespecting the united states of america this is not something that is foreign born or someone that released an audiotape or a videotape here this is what happened right here on the floor the borrowing that i talked about over the last 4 years how did it happen japan 882 8 billion bought our debt japan did not say hey we want yall to overspend we want you to give tax cuts to millionaires and billionaires we want you to do things that you cannot afford to do just because you can japan did not say well just because the president said we should do it that you should rubber stamp it no that is what the republican congress did and we do need a change and we need alternatives we have talked about those alternatives china 249 8 billion they bought our debt china red china communist china the u k want to talk about our ally and friend yeah they are our friends all right they bought 223 2 billion of our debt we did have the prime minister here he addressed a joint session i did not hear him and i was reading his speech as he was up here giving his speech he did not say hey keep spending in an irresponsible way so we can buy your debt and own a piece of the american apple pie he did not say that but the republican congress continues to rubber stamp presidents bushs policies to say that we are being fiscally responsible meanwhile there is 1 05 trillion that we borrowed from foreign nations caribbean countries 115 3 billion bought our debt taiwan 71 3 billion little taiwan they are even in the game of getting part of this american apple pie with the republican congress giving it away they are willing to buy it up guess who we owe we owe every last one of these countries that i have ripped off this chart so far canada just north of us 53 8 billion korea 66 5 billion germany 65 7 billion opec nations well you know opec nations who are they oil producing countries whether it be saudi arabia iran iraq you name it these countries are in this opec nation and they are even in the game of buying a piece of the american apple pie at 67 8 billion well i have this kind of flag here that is kind of draped over the united states of america and i said we want to get back there i would urge the members to do one of twothings one work in a bipartisan way and pick up payasyougo policies as we have talked about and have put on this floor here in this house time after time again and saying that if you are going to give 1 billion to a contractor to do whatever he wants to do with it without any little oversight then doggone it you better figure out how you are going to pay for it if you are going to give tax cuts to folks who are not asking for them you better show how you are going to pay for it not just saying we will borrow from these foreign nations we continue to borrow because we can borrow and make history in 4 years that was not accomplished in over 224 years no we are going to make history the republican majority is going to make history in 4 years at 1 05 trillion that is a lot of money with a big t 224 years 1 01 trillion fortytwo presidents could not even muster up that if you want to get back to a balanced budget that i talked about earlier that i am going to continue to pound on then have a democratic majority or work in a bipartisan way one of the two i have more faith in the fact of the democratic majority getting the job done than the republicans allowing us to work in a bipartisan way towards having a balanced budget you want to talk about partisanship partisanship over the budget is at the highest level that it could be because you have one side with the will and the desire to balance the budget and you have the other side republican majority that says they want to balance the budget but do not have the will and the desire to do it that is the sidebyside on that you have to have the will and the desire to do it i cannot go to my daughter and say lauren i want you to go out and play softball well she may not have the will and the desire to play softball but just because i have the will and desire does not necessarily mean that she has to have it well guess what on this side of the ball we have the will and the desire to balance the budget not only do we have the will and the desire history is on our side history is on our side because we balanced the budget we actually did it the democratic house did it without one republican vote not one maybe i could say maybe two three fournot one republican vote we balanced the budget and put this country in surplus we could have dealt with social security could have took it beyond the time it is supposed to have issues could have made sure that veterans did not have to pay copayments could have made sure that we could have been ahead as it relates not to below the 39 percent in funding leave no child behind could have provided more tax cuts for the middle class it is what it is and i would tell you if folks want to get back to a balanced budget and not have these countries in all due respect in our pocketthese countries have their hand in our pocket not because of the folks that are running around here trying to make a living every day it is because of the republican majority what they have done opec nations got their hands straight in our pocket germany has their hand in our pocket at 6 7 billion the unitedstates taxpayers pocket korea 66 5 billion they have their hands in our pocket taiwan 71 3 billion have their hands in our pocket canada 53 8 billion have their hands in the american taxpayers pocket caribbean countries 115 3 billion have their hands in the american taxpayers pocket the u k 223 2 billion have their hands in the american taxpayers pocket and china have a handandahalf in the american taxpayers pocket and reaching for their credit card while they are at it at 249 8 billion japan has just outright snatched the wallet out of the back of the taxpayers pocket and grabbed someones pocketbook and have their hand in the pocket of the unitedstates taxpayers at 682 8 billion not because the american people went out there and said let us make sure that we spend money that we do not have and let us make records in 4 years in borrowing money from foreign nations the republican majority they have rubber 9tamped the bush administration policy and here we are so what do we do what we do is we make changes and what we have tried to do on this side is do exactly that it would be hard for me as a member of the republican conference to come to this floor and speak with a straight face about the issue on the budget i do not know i would have to go into the bathroom and look in the mirror and practice because it would be hard for me to keep a straight face when i come to the floor to talk about the fact that i am a fiscal conservative and i care about the budget and responsible spending and making sure that we do not overspend and we are not like the others we do not spend well let me tell you something the congressional record says that you spend the american people are noticing that you spend and borrow and spend and borrow and spend and when you cannot borrow anymore you go to foreign nations and you borrow well this is what we have tried to do mr spratts substitute amendment to house concurrent resolution 95 2006 budget resolution failed 228 republican votes against it not one voted for it this is payasyougo once again if you are going to spend 1 million where are you going to get the 1 million from that is all we ask it

think what mr meek was saying was that we are going into the government retirement program in order to not have to increase the debt limit what we have here is that the republican congress has raised the debt limit numerous times since president bush has been in june of 2002 450 billion which means congress raises the debt limit so we can go out and borrow more money may of 2003 984 billion mr delahunt that means almost 1 trillion again november of 2004 this administration this republican congress went out and borrowed another 800 billion and now the new increase that the secretary of the treasury is asking for is another 781 billion so over the last few years the republican congress the republican president has borrowed 3 trillion new money from the japanese the chinese and opec

mean that it is because here are the hard facts the hard facts are these mr speaker president bush and the republican majority has borrowed 1 05 trillion 1 05 trillion from foreign nations historic and my next chart tells you who we are borrowing it from and they are owning a part of the american apple pie not because they had to pay 56 to fill up their f10 pickup truck not because of their indiscretions but because of the indiscretions of the republican majority we have 224 years of history in this country with 42 presidents before this president and they were only able to borrow 1 01 trillion those are the facts that is from the unitedstates department of the treasury it is not the kendrick meek report or the debbie wasserman schultz report of the 30something report because we think it works towards our position and not leveling with the american people i can tell you without looking at this chart i can tell you exactly what is on it because i have read it so many times to so many groups and here on this floor who are we borrowing it from who is owning a piece of the american apple pie japan at 682 billion china at 249 8 billion the u k at 223 2 billion the caribbean at 115 3 billion taiwan at 71 3 billion and the opec nations that i can go on and talk about these countries that we have issues with iran syria oilproducing middle eastern countries that we are

hurt people it is a health care budget that is antilife the bush budget carves out over 36 billion through 2011 from medicare despite the fact that people cannot afford prescription drugs and costs are exploding why is he forcing acrosstheboard cuts to future medicare payments the chaos surrounding the new prescription drug benefit has already caused undue anxiety and lack of medication to thousands of our citizens too sick and too ill to fight back in lines at drugstores around our country seniors 80 years old with parkinsons disease are being forced to go into drugstores confused without the help that they need the presidents budget is antilife at the s ame time the presidents new budget slashes our lead agencies to fight disease they shortchange veterans health care apparently the bush administrations idea of honoring service to our country is to make millions of veterans pay huge increases for health care costs that they have earned the presidents budget proposal includes legislation that would raise veterans premiums to over 100 percent on prescription drugs additionally the bush administration has shortchanged the department of veterans affairs leaving it short of needed funds to take care of the expected influx of tens of thousands of injured and disabled veterans returning from afghanistan and the iraq war his veterans budget is antilife the bush budget offers words only and no substance to thrust our nation into a new era of energy independence for hardhit consumers he has offered nothing his policies however allow the huge oil giants to rack up even more profits take exxonmobil that just racked up the largest profit of any corporation in unitedstates history 36 billion in profits in just 1 year their profits in 1 year were larger than the entire budget of the unitedstates department of energy it is interesting to note that exxons windfall lifted the combined profits of the 2005 oil giants to 63 billion three times the

at the winter heating assistance program the people applying have reached a 12year high but his budget is over 2 billion short 2 billion short of what is needed just to take care of the people that we needed to take care of last year but the oil companies have a 63 billion profit just the top three companies what is wrong with this picture he has cut first responders we know he has not gotten help to people affected by katrina and rita in the gulf and this says nothing about how his budget is antilife against the youth of our country and children by causing tuition to go up at all of our

republican president signed the budgets that is what this crowd has offered they have done it all what has that meant three trillion dollars of additional deficit spending that is what it has meant this budget continues that practice the overwhelming majority of americans now believe that our great nation is headed in the wrong direction not difficult to understand why they think that the republican partys incompetence over the past 512 years is undeniable from the miscalculations in iraq to the inept response to hurricane katrina to failure to secure our ports and borders to the historic turnaround in our fiscal health from the 5 6 trillion surplus that they inherited which they have turned into a 4 trillion deficit a 9 6 trillion turnaround in 64 months 5 4 million more americans live in poverty 6 million more are uninsured real median household income has dropped nearly 1 700 thus today it is stunning that our republican colleagues have brought a budget resolution to this floor that so badly betrays our values and fails to meet our nations priorities this shamefully shortsighted budget resolution cuts crucial investment in our nation and our people the difference i tell my friend from wisconsin is we want to pay for what we buy you are buying a lot you are buying more than we bought when we were in charge you are not paying you are borrowing from the japanese the chinese the saudis you borrowed more money from foreigners over the last 5 years than were borrowed in the 210 years before that over the next 5 years it slashes education by 45 billion veterans health care to which the gentleman referred by 6 billion public health by 18 billion and environmental protection by 25 billion even worse this budget resolution is a continuation of the most reckless fiscal policies in the history of our nation policies that have squandered as i said a 5 6 trillion budget surplus who said that george bush march 2001 said that is what we had they added more than 3 trillion to the national debt and weakened our ability weakened our ability to respond to national and international crises listen my friends to the warning of the nonpartisan comptroller general david walker not a democrat appointed by your side who stated in february continuing on the unsustainable fiscal path will gradually erode if not suddenly damage our economy our standard of living and ultimately our national security that is what mr walker says their budgets are doing to america yet that is precisely what this republican budget continues to do it not only fails to rein in the record republican deficits of the last 5 years it makes them worse hear me this budget makes the deficits worse it not only fails to arrest our exploding national debt it calls

to give i believe our kids and grandkids the opportunities of a debtfree world if we begin with a small step again this year that is the chairman who brings to this floor a 653 billion additional

businesses more than 10 years later an outoftouch republican majority has taken fiscal responsibility to a new low it is clear that in the 10 years the republicans have become addicted to deficits the budget deficit for this year is a record 427 billion the february budget deficit my colleagues of 114 billion for the month of february a deficit of 114 billion is the highest monthly deficit ever and the first time it ever went over 100 billion in one month in 2001 president clinton left president bush with a projected 5 6 trillion in surplus in just 4 years president bush has turned that record surplus into a record deficit of nearly 4 trillion a 10 trillion swing in the wrong direction make no mistake these deficits are the direct result of republican policies huge tax cuts for the wealthy a refusal to pay as you go poor planning for a war of choice in iraq the list goes on and on and on america is awash in red ink because of republican budget irresponsibility tragically this republican budget is yet another missed opportunity to return to fiscal discipline not only is this budget fiscally irresponsible the republican budget is dishonest it does not cut the deficit in half as republicans claim in fact it makes the deficit worse republicans leave out the realistic cost of the war the cost of expiring tax provisions the true cost of fixing the alternative minimum tax and the cost of any changes to social security the budget is dishonest in another way it fails to show any def7 icit figures at all after 2010 in our new partnership for americas future democrats have made a commitment to honor the value of accountability including eliminating deficit spending and holding those in power accountable for their actions with a high 6thical standard democrats support honest accountable budgets that pay as you go the democratic alternative offered by the gentleman from south carolina achieves balance by 2012 the republican budget never reaches balance it heaps tons of debt onto our children and grandchildren and it will eventually lower our standard of living we cannot let that happen to our country and on top of all of that the republican budget undermines the solvency of social security while republicans ignore the real crisis of ballooning budget deficits the president falsely claims there is a crisis in social security but just because the president says it does not make it so he is simply wrong according to the nonpartisan congressional budget office social securitys trust fund will grow every year until a high of 8 3 trillion in 2032 and continues to be solvent until 2052 i want to call your attention to this chart my colleagues the left bar represents the deficit in the general fund between now and 2035 a staggering 15 trillion the bush administration has taken us onto atrajectory of reckless budgeting that will take us to 15 trillion in deficit in 2035 from 2006 to 2035 15 trillion in deficit this bar here the second bar social security 2006 to 2080 twice as long more than twice as long the social security deficit is 2 trillion it is clear that there would be plenty of money to deal with the social security trust fund if the president were not using the social security trust fund as a slush fund to give tax cuts to the wealthiest people in america instead of doing that we have a moral and legal obligation to pay back to the trust fund the money the president has taken out we cannot let the president do this by running enormous deficits the republicans want to force the government to break its promises to the elderly how on earth are they going to pay the social security trust fund back if they have gone broke on the other side by running up these deficits in the general fund democrats will keep americas promises to our seniors democrats have done it before and we will do it again when bill clinton was president we had 3 years of surpluses and with the surpluses imagine think of it zero deficits 427 billion in deficit for this year over 100 billion in deficit for the month of february alone this year and when president clinton was president the 3 years at the end of his term we had zero deficits and with the surpluses that were produced he was able to pay nearly 400 billion off of our indebtedness strengthening the solvency of social security likewise the democratic alternative that wag offered today included payasyougo rules that would block new tax or spending legislation that is not paid for not only is the republican budget fiscally reckless and dishonest it is morally irresponsible the

where these policies are taking this country since 2001 the federal government has posted record budget deficits year after year during the 1990s democrats and republicans worked together with the clinton administration to cut the red ink and balance the budget for the first time in many years we balanced the budget in 1998 wekept it balanced in 1999 2000 and 2001 indeed we ran budget surpluses during those years and for the first time in a generation actually began to pay down the national debt since the bush administration took office in 2001 weve swung from balanced budgets to massive annual budget deficits in 2002the year after the congress adopted the administrations tax policiesthe federal government posted a 128 billion deficit in 2003 the deficit rose to 378 billion in 2004 the deficit soared to an alltime high of 412 billion in 2005 the deficit was 318 billion as bad as these deficits are they do not tell the whole story since these figures do not include the money the federal government borrows from social security and medicare trust funds each year in 2005 alone the federal government borrowed nearly 175 billion from the trust funds and were on course to borrow even more this year we cannot continue on the course were on it is wrong for this congress and this president tokeep borrowing half a trillion dollars each and every year and then pass this debt along to our children it is wrong for congress and the president to keep borrowing more and more from foreigners to fund tax cuts for the very wealthy china alone owns more than 818 billion of our debt the majoritys budget simply digs the deficit hole deeper the republican budget proposes a 348 billion deficit for 2007 if you add in the borrowing from social security and medicaremoney that by law must be repaidthe total deficit for 2007 soars to 543 billion the hard truth is that under the majoritys budget the federal budget never comes into balance the tide of red ink rises forever this policy is unsustainable and morally indefensible tucked away in this budget is a provision to raise the governments borrowing limit another 653 billion this would be on top of the 3 trillion in debt limit increases already approved since president bush took office at the very least there should be a straight upordown vote on a debt limit of this magnitude but evidently the plan is to try to sneak this through the majoritys budget also contains irresponsible cuts in critical domestic programs in this regard the majority has mirrored the bush administrations budget which included deep cuts in education critical medical research environmental protection veterans health care to name only a few areas there has been an attempt tonight to place a fig leaf over some of these cuts with a vague

increase the national debt limit in addition the democratic budget alternative provides 150 billion for future tax cuts and requires that any further tax cuts meet the payasyougo rules lastly our budget alternative rejects yet another round of spending cuts to key domestic programs that have been cut repeatedly in recent years the choice before the house could not be more clear we can vote to continue the failed economic policies of the last 5 yearspolicies that have resulted in massive annual deficits or we can say 3 trillion of debt and borrowing over 5 years is enough and vote for the

nowhere how about doing what you were elected to do you dont need a line item veto this isnt about statutes this isnt about vetoes this is about what the congress is to do you walked in here fresh newly elected and you got handed 5 trillion and now you cant stop yourself you cant stop yourself you can stop yourself from giving the people an increase in the minimum wage that hasnt increased

the minimum wage to 7 25 per hour over the next two years doing so would directly benefit 6 6 million american workers the vast majority of those workers are adults hundreds of thousands of them are parents with children under the age of 18 we have all heard the wellworn economic arguments against raising the minimum wage and we all know they simply arent true the truth is that raising the minimum wage wont hurt the economy and can even help it but forget about economics thats not what this issue is about this issue is about doing whats right and it is just wrong that in the wealthiest and most advanced country in the history of the world millions of adults work fulltime all year and yet still earn an income that leaves them deep in poverty it is just wrong for the republican

years the leaders of this house are going to push tax breaks for the wealthiest people in this country you know starting in 2009 only the largest and wealthiest 7 500 estates nationwide will pay the estate tax the republican plan to gut the tax on these 7 500 estates will add three quarters of a trillion dollars to the federal budget deficit over the next decade thats trillion with a t lee raymond the former ceo of exxon mobil stands to save as much as 160 million if this estate tax repeal goes through this is the same lee raymond who left his job with a 400 million retirement package

congressional record page h664 27 rep george miller november 3 1999 now the republicans tell us that we cannot afford a prescription drug benefit for our seniors that we cannot afford a patients bill of rights to protect our families against managed care and hmos that deny them care that we cannot afforil a minimum wage for our lowincome workers in this nation and that we cannot extend the fiscal security of social security by even ope day no the republicans still want to try to pass tax breaks for the wealthiest individuals corporations and special interests in this country when in this session in the last remaining 8 or 10 days of this session when is it that republicans are going to start thinking about our elderly our children and the working families of this nation congressional

the systematic persistent and inexcusable exploitation of men and women in sweatshops in the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands a territory of the united states of america this legislation will increase the minimum wage in the cnmi in stages until it matches the federal level congressional record page e748 30 rep george miller september 5 1997 this is not a matter of conjecture this is a matter of record that hundreds of thousands of workers on a regular basis are denied their overtime pay that overtime pay is the difference of whether or not they can provide for their family or not provide for their family that minimum wage pays the difference of whether or not they need public assistance or they do not need public assistance whether they can provide child care or they cannot

cancer by the year typical of republicans approach to secancer claims the lives of more than rious problems in this country i am 570 000 americans each year thht is surprised that they didnt try and land on an aircraft carrier and declare that right over half a million but we have cancer was conquered i am offended yet to declare a fullscale war on can that the republican donothing concer the passage of this resolution tte rebin donothing today puts us on record as going on the resolution as its response to fighting right track cancer affects everyone it cancer is not a republican issue or a demo no cancer advocate in our country crat issue it is an issue for our entire should be appeased by this vote the country and it is an issue that faces resolution is empty rhetoric and not the world action and action is what is needed for in 1961 president kennedy estab cancer for aids for parkinsons dislished the lofty goal of putting a man ease and so many other diseases that on the moon in 10 years this historic impact our citizens and people around goal was achieved in just 8 years just the world as this goal was established and the sponsor of this resolution is ofachieved so can the goal of 2015 fering a few platitudes that agree withwe are very close to achieving the the laudable goal of eliminating sufgoal of ending cancer death and suf fering and death due to cancer by the fering but when you are in a race and year 2015 i dont know anybody that you see the finish line you dont jog would not subscribe to that maybe you sprint scientists at the national move it up to the year 2010 but i cant cancer institute and other private and think of a human being that would obpublic research facilities across the ject to that country and world are conducting vital but how does this resolution achieve research each and every day that will that goal does it increase the nih enable cancer sufferers to be cancer funding for cancer research no do the survivors republicans oppose that yes we must show our solidarity on these does it boost support for the departefforts by fully supporting the 2015 goal ment of defense breast cancer research and providing the federal resources program not one penny necessary that to achieve it over the does it extend the expiring tax credit last 5 years we have doubled the re for research and development of lifesearch dollars for cancer but yet that saving cancer treatments no that by is not enough i see no better legacy for the way is something that a few refuture generations than ending cancer publicans support but they cant seem suffering and cancer death to get it to the floor to get a vote and over 10 000 cancer survivors and ad they control this place if they cant vocates from across the cduntry are get it to the floor who can converging on the capitol this week for does it provide for stem cell research the american cancer societys cele as advocated by the scientific commubration on the hill these heroes will nity no they are pandering to a be visiting every one of our offices this bunch of religious radicals and avoidweek when you visit with them and i ing dealing with scientific research septenber 49 2006 that is needed to cure these diseases they put their head in the sand and pander to political contributions the sponsor of this resolution the gentleman from florida voted to cut money for the centers for disease control and early detection and prevention of cancer this resolution doesnt restore that 2 does it expand health coverage to the nearly 47 million americans who lack health insurance cant even find out if they have cancer and therefore fail to get the preventive care available to them no it does notadd insurance to one of the 47 million people without health insurance in this country who therefore do not get medical care it is the republican way of all talk and no action this resolution is an affrontto those who have traveled here from across our nation to advocate better cancer care not only does this resolution fail to do anything to help eliminate cancer but this congress is taking us in the wrong direction led by the republicans president bush and this congress have aggressively cut funding for nih this year adjusted for inflation they have cut 213 million over the last 4 years they have reduced the agencys purchasing power by more than 12 percent the cuts arent just to research since president bush and the republican leadership have taken office nearly 7 million people have lost their health insurance and we all know that is the only way to get proper care the president used the only veto of his administration to keep in place restrictions on lifesaving stem cell research and the republican leadership in this congress didnt have the courage to override that i guess i could go on but i think i have made my point i wholeheartedly agree we must do much more to eradicate cancer and other dreaded diseases but i like the american public want action not words that is why i suspect the american public will join with us in voting for a change in direction in this congress we need a new direction we need people who will put their money where their mouth is and will vote to take action that is so close within our grasp to help these people and not just sit up and preen and say my goodness we think cancer is bad lets do something about it i urge cancer advocates across the country to recognize this resolution for what it is a pathetic attempt to play lip service to an issue that requires resources not rhetoric r 1445 you could replace the inheritance tax that will give you enough money to fund many of these programs instead of standing up sticking your thumb in the pie and saying what a good boy am i lets get busy lets change the

bouncing back to you to ive the wpeb itp a tiiive ont hutf i nomic run inthe last2 decades and it iso is a controlled giowth it is a growth that hag not gotten out of hanhd mr speaker it is a growth that grows frbm 3 to 4 7 percent quarter afi 6ei quarter with an inflation rate that is 2 percent or less and unemployment rates that are in the 5 percent and less range that is where we want not too hot and not too cold a nice steady accountable growth and i would point out this that growth that we have in our economy is growing in spite of the fact that 3 5 percent perhaps of our gdp is going off the top to the litigation that goes on in this country we have to overcome that and still grow at a rate of about 3 to 3 5 percent to match a targeted growth rate that will deal with population growth and to deal with inflation and help us develop our infrastructure in this country to accommodate the future as our infrastructure depreciates that is what it is going to take to grow and what it is going to take to balance the budget should we have the will to do that would be to go into the nondefense discretionary spending recognizing that we have three large entitlements in our budget and those are the spending that just goes on year after year that is growing at a rate of about 6 2 percent a year and that is aggregate and that is social security medicare and medicaid those three entitlements are essentially unless we change some of the larameters are the right now the un touchable budget items and eventually this congress will have to look at them but those three entitlements will grow at about 6 2 percent of their aggregate the interest rate will grow perhaps even faster than that in the outyears you add all those things up and if you recognize that to make changes in that for this year is very difficult to do and also recognizing that we have defense spending that is critical to our national security and we need to take that off the table from a cut perspective and what is left is the nondefense discretionary spending that is the items of all everything else that we spend that i have not identified as being an entitlement of social security medicare medicaid defense spending that nondefense discretionary spending we will call that other to balance the budget we would need to simply cut the nondefense discretionary spending by 5 percent areal 5 percent cut and that would be 0 95 on the dollar that would be asking americans to get along with 0 95 out of every dollar that they have right now today not grow in relation to inflation and not grow with any kind of a cola now if i were looking at this from a business perspective i would advocate that we just simply balance our budget in that fashion but i am also aware that the votes on the floor of this congress will rot accommodate for that so i will be seeking to put together a budget that looks at some of the other components and gets us to the point where we can reasonably practically and in fact part of the equation here is politically balance this budget it cannot and should not be done by simply raising taxes by doing so it would stifle growth and it would get a reverse effect beyond in the opposite direction that my colleagues who just got finished speaking would say i am just going to go backwards through some of the remarks that i heard made over this past hour and address some of them i certainly cannot address them all but the argument that all of the money that was spent all this is a quote all that money is wasted meaning the money that was spent for reconstruction in iraq all wasted with no oversight no oversight mr speaker i take exception to a statement such as that i went over to iraq with three of my colleagues last august and returned here about august 20 with the very mission in mind to take a look at where the 18 5 billion that we allocated out of this congress had been spent where the practices were where the projects were how the money was being spent and what was the return on that investment and i brought a chart along with me coincidentally not knowing that would be the subject matter that was brought up here on the other side of the aisle this evening a chart that illustrates where these project dollars have gone i would point out that these red dots on this map of iraq represent 2 200 more than 2 200 completed projects in iraq and these projects will be road projects they will be sewer projects water drinking water potable water projects they will also be some bridge projects and some pipeline work for the oil pipe lines that are there you will see along on this border with iran the red dots along there many of those are border defense stations and what you will not see are the 250 planned border defense stations that are under construction or in planning around these othei borders that we have there is another 1 100 projects that are either in planning or under construction that do not show up yet on this chart i will have a chart that reflects the projects that are planned the projects that are started then this one reflects just the projects that are completed over 2 200 and i visited a number of these of course it would not be possible to visit them in their entirety but i stopped up here in this region around kirkuk and there went to the mother of all generators i forget just how many kilowatts that generator does put out but i remember what it weighed 750 000 pounds brought in on two large loads and then the other loads would be the rest of the generating plant across about 10 7 kilometers excuse me it was more than that it was a long stretch at least across the northern part of iraq with that kind of a long trail ofa convoy to deliver the generator and the turbine that drives that generator down to this location just south of kirkuk and that being one of two huge generation plants that are now in a position where they are up and running in iraq this one is fed by a natural gas pipeline some of them are using different types of fuel but up in this area around kirkuk there is so much oil that it actually seeps to the top of the ground in some places where i come from the area we call it the prairie pothole region where we have these potholes of water that are collected because of the dips that are cut out in the prairie from the last glacier well the water that collects there reminds me of the oil and certainly the oil is in smaller quantities that collects in the depressiois within the desert up there around kirkuk i and that is not the largest oil location up around kirkuk but down here in the southern part in the basra region there is far more oil and i look at the system of collection the well system the collection system the refinery system distribution system all of it is old tired dilapidated has not been reconstructed or modernized in at least 35 years and yet the oil production out of iraq is greater than it was we keep hearing no they are not producing as much oil now as they were then not true the royalties that iraq was receiving prior to the war were 5 billion a year the royaltiesthat are coming from the oil that is pumping today are 26 billion a year that does not necessarily reflect that they are pumping five times as much oil but it reflects that they are selling perhaps more oil than they did then and pumping more oil than they did the electricity that is being generated in iraq is anumber that is close to twice as much electricity at their peak days as it was on a standard day in iraq at the beginning of the liberation back in march of 2003 and as i measure project after project benefit after benefit it cannot be said that and i will quote again all that money is wasted how could all that money be wasted when we have 2 200 completed projects 3 300 projects altogether people that have potable water that never had it before people that have flush toilets that did not flush before they did not have water to flush in them looking at the infrastructure that is there in places in baghdad where they had the sanitary sewer and i would point out for the lay person listening that a sanitary sewer is not really all that sanitary that is what you run your sewage through and yet that sewer was an easy place for some people to pull a waterline through in those days before the ltberation of baghdad so their drinking water in many areas was delivered through a black piece of plastic pipe that was pulled through the sewer itself and they would pull it through and then the distribution runs out to the locations where it was being used and that is all fine as long as you keep your waterline in condition and it does not ever get a leak in it and you do not ever let the pressure go down but both of those things invariably happen and when that happens the pressure goes down in your drinking waterline and the sewage then is drawn into that drinking waterline and it then pollutes the drinking water that has happened in a number of areas in baghdad we are reconstructing that we are providing them with clean new sanitary sewer systems and sewer plants to be able to handle their systems in a modern fashion and an environmentally friendly fashion so the iraqi people that were living without services now have services i will say that the electrical service that was up to 10 11 perhaps even 12 hours a day in baghdad at the beginning of the liberation is down to less than that now perhaps even as low as 4 to 6 hours a day but the rest of iraq was getting 2 to 4 hours a day and now they are up to 10 11 12 hours of electricity a day the next wave is to increase the generation capacity and the distribution so that baghdad can get back up again to a level that they were before but overall there is more electricity being provided into iraq today than there ever was the demand is perhaps twice as great as it was because you know what happens when people get electricity they figure out a way that they can put another appliance to work and plug it into a wall and use it like air conditioners that did not exist in any significant numbers now they are there in significant numbers tapped into that electricity we also know that satellite televisions were against the law in march of 2003 and today iraq is replete with satellite dishes onrooftop after rooftop in fact i did a survey from the air by helicopter over the top of a region up in kirkuk where many homes were built in about the same style and i had done so over the rooftops of mosul in the fall of 2003 and there my survey showed that about twothirds of the homes then already had satellite tvs and now iam seeing that in some of the neighborhoods in kirkuk there actually are more satellite dishes than there are roofs so you will see sometimes two or even three satellite dishes on a single roof that look like they are singlefamily dwellings from the air everyone in iraq has access to satellite tv which means access to the outside world there is access to internet cell phones those things have grown dramatically landline telephones have grown dramatically the number of newspapers are up to over 175 newspapers in iraq television stations up and running communication is flowing free enterprise is robust in the streets of baghdad people that are running shops out there making furniture out alongside the streets set it out on the side of the street and sell it and yes a bomb goes off once in a while and it is sad and it is tragic but the people of iraq clean things up and they grieve and they go back to work because they are optimistic about the future of iraq they are more optimistic about the future of iraq than the surveys show people are in the united states of america what went wrong her6 where people that we say do not have hope have more hope than those of us folks that have the great blessing of living in the united states of america with all of this hope that we take for granted and cannot apparently appreciate so the effort that has been put forth there it is not all that money that is being wasted not by a long shot mr speaker 3 300 projects all of them worthy and worthwhile and no they were not all cheap there was money that was spent for security and there were some projects that were sabotaged that had to be reconstructed again there is a project over here on the tigris river south of kirkuk where there were nine pipelines that went across the tigris river and those pipelines were cut in the liberation operations with the unitedstates air force and we went back to patch those pipelines together did so they were sabotaged again they were put across the river on a bridge and so we undertook the effort to put them all underneath the bottom of the tigris river they are backfilling that now and it is nearly completed and those lines will be opened up and running by i believe the target date is february 28 so another big day to turn those valves on and get that oil flowing south into parts where it can be converted back to cash and be able to help the funding in the great country of iraq this emerging free arab country that has now at least brought forth the name of a prime minister and i do not think formally has elected him yet but on that day that that happens and they seek this duly elected parliament iraq becomes the most representative arab nation in the world when they sit down at the united nations and their representative speaks on behalf of the iraqi people it will truly be a voice of the iraqi people quite unlike the voice of much of the rest of the arab world where the voicethat speaks for the countries that represent those parts of the arab world in the united nations often is the voice of a tyrant that would cut the tongues out of its oin citizens if they spoke up in criticism of the regime that is there in many of those countries but this country can become the lodestar of a free arab people an inspiration to the rest of the arab world an that is a chilling concept but it also inspiration that can cause the rest of should tell us that there is no negothem to see what iraq is stepping into tiated settlement we must defend ourwhat they are earning along with the selves the israelis have had to guard coalition forces efforts and sacrifice to every theater every bus stop every be able to be that inspiration for the hospital every school every synarest of the arab world and if that day gogue and still the infiltrators come in comes and i pray it comes mr speak and detonate their bombs and blow er we may well see freedom echo their women and children to pieces across the arab world in the same fash that happens out of a deep hatred ion that it echoed across eastern eu that we dont understand in this counrope when the wall went down in ber try and i dont claim to understand it lin november 9 1989 on that glorious but i know that hatred is directed at day that symbolized the end of the us we saw it september 11 we saw it cold war a victory for the united on 18 to 20 other attacks including the states and the forces of freedom uss cole we saw it in the unitedstates emand the forces of freedom could not bassy bombings in africa we have seen be stopped almost the first attack also on the twin towbloodlessly they echoed across eastern ers in other efforts shut off by good ineurope and we saw country after coun telligence work in this country try be liberated we cannot rest our choices though are guard every theater every bus 0 2320 stop every school every hospital since that time we have noticed every church every synagogue and pull that those who knew freeddm the least back into the shores of the united hungered for it the most the people on states and somehow think that we can the east side of the wall stepped up to protect every center in this country help all of our efforts our coalition and we wont be able to and we will see forces in iraq in greater numbers than the attacks come and we will see our the people on the west side of the wall women and children and our men blown the people on the west side of the into pieces wall had the privilege of living with or we can take this battle to them freedom since the end of world war 11 we can fight this war where they are the people on the east side of the wall but going out just to kill the enemy remember the days they werent free mr speaker isnt enough it is not a they remember the day of november 9 solution it is something that has to be 1989 when they had that opportunity done in certain areas of the world and to grasp their own freedom and within under those circumstances where there a couple of years that freedom did echo are training camps and active leaders across eastern europe and it needs to that are plotting and planning to atecho across the arab world tack and kill americans that must be so i submit that there done is a vision and mission in this overall but to go out and think that we war on terror and we need to do a far could kill all of our enemies is the better job of articulating why we are in equivalent of realizing that we had a this war i would point out that the lot of flies on our porch and in our loss of americans on september 11 was kitchen and then go out to the barn right at 3 000 americans that is more with the fly swatter and think we are americans lost there than was lost de going to take care of all those flies in cember 7 1941 in that day that would the barn with the fly swatter no you live in infamy can swat flies in the barn all day every we cannot forget september 11 we day and you will never accomplish the cannot forget that we were attacked task you have got to change the habiwithout cause we didnt provoke any tat that breeds that many flies you one who attacked us they attacked us have to clean the barn because they hate our way of life they and you need to leave an environment attacked the very center of western in there that doesnt breed those flies civilization and then they will leave you alone on and no amount of negotiation un the porch and in your kitchen as well derstanding no amount of sitting so i submit that the plan of the around and talking is ever going to re united states and the mission that has solve this disagreement these people been laid out by our commanderinwant us dead they have demonstrated chief president bush is to create a new that and we saw the celebrations in habitat to promote a new habitat in the streets in other parts of the world the region this is a habitat called as the twin towers fell that should freedom we happen to know that tell us that they will give us no quar where there is freedom there isnt a ter habitat that breeds terrorists we have if anyone doubts that take a look at never gone to war against another free israel take a look and see the cir people it has never happened in the cumstanoes there when the israelis history of this country and i dont thought they could trade land for think it has actually happened in the peace and yet they are still attacked history of the world hamas won the election there that so to the extent that freedom can be means the terrorists the people who promoted and we give people that opare sworn to annihilate the land of portunity to reach out and grasp and israel are running the government of earn their own freedom is also the exthe region that may or may not be a tent to which we can be safer as a peonation called palestine ple western civilization can be safer and the people in that part of the world can learn some tolerance for christianity for judaism for capitalism for free enterprise for this whole idea of western civilization that they seem to take such exception to there are good people in that part of the world and those good people need to be empowered and we need to be supportive bf them the allegations that were made here on the other side of the aisle about corruption in iraq with millions of unitedstates dollars we dont know that and i wont tell you that you can go into an environment with a 18 5 billion mission and spend every dollar that would be competitive with a project in the united states because i know that some of that money had to go for security and some of that money had to go for a high price to get the work done because who would go into that environment and do that work but that work was necessary and to the extent that anyone hag defrauded this government yes we need to search that out we need to have oversight but democrats in this congress are not absolved from that responsibility i did not hear a single solution come out here on the other side of the aisle not one all i saw was complaints lamentations objections because all things that go wrong are all republican responsibility according to the other side of the aisle and of course if they were just in power then everything would be all fine but we dont know what they would do because they havent proposed a solution not a single specific solution they are absolutely without an agenda but they have enough energy they have enough air velocity in their lungs to every night come down here and beat up on the people that are out here trying to move america ahead one statement was said that i will agree with made by the gentleman from florida he said i am so glad that i am not a member of the majority well to the gentleman from florida i want to say i am so glad you are not a member of the majority as well and so are the majority of the american people who have seen to it that there is majority in charge in this congress we do have our work to do i wont shirk that responsibility i step up to it gladly but we need to have our eyes wide open we need to promote a responsible budget and i will be promoting a balanced budget and a path we can get to a balanced budget in a way that we can get the votes in this congress to get it done if we do that we can ensure financial security for our children and our grandchildren but that financial security that can come with fiscal responsibility here in this congress and a solid progrowth tax policy isnt security if we have to be continually under attack from an enemy that the other side of the aisle would not have the will to challenge"], [0.9628680944442749, 0.9628680944442749, 0, "with great regret but with even greater conviction i rise in opposition to this bill while this bill certainly has some worthy provisions including those reported out by our committee overall this bill is a step backward this bill will not lessen our dependence on foreign oil and it will do nothing to reduce energy prices it will increase the deficit weaken our economy compromise our national security and endanger our environment the supporters of this bill are certainly right about one thing we desperately need a good national energy policy this measure does not pass that test our growing dependence on foreign oil puts us at the mercy of unstable and unfriendly foreign regimes it gives terrorists additional targets and puts money in their hands it weakens the dollar by worsening the balance of trade we would start every day 500 millionplus in the hole on our balance of trade because of the imported oil it pumps money out of the domestic economy and into the hands of those who would wish us ill in short our oil dependence represents a significant and growing threat to our national security and national security should be first and foremost in the minds and hearts of everyone in this chamber so what do we do to reduce our dependence on foreign oil yes we need to increase the supply of fossil and nuclear and renewable energy but most importantly we need to become more energy efficient and does this bill do to make us more energy efficient virtually nothing the federal energy information administration found that last years energy bill would have almost no impact on energy demand and energy prices and that bill if anything made more of an effort to tame consumption the alliance for an energy efficient economy has estimated that this years energy bill would not save a single barrel of oil by 2020 that is both tragedy and farce we know how to treat our oil addiction we can make appliances more energy efficient without inconveniencing anyone we can make our cars more efficient without sacrificing safety my cafe amendment would reduce oil consumption in 2020 by 2 million barrels a day that is more than twice the amount that is expected per day from drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge what does this bill do instead of trying to make us more energy efficient at a time of fiscal crises and record oil prices the bill provides new mandatory spending that will go directly to the oil industry and it provides mandatory breaks for the oil industry on royalties the bill provides massive tax breaks for profitable oil companies and next to nothing for new technologies that could help wean us from foreign oil here is what the president said last week on that issue with 55 oil we dont need incentives to oil and gas companies to explore the presidents budget devoted 72 percent of its proposed energy tax incentives to alternatives this bill provides just 6 percent to alternatives while providing more than a billion dollars in additional tax breaks we would not have to look far to

preparedness as a member of the select katrina committee and as chairman of the subcommittee overseeing fema i know that it is absolutely critical to prepare our nation for natural disasters terrorist attacks or any other catastrophe and the spread of disease that could come with it when disasters strike the most effective method of prevention depends in part on effective respiratory protection for millions who may be exposed this protection is available through careful use of respirators the masks mostly disposable that we see in pictures of first responders emergency personnel and health care workers who are treating the sick the world health organization for example specifies certain respirators for use in avian flu treatments the united states has a number of companies that manufacture respirators that are in a number of states around this country one mine safety appliances is headquartered in pennsylvania and manufactures respirators in the state these are high quality products recognized by industry health care authorities and other experts as efficient cost effective more importantly these products are 100 percent regulated by an agency of the unitedstates government the national institute for occupational safety and health or niosh which is part of the centers for disease control in the department of health and human services niosi prescribes design standards for respirators tests respirators in its own labs by its own professionals and monitors respirator manufacturers to ensure their products consistently meet the standards for which they are approved it also approves the warning labels that go on respirators to indicate what uses are and are not appropriate to emphasize the need for users to be sure that these respirators fit well it regulates the respirator manufacturers but the occupational safety and health administration or osha regulates employers and prescribes what level of approved respirators should be used to protect against a particular workplace hazard respirator manufacturers do not interact with respirator users they make their products according to government standards for their uses approved by niosh and described on the label but employers make the decision about whetlher t6 provide a respirator and which one to provide based on osha rules unfortunately in our litigationobsessed society that separation of responsibility has not protected our respirator manufacturers from being sued in literally thousands of cases workers allege that a respirator was defectively designed or contained an inadequate warning label and they got sick and that somehow it is partly the fault of the manufacturer as absurd as this may sound it is the premise for up to 30 000 individual claims brought against each major respirator manufacturer in the united states there has been much controversy over many of these claims since they involve workers who claim to be sick with asbestosis or silicosis in one situation a federal judge in texas a former nurse found that thousands of claims were essentially without any legal or medical merit they were produced by collusion between plaintiffs lawyers doctors paid by the claim and the xray mills that produced the diagnosis that could not survive medical review this corrupts the legal system and hurts most those few who are truly ill it also threatens otherwise strong american industries like respirator manufacturing our american respirator manufacturers are faced with the cost of administering and processing tens of thousands of claims some of these will be thrown out and some will be settled for a few hundred dollars but each one requires thousands of dollars of research and process none of these cases has resulted in a trial and a judgment against a respirator manufacturer it is the administrative cost of millions of dollars each year that are now about to exceed the net income of many companies from making respirators in short we are in danger of losing a vital american industry that we are going to need desperately if disaster strikes whether the spread of a virus or biological terrorist attack we already need respirators for countless industrial applications and routine medical and other healthrelated needs respirators are already providing protection from the airborne hazards that are everywhere in the recovery efforts from hurricanes katrina and rita they also served thousands in the aftermath of september llth we cannot afford to have this vital industry torn down by inadequate claims with dollar signs at their hubs that is why i am pleased to be the author along with my original cosponsors the gentlewoman from pennsylvania and the gentleman from pennsylvania as well as the gentleman from texas of h r 2357 the respirator access assurance act of 2005 this is a very simple bill it says that if a manufacturer has the niosh approval for the design and labeling of a respirator a manufacturer cannot be sued on the basis of the detective design or failure to warn it would apply to any case that has not gone to trial as of the enactment and to future cases we need this legislation and i am working with my colleagues and the house leadership to find an appropriate opportunity to bring it to the house floor for a vote soon i hope my colleagues will share my concern over the need to ensure that this american industry continues to produce these vital products for emergency preparedness and will approve this and make it the law of the land"], [2.396106719970703e-05, 0.4999760389328003, 1, "while

repeat that the spokesman for osama bin laden said on their web site we have the right to kill 4 million americans 2 million of them children and to exile twice as many and wound and cripple hundreds

learned about a rezoning application in fairfax county for the development of a satellite city of 20 000 people on the most ecologically sensitive area of mason neck she decided to lead an effort to stop this development and to preserve mason neck habitat for the endangered american bald eagle during the ensuing weeks and months she organized a watchdog group called the conservation committee for mason neck she made films of the wildlife that thrived there to show other civic organizations around the region mrs hartwell even gave tours by boat along mason necks waterways and enlisted the support of several environmental organizations at the local regional state and federal levels the mason neck national wildlife refuge was established in 1969 for the protection of nesting feeding and
