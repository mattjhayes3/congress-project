potential and strengthens the longterm financial security of our families and our nation democrats believe in budgets that invest in our armed services to defend our homeland and to protect the men

save for retirement we understand the priorities of everyday americans the republican budgets of the last 5 years have failed to meet each of these objectives at a time when american families are facing stagnant wages and everincreasing bills for child care for health care for college tuition and for gas at the pump the republican congress has failed to address these daytoday concerns instead they have enacted tax cuts for the very wealthy my constituents want congress to address their needs not the wants and desires of a select few it is clear which side the majority has chosen instead of budgeting fairly the republicans have relied on smokeandmirror borrowandspend gimmicks they dont include the war in iraq and the military activities in afghanistan in their budget they dont include the massive costs of repealing the estate tax for estates valued at 10 million or more and they dont include the full cost of the medicare part d prescription drug benefit despite these efforts to keep costs hidden their budget schemes create new deficits every year and have added nearly 3 5 trillion to our national debt american families deserve better and they deserve a new direction instead of making smart investments in americas future the republican budgets have run up massive deficits each year and have added to our national debt so that as of now our national debt is nearly 8 5 trillion this means that we spend more on interest payments on our debt than the combined federal investments in education homeland security and veterans health care combined the nations debt is unsustainable and it is immoral american families deserve better they deserve a new direction the budget policies of the bush administration and this republican congress leave our nation less secure their schemes rely on borrowing more and more money from foreign investors more money mind you than the amount borrowed by all past american presidents combined and instead of enhancing our safety at home and bolstering our security abroad the republican congress continues to underfund important security initiatives at our ports chemical plants and along our borders this at the same time they are failing to enact many of the 9 11 commissions recommendations including enabling our police and firefighters to communicate seamlessly american families expect the government to make the necessary investments to keep them safe and they believe that the american dream should be available to everyone not a select few they deserve a new direction democrats understand that unless we change ourse

meet our obligations to american families democrats have a plan that fulfills the basic budgetary principles of living within our means and democrats have a plan to reduce wasteful spending and make

includes a fair andbalanced budget that represents all people in this country so i am pleased to take this time in this special order this evfting to talk about the cruel and shameful budget and the tax cuts the republican majority wants to ram through this house on wednesday or thursday of this week after hearing my republican colleagues in the first hour special order tonight i would hope that they are paying a great deal of attention to what is going on with this reconciliation budget otherwise there is not going to be any money for all of those good ideas they have for health care it was a pleasure to hear their good ideas now that we are going to talk about where the money will be and where the money is going in our budget and it is something we are going to be dealing with straight up wednesday or thursday of this week it is also time for the people of this country to know what is going on it is time to stop this railroad and help the american people learn just what the republicans are up to they keep acting as robin hood in reverse it comes out in the various committees and in bringing up this vote this week on the house floor a vote that will hurt hardworking americans because of a package of bills in the billions of dollars at least 50 billion that will include hurtful budget cuts but makeno mistake about it these budget priorities are outrageous they meaning the republicans want to provide 70 billion to 100 billion in new tax cuts for the powerful and the privileged in america who need them the least while cutting programs for the rest of the country and they are going to pay for these irresponsible tax cuts for the most well off by shredding the safety net for the most vulnerable in our society those who live under or near the poverty line and by breaking the social contract with hardworking middleclass americans as well and oh yes what the republicans do not wring out of the blood sweat and tears of working and impoverished americans through budget cuts will just be added to the debt of the next generation of americans can you believe it this is the first budget reconciliation package in the history of our country that actually increases federal deficits at least another 25 billion which will be added to the deficit this year without batting an eye while pretending to be the guardians of our treasury republicans in charge of this congress just keep borrowing and spending piling up debt that our grandchildren and their children will owe ten years ago the republicans took control of this house trumpeting their contract with america with great fanfare if you will all remember it but now one decade later it is plain for all of us to see that their slick marketing gambit has proven to be a contract on america particularly those struggling to face financial ends the numbers and the budget tradeoffs recommended in this budget package speak for themselves but let me cite a few examples for my colleagues to pay for a 70 billion to 100 billion tax cut and these are new tax cuts by the way the republicans in control of this house want to slash 844 million from the food stamp program which would result in 300 000 families being kicked off of this antihunger program it would leave 40 000 children ineligible for school lunches apparently the republicans do not realize the number of malnourished children and americans grew by more than 2 million in the past year the republicans want to cut 14 5 billion from student aid programs at precisely the time when paying for college education has become more difficult than in any generation in the past these shortsighted education cuts including the largest cut in the history of the student loan program are certain to increase the interest rates and the fees that many students will have to pay the republicans are going after single mothers they are cutting 500 million in federal support for child care assistance leaving an additional 250 000 children without quality child care adding insult to injury the republicans are cutting almost 5 billion from child support enforcement programs that help to collect money from deadbeat dads so much for compassionate conservatism when it comes time to give tax cuts to rich cronies of the republican majority the republicans are cutting 9 5 billion from medicaid the federal program that extends basic health care to the poorest and neediest of americans home heating bills are expected to be 30 to 50 percent higher this coming winter but that is not keeping the republicans in control of this house from voting against full funding of the low income home energy assistance program liheap and evidence is strong and persuasive that many of these programs while not perfect we know that have made progress towards goals shared by americans across the political spectrum such as preventing hunger destitution and homelessness protecting childrens health and rewarding lowpaid work when our constituents experience crises in their personal lives such as job loss or disabilities these programs can cushion them against deep poverty when people have low earnings or little or no health insurance these programs can supplement their incomes and provide essential health care coverage and when people reach retirement age these programs provide some measure of retirement and health security research and data from the center on budget and policy priorities and other experts around the country show that the united states system of income support benefits have helped make tens of millions of americans healthier and more secure without properly funded programs like food stamps medicaid state childrens health insurance programs unemployment insurance and the supplemental security program for the elderly and disabled poor ours will be a harsher and less compassionate society with more extreme hardship especially among children and people who are elderly and people who do have disabilities the happy warrior senator hubert humphrey used to remind us that the character of a society can best be judged by how it cares for those in the dawn and the twilight of life by this measure the republicans who are in charge of all branches of our government today and who are responsible for these budget and tax cuts are failing the american people woefully they are particularly failing our children and students and their education as i said earlier the republican reconciliation budget will pay for between 70 and 100 billion in new tax cuts for the rich by cutting very critical social programs this budget would break the backs of hardworking poor and middleclass families in order to break the bank to pay for tax cuts for wealthy families let us talk about how this budget actually affects family values let us talk about how we could use that 70 billion to 100 billion to keep some important promises to the average american family for instance the head start program offers lowincome families the promise that their young children will not start school at a disadvantage but we serve fewer than half of the eligible 3 and 4year olds nationwide yet instead of providing the 5 billion increase that it would take to ensure this opportunity for every eligible child this year president bush and the republican congress are cutting 70 to 100 billion in taxes at the very top level almost 4 years ago president bush and the republican congress passed the no child left behind act and joined in a bipartisan promise to american families that we would provide schools with resources they need to educate all of our children they said that they would use no child left behind to diagnose where dollars were needed to turn poorer performing schools and school districts around so that actually no child would be left behind since then the president and the republican congress have fallen more than 40 billion short of keeping that promise and so no child left behind has become punitive instead of helpful we could do better by our children if we spent that 40 billion on those children and did not cut taxes for the wealthiest people in this country in 1975 the federal government promised families that it would fully fund its share of idea the individuals with disabilities education act but 30 years later we are less than halfway there last year president bush and the republican congress made another bipartisan promise to increase funding for idea by 4 billion this year and to fully fund idea by the year 2011 it sounded good a lot of us voted for it and a lot of us did not but within a few months of signing the new law the president broke his promise by more than 3 5 billion no billion dollars so we could use 3 5 billion of the tax cuts for the wealthy to keep this bipartisan promise to fund idea as was promised or even better we could use 13 2 billion to fully fund idea up to the federal responsibility another federal student aid for college offers lowand middleincome families the promise of an education to prepare them for jobs in the 21st century 14 3 billion would enable us to offset the cuts that the republican reconciliation budget would make to federal student aid programs the largest cuts by the way in history these cuts would add 5 800 to the cost of the typical students college loans while students whose families can pay outright for the best colleges and do not need loans get another tax cut another 4 2 billion would enable us to keep another promise that president bush has not come close to keeping that would be to increase the annual pell grant for lowincome students to 5 100 or we could reduce the tax cuts for the wealthy by 7 billion to keep the bipartisan promise made in 1998 to increase the pell grant to 5 800 but at a time when the buying power of pell grants is only about half of what it was at its peak the president and the republican congress have virtually frozen pell grants since the year my colleagues how we choose to allocate federal resources is a reflection of our values our values as members of congress our values as leaders of our country and the choices we will make this year will be one of the most critical choices any of us will make during our time in congress we can pass the republican reconciliation budget which i believe makes a mockery of the term family values unless of course the only families you value are the nations wealthiest families or we can pass a budget that truly helps all of americas families i hope that we will make the right choice i hope that we will invest in our families and their children which by the way is an investment in our nations ability to compete in the international marketplace"], [7.045269012451172e-05,

and great fairness and great respect for all points of view i wish we would all join in acknowledging the great leadership of the gentleman from south carolina our ranking member on the committee on the budget in 1994 the first item in the republicans contract with america was the fiscal responsibility act republicans pledged to restore fiscal responsibility to an outofcontrol congress requiring them to live under the same budget constraints as families and businesses more than 10 years later an outoftouch republican majority has taken fiscal responsibility to a new low it is clear that in the 10 years the republicans have become addicted to deficits the budget deficit for this year is a record 427 billion the february budget deficit my colleagues of 114 billion for the month of february a deficit of 114 billion is the highest monthly deficit ever and the first time it ever went over 100 billion in one month in 2001 president clinton left president bush with a projected 5 6 trillion in surplus in just 4 years president bush has turned that record surplus into a record deficit of nearly 4 trillion a 10 trillion swing in the wrong direction make no mistake these deficits are the direct result of republican policies huge tax cuts for the wealthy a refusal to pay as you go poor planning for a war of choice in iraq the list goes on and on and on america is awash in red ink because of republican budget irresponsibility tragically this republican budget is yet another missed opportunity to return to fiscal discipline not only is this budget fiscally irresponsible the republican budget is dishonest it does not cut the deficit in half as republicans claim in fact it makes the deficit worse republicans leave out the realistic cost of the war the cost of expiring tax provisions the true cost of fixing the alternative minimum tax and the cost of any changes to social security the budget is dishonest in another way it fails to show any def7 icit figures at all after 2010 in our new partnership for americas future democrats have made a commitment to honor the value of accountability including eliminating deficit spending and holding those in power accountable for their actions with a high 6thical standard democrats support honest accountable budgets that pay as you go the democratic alternative offered by the gentleman from south carolina achieves balance by 2012 the republican budget never reaches balance it heaps tons of debt onto our children and grandchildren and it will eventually lower our standard of living we cannot let that happen to our country and on top of all of that the republican budget undermines the solvency of social security while republicans ignore the real crisis of ballooning budget deficits the president falsely claims there is a crisis in social security but just because the president says it does not make it so he is simply wrong according to the nonpartisan congressional budget office social securitys trust fund will grow every year until a high of 8 3 trillion in 2032 and continues to be solvent until 2052 i want to call your attention to this chart my colleagues the left bar represents the deficit in the general fund between now and 2035 a staggering 15 trillion the bush administration has taken us onto atrajectory of reckless budgeting that will take us to 15 trillion in deficit in 2035 from 2006 to 2035 15 trillion in deficit this bar here the second bar social security 2006 to 2080 twice as long more than twice as long the social security deficit is 2 trillion it is clear that there would be plenty of money to deal with the social security trust fund if the president were not using the social security trust fund as a slush fund to give tax cuts to the wealthiest people in america instead of doing that we have a moral and legal obligation to pay back to the trust fund the money the president has taken out we cannot let the president do this by running enormous deficits the republicans want to force the government to break its promises to the elderly how on earth are they going to pay the social security trust fund back if they have gone broke on the other side by running up these deficits in the general fund democrats will keep americas promises to our seniors democrats have done it before and we will do it again when bill clinton was president we had 3 years of surpluses and with the surpluses imagine think of it zero deficits 427 billion in deficit for this year over 100 billion in deficit for the month of february alone this year and when president clinton was president the 3 years at the end of his term we had zero deficits and with the surpluses that were produced he was able to pay nearly 400 billion off of our indebtedness strengthening the solvency of social security likewise the democratic alternative that wag offered today included payasyougo rules that would block new tax or spending legislation that is not paid for not only is the republican budget fiscally reckless and dishonest it is morally irresponsible the leaders of five protestant denominations the episcopal church usa the evangelical lutheran church in america the presbyterian church usa the

there is something fundamentally wrong with the budgetary policies the republican leadership has pursued for the last 5 years it is time for a little honesty about where these policies are taking this country since 2001 the federal government has posted record budget deficits year after year during the 1990s democrats and republicans worked together with the clinton administration to cut the red ink and balance the budget for the first time in many years we balanced the budget in 1998 wekept it balanced in 1999 2000 and 2001 indeed we ran budget surpluses during those years and for the first time in a generation actually began to pay down the national debt since the bush administration took office in 2001 weve swung from balanced budgets to massive annual budget deficits in 2002the year after the congress adopted the administrations tax policiesthe federal government posted a 128 billion deficit in 2003 the deficit rose to 378 billion in 2004 the deficit soared to an alltime high of 412 billion in 2005 the deficit was 318 billion as bad as these deficits are they do not tell the whole story since these figures do not include the money the federal government borrows from social security and medicare trust funds each year in 2005 alone the federal government borrowed nearly 175 billion from the trust funds and were on course to borrow even more this year we cannot continue on the course were on it is wrong for this congress and this president tokeep borrowing half a trillion dollars each and every year and then pass this debt along to our children it is wrong for congress and the president to keep borrowing more and more from foreigners to fund tax cuts for the very wealthy china alone owns more than 818 billion of our debt the majoritys budget simply digs the deficit hole deeper the republican budget proposes a 348 billion deficit for 2007 if you add in the borrowing from social security and medicaremoney that by law must be repaidthe total deficit for 2007 soars to 543 billion the hard truth is that under the majoritys budget the federal budget never comes into balance the tide of red ink rises forever this policy is unsustainable and morally indefensible tucked away in this budget is a provision to raise the governments borrowing limit another 653 billion this would be on top of the 3 trillion in debt limit increases already approved since president bush took office at the very least there should be a straight upordown vote on a debt limit of this magnitude but evidently the plan is to try to sneak this through the majoritys budget also contains irresponsible cuts in critical domestic programs in this regard the majority has mirrored the bush administrations budget which included deep cuts in education critical medical research environmental protection veterans health care to name only a few areas there has been an attempt tonight to place a fig leaf over some of these cuts with a vague half promise of perhaps adding an additional 7 1

back the payasyougo budgeting rules and we force a degree of accountability by requiring the house to take a separate upordown vote on measures to increase the national debt limit in addition the democratic budget alternative provides 150 billion for future tax cuts and requires that any further tax cuts meet the payasyougo rules lastly our budget alternative rejects yet another round of spending cuts to key domestic programs that have been cut repeatedly in recent years the choice before the house could not be more clear we can vote to continue the failed economic policies of the

once again as you know the 30something working group we come to the floor as often as possible to not only share with the members what is going on as it relates to legislatioii here in washington d c but also what is not going on on behalf of the american people and hopefully we can put forth ideas and extending the arm to work in a bipartisan way on behalf of the american people so we are glad to come to the floor week after week also i would like to thank the democratic leader for allowing us to have this hour and also our democratic whip mr steny hoyer and mr james clyburn who is our chairman of our democratic caucus and mr larson who is our vicechair i think it is important that we come to the floor to share a unified message from this side that we are willing and able we have the will and the desire to work on behalf of the american people in general not just democrats not just republicans or independents but the american people in general to make sure the people of good will prevail in their everyday lives if they are a veteran if they are an individual that has fallen on hard times if they run a small business in this country if they have a midsized business that they want to turn into a big business we want to be able to be of some assistance as it relates to legislating here on behalf of the american people also i think it is iriiportant that we do not leave our children behind even though they cannot vote many of them are under the age of 18 years old not eligible to vote i think it is important that we stand for them there are a number of things that i am going to try to touch on today to make sure that we can cover all of just about all of what is happening and what is not happening here in washington d c i took the time when we were on break last week to really look closely at some of the comparisons because when you are trying to figure out what is happening to the issues that we all came to washington to work so hard on you have to compare it is almost like you have to have a sidebyside what we call it here in washington d c to compare it is almost like for someone who goes to the grocery store to buy an orange i am from florida nine times out of ten you are going to pick up those two oranges if they are from two different orange groves and kind of compare to see if it is an orange you are not going to grab an apple and grab an orange and start saying well which one looks like an orange but i must say here in washington d c it is almost like an orange and an apple experience because we are so far apart as it relates to working together on many of these issues that are facing our constituents back home and the american men and women that are overseas fighting on our behalf i looked at the issue of fiscal responsibility and i could not help but notice within the house gop budget that the budget calls for deficits as far as the eye can see never achieving a balance and adding another 2 3 trillion to the national debt over 5 years compared to the democratic alternative and the democratic philosophy if we can work in a bipartisan way to be able to balance this budget balance the budget over the next 5 years making sure that we can balance it over the next 6 years on a payasyougo philosophy e 1630 i will talk a little bit about that as i continue to go down this chart we believe that we can balance this budget because we have done it before unlike the republican conference or the republican side of the house which has not there was a surplus when the republicans took control of this house or when the president went into office and president bush went into office now we are into record deficits and i think it is important that we point this out and i have charts to be able to break that down for the members i think it is also important to think about making america safer here at home i looked at the republican budget and i could not help but notice that it made homeland security guts by 488 million this year and it is up to 6 1 billion over the next 5 years of cuts to homeland security and it is not much better than the presidents budget that came out of this house it estimated that port security grants and rail transit security grants will all be rolled into a smaller program and i think that that is something that is going to hurt a lot of local communities on the democratic side in our budget and our motion to recommit of our philosophy as it relates to what we should be doing by the homeland is to provide 6 5 billion more over the next 5 years for homeland security here by guaranteeing funding for border security port security and first responders which are so important to so many counties and local governments that are out there on the frontline that have to respond to the american people in their time of need adequate funding for veterans this is another point i will elaborate a little bit more during this hour of the facts like we always say during the 30something working group this is not what we came up with these are the facts and they are backed up by the congressional record or either a very credible thirdparty validator we start looking at that and we look at the republican budget that passed off this floor it cuts funding to veterans health care by 6 billion over the next 5 years the democratic alternative budget provides 8 6 billion more over the next 5 years for veterans health care then there is the gop budget it also rejects an increase in tricare which is a health care program for veterans for more than 3 million military retirees and their families these are increased costs that the republican budget has put on them and i am going to talk about that a little further it targets as it relates to tax cuts for the middle class the republican budget follows the presidents budget that goes back to the rubberstamp congress the rubberstamp republican congress that i talked so much about and it also happens to be a reality when you look at this issue you have to look at it from the standpoint of the presidents budget which provides 2 5 trillion in tax cuts over the next 10 years targeted for the very wealthiest americans the wealthiest taxpayers versus the democratic alternative that provides 105 billion for the middle class tax relief such as child tax credit marriage penalty relief and the 10 percent individual bracket i think it is also important for me to point out here as it relates to the issue of college making college more affordable and i had to look at this part of the budget and this is another area that i am going to talk a little bit more about because we have so many people and some middleaged people in america we do know that we have some americans that do not go from high school straight into college because they have to nine times out of ten get a job to be able to build up the money to go to college to be able to maybe take care of a family member that is up in age and they need that kind of assistance or they cannot go off to college or they have to go to a community college before they can go to a 4year institution everyone does not have a turnkey life so we have to look at policy that is going to be able to help all americans not just some when we look at the republican majority budget what it had in it this is straight from the budget this is not anything that i have put together to have some sort of lean towards making our proposals look better than the republican majority these are just the facts here in the house when you look at it it is identical once again and i think it is important the reason why i have this rubber stamp back here that i will proudly bring out in just a few moments is the fact that the president hands down what he would like to the policies that he would like to have here in this congress he would like for us to rubberstamp and the republican majority honors him in rubberstamping exactly the way it was written i think it is important in america in the peoples house the only housethat you have to be elected to that you cannot be appointed to over in the senate you can be appointed by a governor that the people should have an opportunity to be heard once again not just democrats not just republicans not just independents not just folks who vote but the american people should be represented and for them to be represented appropriately i think it is important that we have the kind of conversation and dialogue here that is going to benefit all americans and in this case it is identical to the presidents budget it freezes pell grants for colleges and denies more than 460 000 students lowcost loans this also is on the top of 12 billion cuts in the student loan funding that republicafis just enacted it is already there so what we are trying to do is i believe to turn that around and i am going to talk about legislation that we have to turn that around but as it relates to our alternative budget it rejects the gop cuts and higher education programs it also lowers the costs of student loans by cutting the interest rate per student loan in the fall of 2007 i think that is important there are a lot of folks that are sending their kids off to college right now there are a lot of folks that are writing letters for just 1 000 scholarships for local organizations because the costs of college have gone up when we mkke these cuts here in washington dc the state government has to make their cuts to the students and to the families that live down in those states and i think it is important that we look at this and i will talk about that a little further explaining educational opportunities i think it is important when you look at this part of the budget identical to the bush budget well that seems to be a common theme here which underfunds no child left behind by 39 percent denies extra math and reading help to 3 7 million children and shutting 2 million children out of afterschool programs on the democratic side our alternative provides 4 6 billion more dollars in 2007 and 35 3 billion over the next 5 years for education and training programs more than the gop budget i think this is important for families and parents like myself who know what it means that when your kids go to school you have to pay for aftercare and nine times out of ten that aftercare is like 150 to sometimes 200 a week some of you parents know what i am talking about unfortunately members of the republican side of this house do not understand what you are talking about and opt to invest 87 000 in tax cuts to millionaires so i think it is important that we look at this as it relates to a comparison one other thing that i think is important and justified here in this case that we roll right into what this means as it relates to the dollars and cents before we get into some of the policy issues that are called out here we can get right down to the nittygritty by saying over the last 5 years president bush and also the republican majority here came in and had a projected surplus in the next 10 years when the president took office of 5 6 trillion 5 6 trillion and that has now turned into a 3 3 trillion deficit now it would be kind of hard to say well the democrats took us down that line and they made us do this and they made us do that i can tell you that is not true that is not true we have tried to substitute a number of policies that would save this country in the future and would save our future for our children so they are not paying exorbitant tax and fees that this republican congress has put on them and have put on the american people it affects everything it affects social security it affects education it affects our way of being able to come up with alternative fuels it affects the way our troops are treated when they come back it affects our veterans it affects everyday families the decisions that are made here on this floor as it relates to the budget and as it relates to the spending affects everyone all americans it affects everyone that depends on this government to govern not to follow not to rubberstamp but to govern and i think that is very very important when you look at the tax bill that obviously the president wanted and the republican majority rubberstamped i think it is important that you look at the fact that we have now mortgaged our childrens future the republicans have passed this tax cut which has sunken us deeper 80 billion deeper into debt over the next 10 years and will benefit the few the wealthy i think it is also important for us to understand that we have to have fiscal discipline lets just talk a little bit about that because i want to make sure that everyone understands what we are talking about here well here is a chart again it is so selfexplanatory we just continue to use it and use it and use it the unfortunate part is that the numbers will change soon it will not change in the way of saying we are doing better no it will change in that we are doing worse when i say we i am saying led by the republican majority here in the house two hundred twentyfour years 1 01 trillion borrowed from foreign nations since the president has been president president bush and the republican majority has been in control over the last 4 years 2001 to 2005 president bush and the republican congress that is under his picture have borrowed 1 05 trillion i do not care there is no way you can explain how this is good no member need it be republican the one independent or democrat on this floor can explain how this can be good for the american people now time after time i have asked for an explanation from republicans during their time when they are on the floor to explain this all i hear is cricket sounds i look down the hall no one is there i am wondering where the fiscal conservatives in this house are as it relates to the republican majority i wonder where the leadership is as it relates to being able to turn this around there has been no attempt and i mean no documented attempt to be able to turn this around this is unprecedented the first time in the history of the country now this is not the first time in this century or the first time in the last 20 years or the first time in the last 200 years this is the first time in the history of the republic that any congress and any president has borrowed 1 05 trillion from foreign nations the first time the first time i mean it is not like well this happened a couple years ago no the first time in the history of this country should you be alarmed you doggone right you should be alarmed fortytwo presidents could not do it 224 years of a country with all of itg challenges could not do it but when you get president bush in the white house and you get a rubberstamp republican majority here in the house of representatives they can do it unfortunately if we continue with the same team that we have leading in this house and in the white house this is going to continue to grow and it is going to be very very unfortunate because countries are going to start to disrespect this country because we do not have not we the republican majority here in this house does not have the ability to govern and to govern in a way that it should following thepresident unfortunately on this issue where we could show clearly that this is not a winner did this chart come from the democratic caucus i think not these numbers came from the unitedstates department of the treasury so you can get on whatever web site you want to get on and you can find this you dan definitely find it on www housedemocrats gov 30something all of these charts will be there i suggest you download the chart and print it and show it to yout friends because they need to know 1645 what does it mean when i say folks start to disrespect this country we get members coming in this chamber and people giving speeches throughout the country burning all kinds of federal jet fuel talking about terror talking about what you should be scared of i can telliyou right now we need to be dealing with terror and we need to be dealing with it in a smart way and protect the homeland and that is not happening right now take it from me i am the ranking member on the homeland security subcommittee on oversight and i can tell you it is not happening right now we have not issued one subpoena to be able to rein in individuals that are stealing from this government contractors and individuals within the department that is allowing it to happen that is another special order that i will not get into right now but if you want to talk about disrespecting the united states of america this is not something that is foreign born or someone that released an audiotape or a videotape here this is what happened right here on the floor the borrowing that i talked about over the last 4 years how did it happen japan 882 8 billion bought our debt japan did not say hey we want yall to overspend we want you to give tax cuts to millionaires and billionaires we want you to do things that you cannot afford to do just because you can japan did not say well just because the president said we should do it that you should rubber stamp it no that is what the republican congress did and we do need a change and we need alternatives we have talked about those alternatives china 249 8 billion they bought our debt china red china communist china the u k want to talk about our ally and friend yeah they are our friends all right they bought 223 2 billion of our debt we did have the prime minister here he addressed a joint session i did not hear him and i was reading his speech as he was up here giving his speech he did not say hey keep spending in an irresponsible way so we can buy your debt and own a piece of the american apple pie he did not say that but the republican congress continues to rubber stamp presidents bushs policies to say that we are being fiscally responsible meanwhile there is 1 05 trillion that we borrowed from foreign nations caribbean countries 115 3 billion bought our debt taiwan 71 3 billion little taiwan they are even in the game of getting part of this american apple pie with the republican congress giving it away they are willing to buy it up guess who we owe we owe every last one of these countries that i have ripped off this chart so far canada just north of us 53 8 billion korea 66 5 billion germany 65 7 billion opec nations well you know opec nations who are they oil producing countries whether it be saudi arabia iran iraq you name it these countries are in this opec nation and they are even in the game of buying a piece of the american apple pie at 67 8 billion well i have this kind of flag here that is kind of draped over the united states of america and i said we want to get back there i would urge the members to do one of twothings one work in a bipartisan way and pick up payasyougo policies as we have talked about and have put on this floor here in this house time after time again and saying that if you are going to give 1 billion to a contractor to do whatever he wants to do with it without any little oversight then doggone it you better figure out how you are going to pay for it if you are going to give tax cuts to folks who are not asking for them you better show how you are going to pay for it not just saying we will borrow from these foreign nations we continue to borrow because we can borrow and make history in 4 years that was not accomplished in over 224 years no we are going to make history the republican majority is going to make history in 4 years at 1 05 trillion that is a lot of money with a big t 224 years 1 01 trillion fortytwo presidents could not even muster up that if you want to get back to a balanced budget that i talked about earlier that i am going to continue to pound on then have a democratic majority or work in a bipartisan way one of the two i have more faith in the fact of the democratic majority getting the job done than the republicans allowing us to work in a bipartisan way towards having a balanced budget you want to talk about partisanship partisanship over the budget is at the highest level that it could be because you have one side with the will and the desire to balance the budget and you have the other side republican majority that says they want to balance the budget but do not have the will and the desire to do it that is the sidebyside on that you have to have the will and the desire to do it i cannot go to my daughter and say lauren i want you to go out and play softball well she may not have the will and the desire to play softball but just because i have the will and desire does not necessarily mean that she has to have it well guess what on this side of the ball we have the will and the desire to balance the budget not only do we have the will and the desire history is on our side history is on our side because we balanced the budget we actually did it the democratic house did it without one republican vote not one maybe i could say maybe two three fournot one republican vote we balanced the budget and put this country in surplus we could have dealt with social security could have took it beyond the time it is supposed to have issues could have made sure that veterans did not have to pay copayments could have made sure that we could have been ahead as it relates not to below the 39 percent in funding leave no child behind could have provided more tax cuts for the middle class it is what it is and i would tell you if folks want to get back to a balanced budget and not have these countries in all due respect in our pocketthese countries have their hand in our pocket not because of the folks that are running around here trying to make a living every day it is because of the republican majority what they have done opec nations got their hands straight in our pocket germany has their hand in our pocket at 6 7 billion the unitedstates taxpayers pocket korea 66 5 billion they have their hands in our pocket taiwan 71 3 billion have their hands in our pocket canada 53 8 billion have their hands in the american taxpayers pocket caribbean countries 115 3 billion have their hands in the american taxpayers pocket the u k 223 2 billion have their hands in the american taxpayers pocket and china have a handandahalf in the american taxpayers pocket and reaching for their credit card while they are at it at 249 8 billion japan has just outright snatched the wallet out of the back of the taxpayers pocket and grabbed someones pocketbook and have their hand in the pocket of the unitedstates taxpayers at 682 8 billion not because the american people went out there and said let us make sure that we spend money that we do not have and let us make records in 4 years in borrowing money from foreign nations the republican majority they have rubber 9tamped the bush administration policy and here we are so what do we do what we do is we make changes and what we have tried to do on this side is do exactly that it would be hard for me as a member of the republican conference to come to this floor and speak with a straight face about the issue on the budget i do not know i would have to go into the bathroom and look in the mirror and practice because it would be hard for me to keep a straight face when i come to the floor to talk about the fact that i am a fiscal conservative and i care about the budget and responsible spending and making sure that we do not overspend and we are not like the others we do not spend well let me tell you something the congressional record says that you spend the american people are noticing that you spend and borrow and spend and borrow and spend and when you cannot borrow anymore you go to foreign nations and you borrow well this is what we have tried to do mr spratts substitute amendment to house concurrent resolution 95 2006 budget resolution failed 228 republican votes against it not one voted for it this is payasyougo once again if you are going to spend 1 million where are you going to get the 1 million from that is all we ask it wasidentified and this opportunity for the republican majority to vote for fiscal opportunity no they said no"], [0.00012803077697753906, 0.9998719692230225, 1, "i rise in opposition to the republican budget resolution the republican budget resolution is no plan to bring the budget back to balance the republican budget includes a deficit for 2006 of 372 billion and a deficit for 2007 of 348 billion these deficiti mean that under republican policies the five largest deficits in history will have occurred in five consecutive years over the next five years 20072011 the budget resolution calls for deficits totaling 1 1 trillion since this administration took office it has requested and the congress has provided four increases in the statutory debt ceiling totaling 3 trillion under this budget by 2011 the statutory debt will increase by another 2 3 trillion for a total increase of 5 3 trillion it will leave the statutory debt at a record level of 11 3 trillion the presidents reckless economic policies have doubled our nations debt further i am concerned by the amount of the debt that has been accumulated by foreign bank individuals and governments in 1980 17 percent of the federal debt held by the public was in foreign hands by 2006 45 percent of the debt held by the public was ovned overseas unfortunately this trend seems to be increasing rapidly during the past year approximately 90 percent of the debt we have accumulated has been purchased by foreign banks individuals and governments i support the representative john spratts alternative budget which would reach balance in 2012 the spraft budget also has smaller deficits than the republican budget and accumulates less debt by contrast the republican budget never returns to balance and even refuses to show how big its deficits will be after 2011 the spratt budget backs the twosided payasyougo paygo budget enforcement rules that require that the cost of any new mandatory spending or revenue legislation be fully offset during the 1990s twosided paygo rules played a critical role in turning record deficits to record surpluses the spratt budget also requires a separate vote to increase the debt limit and prohibits using fasttrack reconciliation procedures to make the deficit worse the republican budget cuts appropriations for domestic services by 9 4 billion relative to current services and by 3 2 billion below the level passed by republicans in the senate meanwhile the budget continues medicare subsidies close to 60 billion for managed care providers of medicare even though they are supposed to save medicare money not cost more the resolution also includes 228 billion over five years for additional tax cuts part of a 3 trillion tenyear republican tax cut agenda the republican resolution cuts appropriated funding for education and related programs below current services providing the same inadequate level as provided by the president for 2007 that repub ican level cuts funding for the department of education by 2 2 billion below last years comparable level and eliminates 42 education programs the spratt budget provides 4 6 billion more than the republican budget for education appropriations and over five years provides 45 3 billion more than the republican resolution the spratt budget rejects the deep cuts proposed by the republican budget and preserves programs such as vocational education perkins loans safe and drugfree schools state grants and the gearup college readiness program the spratt budget also makes a down payment on college affordability by cutting student loan interest rates after a temporary one year gain the republican budget after five years cuts funding for veterans health care by 6 0 billion below current services the spratt budget includes 6 0 billion more than the republican budget over five years for veterans health care the spratt budget also rejects the increase on health care fees on military retirees who are enrolled in tricare the republican budget asks additional sacrifices from those who have served and sacrificed for our country the spratt budget rejects the misguided republican policies and keeps our commitment to our veterans the republican budget cuts funding for health by 18 1 billion below current services over five years the same insufficient level provided by the president the republican level means cuts to priorities such as the centers for disease control 18 of 19 institutes at the national institutes of health and rural health activities the spratt budget provides 18 billion more over five years to fund health priorities cut by the republican budget including medical research at nih and graduate medical education for childrens hospitals the spraft budget also takes steps to address the problems with theimplementation of the medicare prescription drug benefit including extending the may 15 signup period through the end of year and protecting seniors from any enrollment penalties the spratt budget also takes steps to help the uninsured and creates a reserve fund to increase medicare payments to physicians which are currently scheduled to be cut for the environment and natural resources this republican budget imposes a 25 0 billion cut relative to current services over the next five years and imposes a 2 9 billion cut for next year alone this is the same level as the presidents budget which cuts funding for the environmental protection agency including the clean water state revolving fund the army corps of engineers and the national park service the house republican budget resolution actually makes the deficit worse offers no plan to bring the budget back to balance and adds to the growing burden of the national debt meanwhile the republican budget makes harmful cuts to critical services for the american people including education veterans services health and environmental protection i ask my colleagues to

means committee for yielding me the time i thank you and our colleagues on the committee on the democratic side for the excellent work you did in putting forth the democratic alternative today you have made an excellent case for your substitute and indictment against what the republicans are doing let us talk about what is happening here today a few weeks ago right before thanksgiving there was a bill on the floor which was the republican budget bill so bad was this bill in terms of it not representing the values of our country that the religious community gathered in the rotunda of the capitol of the united states and they prayed that this congress would make the right decisions and reject the republican budget proposal they asked some questions about why we would be giving tax cuts to the wealthiest people in our country while taking food out of the mouths of americas children they said they were going to draw a moral line ii the sand because a budget should be a statement of our national values and what we care about in our country should be reflected in that budget today we are talking about a tax bill which is handinglove part of the reconciliation that the republicans are putting forth so embarrassed were they by their own budget and so embarrassed were they by this tax bill that they had to have 3 weeks come between the two of them so that the american people would separate the cause and effect of what they were doing with their budget bill that was poor in its values poor in its priorities and increasing our deficit because of this tax bill today yesterday they engaged in another sham which was to pretend that they were giving alternative minimum tax relief for middleclass families in america if they cared about middleclass families in america they would have put that in this bill today which has the full protection as it goes over to the senate they know that that bill they passed yesterday has no weight in the senate it does not have the protection of the parliamentary process on the senate side and the same applies to what they did to try to give the illusion that they were helping our men and women in combat so that they would qualify for the lowincome tax credit if they cared about them they would have them in the bill today this budget as i said should be a statement of our national values and while we talk about that let us talk about what those values are america has always cherished the value of opportunity and one place where that is possible for more americans is in the issue of education taking these two bills together we are giving tax cuts to the wealthiest people in america while we are putting a burden on our young people by saying that they will pay 5 800 more in their student loans so that we can give tax cuts to people making over 1 million a year that is not a statement of our national values that takes from our children their opportunity when we should be expanding it fairness fairness has always been a cherished american value fairness we see that during the last 5 years these 5 years of the bush administration 7 million more people in our country go to sleep hungry without adequate food because they cannot afford to buy food seven million more people an increase of 12 percent and what does this combination of reconciliation in order to give tax cuts to people making over 1 million a year that cuts food stamps and takes many tens of thousand of children off the school lunch program do as the religious community said how can we as a country give tax cuts to the wealthiest and take food out of the mouths of our children that is not about fairness fairness is an american value community america has always been about community alexis de tocqueville said it about the origins of our country and community means safe neighborhoods the safety of our people homeland security and the rest we are not putting adequate resources to cops on the beat or anything else in order for us to give these tax cuts at the high end that is not about community that is totally unfair and it is diminishing opportunity let us take the value of responsibility personal responsibility fiscal responsibility which should be the order of the day in this conversation here the combination of their tax bill and their budget bill in reconciliation which i do not blame them for separating by 3 weeks because it is a total embarrassment with that they are increasing the deficit they are increasing the deficit by 20 billion in order to give tax cuts to the wealthiest americans they are putting the burden of debt on americas children individual debt with their student loans and fiscal debt in terms of our national debt and what our kids will be burdened with it is just totally irresponsible and at the same time increases the deficit democrats support payasyougo no deficit spending if something is important to you figure out how to pay for it but do not make my children and grandchildren have to pay for it or anybodys children and grandchildren have to pay for it every opportunity i get i want to sing the praises of the clinton administration coming out of that administration we were on a trajectory of 5 6 trillion with a tr dollars in surplus in the years of the bush administration that has been almost fully reversed over 4 trillion in deficit a swing of around 10 trillion an incredible burden on the future a tax on our childrens future and this is the party of fiscal responsibility republicans have completely abdicated that the democrats are the party of fiscal responsibility we showed we can do it then we can do it again we should not today be catering to this appetite for deficits that the republicans cannot seem to get over it is just absolutely immoral immoral for us to heap those deficits on our children i want to commend my colleagues on the democratic side for what they have done and put into their proposal the house democrats are committed to an america that works for everyone not just the privileged few our democratic substitute reflects the values of community by shielding the middleclass americans from the alternative minimum tax in a bill that really counts not in some suspension of yesterday that has no weight in the conference with the senate and it provides tax relief the democratic alternative does for our soldiers in combat in the bill that really matters as well the democratic substitute demonstrates fairness by not adding to the deficit and it creates opportunities spurring economic growth generating jobs and supporting our small businesses our democratic members on the committee have eloquently made an indictment against this budget which is immoral because of the 70 billion in tax cuts mostly for americas wealthiest the republican budget decimates the very initiatives that middleclass americans rely upon to get ahead the poor suffer the rich benefit the middle class is paying the bill the number of people without health insurance has increased 4 years in a row people are hungry a 12 percent increase the number of people who do not have health insurance has grown they are cutting 45 billion in medicaid a health insurance program that is mostly for americas poor children many of them katrina survivors alexis de tocqueville talked about community in america he wrote back to the french america is great because america is good if america ever ceases to be good he concluded america will cease to be great this is a moment that no one in this body wants to hasten we all want

states national debt is 8 413 298 480 959 and some change if you divide that enormous number by every man woman and child including those babies being born today every united states citizens share of the national debt comes to the tune of 28 120 in the blue dog coalition we have coined the phrase the debt tax not to be confused with the death tax or estate tax the debt tax debt is one tax that cannot go away until we get our nations fiscal house in order that is what the democratic fiscally conservative 37memberstrong blue dog coalition is all about trying to restore some commonsense and fiscal discipline to our nations government as you walk the halls of congress and as you walk the halls of the cannon and the longworth and the rayburn house office buildings you will come across these posters which signify that you have walked by the door of an office of one of our fellow blue dog members we are concerned about this because from 1998 through 2001 this nation had a balanced budget and yet under this administration and this republicanled congress we have seen record budget deficits the largest deficits ever ever in our nations history in 2004 the deficit was 412 billion in 2005 it was 318 billion in 2006 it was 372 billion and in fiscal year 2007 it is projected to be 350 billion one of the largest deficits ever in our nations history one of the first bills i filed as a member of congress when i got here back in 2001 was a bill to tell the politicians in washington to keep their hands off the social security trust fund the republican leadership in this congress refused to give me a hearing or a vote on that bill and now we know why because the real deficit projected for fiscal year 2007 is not 280 billion or 350 billion depending on whose numbers you want to believe it is really 545 billion so where does the difference come about it is because this republican congress and this administration is counting the social security trust fund and that is wrong when you and i go to the bank to get a loan our banker wants to know how we are going to pay it back when are we going to pay it back and yet this republican congress continues to give us the largest budget deficits ever in our nations history while borrowing money from the social security trust fund with no provision being made on how or when that money will be paid back where is it going come from they cannot tell us when is it going to be paid back they cannot tell us social security has kept over half the seniors in america out of poverty it is time for this republican congress to keep their hands off the social security trust fund now why is this debt so important total national debt from 1789 to 2000 was 5 67 trillion let me repeat that from 1789 until 2000 the total national debt was 5 67 trillion but by 2010 the total national debt will have increased to 10 88 trillion this is a doubling this is a doubling of the 211year debt in just 10 years another reason that deficits should matter is because interest payments on this debt are one of the fastest growing parts of the federal budget and the debt tax debt tax is one that cannot be repealed until we get back to the days of a balanced budget not only is our nation borrowing 1 billion a day this number is going up by about 1 billion a day our nation is borrowing 1 billion a day more important than that our nation is spending a half a billion dollars 500 million every single day simply paying interest on the national debt that we already got before it goes up another billion dollars a day i represent a very poor district in arkansas we have a lot of hope in creating economic opportunities by building new highways we need 1 6 billion to complete interstate 69 it sounds like a staggering number until you think about it if we did not have this debt we could build interstate 69 with 3 days interest on the national debt our government will spend more money in the next 4 days paying interest not principal just interest on the national debt than what it would cost to completely build interstate 69 through arkansas interstate 49 will also be critical to creating economic opportunities and jobs for my district we need 1 5 billion to finish it again a staggering number until you think about we are spending 500 million dvery 24 hours simply paying interest on the debt we already got before it goes up another billion dollars today we could complete interstate 49 with just 3 days interest on the national debt hot springs arkansas we need about 200 million to complete the expressway around hot springs 80 million to get it up the hill and up the mountain and another 100 to 200 million to get it back down and totally completed 80 million would be nice 200 million would be better we could complete the hot springs expressway with just a few hours interest on the national debt el dorado arkansas the largest town in my district not located on a fourlane highway desperately needs fourlane access we could fourlane unitedstates highway 167 for about 400 million put it another way we could fourlane unitedstates highway 167 from little rock to el dorado and connect on down to louisiana to 120 with less than 1 days interest on the national debt interstate 1530 200 million to complete that project that is also under construction a lot of money but just a few hours interest on the national debt in fact we could build 200 brandnew elementary schools every single day in america just with the interest we are spending on the national debt we cannot meet americas priorities as it relates to reducing our dependence on foreign oil in fact we will spend we will spend more money in iraq in the next 8 hours than we will spend on research and development of biorefineries in the next 365 days health care education making the kind of advancements to our nations infrastructure that we so desperately need the kind of investments that we saw under roosevelt with the wpa program to help get us out of the great depression or with eisenhower with the interstate program these kinds of priorities for america will continue to go unmet until we get our nations fiscal house in order that is why as a member of the blue dog cqalition i am here to talk about this debt and this deficit because america has many priorities many priorities that continue to go unmet as our nation continues to borrow 1 billion a day as our nation continues to spend half a billion a day 500 million a day simply paying interest on the national debt meanwhile americas priorities continue to go neglected now why should deficits matter other than all of these reasons i have already given you deficits reduce economic growth we all know that look how much better the economy was in the 1990s when ve had a balanced budget deficits burden our children and our grandchildren it is wrong for us to borrow money from other countries to give tax cuts to people here earning over 400 000 a year and leave our children to pay the bill how would you like to go to the bank and tell your banker you want to borrow money to build this new house but you are not going to pay for it you are just going to leave the bills for your children you know mr banker i have got two wonderful children i am going to make sure they get a wonderful education grow up get a good job they are going to pay for this house the banker would try to have you locked up as being mentally insane yet that is how we are running our country today in fact deficits do matter because they increase our reliance on foreign lenders foreign lenders who now own over 40 percent of our debt where is this money coming from that we are borrowing 40 percent as we know some of it is coming from the social security trust fund with no provision on how or when it is going to be paid back well where is the rest of this debt coming from we are borrowing 1 billion a day where is it coming from is it coming from your hometown bank i do not think so it is coming from foreign central banks and foreign investors in fact the united states of america is becoming increasingly dependent on foreign lenders to fund our lifestyle which is give me tax cuts if i make over 400 000 a year borrow the money from china and let my kids worry about paying it back that is thd way this republican congress is running america foreign lenders foreign lenders currently hold a total of more than 2 trillion of our public debt compare this to only 23 billion in foreign holdings back in 1993 the top 10 list the top 10 current lenders america continues to pass tax cuts for folks earning over 400 000 a year with money that we are borrowing because we are borrowing 1 billion a day with money they are borrowing from whom here is the top 10 japan the united states of america owes japan 640 1 billion china 321 4 billion as my friend and a founder of the blue dogs mr tanner has so eloquently stated and pointed out before if china decides to invade taiwan the united states of america will have to go to china to borrow more money to defend taiwan the united kingdom 179 5 billion opec imagine that we wonder why gas is approaching 3 a gallon our nation has borrowed 98 billion from opec to fund tax cuts for folks in this country earning over 400 000 a year korea the united states of america has borrowed 72 4 billion from korea taiwan we have borrowed 68 9 billion the caribbean banking centers 61 7 billion hong kong 46 6 billion germany 46 5 billion and are you ready for this rounding out the top 10 countries that our nation borrows money from to fund our outofcontrol deficit spending to the tune of 1 billion a day we have now borrowed 40 1 billion from mexico now when an american family sits down around the dinner table to pay their bills and budget for their household they include all of their family obligations their mortgage their car payment their credit card bills their education expenses you name it those hardworking folks take into account the cost of a 4year education for their children not just for one year of it they take into account their car payment and how many years it is going to take to pay for that car not just to drive it for a year when they mortgage their homes they take into account how long and by what means they will be able to afford their housing not just live in it for a year and you know what they expect the same from their government and yet as we can see july 11 today los angeles times editorial entitled another mission accomplished i am not going to read all of the editorial but the first two paragraphs are worth reading the release of the white house midsession budget review is an annual event normally marked by a few wonkish observations and the routine updating of various spreadsheets not by a fulldress presidential dogandpony show president bush plans to preside today with members of congress and invited guests in attendance by all indications including his own in his weekly radio address last saturday he plans to turn this into a celebration just in time for the fall campaign this is proof if anyone still needs it that this administration is desperate for something to boast about on mr bushs watch tripledigit budget surpluses have turned into annual tripledigit budget deficits there is no information in the midsession report to alter that utterly disparaging fact yes the report is expected to project that this years deficit will be somewhat less gargantuan than last years probably somewhere between 280 and 300 billion versus a 318 billion shortfall in 2005 that is not much to crow about that is an editorial that appeared today in the los angeles times entitled another mission accomplished it goes on but the point is that this administration is so desperate for some good news that they are having a celebration to celebrate that our nation is not going to borrow 318 billion as it did in 2005 it is only going to borrow between 280 and 300 billion in fiscal year 2006 i submit to you that our nation borrowing nearly 1 billion a day is nothing to celebrate now contrary to this administra special orders for the blue dog coalitions rhetoric in light of these new tion now for quite a while on a weekly numbers touted today we have yet to basis to try to deliver the message to get government spending under con the american people in an honest and trol instead of talking about 1 year straightforward way about the fiscal we should have a real plan to deal with situation of our nations government the realities of our longterm debt and i was glad to hear him deficit just like american families do talk a little bit about iraq iraq is a for their financial obligations situation that we are having a great a perfect example of this is how we debate in this country about and i are handling our obligation in iraq i think that he made the point that we believe we all support our troops i all very strongly support the men and hope we do i have got a brotherinlaw women once we established the miswho spent christmas refueling air sion and sent them over there to perforce planes over in afghanistan my form and carry out that mission it is first cousins wife gave birth to their clear that we support them it doesnt first child during his service in iraq mean that we cant have an honest and we honor all of those who have and open dialogue and debate about the who continue to serve our country in policy iraq afghanistan and elsewhere is appalling to me as a where i disagree with this president person who wore the uniform during is on the point of accountability this the vietnam era to see those members president this republican congress is of the house of representatives and sending 279 million of your tax money the unitedstates senate or anybody that might to iraq every day and yet if you ask oppose the policy that the united him to be accountable for it if you ask states government has to have them him for a plan on how that money is called unpatriotic so i appreciate the being spent and how it will win the gentleman from arkansas bringing up peace and ultimately bring our men that point and women in uniform home he will i also came here today tell you you are being unpatriotic to talk a little bit about fiscal responthat is where i disagree with this sibility and to assist my friend from president arkansas in talking about the national we just entered our fourth year in debt i find it appalling to this war and i believe if we are going hear the partisan political rhetoric to send 279 million of your tax money that goes on in these chambers rhetto iraq every day this administration oric which celebrates a federal budget and this republican congress should be annual deficit of 300 billion held accountable for how that money is now most of us that have run a busibeing spent ness know that at the but we are still finding it piecemeal end of the day your revenues have to we are still excluding the cost of the match your expenditures or else you war from our annual spending process either have to borrow money with a we are passing a number of supple longterm plan to pay it back or a mental appropriation bills to pay for it shortterm plan and show your banker that mask the wars true cost it is how you can pay it back that year time it is past time that this adminis this administration and tration be up front with the american this republicanled congress over the people and include these important last 5 years have run our government costs in their annual budget estimates into a situation where we have a struconly then only then tural deficit built in there is not an will we be able to celebrate a real de economist anywhere around that will

we con know that we have to make some clude this hour on the floor today the structural changes to the way we are unitedstates national debt will have risen to doing business so when i see somebody

again what you need is a 12step program on spending it is called intestinal fortitude it is called having a spine it is called having some guts to do what is necessary but the first thing you did was get rid of the discipline and payasyougo so now you are stuck but more importantly the nation is stuck and so we see this little plea on the morning that we are going to give away almost 1 trillion to the richest people in the nation you have a plea here that maybe the president will stop the bridge to nowhere how about congress stopping the bridge to nowhere how about doing what you were elected to do you dont need a line item veto this isnt about statutes this isnt about vetoes this is about what the congress is to do you walked in here fresh newly elected and you got handed 5 trillion and now you cant stop yourself you cant stop yourself you can stop yourself from giving the people an increase in the minimum wage that hasnt increased since 1997 you cant give those people 70 cents more an hour but you give it away to the richest estates and then you can plead that but for the line item veto we would somehow get to a balanced budget every dollar you are going to spend today tomorrow and every dollar you spent yesterday and the day before came out of the social security trust fund i am sure that america while you are putting away a rainy day fund on borrowed money i am sure america is delighted that you are putting away the estate tax on their social security earnings on their trust fund you are taking their trust fund that belongs to all americans called the social security trust fund and you are raiding it for the trust fund of the heirs of the richest estates in america what a wonderful example today what a wonderful example for young people to learn about our obligations to future generations this is a theater of the absurd you have run the country into the ditch financially you got a 1 trillion war going that you cant figure out how to stop you have stolen most of the money from social security trust fund every year we have a deficit we have a 8 trillion debt and you want to talk about the line item veto you know the government is spending money like a drunken sailor andronald reagan said well at least the sailor was spending his own money you are spending the publics money at a rapid illegal unconscionable immoral rate and you ought to stop but the line item veto wont do it lots of things have changed since 1997 but the value of the minimum wage isnt one of them because of congress failure to act on behalf of the lowest paid workers in america the minimum wage is still just 5 15 per hour 5 15 per hour think about that at 5 15 per hour you would have to work 11 day just to fill a tank of gas at todays gas prices at 5 15 per hour you would have to work for at least 30 minutes just to afford a single gallon of milk democrats have a simple and reasonable proposal we want to raise the minimum wage to 7 25 per hour over the next two years doing so would directly benefit 6 6 million american workers the vast majority of those workers are adults hundreds of thousands of them are parents with children under the age of 18 we have all heard the wellworn economic arguments against raising the minimum wage and we all know they simply arent true the truth is that raising the minimum wage wont hurt the economy and can even help it but forget about economics thats not what this issue is about this issue is about doing whats right and it is just wrong that in the wealthiest and most advanced country in the history of the world millions of adults work fulltime all year and yet still earn an income that leaves them deep in poverty it is just wrong for the republican leaders of this congress to refuse to allow even a vote on raising the minimum wage but what makes all of this far worse is that today once again as it has done so many times during the past several years the leaders of this house are going to push tax breaks for the wealthiest people in this country you know starting in 2009 only the largest and wealthiest 7 500 estates nationwide will pay the estate tax the republican plan to gut the tax on these 7 500 estates will add three quarters of a trillion dollars to the federal budget deficit over the next decade thats trillion with a t lee raymond the former ceo of exxon mobil stands to save as much as 160 million if this estate tax repeal goes through this is the same lee raymond who left his job with a 400 million retirement package why is the republican leadership so worred about people like lee raymond why is the republican leadership constantly looking for new ways to help the absolute richest people in the country when is the leadership of this house going to do something for the lowestpaid families in america if you are born with a silver spoon in your mouth and you stand to inherit millions or even billions of dollars that you did not work to earn then this congress wants to serve you but if you get up every day and go to work to earn a living then dont expect any help from this congress the message all of this sends could not be clearer the republicans value wealth not work if you hold up your end of the bargain and contribute to your community and our econ omy by working hard every day then you should not have to live in poverty it is well past time for this congress to treat americas working families with the respect and dignity they have earned the choice to provide hundreds of billions more in tax breaks for the ultrawealthy is shameful its even more

bill while this bill certainly has some worthy provisions including those reported out by our committee overall this bill is a step backward this bill will not lessen our dependence on foreign oil and it will do nothing to reduce energy prices it will increase the deficit weaken our economy compromise our national security and endanger our environment the supporters of this bill are certainly right about one thing we desperately need a good national energy policy this measure does not pass that test our growing dependence on foreign oil puts us at the mercy of unstable and unfriendly foreign regimes it gives terrorists additional targets and puts money in their hands it weakens the dollar by worsening the balance of trade we would start every day 500 millionplus in the hole on our balance of trade because of the imported oil it pumps money out of the domestic economy and into the hands of those who would wish us ill in short our oil dependence represents a significant and growing threat to our national security and national security should be first and foremost in the minds and hearts of everyone in this chamber so what do we do to reduce our dependence on foreign oil yes we need to increase the supply of fossil and nuclear and renewable energy but most importantly we need to become more energy efficient and does this bill do to make us more energy efficient virtually nothing the federal energy information administration found that last years energy bill would have almost no impact on energy demand and energy prices and that bill if anything made more of an effort to tame consumption the alliance for an energy efficient economy has estimated that this years energy bill would not save a single barrel of oil by 2020 that is both tragedy and farce we know how to treat our oil addiction we can make appliances more energy efficient without inconveniencing anyone we can make our cars more efficient without sacrificing safety my cafe amendment would reduce oil consumption in 2020 by 2 million barrels a day that is more than twice the amount that is expected per day from drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge what does this bill do instead of trying to make us more energy efficient at a time of fiscal crises and record oil prices the bill provides new mandatory spending that will go directly to the oil industry and it provides mandatory breaks for the oil industry on royalties the bill provides massive tax breaks for profitable oil companies and next to nothing for new technologies that could help wean us from foreign oil here is what the president said last week on that issue with 55 oil we dont need incentives to oil and gas companies to explore the presidents budget devoted 72 percent of its proposed energy tax incentives to alternatives this bill provides just 6 percent to alternatives while providing more than a billion dollars in additional tax breaks we would not have to look far to come up with better ideas while the house has been writing a bill based on ideological purity rather than careful analysis others have come forward with bipartisan sensible balanced approaches to energy policy groups like the national commission on energy policy and the alliance to save energy and the energy future coalition have all offered carefully considered proposals that could have formed the basis of an effective bill with republican credentials but instead we have decided to close our minds and open our purse in a way that will harm taxpayers and consumers and weaken our economic health and national security we can do

this matter can neither be created nor destroyed now we knew that saddam had weapons of mass destruction he admitted he had weapons of mass destruction he said that he destroyed them and got rid of them but we could of course not believe him we sent the inspectors in he had the inspectors running around in circles anyone who has listened to the tapes of saddam and some of his henchmen there knows very well that they knew where the inspectors were at all times and they were giving them the runaround they talked about it on the tapes there are 12 hours of tapes there that say so that material that information is available to the public today and so we know that he had weapons of mass destruction and we know that he was pulling the wool over the inspectors eyes and we know that he used them on his own people in one instance with only three of the weapons only three of the canisters for gas he killed 5 000 of his own people up in kurdistan 5 000 people with only three we got the news we got the news a couple of days ago the information about the collection and the gathering of the finding of the weapons of mass destruction had finally been declassified by the pentagon when it was declassified then we saw senator santorum and chairman pete hoekstra go before the world and say we have found weapons of mass destruction since 2003 weve accumulated 500 of the weapons of mass destruction now there isnt very much information that is available to the public that has been declassified and i will confine my remarks to the declassified information that is there but i would submit the facts are that we have found over 500 weapons of mass destruction and among those are mustard and sarin gas and that they are lethal and the warning that comes out from the pentagon is that they remain lethal and so whether these were pre1991 or post1991 nobody on that side said well he had them up till 1991 then theyre gone again that wasnt a condition in fact they are going to find a way to put conditions on it no matter how much we come up with no matter what the reality is they will never make an admission that saddam had weapons of mass destruction when we went in and so they were found they were found perhaps in various locations around iraq and the cumulative total right now is 500 we are confident that we will continue to find more i would submit that if we do not find them and if the terrorists do find them they will find a way to use them on coalition troops on americans they will use them on their own people if they think they can create the kind of chaos that would melt that country down get us to pull out and turn that into a training center and a mission operations control center for al qaeda and for their side of this global war on terror no saddam had weapons of mass destruction he had significant quantities of weapons of mass destruction and the fact that we didnt end up with great huge warehouses full sitting there waiting for us to ride in on doesnt prove that they dont exist it has been proven and admitted and no one denies they did exist saddam had them he used them and so what i have said is either you have to believe that saddam hussein used his last canister of gas on the kurds and simply ran out of inventory and so there he was his warehouses were empty and we came in to liberate the iraqis and he simply had used up his supply of chemical weapons either you have to believe that or you have to believe that those weapons that we know existed are somewhere matter can neither be created nor destroyed so the king version of that is everything has to be someplace and we found 500 of them and there are many more someplace whether they were hauled across the border by the russians and whether they were buried in syria whether they are buried in iraq but i would ask the people on the other side of the aisle this group of lamenting pessimists that we hear every night if you will confess that there are 500 different pieces of weapons of mass destruction then you can make your arguments about how much that means to you it means a lot to the american people it means a lot to this war effort but i would ask then if they happen to be something that the iraqis forgot about which one wag actually said how do you forget about 500 pieces of weapons of mass destruction if that is the case and you think they dont exist where did wecome up with these mig29s that were buried in the iraqi desert fully operational mig29s they were ordered to be buried by saddam hussein we found that out did we find these jets by having some kind of a united nations weapons inspector walking around with a metal detector in the desert no did we find them by using intelligence having someone who said all right i know what we did we dug a hole and we buried these mig29s scattered them around the desert heres where they are here are the gps coordinates go dig them up theyre operational you can dust the sand off fuel them up and fly them out of here that didnt happen either what happened was the wind blew the sand off the tail section of a mig some people looked over there and thought thats funny that looks a lot like the tail section of a jet lets dig down and see what we have got they dug down and found out a mig29 sitting there fully operational buried in the desert if they can bury an airplane and we cant find the airplane except by happenstance weather and good luck tell me why anyone would think that they couldnt have buried weapons of mass destruction there when we know that they exist we know that he used them on his own people we know that he only took three of them to kill 5 000 people and we found 500 of them and think what kind of devastation that could have been on the american troops and then think about how many others are there somewhere that might fall into the hands of the enemy and be used on americans coalition forces or the brave iraqis themselves that are in uniform today defending iraqis to the tune now and the strength of 267 000 iraqis in uniform defending iraqis performing well fighting well carrying on operations taking over security of the country and providing that next level of safety security and freedom for the iraqi people this has been distorted so far that i dont know if i can express my disappointment with the message that the american people have been getting having gone to iraq a number of times myself having looked our soldiers in the eye having sat down and been briefed by our commanding officers including general casey and general abazaid having a working relationship with secretary rumsfeld on this and knowing that from the lowest ranking foot soldier or marine to the highest ranking officer in our military to the secretary of defense and to the president himself everyones message indexes up and down the line the message that comes out of there is we are winning and we are scoring points and we are providing more security in iraq not less and the future is getting brighter by the day and the enemy is giving up more and more people and more and more eauipment and more and more ability to carry out operations their will to fight is being destroyed and it is being destroyed systematically so i submit to you that poster of abu masab al zarqawi zarqawi was the leader of al qaeda in iraq he was pretty difficult to find for a couple of years he pledged his allegiance to osama bin laden and he was an inspiration and a recruiting force and probably the most evil diabolical person that we have seen on this globe in my lifetime he is the person that devised the most brutal ways to slaughter people he is the one who made sure that he was on a videotape beheading americans the torture deaths the burning deaths those who were killed a child killed and had bombs planted inside the cavity of the child and have that detonate when the family comes to collect the body that is the kind of diabolical evil that zarqawi was now it is ironic i think that he said these things about americans zarqawi said aniericans are the most cowardly of gods creatures they are an easy quarry praise be to god we ask god to enable us to kill and capture them americans are the most cowardly of gods creatures that is the last thing i have seen out of americans i have not seen any of that out of americans in iraq or anywhere else when they put on the uniform they are the most courageous the most noble certainly not the most cowardly and are far from an easy quarry zarqawi zarqawi was in a safe house i appreciate myself and i think americans will appreciate the irony of abu al zarqawi being in a safe house that safe house didnt turn out to be too safe for him and the pictures of that house after it was blown to smithereens by two 500pound bombs that came from a pair of f16s would tell the world how unsafe it is to be the number one enemy of the united states of america of the coalition forces of the iraqi people and of the free world and so zarqawi went to meet his maker and checked into the next life what has met him there zarqawi knows today but if there is a place for evil people where they burn in infinity i have to believe that zarqawi is there i have never seen such evil out of anyone anyplace on the planet in my lifetime this is the individual that was the inspiring spirit of al qaeda in iraq and pledged his allegiance to osama bin laden zarqawi was the individual who was the inspiring part that recruited enemy soldiers to work for him he is the one that organized the funding effort and the military munitions and the equipment that they needed in order to attack coalition forces and the iraqi military and the iraqi people women and children included where the only discrimination he made was occasionally he would spare the lives of some sunnis because he had a preference to the sunnis this man is now dead and he is gone in the aftermath of the detonation the blowing to smithereens of the safe house there were a lot of data that was gathered there computer hard drive data and paper documents and those paper documents and the hard dive data indexed with a lot of other intelligence that had been gathered around iraq and other places that were indexed into that location in the world all of that data that has been pored through now and i mean all of it points to one thing the enemy the terrorists in iraq are losing they are having great difficulty recruiting fighters they are having difficulty finding funds they are having difficulty pulling together weapons and they are having difficulty finding the material to improvise explosive devices with 2045 they are having difficulty logistically because security in iraq is getting tighter and tighter and tighter and moving from section to city from city to section and from city to city it is ever more dangerous than it was before they are getting demoralized and dispirited the very thing that some of the people on the left would like to have the enemy think about the united states is actually happening to al qaeda and the terrorists in iraq we are very close to putting this thing away their spirit is weak and von clausewitz wrote a book and the name of the book was on war and von clausewitzs statement on war was the object of war was to destroy the enemys will and ability to conduct war and that seems to be a little bit obvious but i think it is something that bears repeating we should all be in the same effort here we should be in the effort of destroying the enemys ability to conduct war and that means we need to turn our military loose on them with a ferocity that we can bring to bear and we have been doing that we have been doing a great job both in afghanistan and also in iraq but additionally to that we need to be destroying the enemys will to carry out war to conduct those acts of war and that means they need to understand that our will will not be shaken we will not let up we will provide all of the troops and all of the support for the troops and all of the equipment and the training and the munitions and the weapons and the tactics and the technology necessary to take them out until this is over because the stakes are far too high we cannot tolerate stepping back from this confrontation we made a commitment to go in there and there is only one option and that option is victory there is no option to any phased pullout or any drawdown unless it is something that it is no longer necessary to have troops there there is also an option to escalate if we need to do that if we see the need to do that but if we need to do that that option is on the table if we needed to double the troops there that is what would happen if that is what the generals asked for because this enemy this one is dead the ones beneath him some of them many of them are actually dead and the one who follows will soon be those that are part of the officers will be sent into the next life as well but at some point they are going to understand that they cannot carry on this fight that it is absolutely hopeless the best part of it is it will be hopeless when the political solution in iraq is fully manifested now they have a prime minister now they have a fully operational cabinet one that was carefully chosen and it was a little bit of a struggle to get to that agreement but their minister of defense and the minister of the interior in particular are very very important cabinet positions those positions are now filled with good people people that are going to have the best interests of the future of iraq in mind not their best interests in mind but the best interests of the future of iraq that means that the minister of defense is going to continue aggressively taking out the enemy we have seen that kind of leadership out of the prime minister and we will see that kind of leadership out of the minister of defense the minister of the interior is going to be looking at their national resources and thinking how do we convert this oil into cash and they will set up a formula to do that when that cash starts to flow into iraq prosperity begins and it will take a little while but it will take root when prosperity takes root the root that is there now for freedom goes deeper and wider it has something to nourish itself and that will be the profit that comes from marketing the national resources called oil and the wealth of that will generate the many layers and the cycles and the interconnectivity of the economy that is all going to take place that is going to take place because the iraqi people see themselves as iraqis first and shiias sunnis and kurds second they understand that they have one chance at freedom and that is as a unified nation and they are fighting together to do that and we need to stand with them we made that pledge our commanderinchief is the commanderinchief the president of the united states has that constitutional duty and responsibility and we need to stand with him when i see amendments come out here on this floor that undermine the presidents authority to conduct this military operation as he sees fit then that is unnecessary interference if there is anything that takes away a tool from the battlefield if there is anything that undermines our ability to do negotiations to work with and cooperate with the iraqis that is undermining the war effort and that should not ever happen out of this congress we committed to this task this congress voted to commit to this task and we put up at least two xesolutions since then committed to this task we will stay committed to this task and those who work against it are working on the side and this is what makes this guy what made him smilewas when our lefthanded leaders here stand up and say we cannot win wrong war wrong place wrong time somesay that the american soldiers are carrying out operations that are not becoming of american soldiers things happen in war but our soldiers are conducting themselves with honor and with dignity zarqawi is now gone checked into the next life i will tell you then we have another leader in the other side of the theater in afghanistan that ran a tape just other the day this is ayman al zawahiri he would be secondincommand among the al qaeda and operating we think out of the border area between afghanistan and pakistan he has put out a tape and let me see it is kihd of interesting to watch how they do this when they take some serious blows as they did when zarqawi was killed by those american bombs as we see the intelligence that they are operating out of desperation and despair that every bit of that intelligence says that they are losing the war and when we see these weapons of mass destruction have been discovered and accumulated since 2003 when the people on the other side of the aisle say well that is not really any big deal killing zarqawi was not that big a deal and finding the weapons of mass destruction is not that big a deal and the intelligence is there that says that they are dispirited and they are running out of resources and they are having trouble recruiting that is not that big a deal then we have zawahiri who does about a 31 2 minute video he is calling out also i think in desperation and he says i am calling upon the muslims in kabul in particular and in all afghanistan in general and for the sake of god to stand in the face of the infidel forces that are invading muslim lands well i do not know that we have invaded muslim lands and i am surely convinced that there is a lot of strong christians there that would be a definition by my definition would mean they are not infidels he also calls out to egyptians he is an egyptianborn fugitive zawahiri who says here is his operation the collapse of american power in vietnam they ran and left he thinks that is going to happen in afghanistan he thinks it is going to happen in iraq americans did not run and leave but they were deployed out of vietnam by the direction of this congress this congress lost their will and losing our will back in 1974 has given inspiration to a man like this in 2006 it is costing american lives today coalition lives today in iraqi and innocent and civilian lives today because that has been what has inspired this egyptianborn fugitive who also said in his tape the young men of islam in the universities and schools of kabul should carry out their duties and essentially go volunteer for jihad but we have a prime minister in afghanistan they are a free country they are a sovereign nation and people went to the polls in afghanistan for the first time with those routes to the polls and the polling places being guarded by american soldiers by coalition soldiers and for the first time in that place on this planet free people went to the polls and elected their national leaders chose and helped direct their national destiny the first time ever in afghanistan in the history of the world that that has happened they elected karzai so he says of zawahiri the truly elected leader the leader of the afghan people says zawahiri is the first enemy of the afghan people the first enemy and then the enemy of the rest of the world says karzai during his press conference he killed afghans for years thousands and then he went to america and destroyed the twin towers karzai went on to say we and afghanistan want him arrested and put before justice well many of zawahiris supporters have been delivered to justice perhaps 600 of them in these last operations coalition forces afghani troops and americans are serving well in afghanistan in some of the most intense operations that we have seen over there in some time and they are serving effectively over there they are going to preserve and protect the freedom of afghanistan i just have not heard the criticism of the other side of the aisle with respect to afghanistan as i have with iraq i am wondering why that is twentyfive million people freed in afghanistan 25 million people freed in iraq it takes a little longer in iraq than afghanistan fewer casualties in afghanistan there are more in iraq certainly and it is sad and it is a tragedy for every family it is a tragedy for every family but they can take great pride in knowing that that sacrifice has great value frees people around the globe and it is not just the freedom of the iraqi people or just the freedom of the afghan people this is an inspiration of freedom that will one day free every arab in the world everyone through the middle east will one day breathe free and perhaps even in my lifetime we will see that happen the return for that sacrifice does not just do that some may think why do i care about freedom for an arab people i will submit that to the extent that the globe is free we can also be more free in this country safer in this country because wherever there are free people they are not plotting and scheming to go to war against us the united states of america has never gone to war against another free people we work out our differences in a democratic process to the extent that the globe becomes entirely free with people who can have their differences in the voting booth instead of on the battlefield is also the extent that the world becomes a safer place even though we have had ongoing conflicts going on around the world it seems like it never ends and in fact it does not end it has been a long long time since we have had conflict that took lives by the millions as opposed to lives by the thousands or even the hundreds that means that millions of lives i believe have been saved and if this inspiration for the arab people if afghanistan and if iraq become the lodestars of inspiration for a free people that echoes across the arab world the same way that freedom echoed across eastern europe that is the formula for victory in this war we can get there we are getting there freedom has never been easy and it has never been without price but freedom is priceless and it is a profound honor for those who have given their lives also for those who have given their limbs and other parts of their bodies or a year out of their life to give the iraqi people a chance at freedom and to help ensure safety and freedom for the american people for perhaps a long time to come and that is the reason why we fight now there is another subject matter that needs to be brought up because i hear from the other side of the aisle that it is intolerable it is intolerable to have the level of violence in iraq that we have it is intolerable to have the level of casualties in iraq that we have so therefore we should cut and run and that is almost the words that get used and sometimes they actually do get used well the ranking member of the defense subcommittee came here on the floor some months ago and in news conferences around the country and nationally and then globally it got picked up and certainly by al jazeera and arab tv that we should pull out of iraq immediately here we are holding together this country and nurturing and training troops and we have someone who is viewed as a leader in the armed services in this congress who says we should immediately pull out and pull back to the horizon that was much discussed around america and sure it was discussed in the middle east i am sure it was a great inspiration to people like zawahiri in fact it was a great inspiration to zarqawi he was alive then but if we should pull out to the horizon the horizon to me would be some placein range someplace where kind of the top of the hills so you look down in the valley and shoot down in there if you need to or rush down there if you have to no we found out where that horizon was in this past week when that member the representativre from pennsylvania said no we should immediately redeploy to okinawa now how many people in america could have gotten that multiple choice question right i would have missed it if you would have given me two answers if you would have said okinawa and let me see if i can pick another one australia i would have gotten it wrong i would have picked australia if you had given me 10 choices across there i think you maybe could have picked two or three i could have as being more likely or less likely but okinawa i would have never done that in an essay question or a fillintheblank i do not know where he came up with okinawa as a place to deploy all of our troops over to it is not a tactical thing that makes any sense it is not a political thing that makes any sense to take our troops and say we are going to take you out of iraq and we are going to put you in the barracks in okinawa where you can train let us say train beach landings in okinawa to get ready to one day go back and fight in the desert in urban warfare does not make sense to me now if he said let us deploy them down to the border to the illegals that are coming across this border that would have made sense but okinawa to say we are going to mount military operations out of okiflawa to go into iraq in case there is some civil unrest where you have to be there quickly where you have to have boots on the ground when our troops our coalition troops and iraqis have to understand the neighborhood have to know the people have to have relationships there in order to be effective okinawa fl 2100 okinawa okinawa i dont think that there is anybody in america that can with a straight face defend such a proposal and it causes me some concern about the foundation of where that came from i would like to know i would like to know if this is kind of a mental equatiofl where you take a kaleidoscope and you btimp it and it looks a certain way and then you leave it like that for a while and you say this is the way it is and then over time you bump it again and it cracks a little differently and you get a different picture entirely i think that is how we come up with okinawa it cant be a rational deductive reasoning path that gets you there even the argument that you can mount air missions out of okinawa to come into iraq and somehow they can be effective from there no we have many bases a lot closer to iraq if there was the idea we would run out of those bases or fly out of those bases it would not be out of okinawa but i would submit that we do have a base agreement there in okinawa we do that in the aftermath of any of our military operations we have open discussions with the sovereign nations that control those territories and we enter into those agreements so that we can have better security and be better positioned militarily we have bases in germany and we have them scattered around in other places around the globe we have gitmo down in cuba that is a legacy left over from the spanish american war of 1898 so that is something that a sovereign nation must do so i think we have covered some of this with regard to the enemy but the issue of the casualties being too great needs to be raised so i am going to submit something i was asking the question on how dangerous is it for a regular civilian in iraq how dangerous is it what would it be like when i see violence on television day after day after day i think sometimes they must announce to the television cameras there is going to be a detonation of an ied so they can set their cameras up and be homed in on the site so they can see the dust and the smoke from the explosion and the flying parts that come out of there how else would they know to have a video camera set up down there and i know some of that film comes from the enemy they set the cameras up and make sure it gets to the news but we see it day after day after day something that would appear to be an intolerable level of violence and something that the people on the other side of the aisle surely cant stand to see because they come down here on a daily basis and say bring them home mr president we cant tolerate this type of violence but what must it be like for a regular iraqi citizen an average citizen that could be living in a random place in iraq they might live in a small town or city somewhere but what are the odds that you are going to be killed in an explosion of a suicide bomber or the detonation of an improvised explosive device i thought i would look into that and i came up with some very interesting statistics and i have them here this is a little example that tells us about the violent death rate across some countries some of them selected for their high rates of violence and some selected for their low rates of violence like the united states but it is designed to tell us about how dangerous it is to be a regular citizen in iraq we went to a couple of web pages and pulled the most reliable information that is available this is the information that is used by congressional research service people who provide us factual data to be used here on the floor of this congress and in committees this is the factual data that is used as a foundation for the decisions that are made in congress that factual data came up with these numbers for us the violent death rates for civilians are rated in the per 100 000 category so here is the united states 4 28 that means out of every 100 000 americans each year 4 28 of them on average meet a violent death that is considered in the civilized world a relatively low violent death rate there are other countries that have lower rates certainly many of the states have lower violent death rates including iowa i might add but 4 28 is compared to mexico with a rate that is more than three times higher about three times higher the violent death rate in mexico is 13 02 per 100 000 now i t ke us to where iraq is this is our subject here iraqs violent death rates an average citizen in iraq is going to be faced with this statistical reality that 27 51 iraqis will die a violent death out of every 100 000 now keep in mind there are 25 million of them so you can calculate what this number is and i just havent done this for this survey but what does that compare nation to nation well it is clear that iraq is about twice as dangerous as mexico 27 51 compared to 13 02 so you are about twice as likely to die a violent death in iraq as an average citizen as you are in mexico but as you can see here about seven times more likely 6pointsomething times more likely to die a violent death in iraq than you are in the united states so it is not so safe by that standard but when we look down the line on some of these other representative countries for example venezuela with hugo chavez down there who is really running a tight ship down there i hear with 31 61 violent deaths per 100 000 it is more dangerous to be an average citizen in venezuela than it is an average citizen in iraq and even more dangerous yet in jamaica only by a little bit with 32 42 violent deaths per 100 000 so there is your comparison it gets a little more dangerous as we go down the line iraq at 27 51 jamaica at 32 42 but south africa has 49 6 violent deaths per 100 000 significantly more dangerous to be an average citizen in south africa in the nation of south africa than it is to be an average citizen in iraq not quite twiqe but moving up the line along in that direction then we go to colombia almost a neighboring country down there they produce a lot of drugs down there that come up into the united states there is a drug culture down there and it is violent there and the death rate is 61 78 violent deaths per 100 000 clearly more than twice as high a death rate in colombia as there is in iraq now that seems to be a little bit shocking but when you go to swaziland 88 61 violent deaths per 100 000 so you are up there a good solid 21 2 times more dangerous to be walking around in swaziland as a regular citizen than it is to be walking around in iraq as a regular citizen that gives us a sense of the level of violence that is there can they tolerate that level of violence can they be a sovereign nation with that level of violence if it never diminishes from where it is today can they still continue to move on and have a civil society and could they still produce and deliver electricity and goods and services and have shops open up and close down at the end of the day and people could go on with commerce the answer to that is well they are doing it in venezuela in jamaica south africa colombia and swaziland every day and we are not hearing a word about that in the news but every day we see the violence in iraq that the cameras have been trained on before it happens and it is a distorted viewpoint safe in the united states three times more dangerous in mexico than in the united states they have a drug culture down there too that is coming at us at a rated of 65 billion worth of illegal drugs a year but almost seven times more dangerous in iraq than it is in the united states but then incrementally more dangerous in venezuela jamaica south arica colombia and swaziland i think i made my point on that so then okay we are talking nation to nation iraq compared to other nations but what is it like for those of us who live in cities we have a sense of what it is like here for example in washington d c well i just happen to have this little chart right here that lays out the relative violent death rate for civilians in the cities now i would point out that we have exempted military deaths in iraq and police deaths in iraq and done so because they are involved in combat over there in a war against the terrorists so they are faced with running into that on a daily basis and those casualties will certainly be higher but we are comparing an average civilian to an average civilian in some of these other places in the world so we will start out here let us go to the low side of this with 27 51 deaths in iraq now we could not find any reliable statistics for citybycity data of violent deaths in iraq so i cant give you mozul i cant give you kirkuk or basra or tikrit or any of those places that information is not available by the crs research that has been done on these web pages that provided this data if it doesnt come through crs i dont have enough confidence in it being reliable in fact we just simply could not find it so we put out what we have an average citizen anywhere in iraq to give you a sense of what it must feel like to live there compared to oakland california it is a little bit safer in oakland california with 27 51 deaths per hundred thousand in iraq and 26 1 in oakland california so if you are walking the streets of oakland california and you are wondering whether it is dangerous or not for you there you should have about the same kind of feeling if you are living in a random place in iraq that doesnt mean there are not highly violent locations in iraq but it just means that overall average citizens feel about the same as in oakland california but st louis is a little more dangerous than iraq on average with 34 4 deaths per 100 000 atlanta is more dangerous yet than iraq at 34 9 violent civilian deaths per 100 000 someone said well you didnt include the policemens deaths in these cities they are not included in this data and i cant tell you actually whether they are or whether they arent but i went back and looked at the level of deaths fhat we had in the last year one in atlanta and none in washington d c so you can see statistically it just simply is not relevant so that issue doesnt really matter to this debate so we have 27 51 deaths per 100 000 in iraq average citizen baltimore 37 7 if you feel safe in baltimore you ought to feel safe in iraq detroit 41 8 the rate is going up if you feel safe in detroit you ought to feel safe in iraq washington d c 45 9 violent civilian deaths per 100 000 and 27 51 in iraq now we are getting up there to that number that is approaching twice as dangerous in washington d c as it is for an average citizen in a random place in iraq if you feel safe in washington d c you should feel equally safe in a random place in iraq there are many places more dangerous than that but a random place in iraq now when you get to new orleans and this number is prekatrina 53 1 violent deaths per 100 000 and guess what mr speaker they called out the national guard and deployed troops down to new orleans because the level of violence got so high down there even with the diminished population there was a violent murderous event down there and so the governor called out the national guard to deploy them on the streets of new orleans to get control of that city is anyone on that side of the aisle talking about that about calling the troops up and mobilizing the national guard to go to new

after this last flurry of crime they have had where there were five people that were executed in one vehicle we dont know whether it was over drugs or a grudge or both but likely that would be the foundational excuse there would never be a reason for doing something that horrible so the governor called out the national guard and the people on this side of the aisle they are not saying what is your exit strategy governor blanco when are you going to get the national guard out of new orleans we dont need to have troops deployed there in an american city that ought to be a civilized place they are not calling for pulling the troops out they are not calling for an exit strategy they are not objecting to troops being deplo3ted to new orleans to keep order for a simple crime rather than the kind of violence that comes in iraq from the terrorists that are trying to turn that society into an uncivil society the terrorists that are attempting to break that country up and start a civil war the terrorists that think if they just kill enough people maim enough people if they can kill enough people in a heinous enough fashion sooner or later everyone will say enough i cant take it any more will you please just stop killing us in the brutal fashion that you are why would anybody think they would ever stop that is their religious belief that is their religious mission they think somehow their path to salvation is brutally killing us killing people who are not like them and i would submit that they kill more muslims than they do christians or jews not that they are their preferred target but it is just simply i think because they are handier those who announce that there is a civil war in iraq that resolution that has been introduced over in the senate and i believe a resolution that may have been introduceil here in the house that says there is a civil war in iraq how can they come to such a conclusion mr speaker 5 2115 i will define a civil war in iraq so folks can have a measurement to go by and that is this 267 000 iraqis in uniform defending iraqis trained on the job today taking over more than 30 bases covering a high percentage of the real estate in iraq and these iraqis are recruited and they are mixed up they are not sorted out by kurds and shias and sunnis they are blended together in one force when those iraqis choose up sides and start shooting at each other wearing the same uniform that will be the definition of a civil war so great strides have been made there is a great reason for optimism there will be a successful conclusion

clearheaded about the challenge of iran it is a more difficult society to deal with a more difficult government than iraq it is absolutely clear that iran does seek nuclear capacity it is absolutely clear that iran has been the greatest state promulgator of terrorist activity in the middle east those are bases that we all have to understand then we have to think through what is our response and what are the kinds of strategies that the united states should develop and are there lessons that exist today that might lend to this circumstance one of the lessons is that some things we do as a society can be counterproductive all of us are concerned with the security and the fate of the state of israel as well as the american national security but if we think it through does our policy in iraq advance the security of israel does a preemption of iran advance the security of israel does it advance the security of the united states if the united states acts militarily for instance in iran do we spark and ensure the great prediction that none of us want to come to pass that we will enter into one of these clashes of civilization made inevitable by another war of the west against another muslim state muslims would view this as a circumstance thatthe judeochristian world is attacking the world of muslim culture we have to think deeply and seriously about this then when it comes to nuclear weapons it is bad for iran to have a nuclear weapon but there are things that are worse one of the things that is worse is to give them reason to use that nuclear weapon whether it be against ourselves or an ally of the united states the administration has informed the committee of jurisdiction that it profoundly opposes this piece of legislation and that it prefers a tack of stressing international diplomacy and it is suggested to the committee in the strongest possible terms that this type of legislation undercuts their effort to be multilateral 1200 and so while many members of this body many members of the public have objected to this administration for being too unilateral this congress is saying with this kind of legislation that we will be more unilateral than the administration wishes to be in other words with an administration that no one of any stripe would argue is not mriuscularit is a very muscular administrationthis congress is trying to outmacho the muscular that is something we should all think veryseriously about then we ought to think through what it means if we go forth in a given kind of direction which words like regime change imply what does preemptionmean it is clear that if we h1762 move in a muscular direction and for example preemptively strike iraq that that will slow down the capacity of iraq to develop a nuclear weapon but will it stop it not necessarily partly because of the capacities iran has to develop wmd capacity in a more decentralized way than iraq once did but there are other ways of getting nuclear weapons one can get nuclear weapons through the loose nuke dilemma of purchase or theft and if one gives iran reason to attack it will and it will in many ways that are now available in the world through decentralized terrorist activities but also potentially through nuclear and the potential of nuclear use increases if they are attacked now we have the other option which is stressed in this billbut the first force being implied but what is stressed is economic sanctions so our two options are to shoot iran or to shoot ourselves in the foot economically and i will tell you that i cant think of anything that is more outrageous in logic so i think we have to think through new types of approaches involving new ways of dialogue new ways of international pressure of a very different nature than are proposed by this committee at this time while i have enormous respect for the proponents of this legislation particularly the distinguished chair of the subcommittee on the middle east and central asia and our distinguished ranking member on the full committee i am convinced that in its present form the approach brought before this body complicates ongoing diplomatic efforts to peacefully resolve the building crisis with iran indeed it is for this reason that the department of state indicated that the administration would be unable to support the legislation as noted in a letter to chairman hyde the bill would narrow in important ways the presidents flexibility in the implementation of iran sanctions create tensions with countries whose help we need in dealing with iran and shift the focus away from irans actions and spotlight differences between us and our allies this could play into irans hands as it attempts to divide the unitedstates from the international community as well as to sow division between the eu3 china and russia it would also create dissension among unsc members as the council considers the iran nuclear dossier there are few areas of the world with a more troubling mix of geopolitical problems than the middle east the irony is that the war in iraq which has consumed so much of our countrys political and economic capital may hold less farreaching consequences than challenges posed in neighboring middle eastern countries to the west the israelipalestinian standoff remains the sorest point in world relations complicated by the incapacitation 6f ariel sharon and the rise of a hamasled government in the occupied territories to the east the sobering prospect of iran joining the nuclear club stands out in life individuals and countries sometimes face circumstances in which all judgments and options are bad the iranian dilemma is a caseinpoint but it is more than just an abstract badoption model because at issue are nuclear weapons in the hands of a mullahcontrolled society which has actively aided andabetted regional terrorists for years indeed the issue has become even more acute with the election in iran of its hardline populist president mahmood ahmadinejad who suggested late last year that the murder of six million european jews by the nazis did not occur and called for israel to be wiped off the map in reference to recent disclosures of enhanced iranian efforts to develop nuclear weapons as well as missile delivery systems to carry such weapons concerned outside parties are actively reviewing options the europeans have led with diplomatic entreaties neocon strategists in the unitedstates with openoption planningincluding if investigative journalist seymour hersh is to be believed the possible use of nuclear weapons in the background are references to the 1981 preemptive strike by the israeli air force against iraqs osirak reactor at issue is the question of whether preemption is justified if so how it should be carried out and if carded out whether intervention would lead to a more conciliatory nonnuclear iran or whether the effects of military action would be shortterm perhaps pushing back nuclear development a year or two but precipitating a new level of hostility against the unitedstates and israel in iran and the rest of the muslim world which could continue for decades if not centuries since the american hostage crisis which so bedeviled the carter administration in the late 1970s we have had a policy of economic sanctions coupled with comprehensive efforts to politically isolate iran six years ago senator arlen specter and i invited irans u n ambassador to capitol hill the first visit to washington by a highlevel iranian representative since the hostage crisis on the subject of possible movement toward normalization of relations with iran i told the ambassador that while many would like to see a warming of relations it would be inconceivable for the unitedstates to consider normalizing our relationship so long as iran continued its support of hamas and hezbollah the ambassador forthrightly acknowledged that iran provided help to both these terrorist organizations but also noted in what for some might be considered the most optimistic thing he said that day that his government was prepared to cease support to antiisraeli terrorist groups the moment a palestinian state was established with borders acceptable to palestinians for decades in the muslim world debate has been ongoing whether to embrace a credible twostate israel and palestine approach or advance an irrevocable pushisraeltothesea agenda the implicit iranian position as articulated by the ambassador was iupport for a twostate approach but if the unitedstates on its own or israel as a perceived surrogate were to attack iran the possibility that such a compromise can ever become possible deteriorates while angstridden the muslim world understands the rationale for our interverntion in afghanistan where the plotting for the 9 11 attack on the unitedstates occurred it has no sympathy for our engagement in iraq which had nothing to do with 9 11 but if these two interventions were followed by a third in iran the likelihood is that such would be perceived in the vocabulary of the harvard historian samuel huntington as an allout clash of civilizations pitting the judeochristian against the muslim world in the middle east it would be considered a war of choice precipitated by the united states we might want it to be seen as a shortterm action to halt the spread of nuclear weapons but the muslim world would more likely view it as a continuance of the crusades a religious conflict of centuries dimensions with a revived future if military action is deemed necessary the unitedstates broadly has only three tactical options a fullscale invasion a la iraq b surgical strikes of iranian nuclear and missile installations or c a surrogate strike by israel mod eled along the lines of osirak the first can be described as manifestly more difficult than our engagement in iraq particularly a postconflict occupation the second presents a number of difficulties including the comprehensiveness of such a strike and the question of whether all aspects of a program that is clandestine can be eliminated the third makes the unitedstates accountable for israeli actions which themselves are likely to be more physically destructive but less effective than the 1981 strike against osirak in thinking through the consequences of military action even if projected to be successfully carried out policymakers must put themselves in the place of a potential adversary a strike that merely buys time may also be a strike that changes the manner and ra tionale of iranian support for terrorist organizations it may also change the geostrategic reasonand methodology for a country like iran to garner control of nuclear weapons loose nukes abound countries with money and will can garner almost anything in the world despite efforts by the unitedstates and others to make theft or sale difficult it is presumed that the major reasons that iran currently seeks nuclear weapons relates to 1 pride a belief that a 5 000 yearold society has as much right to control the most modern of weapons systems as a younger civilization like america or its neighbors to the west israel and to the east pakistan 2 power the implications of control of nuclear weapons with regard to its perceived hegemony as the largest and most powerful country in the persian gulf particularly with regard to its nemesis iraq which not only once attacked kuwait but iran itself using chemical weapons 3 politics the concern that israeli military dominance is based in part on the control of weapons that cannot be balanced in the muslim world except by a very distant pakistan the issue of the day from an american perspective is weapons of mass destruction their development and potential proliferation to nationstates and nonnational terrorist groups the question that cannot be ducked is whether military action against iran might add to the list of reasons iran may wish to control such weapons their potential use against the united states perhaps as significantly american policymakers must think through the new world of terrorism and what might be described as lesser weapons of mass destruction any strike on iran would be expected to immediately precipitate a violent reaction in the shia part of iraq where the unitedstates has some support today with ease iranian influence on the majority shia of iraq could make our ability to constructively influence the direction of change in iraq near hopeless and there should be little doubt that in a world in which tit for tat is the norm a strike on iran would increase the prospect of counterstrikes on american assets around the world and american territory itself the asymmetrical nature of modem warfare is such that traditional armies will not be challenged in traditional ways nationstates which are attacked may feel they have little option except to ally themselves with terrorist groups to advance national interests we view terrorism as an illegitimate tool of uncivilized agents of change in other parts of the world increasing numbers of people view terrorist acts as legitimate responses of societies and in some cases grpups within societies who are oppressed against those who have stronger military forces if afghanistan an impoverished country as distant from our shores as any in the world could become a plotting place for international terrorism such danger would increase manifoldly with an increase in iranian hostility especially if based on an american attack if there exists today something like a oneinthree chance of another 9 11type incident or set of incidents in the unitedstates in the next few years a preemptive strike against iran must be assumed to double or triple such a prospect and iran far more than osama binladen has within its power the ability not only to destabilize world politics but world economies as well oil is after all the grease of economic activity and an iranianled cutback in supply precipitated by us or them cannot be ruled out given the risk if not the untenability of military action policymakers are obligated to review other than military options one which has characterized our posthostage taking iranian policy for a full generation is isolation of iran this policy can be continued but as tempting as it is there is little prospect of ratcheting it up much more except in ways such as a naval embargo on iranian oil that would be difficult to gamer international support for and would in any regard damage us more than iran the only logical alternative is to consider increasing dialogue without abandoning the possibility of future sanctions with this very difficult government iranits government and peoplehas to be fully engaged and i am pleased that unitedstates ambassador khalilzad in baghdad has been authorized to talk to the iranians about the situation in iraq the iranians played a stabilizing role regarding afghanistan just several years ago and logically they have a stake in a stable iraq i would urge the leadership in tehran to rethink its apparent decision to close the door on this potentially productive avenue for dialogue with respect to the iranian nuclear program however it is difficult to see how confrontation can be avoided if we will not talk directly with tehran in appropriate foras about this and othei matters the stakes could not be higher if diplomacy fails there is a credible prospect that iran will follow the north korean model of rapid crisis escalation including the cessation of international inspections with a wholly unsupervised nuclear program leading in time to the production of nuclear weapons and the dangerously unpredictable regional consequences that might flow from that or a perilous move to an iraqlike preventive military strike with even more farreaching and alarming consequences both regionally and worldwide a proposal that might be suggested is negotiation of a persian gulf nuclearfree zone which would reduce although given the high possibility of cheating not eliminate entirely one of the reasons iran presumably seeks nuclear weaponsfear that it may be at a disadvantage in a conflict with an oilrich neighbor in this context iran the eu and russia with unitedstates support might agree on a proposal under which iran would indefinitely and verifiably suspend domestic enrichment activity in exchange for an internationally guaranteed fuel supply unitedstates backed security assurances and a gradual lifting of sanctions by and resumption of normal diplomatic relations with the unitedstates including expanded countrytocountry cultural ties here it should be stressed hundreds of thousands of iranians have been educated in the united states the people although not the government of iran have democratic proclivities while real power in iran is controlled by the mullahs few societies in the world have if given a chance more potential to move quickly in a democratic direction than iran and just as it is hard to believe that outside military intervention would lead to anything except greater ensconcement of authoritarian mullah rule a bettering of unitedstates relations with iran provide a greater prospect of progressive change in iranian society there is nothing the new government of iran or for that matter osama bin laden and his al qaeda movement benefit more from than an aggressive interventionist u s policy toward iran finally a note about arms control if the unitedstates wishes to lead in multilateral restraint we might want to consider joining rather than rebuking the intemational community in development of a comprehensive test ban ctb all american administrations from eisenhower on favored negotiation of a ctb this one has taken the position the senate took when it irrationally rejected such a ban seven years ago the senate took its angst against the strategic
