i totally support what the gentleman in the well is doing along with the colleagues on the other side of the aisle of having this all day and all night special order pertaining to voluntary prayer in our public schools i am happy to be a part of this historic event i would like to point out that as the gentleman knows we had some respected sports figures who were here on the hill last week talking about returning god to his rightful position in our lives we had the redskin football coach joe gibbs along with the dallas cowboys football coach tom landry as the gentleman knows they are certainly rivals on the football field but they are strong teammates when it comes to the issue of prayer in schools certainly they are not alone public opinion polls that were taken recently pertaining to voluntary prayer in schools showed that 80 percent of the american people favor a return to voluntary prayer in our schools and i believe boa that i can safely say that i have never met a person in mississippi who did not support voluntary prayer in public schools our people when we have trouble and problems in our state turn to the bible we turn to prayer we turn to god quite frankly i have never met an atheist in my state or have i ever met an atheist in the congress of the united states in the 18 years that i have been serving here so it i beyond me why we cannot have the opportunity to have a vote on this important amendi 1116 ment this is not the last step this will be submitted to the states and to the people for their ratification but i certainly rise in strong support of this amendment and of this historic event that la taking place today in the house of representatives that we are speaking up loud and clear and speaking a long time in fact for another 18 hours i would say that we want to have an opportunity to vote on the prayer amendment for our public schools i want to join my colleagues here today in voicing strong support on a subject of great importance to my state of mississippi and to the nation that subject is the adoption of a constitutional amendment to allow voluntary prayer in public schools i am happy to be a part of this historic event which will i hope focus national attention on the need to bring back prayer to our public schools this allnight special order demonstrates the strong sentiment in this house for such an amendment last week some very well respected sports and entertainment figures came to capitol hill and voiced their concerns about the need to return god to his rightful place in our lives i want to echo that sentiment washington redskins coach joe gibbs and dallas cowboys coach torn landry are rivals on the football field but they are strong teammates when it comes to the issue of prayer in schools they are not alone according to public opinion polls more than 80 percent of the american people favor a return to voluntary prayer in public schools i have never met a person in mississippi that did not support voluntary prayer in public schools my interpretation of the first amendment differs from the interpretation made by the court 22 years ago the way i understand it this nations founders approved the first amendment to insure that the federal government would be prohibited from designating a particular church as a national church and thereby require the people to join and support it also they felt the subject of religion should have been left to the state and local communities not to the federal government or federal courts at the time of the court decision in 1962 a number of states and communities did not have opening prayers in their schools shoula this amendment win approval it may well be that many states and communities will continue that same course but at least there would be an option to do so right now there is no option at all because no religious activity is allowed in our public schools and this is wrong the purpose of an amendment would be to simply return to the american people the fundamental right of voluntary prayer in public schools i want to emphasize the word voluntary it would be wrong to force someone to participate in prayer or other religious services against their will i do not think anyone is advocating that but i think it la also wrong to deny the free exercise of prayer to those who do wish to participate those sports personalities pointed out that prayer and othef religious activities would be a very positive influence on young people and they are speaking as authorities on the subject because of their close association with the youth of this country they have had a chance to see some of the negative influences at work in our schools certainly we would all agree that parents should be the main influence on the lives of our young people but it is also a fact that in many communities the schools are the primary activity centers students spend a great deal of their formative years at school and there is no doubt that they develop attitudes form opinions and ideas based on the people and activities they come in contact with there at the present time the students are not allowed to come in contact with god or any other religious activities because of the supreme court ruling 22 years ago another point i would like to make is that passage of an amendment in congress is only the first step in a long process to become part of the constitution the twothirds approval vote needed in both houses sends this amendment to the states and 38 states must ratify it in order for it to become law if those opinion polls are correct and i have no reason to doubt them then our failure to pass an amendment w6uld be going against the will of the people who favor prayer in schools based on that wide support i think the people should be given the chance to express their opinions in this ratification process the first amendment says congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof it is my opinion that the majority of americans are being denied that free exercise of religion by not having the opportunity to observe religious activities in public schools i am proud to stand up and voice my support for a constitutional amendment on voluntary prayer in public schools i think i speak for the majority of mississippians when i say let us pass a voluntary

retirement solvency act and i would like to begin by commending my colleagues on the energy and commerce committee and the ways and means committee and especially the leadership of these committees for their prompt action on this vitally important legislation over the past half year scarcely a day has gone by when i have not found several letters on my desk sent by railroad retirees in my district the handwriting on these letters varied the postmarks on the envelopes variedbut there was one message that came through every last one of these letters in letter after letter they made their plea these railroad retirees told me how hard it already was for them to make ends meet they told me how important their annuities werehow they and their families were counting on these annuity checks to pay the bills buy the groceries and keep a roof over their heads they asked me to do everything in my power to help keep their benefits safe and to prevent these crippling cuts in their benefits and for every last one of these railroad retirees who listens for the news each day waiting to find out whether his benefits will be cut for every last one of these retirees who has such a reasonable demand to make i would like to present their message to the unitedstates congress there are parts of this legislation which some of my colleagues might like better than others i know some of my colleagues are concerned about the dual benefits and other longterm problems in the system and there are many of us who would have preferred to have avoided tax increases on these benefits or raising the retirement age to qualify for full benefits but on behalf of my constituents constituents who probably would not be able to keep body and soul together if they were to suffer a 40 percent cut in their annuities i urge you to bury your differences and to adopt the legislation we have before us today the committees have done a good job in working with labor and management to develop a compromise solution and it is the only way we have to prevent a devastating cut in retirement benefits and across our land there are 1 million yes that is 1 million railroad retirees who are waiting for us to do the responsible and right thing and save their benefits i would also like to point out to my colleagues that railroad retirement benefits are not giftsthey are benefits which have been earned by our retirees by hard work over the course of many years and if they were to suffer that 40 percent cut it would be through no fault of their own the primary cause of the financial problems facing the railroad retirement system stems from the recessionwhich has led to a drop in railroad employment from 510 000 in august of 1981 to 388 000 as of last january this drop in employment has meant that fewer workers were paying into the fund so tax revenues flowing into the retirement system have been dropping making the problem worse with the hard times more workers have decided to retire early so we have been paying more out from the fund for benefits and for all these reasons along with the depletion of the fund for unemployment benefits the retirement fund has been drawn down to dangerous levels until we have reached the point where there would not be enough money to pay for the benefits in fiscal year 1984 unless we take strong legislative action and the bill before us today is the strong action we need to save railroad retirement benefits from mccreary county to pulaski county from harlan county to whitley county railroad retirees in my district have sent me a message which i would like to repeat to my colleagues here today railroad retirement benefits have been earned by our retirees railroad retirement benefits are needed by our retirees and railroad retirement benefits should be protected by our congress i urge my colleagues to join with me today in taking the fair and responsible action we need to take and vote in favor of the railroad

power to be granted only as a means to further the public good suich a privilege requires special safeguards to assure that the publics legitimate interests are protected h r 1010 is deficient in

deficient from a public policy standpoint in many ways but i will only touch upon two areas in which i have taken a special interest namely the question of water resources and the use of takeorpay contracts to begin with slurry pipelines are a dubious use of scarce water supplies h r 1010 compounds this initial concern by its delegation of commerce clause power to the individual states by not having in place a consent mechanism for interstate water that is exported for use outside a particular state h r 1010 fosters the sale of water to serve shortterm parochial interests at the expense of other affected states and the national interest assurances of protecting traditional water uses ring hollow when faced with the fact that many areas have neither allocation agreements or water compacts the sweeping use of the commerce clause powers in h r 1010 combined with the provisions of section 3 overriding state or federal law in conflict with this water language only compounds the problems we face in carrying out a sound water policy at the state and federal level there is considerable concern among many members including representative iiammerschmidt and myself on the question of the use by one state of water for coal slurry from a multistate water source we intend to offer an amendment to rectify this matter unless we address this question we are insuring ourselves heightened confrontation by states that share a common water source when i offered an amendment during interior committee markup on take or pay contracts it was labeled by slurry proponents as a

take or pay contracts but slurry proponents blissfully ignore this in their claim that longterm take or pay contracts are necessary for the financing of a slurry pipeline now besides the anticonsumer aspects of take or pay what does this say about the competitiveness of slurry pipelines if they need take or pay on a longterm basis to survive they can hardly wait to leverage the financing on utility consumers these bannerwaving free enterprisers quickly forget about risk taking when the opportunity presents itself to let electric rate payers carry the risk for them slurry proponents claim they want competition but once they get longterm take or pay contracts they have effective y locked out competition they will have a closed captive market it is interesting to note that one of the proponents of this legislation the consumer federation of america has changed its view on the use of take or pay contracts with coal slurry pipelines and i want to publicly commend them for that
