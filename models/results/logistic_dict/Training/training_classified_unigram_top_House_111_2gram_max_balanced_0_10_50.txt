reinvestment plan will do just that the 825 billion recovery package that we will vote on this week will create or save an estimated 4 million jobs and will make key investments in our future first and foremost the economic recovery package focuses on blunting the effects of the recession and helping families in need by increasing food stamps for some 30 million americans expanding unemployment benefits and preserving health care benefits our plan protects health care coverage for nearly 20 million americans during this recession by increasing the federal medicaid assistance percentage fmap so that no state has to cut eligibility for medicaid and schip the childrens health insurance program because of budget shortfalls i am encouraged that in my home state of new york where we have an unemployment rate of 7 percent the state would qualify for an additional 6 percent fmap on top of the 4 9 percent base fmap increase for a total of 10 9 percent resulting in roughly 10 4 billion over nine quarters this is critical funding for our state which is seeing an increase in caseloads as a result of the recession we will also provide health care coverage for nearly 8 5 million americans through a tax credit that would allow newly uninsured and unemployed americans to keep their health insurance through cobra as well as a new option in medicaid for low income people who lack access to cobra the recovery plan also invests in important needs that have been neglected over the past 8 years americas schools roads bridges and water systems are in disrepair and this is creating a drag on

interest to people yesterdayim thinking of the election of massachusettsstill remains the question of health care there is discussion with the new political realignments that it may be that the house will take up and just pass the bill that was passed by the senate that is one possibility which then of course would require the bill not to have to go back to the senate and so we come back to this question of health care in america something that has a lot of peoples attention its not the top priority i think for many people i think many people are worried about unemployment theyre worried about the economy theyre worried about excessive government spending theyre worried about terrorism and national security but underneath those perhaps there is still some concern about health care but particularly a fear that in an attempt to try to solve a problem we may make a bad situation worse indeed when government does too much we have found that we sometimes get some very bad side effectsinferior quality inefficient allocation of goods bureaucratic rationing and of course excessive expenses now if health care is expensive now just wait until its free some have said we were promised by our president heres what you need to know first i will not sign a plan that adds one dime to our deficits either now or in the future sounds pretty definitive it sounds like he says hey i understand about the deficit i understand about the debt i understand about excessive spending and i am not going to add one dime to our deficit well the bill thats being proposed does not add a dime so i guess technically this statement is correct it adds rather either one or several trillion dollars that may be a whole lot worse than the dime so this particular statement along with some others that weve heard is not really precise in terms of what has been proposed particularly the senate and the house versions that we have seen in order to try to put a package together there have been some compromises made as tends to happen when youre writing large and complex pieces of legislation this protects insurance companies in kind of an odd way the legislation that is being considered in the senate preserves the legal immunity of large insurance companies in the event of negligence or any other wrongful action even if their action results in injury or death of a patient now this is the language thats in the bill what does that really mean what it means is something that i think most americans consider to be very undesirable and that is you walk in and you feel sick and you go see your doctor you trust your doctor youve known your doctor for some period of time and so you have the doctor take a look he runs some tests and he says well now congressman akin this is the news youve got this this and this and i recommend we do this and you check with him ask a bunch of questions and say good that seems like a good course of action now heres where the train comes off the tracks your insurance company says but we dont really think thats necessary were not that concerned about you congressman akin and your doctor well you know hes probably being pretty cautious but hes also being pretty expensive and so were going to say you really dont need to go to the hospital for this were going to recommend you just stay home for a while and take some aspirin and see what develops now thats what we call something or somebody getting in the way of the doctorpatient relationship in this country we have gotten spoiled we have enjoyed contact with our doctors we have enjoyed the process of getting to know the doctors and trusting them and soliciting their opinion at times we get multiple opinions from different doctors just to make sure but we dont want some insurance company coming between the patient and the doctor thats pretty bad when that happens whats worse is when the government comes between you and your doctor thats what a fullborn socialized medicine bill will do this bill here says that these insurance companies can basically secondguess the doctors and if things go wrong guess what they have no liability is that what we want in health care reform i dont think so doctors can be sued if they make a bad diagnosis but not insurance companies even when they get in between the patient and the doctor is that something we want in a health care bill i dont think so and thats one of the reasons why a lot of americans dont want this massive government takeover to pass because it has these little loopholes like this in it i dont think many of you would have known that that was in the bill and yet it is there are also some other problems we have a bill when you start to get thousands of pages of legislation there is a lot of room for mistakes and an awful lot of creation of bureaucracy i dont know what the latest version of this is because a lot of this is negotiated behind closed doors but were talking about close to a 2 000page bill passed with i dont know how many hours of public review72 hours would be nice im not so sure well have that we have not had that on other major pieces of legislation this particular bill creates 118 new boardsthat sounds like some bureaucracy doesnt itcommissions and programs full of new mandates one of the things in legislation that people who are legislators pay attention to is how many you musts and you shalls and youve got tos there are in a bill this one contains the word shall 3 425 times obviously somebody has very strong opinions about what other americans ought to do and theyre going to mandate it and so you have here quite a large bill many many pages 3 425 shalls 118 new boards we tried to draw a picture of what that would look like now you know they say a picture is worth a thousand words i dont know if this picture is worth 1 000 or 2 000 pages but this is an attempt at drawing a picture of what weve got and the more you look at it the more you look at all these colored boxes which are some of the new agencies and all it starts to look more and more like some sort of a maze and you kind of wonder whether whats going on is the consumers or people who are sick are somehow trying to get across this maze to find their doctor its almost like something you would be given at a restaurant with a crayon and youre supposed to plot the path if youre a patient to somehow get over to see the doctor but this is the kind of complexity that is being created by what has been proposed over the last 7 or 8 months by the democrats the reason this is so complicated is because of the overall strategic approach that health care started and that was the idea that were going to take what we have and pretty much pitch it and were going to redesign the whole thing and put the government in charge of it so were not going to go in and fix this or that thats broken were going to basically scrap it and start over consequently the result is a very complicated piece of legislation for the government to try to take over what is essentially close to onefifth of the unitedstates economy so thats one of the things that people are concerned with and one of the reasons why not so much based on political party but just based on good old american commonsense there is a concern for the complexity and of course the cost associated with that complexity we dont like mandates a whole lot americans tend to be a little bit freewheeling and theyre not too much into following all the dots and tittles and all the little nuances of laws and rules americans like to have some freedom a little bit of elbow room a little flexibility so when were talking about the mandate were saying here theres mandates in this bill all those shalls come into things that restrict your freedom one of the mandates is that employers must offer a qualified health care plan to full and parttime employees so were saying to companies we dont care what you think is good for your employees and we dont really care what your employees think is good for them what were going to do is tell you how its got to be and so we are going to write what your health care plan has to look like and then mr employer you have to offer what were writing up for you to your employees that is an interesting approach we think of it in terms of the idea of a topdown big government solution because the government is going to tell you what you need whether you think you know what you need doesnt make any difference its going to be a topdown status mandate and you will pay for 65 to 72 percent of the cost of the plan so were going to tell you what kind of plan youre going to offer by the way youre going to pay for it and if you dont pay for it were going to penalize you and were going to hit you with a tax of up to 8 percent of your payroll costs so whoever you are even fairly small businesses you know in terms of what the cutoff is in this youre going to get hit with 8 percent of your payroll taxes in fact if you have 100 employees if 99 of them want this qualified plan and one does not the way the bill is written is that youre going to end up paying this 8 percent because everybody has to agree to what the government has mandated so there are some mandates in here which from a small business point of view are considered fairly onerous its another thing which makes the bill offensive and not popular now one of the concerns is when the government takes something over it tends to cost money the president said its not going to cost a dime i suppose thats true its supposed to cost over 1 trillion but there are a lot of hidden costs you see you bury the costs of some things that you dont want to show trying to keep it under 1 trillion was a tough thing to do 1 trillion is a fair amount of money even for the unitedstates federal government 1 trillion is a lot of money we spent about 1 4 trillion last year that was about what our level of debt was 1 4 trillion the highest debt that wed had before that was under president bush in 2008 during the pelosi congress here in 2008 we had just south of 500 billion in deficit spending that year so if deficit spending of 400 andwhatever it is50 or 60 billion was a lot 1 4 trillion in deficit spending was a considerable amount so our deficit in 09 tripled from 08 and it was a 1 trillionplus 1 5 trillion well here is 1 trillion for this little plan this is not small if youre worried about federal spending the estimate here is its going to raise taxes 729 billion if we got away with that few in tax increases we might be doing well it increases the longterm cost of medical care by 289 billion again i think those are conservative estimates it creates shortages higher costs more regulations more patients and a fixed supply of medical professionals this is part of the cms report cms is a group of staffers who are not connected with a political party they take a look at legislation and they try to come up with what the costs are and how its going to work of course theres a lot of argument about what they count and about what they dont count but things like creating shortages and also considerable amounts of unemployment are expected to come from this because if you mandate that businesses spend a lot of money what happens is it means their employees are going to cost more if their employees are going to cost more theres an incentive for them to get rid of some employees and to run the employees they have for longer hours that reduces their costs which of course increases unemployment so this bill will affect unemployment which is another reason people are not very pleased with it and are disappointed in the bill there is an inefficiency and an expense here which is quite considerable there is another mandate this is one on individuals it says that individuals must buy acceptable health insurance coverage now guess who defines what health insurance coverage is acceptable if youre an individual citizen of the united states is it the individual citizen is it the 22yearold who says i cant afford health insurance right now and im very healthy and im making the decision not to get health insurance is he the one who decides what acceptable health insurance coverage is of course the answer is no the answer is that the federal government knows what you need better than you do so the federal government is going to mandate that you have this coverage and theyre going to tell you what kind of coverage it is and youve got to buy it now this raises kind of an interesting legal point which is if the government mandates that you have something or that you buy something is that not really essentially a tax increase when you mandate that somebody has to buy a particular product is that something that the federal government should be doing in this particular area is it even constitutional when it is a mandate is it not just essentially a tax increase or pay an additional 2 5 of your income in taxes so now youre going to have a choice you can either buy the insurance that we know is best for youbig brother governmentor you can pay a fine or face criminal penalties including jail time and severe fines if you dont get in line with what we know is best for you who is we oh we just saw a picture of the we didnt we here is the we we know whats best for you all of this matrix of bureaucracy this matrix run by the federal government really knows whats good for you and so were going to tell you what it is that you have to buy youve got to buy the insurance we tell you youve got to buy otherwise youll face criminal penalties including jail time how do you think that goes over with a lot of freedomloving americans well not very good i think some of the election results that weve seen in the last number of months reflect the fact that people are not that comfortable with washington d c big governmentplaying god in everybodys lives thats one of the concerns and why this is not particularly popular i notice that we have joining us this evening a doctor somebody who has spent years in the health care profession and who has really been in the middle of it as to providing that doctorpatient relationship he knows the subject far better than this poor old engineer does and i would like to yield some time to my good friend who has just joined me on this health care topic i was just running through some of the reasons why people arent that excited about this big government takeover of health care and why youre seeing a lot of people voting saying im not sure were on the right track with this i yield to the gentleman from tennessee"], [9.356487134937197e-05, 9.356487134937197e-05, 0, "thank you good evening its a pleasure to be able to join you i had a chance to listen in on some of the last hour presented by the democrats and their views on the economy it seemed like a fair amount of sophistry to me and a lot of excuses it would seem like were blaming things on bush and the chinese so i am going to be presenting and maybe even have some guests here presenting a different perspective on the economy and the american people will be the judge of that debate and discussion in november now i would suggest that the democrats and their policies are actually destructive to the economy i dont think its a coincidence that if you look at the 10 cities in america that have the highest percentage of people below the poverty level that those cities have been managed every one of them for many years by democrats now you can blame the chinese and you can blame president bush but i would suggest and i will show in the next hour in plain simple terms why the democrat policies are literally destroying the economy now you could say well i dont like that or maybe youre being partisan im not really quite so concerned about being partisan or whether we like things politically im concerned with america im concerned with the people that dont have jobs and im concerned that not only are we creating unemployment but we are systematically destroying the businesses that can create employment in the future lets take a look at these questions those are strong charges to say that the democrats are the ones that are actually responsible for whats been going on i think a lot of americans have some sense that that may be true sometimes its fun to take a look at some of these political cartoons we have the president here now talking to the guy that owns the china shop now give me one good reason why youre not hiring and you have health care reform storming in and capandtax or capandtrade and the taxes that are impending and all the point of the cartoon of course is the fact that the policies that we have seen are creating the unemployment lets look at that again just a little bit closer now when we talk about the economy there are different ways of measuring it you can see well is wall street doing well am i doing well am i happy with my job or are things going comfortably for me is there a lot of employment or unemployment those are measures that we use we take a look also at the rate of the federal government how much its spending money versus how much its having to borrow those are all things when we say the economy what does that mean but particularly its very personal when we talk about unemployment and it becomes not a political issue but a personal issue when its your job that was just lost we were told that we had to come up with this economic stimulus bill last year we were told that if you dont pass this economic stimulus bill this unemployment could get above where it is now its going up could get above but if you dont pass it why we could have 9 percent unemployment if you dont pass this stimulus bill and so the democrats all by themselves passed this 800 billion bill to supposedly stimulate the economy after they passed it what happened well now weve got this unemployment here at 9 7 percent the numbers vary but were pretty close to 10 but that 10 percent is very conservative because if youve lost your job more than a year ago you dont get to count in the statistics anymore so in fact the unemployment rate is well over 10 percent in america now we were told that if you passed the stimulus bill that we could keep it underneath 8 percent thats the words that the democrats brought to this floor a year ago the fact is they were wrong anybody can see theyre wrong just take a look at what the unemployment numbers are and they dont bear it out in fact they spent 800 billion and where did it all go did it go for a lot of projects or was it just more bailouts in fact it turned out that it had a lot of bailout money in it that didnt really go for even things that fdr would have considered an economic stimulus package this is whats going on weve got a high level of unemployment the stimulus package that was passed here and the democrats said the republicans didnt help any theyre right they didnt because we didnt think that stimulus package would work we stood here on the floor i stood here on the floor on a time just like this on a wednesday night and said its not going to work but they did it anyway and now we can see it didnt work and now what are they going to do well they want to do some more stimulus packages is it going to work no because its based on faulty economics it will never work the interesting thing is they should have really listened to the secretary of the treasury under fdr henry morgenthau he tried the same thing this was back in the 1930s he said weve tried spending money to try and get the economy going weve spent and spent now were in a tremendous amount of debt and unemployment hasnt changed a bit he said it does not work to this house ways and means committee henry morgenthau way before i was born he was saying it doesnt work yet here we go were doing it again now lets take a look more specifically at what the democrat policies are that are in conflict with creating jobs because i would suggest that the democrats have got this problem the problem is is that everything they stand for is specifically going to be in conflict with creating jobs what are the things they stand for well lets take a look at where jobs come from and this is the linkage that the democrat party doesnt want you to figure out its not a very complicated thing and that is if you get a job you have to get a job from somebody whos the from somebody well its a business somewhere you cant separate employers and people who run businesses from jobs jobs just dont hang out out there floating around somewhere theyre created by an employer somewhere and if you create conditions economically that make it impossible for the employers then guess whats going to happen youre not going to have jobs its not very complicated its about as simple as a lemonade stand im going to use the illustration of a lemonade stand to try and hammer through this very simple truth and its very important because the future the economic future the future of families in america hang on understanding these simple principles the idea is that jobs come from an employer and if you harm the employer youre not going to have the jobs and if you do it bad enough as fdr did and you hammer them bad enough youll put the employers out of business and then its going to be a long time before the company starts up and new jobs can be created so lets take a look at what happens lets say that youve got a lemonade stand you happen to have a very fortunate piece of property and a whole lot of people are coming through there theyre hot sweaty and tired youve got the one piece of property where you can put up a whale of a lemonade stand so you start out you hire your younger brother and sister to work there you squeeze the lemon juice in the morning and get some sugar from the store put it all together you get some ice get out there and you have a pretty good day you sell a lot of lemonade you get going at it and pretty soon though you realize theres a whole lot more demand for your lemonade than you have capacity to make this stuff so you start thinking man i wonder if i should go down and buy some sort of a lemon squeezer and a great big shaker machine and ice machine ill hire five or six more people not just my younger brother and sister but im going to bring some other friends from my class and they can all work at the lemonade stand and well make a whole lot more lemonade then you think to yourself but for me to buy that ice machine and the lemon squeezer and all im going to have to have some money and im going to have to make sure that theres going to be enough money coming in from lemonade to pay off the cost of that machinery so if youre an owner of a business one of the things you have to figure out is you have to have enough money to be able to create new jobs now if you go with your plan and you buy the lemon squeezer and the ice machine you can hire eight more people to make lemonade and you can sell it but it requires that youve got to have some money to buy the ice machine and the lemon squeezer youve been making good money in the lemonade stand you can see how you could pay it off in a couple of months but you dont have the money right now and so as a businessman youre saying well ive somehow got to get this money and that comes into a question about liquidity if you can borrow some money from somebody now what happens to this lemonade stand guy if youre running along youre making this lemonade and all of a sudden you say were going to put a tax on lemonade stands and were going to charge 50 cents a glass of tax on lemonade well if you do that that means the guy that owns the lemonade stand isnt going to have the money to pay off the ice machine and the lemon squeezer so hes going to just hunker down he will pay the tax he will keep things going the way they are but he says man this is a hostile environment out here theyre taxing every glass of lemonade i make and so im not going to create as many jobs now i guess a lemonade stand may be silly im trying to make it sound simple its not complicated if you tax the owners of businesses heavily theyre not going to have the money to make the investments to create new jobs and its that linkage which the democrats refuse to understand and it is so obvious and so simple our policies are going after the owners of businesses and were calling them rich guys and were saying youve got to punish the rich guys by taking their money so everybody else can be okay this is the bailout mindset this is the bailout fever that has infected this city it is the bailout concept that the government has to redistribute wealth and when you take it away from the guys that own the business youre not going to be creating the jobs thats just the mechanics of how economics works you dont have to like it i didnt invent it im just explaining what is common sense and most americans can understand jobs come from employers if you destroy employers youre not going to have jobs and how do you destroy employers the best way to do it tax them there are other ways to destroy businesses but taxing them is a pretty good way to do it lets take a look at other questions one like the lemonade stand example if the owner of the business maybe hes making good profit on his lemonade but he doesnt have a huge bank account or money saved up what he will want to do is go to a bank and borrow some money for his ice machine and his lemon squeezer so he goes to the bank and he tries to get a loan from the bank but what we found is going on right now the policies on banks are so tighteven though the fed has released tons of moneythat the bankers are afraid to loan money to businesses and businesses are afraid to borrow it that is not a good condition if youre trying to create jobs because you have to have a source of money for businessmen to borrow in order to get innovation and things going to get the marketplace going another thing thats a huge killer of jobs is if the businessman doesnt know whats going to happen the guy with the lemonade stand is doing a land office business because its 100 degrees every day and everybody is coming by his lemonade stand but the thing is he knows the season is changing and fall is coming and hes not so sure that he is going to be able to sell that lemonade as the weather gets colder now hes got some unknowns the weather is in there well weve got a big unknown and thats what the people in washington d c are going to do to businesses next when the businessman doesnt know whats going to happen guess what in missouri we have an expression its called hunkering down or sometimes people say hunkering down like a toad in a hailstorm well they hunker down because theyre not sure what these guys in washington d c are going to be doing and if theyre going to pass a health care bill which is going to crank taxes way up on everybody thats working for you if youre going to pass this great big tax increase theres some uncertainty there and if you think the economy is really bad and everybody is struggling and there is not much demand because nobody has jobs and the whole economy is sort of sluggish and sitting like a stone then youre going to be very careful about doing anything in terms of increasing your productivity or how fast or how efficiently you can make something because youre saying wait a minute im going to have to make a big investment i dont know if i can sell enough product with the taxes and everything to be able to pay it off so uncertainty is a killer in terms of jobs and then of course red tape and government mandates if you make that lemonade stand test every single glass to make sure its just crystal pure and you have to file a report with the government and with the epa that every single glass of lemonade is certified and has been tested on analytical equipment to be sure what that does is that red tape then makes your cost of product go up and it makes it harder for the guy to run his business so when you do that hes not going to hire as many people so all of these things are things that are going to make the unemployment rate go up in america these are the main things now this isnt just todd just invented this you can see it by common sense but also ive talked to all kinds of businesses i have had forums of businesses and said now give us the list of things that make it hard to hire people these are the lists they come up with its not a big surprise this isnt any kind of rocket science so my proposition was the democrat policies are basically in conflict with creating jobs lets take a look at what some of those policies are because we have examples of them weve been told that all of this woe that the economy is in is president bushs fault chinas fault is it really heres the legislation democrat tax increases we just talked about tax increases the number one enemy of creating jobs obamacare socialized medicine 570 billion thats what that is supposed to be for a year thats a lot of money whos going to pay that money you guessed it its supposed to be the guys that owns those businesses is that going to make for more jobs no its not schip 65 billion the stimulus 7 billion the benefits and other homebuyer credits 23 billion hire act 6 billion total package 671 billion in tax increases is that the way to create jobs no now the democrats dont have to look at republicans to get the right answer they could look at history they could look at jfk jfk was a democrat he understood this stuff he got it right jfk came into a time when there was a recession and he did the right thing he knew what the right thing to do was and that was that he cut taxes and when he did the economy rebounded the democrats could learn from jfk but they refuse to they dont want to hear this because they like spending money their solution to everything is more money and more governmentmore government spending more government programs theyre not listening to jfk they should have they could have listened to ronald reagan but they dont like him too well they dont have to listen to him they could listen to jfk they could also listen to bush who inherited a recession in 2000 and in 2001 2002 and 2003 did a bunch of tax cuts those tax cuts got the economy back going again they could learn from examples but theyre not instead theyre following the same path of fdr who turned a recession into a great depression and theyre not listening to henry morganthau who was the secretary of finance under fdr so these are tax increases does that help the job situation no not at all in fact they harm it well what other tax increases have we got going oh okay not only are we going to increase taxes for all these programs what were going to do is were going to allow all the tax cuts that took place under bushwhich were designed specifically to get the economy goingand were going to allow those things all to expire or some portion of them to expire which means that whatever effect they hadbecause we did move from a recession into some good strong economic activity in 2004 and 2005 and 2006whatever effect they had is now going to boomerang and its going to hurt us in the same amount in the down side as the other helped us in the up side and so the ordinary income the top income rates in 2010 35 percent theyre going to jump to just under 40 percent capital gains is going to go from 15 to 20 percent qualified dividends 15 to almost 40 percent and the death tax is going to go from 0 to 55 percent lets take an example of what this death tax is going to do youve got a couple of guys running a farm youve got 1 000 acres theyve got some good equipment its a dad and his son tragically as time goes on the dad gets old and dies the farm was owned by the dad the son wants to take it overtake that equipment take that acreage and make it go they hire 10 people to work their farm for themi just made up the number 10 i dont think they need that many maybe but anyhow they got some people that are hired to do that and so the death tax comes along and says to the son hey you owe the government because were going to tax your dad for dying we want 55 percent of the value of that farm his son takes a look and says well mr government if i had to sell half the land id be from 1 000 to 500 acres and id have to choose which tractors that i sell i couldnt make the farm work if you take 55 percent out of it i couldnt make the farm work the government says i dont care just give me my 55 percent it may not be a farm it may be a small business but thats what this death tax does thats why we got rid of the death tax because we want those businesses to keep going we want that money to be plowed in and were willing to live with the fact that somebody may be very welltodo and very comfortable and having a very nice life we dont begrudge it to somebody to work hard save money and do well because we realize if you allow that guy to do well hes going to hire other people and thats what creates jobs and it increases everybodys standard of living this policy to allow this thing to go back to 55 percent is going to hurt the job situation its going to hurt the economy its going to hurt americans now the other thing here the capital gains is the same kind of thing so if you keep taxing businesses a lotnow there is this other thing child tax credit the marriage penalty and the average those things are changing back again and the lowest tax bracket it goes from 10 to 15 percent now the democrats may change this a little bit to make it look pretty to people but if you dont deal with things like the death tax and qualified dividends and capital gains these are the things that make the difference in whether or not there are going to be any jobs or whether were going to have companies going bankrupt well you got the message its really dumb to be raising taxes when the economy is having a hard time everybody can tell you that it just isnt smart there arent many people who have been dumb enough economically when the economy is in trouble to want to go ahead and push for the largest tax increase in the history of our country now i notice my democrat colleagues were talking about how bad it is that things werent made in america they said weve got to bring those jobs back in the country how are you going to bring jobs back in the country when we create a set of rules that makes it so expensive to build something here that you have a huge advantage somewhere else to build it in another place what sort of things would that be congressman akin are you telling me that americas got policies that make it so people dont want to produce things in america well yeah take a look at this this is the corporate tax rates of a whole bunch of countriesyou may not be able to read them all down here but this is ireland down here has a 13 percent and as you go down the line lets see this is turkey over here its gotten to 20 percent and lets see where else do we go sweden theyre pretty socialistic theyre at 20 percent then youve got all the way over here to canada and france and that green line thats the united states were second only to japan in terms of corporate tax rates now its pretty hard for me to see the logic of complaining about things being made overseas when what we do with our tax policy is tax corporations so heavily that you create an incentive to chase the production overseas if youre a businessman youre competing youre competing with all of these other countries and what youre going to have to do is be competitive or else people wont buy your product so for us in congress to complain about foreign imports and things when weve got a corporate tax rate thats second highest in the world is once again an example of democrat tax policy being completely at odds with a goal of a strong economy and lots of jobs you cant keep taxing the creator of jobs without losing your jobs i think its straightforward im trying to make it simple because theres one example after the other that our policies just dont make sense heres a chart done in a little more colorful way we compete with france and spain u k and china we talk about china theyve got 25 percent here we are weve got a 40 percent corporate tax rate why in the world would we want to be doing that it just doesnt make sense and thats why our economy is in trouble and if we dont fix this it will just get worse because what you do is you hammer a business and you hammer a business and you hammer a business sooner or later its going to go out of business then its going to be a whole lot harder for somebody to start up a new company and try and put those jobs that could have been there otherwise if our policies had been more favorable now heres what happened when we did the stimulus the democrats answer to this is of course well the government can direct things and make things work and theyll really make it good so youve got to take a whole lot of money away from all of those taxpayers lets grab a whole bunch of money from the taxpayer and were going to spend it in this stimulus billwhich by the way went to pay among other things the teachers union in california because they had overspent their pensions and were getting near bankruptcy same thing in illinois so were taking this stimulus bill taking money away from states like mine in missouri and giving the money to states that couldnt manage their budgetslike california and illinoisand taxing the taxpayers all across america to bail out people who were irresponsible thats where a lot of that stimulus money went it also went to other various miscellaneous projects and all but what was the result of all of the stimulus spending what you see is weve lost 2 6 million jobs since the stimulus started you see henry morgenthau was right its not logical that if government spends a whole lot of money it makes the economy better if you ran your household and youre in trouble economicallyyouve got a whole lot of loan payments that are coming due you dont have enough salary to pay those things youve got some medical bills everything is not right in your economic little familyand you say to your wife hey heres what im going to do im going to go out and get this credit card and im going to spend money like mad and that way we can fix our problems here with our little family your wife would think you were nuts shed tell you to stay away from the bar or stop smoking them funny cigarettes because anybodys got the common sense to know that if youre in economic trouble you dont spend money like mad and yet here we are in economic trouble we spend money like mad and then were wondering how come we lost all of these jobs what in the world are we thinking the federal government cannot create jobs by spending lots of money the federal government can spend a lot of money and they can hire people you say wait a minute now the federal government takes a billion dollars and they hire all of these people isnt that going to create jobs because youve got these people working for the government well heres the trouble with that line of reasoning its true you have government employees but for every government employee youve taken money out of the economy which could have been used in the private sector and when you do that you lose more than two jobs out of the private sector for every government employee you hire obviously you cant do that very long pretty soon youve got more government employees than you do people working in the private sector and when youve got that youve got a country that doesnt work anymore economically and we are rapidly marching toward that point where these economic policies are going to bring a great deal of trouble down on our heads if we dont get sober and start taking a look at the hard facts about economics now there are a whole lot of people now suffering with unemployment but its important for them to understand the principle that you have got to allow businesses to prosper if you want to have employment this is where the democrats should do some reading this isnt too much reading to do for maybe a week or so here it is henry morgenthau franklin delano roosevelts treasury secretary before the house ways and means committee 1939 weve tried spending money were spending more than weve ever spent before and it does not work i say after 8 years of the administration we have just as much unemployment as when we started and an enormous debt to boot how many times do we have to replay the sad lessons of history well i can hear all sorts of things well democrats just saying well the chinese are fiddling with the currency and president bushs policies theyre the ones that brought us all this trouble no its not no its not its not president bushs policies look president bush spent too much money his worst year was 2008 when nancy pelosi was speaker of the house here he had a deficit of 450 billion too much he shouldnt have had in 2009 under obamas presidency 1 4 trillion thats three times bushs worst year out of bushs 8 years obamas first year the amount of debt incurred in that year was three times in 2009 what bushs worst was dont tell me about bush obama makes bush look like ebenezer scrooge hes a mere piker when it comes to spending money you dont have and 2010 you saywas 2010 any better no it was worse it was 2 5 trillion in deficit spending we arent listening to henry morgenthau we should learn from henry morgenthau if he is a democrat we should learn from jfk if you want jobs you cant destroy the businesses take a look at these government deficits thats the number that i am talking about here this gives you a little bit of a sense now you cant run your family that way and over a period of time what were going to find out is you cant run a country this way either because when you have deficits like this whats going to happen eventually is somewhere along the line you got to pay and whos going to pay well that hasnt totally been determined but you can bet one thing when the economy goes bad everybody suffers in fact if i were a happy little socialist and im not but if i were a happy little socialist what i would want to do is i would want to implement an economic policy that made the economy strong because i would get more government revenues to slop around to my friends if the job of the government is to redistribute money is to be experts at bailout which it should not be but if that is your goal at least you should adopt policies that are going to provide as much revenue to the government as possible in 2001 and 2002 if you took a look at the items that the economists would say were the big ticket items of george bush one was the war on terror and the other was the tax cuts and people said oh look at all the money the government lost from the tax cuts so you add the war on terror and you add the cost of the tax cuts and what you find is that the money that the government was losing in 2001 2002 and 2003 in terms of the economy being bad was worse than the tax cut plus the war on terror and so when the economy is bad not only do people not have jobs and poor people suffer and more welltodo people suffer governments suffer too the governments dont have the money and if you happen to be a state governor and you have a balanced budget amendment in your constitution such as missouri you are in big trouble if you are the governor because youve got to do some serious cutting and youre not going to be very popular when the economy goes bad and you happen to be a governor on the other hand if the economys doing well it makes you look like a hero because you have plenty of money for everything and you can be benevolent so when the economy goes bad it sinks all boats everybody including governments as well so this level of deficit spending is unparalleled in our history and its going to destroy our country if we continue along the lines here is one way of looking at the destruction right here see when we have the chinese buying up our debt the chinese are buying treasury bills and the chinese are happy because theyre getting paid a certain number of percent by the federal government for every treasury bill and so theyre willing to sit there quietly buying up america and theyre getting their percent well what happens when we spend so much money that all the money that were taking in with taxes cant afford to pay for what our debt service is this would be the equivalent of youre at home and youve got these credit cards the credit card companies really like you and everything and so your family budget well you are spending a little more each month a little more each month and pretty soon you find out when you add everything all up that you take a look at your credit card debts and the interest rate that you are paying on all those credit cards is more than the amount of money you make whats that mean that means you are in deep doodoo you are paying more in interest than you are getting in terms of how much money you make when the federal government gets to this point whats going to happen is that the amount of tax revenue is going to be less than what were paying on all this debt that were buying thats another way of picturing the fact that these economic shenanigans that are going on cannot continue forever people understand that it doesnt make a difference if you are a liberal or a conservative if you have any understanding of economics you are going to say look this is not sustainable and thats kind of where we are this is social security and medicare this is what their entitlements are going to cost this is what the unitedstates economy is you cant sustain this with this it just doesnt work and so thats where we are i started with the premise that the democrat policies the democrat policies are actually destructive to the economy and theyre destructive to creating jobs and what are those policies one after the other they are policies of increased taxation more government programs more government redtape and the combination of those things along with excessive federal spending basically creates a suction where there is no money in the economy for small businesses and you dont create any jobs and thats whats going on so as i said as i began its not a coincidence that the 10 poorest cities in america the cities that have the highest percent of people below the poverty level have all been run by democrats some for over 100 years and they keep electing democrats because we dont understand the basic idea that jobs come from businesses if you want a healthy economy and businesses youre going to have to allow some people to prosper and just grit your teeth when you say it some people are going to get filthy rich but the benefit of allowing a few people to get wealthy means you are going to have some healthy companies and companies that are growing and hiring people and when the economy does better everybody prospers you got a guy on the street just a little kid trying to make some money he goes around mowing lawns now that kid would he rather be mowing lawns in a rich neighborhood or a poor neighborhood i would suggest the kid may be dirt poor but he would do better in a neighborhood of millionaires because when he mows the lawn they are going to give him a little bit better price another neighborhood full of people that can barely afford putting food on the table theyre not going to pay him much to mow their yard for them so when the economy gets better it helps everybody and when you drive the economy into the dirt then everybody suffers at the same time we may not like it or not but were all hooked together in this great country called america now i think there are some ways we could get a little bit philosophical here i think there are some places where we as americans have to take a look at our forefathers and maybe learn some lessons from them our forefathers bled and died and sacrificed greatly for freedom their understanding of freedom was maybe a little different than the way we are today in america their understanding of freedom was a sturdy independence a sturdy character of hard work and wise decisionmaking honest business transactions courteousness a sense of neighborhood and community service it was so many things that i heard in an eagle scout ceremony on sunday all of these virtues about being courteous and cheerful and hardworking and diligent and all these kinds of things and that was the freedom of our forefathers it seems to me that to some degree now in america weve started to adopt an idea of freedom that it means that anybody can do anything they want regardless of whether its very smart to do or not and when things dont go well we just want the government to come and bail us out thats what i call bailout fever i dont think thats the freedom of our forefathers i dont think the idea is instead of saving for your retirement that you go out and buy the ski boat or whatever it is that you dont really have money to buy you buy it on credit and you buy a house too big for what you can afford and then when things dont go right we say im a victim those rich somebody or others did this to me it was george bushs fault no it was the chineses fault no its not my fault that i spent all that money on the ski boat thats not freedom thats not being responsible freedom doesnt mean do whatever you want to do and expect the government or somebody to bail you out and blame someone else it doesnt mean you are dependent on the government or other people freedom means that you have a right to certain basic inalienable rights the inalienable right of life to be alive so people dont kill you and liberty so you have a right to free speech to share with your neighbor what you think the truth is and to share your opinions to be able to get in a town hall meeting and challenge people and say where did you spend that money and why did we do that we call it free speech and to pursue happiness to pursue happiness that means whatever gifts god gave you whatever desires or interest that you can pursue that career and you can succeed or you can fail based on whether or not you made good decisions based on your being responsible when the founders a couple of hundred years ago used the word government when they talked about government they did not think about capitol domes they did not think about washington d c they thought about the government that a man exercises over his own life whether he was honest hard working trustworthy whether he was friendly whether he was a good citizen in the community that was the use of the word government today we tend to think of government in terms of capitol domes we need to get back to the traditional view of things in america and not look at freedom as license to do things that are irresponsible and then ask big brother government to come pick up the pieces because the government cant afford to do that anymore recent statistics have just come out i think it was the front page of the wall street journal saying that in a good number of households in america almost half of them there is someone in the household thats getting government bailout of some kind some type of government subsidy now obviously if you keep doing that more and more there is going to come a point where it doesnt work and thats what all of these graphs and charts are showing that you cant continuously have the federal government spend more and more money without the wheels falling off of everything we have come to that point and the point has to be turned around not even so much by people in washington d c it has to be turned around by the good citizens of america that look back to the strong parts of our past that have made america such a unique nation a totally unique nation in the history of the world and we have to go back to those virtues and that selfgovernment thats necessary to rebuild this country america was built by these crazy people that came here with all these crazy ideas they didnt know what cant meant they didnt know what i cant do it meant they just tried some dream became a vague possibility then possibility and then eventually that dream became reality and america was built one dream at a time it became so common we gave it a name we called it the american dream it was a phenomenon of freedom of citizens being able to be free to succeed or fail without all kinds of government red tape without excessive government taxation without bureaucrats looking over your shoulder they could go out and try and a lot of them failed there was one guy his name was edison he failed a lot he was trying to make light bulbs he made a hundred of them every one of them didnt work when he got done with a hundred he said well now i know a hundred ways not to make a light bulb and he kept on trying that was that american cando spirit he doesnt ask the government to subsidize his light bulb company he didnt go to the government for a bailout he didnt say his mom didnt give him enough chocolate chip cookies so he was really a victim no he just went back to the drawing board and kept on working and that was the american dream so america became a more and more unique country we came to be the oldest country with the written constitution that we have we were known for going all over the world when there is a hurricane or a tragedy where there is a war where people are being oppressed you find the american soldiers there helping out and people around europe can be cynical but when there is trouble they sure like it when america is around america was different in other ways too and in its perhaps most important way america was unique because we were built on a religious principle we believe that there is a god and that that god granted to all human beings certain basic fundamental rights we wrote it in a thing called the declaration of independence we believe that every individual should have the right to be alive you shouldnt just shoot people people should have a right to be alive unless they do something terrible second of all that they should have a right to liberty the liberty to speak their own to have the right to free speech and to own property not to have their property stolen from them by the government and given to someone else we didnt believe it was ever the governments job to take money from one person and give it to the other that was socialism that was theft that was immoral you had the right to own what you worked hard for and you also had the right to pursue whatever it was that god had gifted you to do if you were to be a singer god would say go out and be strong and do a good job being a singer if you are going to be a businessman be a good businessman treat your employees well work hard be diligent dont waste dont pollute if you are going to be someone who is a doctor go to the top of your profession do a good job take care of people well come up with new procedures and new drugs so that people can be healthy and over a period of time the standard of living increased in america because we believed in these basic ideas these traditions of america but freedom never was a license to take from other people it was never a license to make the government the big bailout expert thats not what our country was built on and if we go back to this other approach it doesnt work economically so americans again in november they have a choice you can believe all of the sophistry and the blame of george bush and this and that but we have seen the stimulus bill and it flat didnt work we have seen the taxation of small businesses we have seen unemployment go up and up and up and people have a sense that all is not right economically at the tremendous rate we are spending money they know that we cant keep on this path and so the choice is to be made november which approach are we going to take i think the approach of our forefathers to have a sturdy hardwork ethic integrity and each person being responsible and accountable for their own decisions and scaling back that federal government i think a lot of americans today believe that in an effort to maybe in a good intended effort to do right things we have made the government no longer a servant but a master i think a majority of americans now are threatened by the government i think a lot of americans realize the government is the problem not the answer i believe those people are going to be rendering a verdict on that regard into that regard there is a point when the government becomes the master and not the servant how close are we to that point how much control do we really have to the machine that is promising so much more than anybody has any reasonable expectation that there is revenue to pay for how much control do you have when the government agent talks to you about runoff of water how much control do you have when you want to look for a loan for your kid to go to college and the government is the only one doing it the government is in the flood business they are into the automotive businesses we have got government motors now not general motors they are in the insurance business the government is going to take over all of health care how much do you want the government to run and how good a job have they done with the post office we have a department of energy thats an interesting department isnt it created to make sure that we are not dependent on foreign oil boy i am sure glad we have got that department working hard we have got a department of education thats a wonder too the government runs that department of education i think the wall street journal about 3 weeks ago said the act test scores of kids that are being tested that want to go to college 24 percent of them are ready for college thats amazing isnt it you have got a government product state government and federal government product where 24 percent of them are acceptable if you bought gasoline and every tank of gas out of 100 tanks 24 of them worked and the other 76 of them didnt work you wouldnt buy gas there very much so we can let that government agency then run our health care is this what we really want in america i dont think so people in missouri had a referendum on that socialized medicine bill and they passed by 80 percent a measure to challenge that in court it is unconstitutional to require people to buy health insurance they be part of this big government bailout socialized medicine boondoggle they didnt want it and i have a feeling there is a whole lot of other states full of people who are tired of the government being the master and of the attitude that freedom means you can do whatever you want and if things go wrong you are going to live with the bailout we cannot continue the level of taxation that we have done we have to start rethinking and it doesnt start in washington d c i think there are a lot of people that think if we got things right in washington d c everything would take care of itself no thats not right freedom starts in the hearts of individuals that believe that god gives them basic rights and when the federal government starts to take away the basic rights that god gives you thats when there is really big trouble thats where there is a clash thats where true patriots stand up and say enough already thats what happened in the war of independence thats what happened in the other wars of americas past when people threatened our premise that god gives you certain basic rights and they got in the way of that thats when americans stood up and they acted today there are a lot of americans that are saying to our federal government no this is not what america is built on our government was built on justice it was built on the concept that people are equal before the law if you are a rich man or a poor man it makes no difference everybody is equal before the law thats not bailout fever we have given up justice and gone to socialism it hasnt worked in europe it didnt work for the ussr and it wont work for us we need to go back to what works and that is people are equal before the law and people are free to take a gamble and try to run their business and if it doesnt work then theyve got to pick themselves up and try again and not complain that they need more bailouts in short there is a reason why there is unemployment today there is unemployment today because it was created by government policies and those government policies have to change we have to take the chains off of american business and we have to go back to the principles that work well weve talked about a couple of very philosophical kinds of things justice which is a very important word justice does not mean that lady justice who has the blindfold over her eyes is peeking it does not mean that she peeks and gives a special deal to one person or another person we have created now with the law a special bill to create a whole bailout section of the federal government so lady justice can peek and give money to one person and maybe not to another what confidence does the individual american have that the government is going to come and bail them out when they need it is the government going to be there do you want to be servant to big government or do you want to be a free person do you want to breathe the fresh air live in the fresh air and the sunshine of being free knowing that you also have to be responsible or do you instead choose the gloomy path of the promise that the government will take care of you even though you know that it cant economically or it will not take care of you well and allow you to live in some sort of pseudofreedom where you dont make responsible choices and you hope the government will take care of you when it doesnt work thats where we are as americans it has to start in our hearts freedom starts in the hearts of selfgoverning people who love god they love their family and they love their country and america is full of those people and i have confidence i have confidence that the american public still has a passion for freedom still has a love for this country still cares about the american dream and wants to live in an environment where they can be free to exercise their godgiven gifts and abilities they want their children to grow up in a better condition than they are they want to see civilization building and suffering going down but the only way you can do that is you have to allow some people to prosper you cant knock down all the businesses and anybody who makes money and expect to have jobs you just cant do that it doesnt work and so we come back as we started do you want jobs lets get rid of all this excessive taxation lets do what every president in the past has done when there is a recessionjfk ronald reagan bush lets cut the taxes that is what weve got to do weve got to change the regulations in the banking system so theres liquidity for businessmen to raise money we have to create an environment where people arent afraid of some new whacky idea coming down the pike and totally changing the business climate we have to create a condition where people have confidence that there will be a stable government in this country which is not hostile to business and weve got to cut the red tape and the government mandates what that means is we basically need to take a look at the federal government and we need to say anything that the federal government does not have to do it has to be just gotten rid of we need to delegate it back to the states or the local governments weve got to get the federal government out of all kinds of businesses they have no constitutional reason to be in and we have to focus on the basic things which are justice we need to make sure there is a level playing field at home for people to do their work and there has to be a secure environment internationally which means we have to have national defense those are the basic functions of justice those should be the functions of limited government when the government gets too expensive you have to go back and say wait a minute lets do the basics lets do the basics well and everything else the federal government does not have to do then lets get rid of it thats where we have to be going thats a clear path its something thats not going to happen overnight because it has to change in the hearts of americans in the families of america in the churches and places of worship there has to be an understanding that its not the job of the government to take care of everything that goes wrong in everybodys life because it wont work and then washington d c will change reluctantly but washington d c will change and we will see a new america and a brighter day and a better day for americans we will see a place where people are employed and excited about their work and where theres a responsibility and a vigor and a vibrancy that was so common of the old yankee that the europeans used to make fun of and once again that yankee will be back again yankee doodle they used to sing about it to make fun of us but as we have seen tsunamis and hurricanes and all kinds of crises around the world they like old yankee doodle to come to help them and so im proud to be an american i know that youre proud to be americans we have to move back to the policies that made this country great and i see that a very good friend of mine a former judge a congressman from the great state of texas is here to join us before long and perhaps he will carry on along these lines i know he is a man who loves god he fears god he loves his country and he loves his family and thats why i love him and so i think the next hour will be exciting and i urge you to stick with us here"], [9.78708267211914e-05, 0.9999021291732788, 1, "thank you very much let me begin my thanking my friend and colleague the gentlewoman from ohio congresswoman fudge for anchoring once again tonights congressional black caucus special hour we are talking tonight about job creation and the economy every monday the house of representatives is in session we hold special orders so that we can bring attention to some of the most pressing issues confronting our country that often really dont make headlines and so i have to thank congresswoman fudge once again for her leadership and for leading these special orders because this continues to keep our caucus and the entire country focused on the critical issues that sometimes do not receive the type of attention really that they should receive and also really puts forth what the agenda is of the congressional black caucus as chair of the cbc i rise once again this evening sounding the alarm for the urgent and vital need to create jobs in america we have to create jobs in our communities that have disproportionately suffered the brunt of this economic crisis and who as a result are in desperate need of targeted concrete and meaningful relief for many months now members of the congressional black caucus have been and continue to be laser focused on stimulating the economy and creating jobs particularly for the chronically unemployed we have sought to engage the obama administration our house and senate leadership committee chairs and our coalition partners to develop a legislative strategy to address the needs of millions of americans who are struggling in this tough economic environment last week we tried but this week i hope we will pass h r 4213 the american jobs and closing tax loopholes act this includes funding for summer youth jobs and emergency assistance for needy families these provisions will target resources to communities with the most urgent need for help over the past several months we have worked to develop a job creation strategy that will address needs of the chronically unemployed and one of our top priorities has been the creation of a summer youth jobs program for americas youth the congressional black caucus met with president obama and we raised the importance of the summer jobs program to address the huge unemployment rate among young people we need this targeted assistance to help put our young people to work and to teach them an array of valuable job skills that they can use throughout their life but even more importantly at this point in many of our communities and in our districts many of our young people have to help their families just survive they have to help pay the rent and put food on the table while the most recent job reports issued at the beginning of may show the overall teen unemployment rate dropping significantly african american and latino teens remain unemployed at significantly higher rates than their white peers african american and latino teens are unemployed at 37 3 percent and 29 2 percent respectively compared to an overall national rate of 23 5 percent these figures underscore the urgent need for this legislation and for the united states senate to quickly follow we know that these jobs and the jobs initiative provisions in these bills will help all young people due to this recession and due to parents being unemployed again our young people have a critical role to play now in terms of just the stability of their families studies have shown also that teenage joblessness has many longterm consequences young people who fail to find early jobs are more likely to be unemployed are underemployed into their 20s and permanently mind you trapped at the margins of the economy so i urge all of us to support h r 4213 and get this passed this bill will also provide critical tax cuts and support for american workers through the end of this year some of the other provisions included in this legislation would provide tax relief to businesses and state and local governments to help them invest and to create jobs provide important tax cuts to put money back into the pockets of working families and help restore the flow of credit to enable small businesses to expand and hire new workers by extending small business loan programs this bill also expands career training for americans who are looking for work it extends eligibility for the unemployed who need the unemployment insurance benefits also cobra the health care tax credits and other critical programs that families and communities depend on through these hard economic times this and sometimes i call it the survival package which is what it is helps families maintain and only maintain until they can get back on their feet and also until we can do more in terms of creating some real good paying and sustainable jobs this bill also ensures that seniors and military servicemembers and americans with disabilities continue to have access to doctors that they know and trust also it closes tax loopholes for wealthy investment fund managers and foreign operations of multinational corporations so we need to consider this bill quickly we also need to look at chairman millers bill which is called the local jobs for america act because many of the provisions that the congressional black caucus has been championing are included in that bill also in the miller bill we target funding to communitybased organizations serving communities with poverty rates of 12 percent andor unemployment rates that are 2 percent or more than the national average we provide for onthejob training for thousands seeking new skills for a new economy in many of our districts throughout the country even if we created jobs our workforce may or may not have the requisite skills and may not have the preparation and the job training for those jobs because they have been undereducated they have not had the type of resources and have been chronically unemployed for many many years and so we need to have onthejob training and workforce training as part of any comprehensive jobs package also in the miller bill we target communities that are hit hardest by the recession and we support programs that train retrain and hire teachers law enforcement officers and firefighters so this bill that we are working on and talking about tonight h r 4213 is building a foundation it is an excellent first step but we must move forward and have a comprehensive jobs bill to invest in people invest in our workers provide for worker training and retraining apprenticeship preapprenticeship programs but also direct investment in job creation efforts i want to thank once again my colleague from ohio for sounding the alarm certainly in ohio we have witnessed an economic downturn that is hard to imagine with the foreclosure crisis the loss of jobs outsourcing the lack of health care i know ohio has really gone through some very difficult times in my own state of california we are facing a huge budget deficit people are being cut of course unfortunately the safety net is being cut and so what we need to do here is provide federal investment in job creation because this ultimately will help us reduce our deficit put people back to work and allow american men and women and families to finally regroup and be part of the

economic crisis we are currently facing this measure will put our economy back on track and will also transform our economy for the 21st century through much needed investments in our health care system infrastructure education and energy independence while saving and creating millions of jobs during the next two years we are facing dire economic times every week we are faced with new reports on job losses across our country in my home state of rhode island we have the countrys second highest unemployment rate at ten percent and last december we were ranked sixth nationally in foreclosure rates these harsh realities have made it increasingly clear that our economy will face an even sharper downturn if we do not act soon the compromise between the house senate and white house is not perfect but it contains the right formula of spending and tax relief to stimulate our economy and increase new job opportunities with that in mind i support taking action to rebuild our nations economy and put rhode island families first h r 1 will appropriate spending for transportation and infrastructure upgrades and construction health care programs education assistance housing assistance and energy efficiency upgrades and includes personal and business tax breaks tax provisions intended to assist state and local governments and energyrelated tax incentives for a total of 787 billion to be expended over fiscal years 2009 and 2010 this measure helps those hit hardest by the economic downturn by extending unemployment benefits providing job training to get people back to work quickly increasing food stamp benefits and extending health benefits the recovery plan provides funding to modernize our crumbling roads and bridges increase transit and rail funding to reduce traffic congestion and gas consumption and invest in clean water and other environmental restoration projects these investments will immediately create jobs in my state as projects will only receive funding if they are ready to go within 90 days of the enactment of this bill this legislation also includes additional infrastructure funding that will improve our national security by modernizing our electric grid upgrading our airport port transit and rail security and updating department of defense facilities one of the best ways to grow our economy is by investing in our future workforce the inclusion of robust education initiatives that will build 21st century classrooms labs and libraries is also very important to me as we prepare the next generation of workers to support and strengthen our economy i am pleased that funding to modernize renovate and repair school buildings is included in the final language it also contains funding for title i programs which serve disadvantaged children and idea which serves disabled children ensuring that all children regardless of where they live or their disability receive a quality and equal education moreover this level of funding for idea increases the federal share of special education services to its highest level ever and brings much needed relief to school systems h r 1 also provides 15 6 billion for pell grants and it is estimated that rhode island will receive 97 5 million in aid for 28 217 recipients for an average award for the academic year 200910 of 3 456 investing in our childrens education not only has longterm benefits to our economy but it also delivers on our nations promise to ensure that all individuals have an equal opportunity to succeed investments in american health care also represent a vital component of our nations economic recovery and long term fiscal sustainability this package contains several provisions that will stimulate job growth and improve health care quality and efficiency through 10 billion investments in biomedical research and 19 billion for the further development and implementation of health information technology this bill bolsters crucial safety net programs that provide invaluable health and social services to our nations lowincome and disabled citizens with the inclusion of 87 billion in enhanced funding for state medicaid programs that have been stretched to the breaking point under increased unemployment and skyrocketing health costs this package also includes a provision to assist recently unemployed individuals and their families by helping them maintain their health coverage through a 65 subsidy for health insurance premiums under cobra for up to nine months one of the greatest challenges we face with this effort is ensuring that we do not repeat the mistakes of the past this bill makes great strides by investing in the transformation of our national energy policy which will lead to greater technological advancements in renewable technologies job creation and energy independence now is the time to make the commitment to our children and our grandchildren that we will leave a safer cleaner and healthier environment than we have now as a cofounder of the sustainable energy and environment coalition i fought for several provisions in h r 1 that promote energy efficiency and renewable energy production and development including tax provisions for families and businesses in addition to funding that will drive the creation of new greencollar jobs more importantly than tax incentives alone this measure sets forth a longterm energy policy that puts our nation on the path towards energy independence individuals and families will also receive relief through the making work pay tax credit which will provide up to 400 for an individual or 800 for married couples filing jointly parents will also benefit from an increase in the earned income tax credit for families with three or more children and the bill allows additional lowincome families to receive the child tax credit the measure will also provide a tax credit up to 8 000 for first time home buyers if they purchase a home between january 1st 2009 and december 31st 2009 injecting a much needed financial incentive into the housing market i also urge my colleagues to join me in my support for h r 1 because it includes unprecedented accountability and strong oversight by creating the recovery act accountability and transparency board which will coordinate and conduct oversight of federal spending under the bill a public website will also contain the boards reports show exactly how funds are spent and will list announcements of contract and grant competitions and awards it is important to understand that this funding is not a silver bullet but that our economy will continue to decline without this immediate action the recovery package will slow our downward economic trend and allow us to regain our footing as we begin to make muchneeded

federal spending for 2011 a record high it projects a 1 6 trillion deficit a record high it assumes 2 trillion in tax hikes over the next 10 years a record high and it estimates 14 trillion in government debt that will be inherited by our children and grandchildren in fact the presidents budget will more than double the federal governments public debt one of the most touted parts of this budget is its call for a spending freeze which is a good idea just like the millions of americans who have adjusted their budgets the federal government should respond to record deficits by halting its spending expansion but unfortunately this budget freeze is merely papering over our record federal deficits instead of a meaningful freeze the proposed freeze in the budget covers only oneeighth of the federal budget that means that more than 80 percent of the federal government will continue to grow under this socalled freeze a freeze that allows the vast majority of programs to stay on the path of unsustainable growth will not solve our budget problems and so this budget predicts another year of record deficits more than one in three dollars spent by the federal government next year will be borrowed with such astonishing deficits and debt we need much more than a freeze on oneeighth of government spending we should be taking a hard look for underperforming areas where we can reduce spending congress could also start tackling our debt problem by immediately passing strict budget caps that will limit federal spending each year unfortunately this looks unlikely to happen also instead democrats in congress along with president obama appear to be dead set on pushing a trilliondollar government takeover of health care and another multibilliondollar stimulus plan just last week democrats in congress showed their true colors by passing a 1 9 trillion increase in the national debt limit making way for more deficit spending after all reckless spending requires reckless borrowing federal spending on socalled discretionary programs increased 84 percent over the past 2 years these increases have been financed entirely by new debt the time has come to stop these outoftouch spending increases so we dont have to keep jacking up the national debt the presidents budget lacks the sort of spending accountability americans want from washington it contains more spending more debt and more taxes which will not restore our economy or help the unemployed in north carolina and around the country find work government growth and exploding debt are just more of the same big government policies that americans are weary of watching in washington while president obamas budget does get some things right it unfortunately gets most things wrong as north carolina taxpayers continue to tighten their belts we can do better than 1 6 trillion in new debt for more wasteful washington spending republicans are ready to go line by line through the federal budget to cut wasteful spending the debts congress is racking up are not going to go away if we dont get a handle on spending and during a time of double digit unemployment the american people want solutions

over 5 trillion to a little over 10 trillion they didnt quite double it but 87 percent more debt under the bush administration that i called fiscal child abuse why because it was not done at a time of fiscal crisis with large unemployment that unemployment was caused by the policies of the last administration why do i say that because under the clinton administration we created 21 million jobs in the private sector just a little short of 21 million jobs 22 8 overall when you include public employment and during the bush administration how did it relate to that 20 1 million new jobs in the private sector one million how did it relate per month to job production 216 000 under the clinton administration and 11 000 per month under the bush administrations thats what their economic policies wrought their economic policies of cutting deeply not 40 billion or 34 billion borrowed money but trillions with an s of borrowed money to fund tax cuts which they did not pay for they werent

country not the little children who are worried about whether their parents are going to be able to afford the mortgage or afford to put bread on the table thats what were talking about in this bill

and they wont be available for the insurance to which their employer and they participated in providing for the contingency that we ran the economy into the ditch the worst economy in threequarters of a century wrought by the bush economic policies to which mr sessions the chairman of their campaign committee says that they want to return to the exact agenda im so pleased i had the opportunity to come and respond to my friend from texas it does demonstrate the difference between our two parties absolutely jon kyl who says we ought to borrow 686 billion from the chinese to give to the wealthiest in america and democrats who say we want to borrow 34 billion to give to the children of america whose families are in needyes that is the difference if my friend from texas wants to make that the difference this is about saying that we have an emergency and historically from ronald reagan to today ronald reagan bush the first and bush the second what did you do when you were in charge you borrowed at times of economic trouble to give unemployment insurance we are doing the same thing why did we do that because we perceived it to be an emergency an emergency that people in the richest nation on the face of the earth were about to run out of the ability to keep their homes buy their food clothe their children a moral and great country thinks thats an emergency thats what this vote is all about this vote is also about as the gentleman from texas has said expressing our values i agree with that and im going to express my values and i urge the members of this house to express their values this day on this vote as millions of people have lost their unemployment insurance because we could not get 60 votes in the senate had almost every democrat saying we need to help now people are running out of ability to support themselves now we paid insurance for now so i urge my colleagues to vote for this legislation a few months ago we passed unemployment insurance through this house by unanimous consent the election wasnt as proximate then as it is today the deficit is way too high and we need to get a handle on it and i just made a speech and i have been criticized by some on my side of the aisle and some others for saying that we needed to put everything on the table i reiterate that today we need to put everything on the table no sacred cows i have three children three grandchildren as all of you will get tired of hearing and one great granddaughter and i owe it to her personally as a member of this house to say ladies and gentlemen of this house and of our country we have a moral responsibility to get a handle on this deficit a reporter just asked me as i was walking down the aisle did i agree with mr bernankes comment that we ought to pay if we extended the tax cuts and i said to him this at a time of fiscal crisis when our economy is struggling to get back from the ditch it was in when this administration took overhow much of a ditch during the last year of the clinton administration we added 1 9 million new jobs i tell my friend from texas last year clinton administration 1 9 million new jobs in america and it was a slowdown period during the last year of the bush administration after the economic policies that were pursued from 2001 and 2002 and 2003 and through 2009 even though we took the congress we couldnt do anything because the president would veto legislation and did in fact veto legislation 3 8 million americans lost their jobs thats a difference of 1 9 million new jobs in the last year of clinton to 3 8 million lost jobs in the last year of bush or a 5 7 million jobs turnaround is there any wonder why there is a lot of pain in america and families are in great distress and theyre angry and they have angst and we share that today does not solve the problem but today reaches out to those folks in distress and say in the shortterm on an emergency basis we are going to continue to give you help so you can support your families in this the wealthiest nation on the face of the earth you worked hard you paid in and through no fault of your own you lost your job maybe because of the fault of wall street that my friend believes we were too harsh on we are imposing rules on so they can play by the rules and not squander and take risks that put wall street profits before main street stability yes

going to say sorry some people want to say sorry that the president of the united states suggested hey you need to help those people maybe helping people is a difference between our two parties i dont

said about the unemployment rate in this country and i saw one other take on unemployment today where it said that for lowincome people below 20 000 the unemployment rate is actually 31 percent which shows how devastating this recession is and for some it is an actual depression i would like this bill to be passed but not just as symbolism it is good symbolism and important symbolism as was mentioned by the gentleman from california it is not a tremendous amount of money but it is important for us to recognize that we have a serious problem in this country and that we shouldnt be careless about the way we think about this problem it shouldnt make us feel necessarily good because we passed this this is just necessary it does remind me of a piece of legislation i introduced many years ago in the 1970s when we had rampant inflation which i anticipate will probably come back to this country back then we had a 15 percent inflation rate my suggestion then in the form of legislation to get the members attention to understand what inflation was all about i said we should take a pay cut at the rate of inflation even today we might suggest that there is a lot more inflation out there than we admit to so maybe not only should we freeze our salaries maybe we should be taking a pay cut so that we can do a better job because we really cant brag about the job that we have done for the country because of the condition the country is in but i would like to extend this motivation to freeze the pay of congressmen to freezing a few other things i would like to see our budget at least frozen where it is that would go a long way to solving some of our budgetary problems and how about freezing the debt level lets not raise the debt level instead this next year our national debt is going to go up about 2 trillion when you add up all that we borrow from our trust funds also i would like to see a freeze on regulations because regulations usually backfire there are unintended consequences they cost a lot of money they act as a tax and they dont improve the economy overall i would be in support of freezing the wealth transfer system the system that most people think is going to help all the poor people the trouble is the wealth transfer system helps the rich people and they are the ones who get the bailouts and the poor people dont so a freeze on wealth transfer would go a long way toward restoring a free society and a constitutional government also i think the consensus of the american people today is we ought to freeze the bailouts lets not bail out anybody anymore but it looks like it will be a long time before that happens because we have a monetary system where we have somebody over there called the federal reserve that says we can print money at will and our job is to be the lender of last resort that means to bail anybody and everybody out that needs money and it looks like that will be domestic as well as international i would like to freeze the ability of the federal reserve to print money out of thin air that in moral terms is counterfeit and yet that is the encouragement for us to run up our deficits because the fed can come in and increase the money supply a sound monetary system would have frozen anybodys ability to just create money out of thin air i would also like to freeze the income tax at the 1912 level and that indeed would be a real boost to the people of this country all of a sudden there would be great wealth in the hands of the consumer just think if all the money that we spent on the bailouts that just tided things over if just a portion of that had been used to get rid of the income tax i think the money would have been better spent because the people would have been spending the money instead of the bureaucrats and the politicians and the regulators that bailed out the people who were making all the money in the first place but i would also extend this freeze onto some other things too i would like to freeze some of our militarism i think we have enough fighting going on i dont think we should expand the war i dont think we should be looking for another enemy i would like to freeze

carlsbad and enlisted in the army after basic training he was assigned to the 27th infantry division the 27th infantry division was part of the largest amphibious operation in the pacific theater the allied invasion of okinawa code name operation iceberg it was during this invasion that on april 28 1945 private ruiz unit was pinned down by machine gun fire from a camouflaged japanese pillbox they were unable to advance until ruiz grabbed an automatic rifle and charged the pillbox right in the face of machine gun fire and grenades unfortunately his rifle jammed and one of the enemies attacked ruiz without hesitation he used the rifle as a club and beat back his enemy ruiz then returned to his original position all the while under fire from machine guns and grenades from the pillbox on his second attempt to free his unit ruiz was able to overtake the enemy pillbox and save the lives of fellow soldiers for his actions he was awarded the medal of honor which was presented to him by president truman on june 26 1946 in a ceremony at the white house it is with great pride that i stand before you to honor this american hero we should all work every day to remember individuals like sergeant ruiz he and the multitudes of his fellow americans who battled for the freedom of europe asia and the americas left the world a legacy of liberty security and prosperity after the war sergeant ruiz would tell the story of how he came to serve in the army as a young man working for a cattle farmer in carlsbad he was told to transport an animal to another farm now i am as familiar with the long lonely roads of southern new mexico as much as anyone is and i can tell you your mind wanders on those long drives that day more than a half a century ago mr ruiz mind wandered to thoughts of a girlfriend well those thoughts in mind he drove straight to barstow texas 122 miles away to speak with that young woman and he brought the cow with him seeing as hed now stolen a cow mr ruiz was detained and the judge told mr ruiz he would either be sent to jail for taking the cow or he could enlist in the army he chose the army sergeant ruiz died on november 20 2009 he was survived by two children selia ruiz and alejandro ruiz jr a sister seven grandchildren and six great grandchildren sergeant ruiz was a member of the greatest generation as that generation grows older and many of them leave this earth it is important that their sacrifices their acts of heroism their accomplishments and of course their names not be forgotten it would be a great mistake for us to forget how the lives we live today the freedoms we cherish and the comforts we enjoy were earned by the heroism of sergeant ruiz the blood of his fellow soldiers and the sacrifice of an entire nation upon
