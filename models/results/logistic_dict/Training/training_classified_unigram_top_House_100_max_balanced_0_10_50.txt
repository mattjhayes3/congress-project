did the research for most of this talk in april 1986 when i took 10 hours of debate in the unitedstates house and analyzed them as a historian trying to understand the rhetorical patterns of the modem left the biggest conclusion i came to is that there is a systematic process by which the modern democratic left ignores the reality of the soviet union and ignores the realityof the world we live in frankly after we finally got done doing the research i put it to one side and did not really think about it very much then recently i read an article about a democrat who said a series of things about central america so fundamentally wrong and so just plain inaccurate that as a history teacher i was intrigued i am not going to quote by name anyone tonight because i have not given anyone notice i am just going to refer to liberal democrats generically but let me quote from one particular democrat this is from cspan the contras are a pure communist group now that is not only wrong it is about as inaccurate as suggesting that the united states bombed pearl harbor it would be almost impossible to responsibly vote in the unitedstates congress on anything if you are notsure who you are voting for yet by definition the contras are the freedom fighters who are on the american side against the communists the gentleman apparently did not have any idea who the contras were although i believe he voted against helping them apparently on the grounds he thought they were the communists second at one time in history most of the states in latin america were communistic that is just not true you can make some argument guyana has leaned communist clearly grenada was communist nicaragua is now communist cuba is communist and that is it argentina chile ecuador peru colombia brazil panama jamaica the list goes on and on most of the countries of south america and central america have never been communist the gentleman was just wrong he went on to say then we had an organization formed thatjust cant recall the name of it now but really showed the value of being a democracy well i am presuming that the reference is to the organization of american states but in fact it was formed largely to defeat nazi germany around 1940 it was not primarily formed for the purpose of dealing with communism it certainly precedes the communist threat to the western hemisphere the organization of american states has a long and noble tradition of being what it says an organization of american states he went on to say there are three different groups down there who form the contras one is controlled by a man named uno the other is controlled by awell i dont recall their names uno is in fact the initials uno for the organization which is one of the freedom fighter groups it is not the name of a man finally i dont think the country of nicaragua has enough firepower in the navy or the air force or their army to fight anybody now that is just explicitly systematically wrong the nicaraguan military the communist nicaraguan military is the most powerful military force in central america so what do we have here this is what intrigued me and led me to decide to do this evenings special order here we have a leftwing democratic congressman who thinks the contras are the communists who thinks most of the countries of latin america are communist who thinks that there is a man who is in fact an organization and who thinks nicaragua does not have an army navy or air force to confront anyone i would suggest based on those factually wrong statements that the gentlemans vote is perfectly correct if in fact the fantasy world he just described existed he should vote for the leftwing democratic proposal to unilaterally surrender in central america but in fact it is not correct i was not intrigued with this passion for leftwing democrats to be factually wrong about foreign policy that i went back and i reexamined the paper i had written a year ago based on the debate in march 1986 i was struck with the old french proverb the more things change the more they remain the same as i go through this analysis which i hope to upgrade in a couple of weeks with todays debate notice how relevant this yearold analysis remains notice how little the democratic left has learned about reality notice how if you do not know anything about the world and you do not understand the factual information and you are not sure what the soviet union is and you are not sure who the contras are and you cannot quite figure out how wellarmed nicaragua is you can suddenly understand much of modern leftwing democratic foreign policy because it combines two continuing facts first it lives in a fantasy world driven by a psychological commitment to avoid reality and second it is simply ignoranti mean the word ignorant as a college teacherliterally does not know what it is talking about i noticed recently for example a leading democrat who is a subcommittee chairman on the committee on foreign affairs was quoted as saying that he had always agreed with the communist party in its commitment to free speech i would suggest to you that anyone who thinks that the communist party believes in free speech ought to vote in favor of coexistence with a group which after all believes in free speech i would also suggest that you have to deny the entire history of the soviet union since 1917 the entire history of cuba since 1960 the entire history of the soviet empire in eastern europe the entire history of what is going on in nicaragua and if you deny all of that and reject all of that factual information then you can convince yourself of the fantasy which the democratic left believes in i might suggest by the way that timothy ashbys fine new book the bear in the backyard moscows caribbean strategy which is just out is something that any member who wants to begin to understand what is happening in central and south america and the caribbean should read ashby goes step by step what is the historical soviet interest in latin america and the caribbean what is cubas role as a colony of the soviet empire how is cuba used as a base for soviet power projections what was the role of grenada and what was grenada doing what is the role of nicaragua and soviet strategy for the caribbean what is happening in el salvador and honduras what is happening in jamaica guiana and surinam how does all this fit together timothy ashbys book ought to be required reading for every leftwing democrat before they are allowed to vote again when you read this the other much thicker book which is the grenada documents published by the unitedstates state department which ought to be required reading for every leftwing democrat because when you read the documents that talk about reality it begins to be obvious just how out of touch with the real world the democrats are let me put it in context the threat of communism in nicaragua can only be understood within the context of the soviet empire the soviet use the communist cuban colonial troops the historic patterns in which leninist factions seize power and ally themselves with the soviet union is the primary threat to the survival of the united states the modern democratic left ignores the reality of the soviet empire it does not understand the role of castros cuba and by interpreting history in its own distorted way it denies the seriousness of leninism as a doctrine for imposing tyranny finally it is blind to the predictability of communist behavior consequently the modern democratic left sees no threat to the united states from the soviet empire modern leftwing democrats truly believe and are intensely committed to their ideology they are committed though on an emotional level not an intellectual level their rejection of certain factual data is a sign of cognitive dissonance a psychological condition not factual disagreement an intellectual condition we will not cure the modern leftwing democrats of this condition thus taking them seriously and debating them intellectually is a mistake it legitimizes their fantasy world as accepting their position as even defensible is anything but a fantasy therefore we must isolate the modern democratic left our challenge is to convince younger americans who are untramatized by vietnam and who are willing and capable of looking reality in the face our strategy must be to highlight the democratic lefts fantasy world and contrast it with the grim reality of the world we see on the evening news let me make this very clear consistently if you read leftwing democratic speeches about the world and you watch the evening news the world on the evening news is tougher more dangerous and more brutal than the fantasies of leftwing democrats they cannot explain terrorism in lebanon they cannot explain the soviet army in afghanistan they cannot explain the massive increase of cuban and soviet forces in a colonial communist nicaragua our goal has to be to convince the american people that the survival of honest people depends on honest realism no matter how repugnant reality may be democracy can only survive if the people of that democracy are told the truth and are led to face tough choices in an honest realistic way success will be found in discrediting the democratic left as thoroughly as isolationism was discredited in bipartisan fashion between 1946 and 1952 victory will be a bipartisan consensus that the soviet empire is dangerous we must go beyond that and build a successful strategy for transnational survival and the strengthening of freedom let me start with the debate of march 19 and 20 1986 the march 1986 house of representatives debate on president reagans proposal to aid nicaraguan freedom fighters is a case study in the political and intellectual divisions which have undermined americas effectiveness in stopping communism for the past 20 years a careful study of the 136 pages in the march 19 and 20 1986 congressional record covering the 10 hours of debate will reveal a leftwing world view which simply prevents intellectual debate on foreign policy the average citizen would find it difficult to understand what is happening in the debate due to the passion with which the left advocates their world view fantasy since many leftwing politicians have excellent educations and are able to use english brilliantly they can cloak their delusions and fantasies in pseudolearning to the unknowing listener their arguments sound plausible sometimes one hears an occasional phrase or concept that seems to be in touch with common sense and reality the extent of intellectual blindness and psychological delusion among the modern democratic left is obvious some members used emotional statements irrational arguments distortions of history and false facts to make seemingly intellectual points in the debate consider the following patterns in the march 19 and 20 house debate of last year nineteen representatives found some way to blame america for the rise of communism in nicaragua ten blamed the united states for forcing the nicaraguan communists to be repressive as if communists are not always repressive four said that president reagan if he is really worried about communism in our hemisphere should go after cuba and the soviet union twelve suggested that violence never works they ignore the fact that it was violence that brought castro and ortega to power in the first place and violence which was the only thing that worked against hitler seven suggested we should never aid freedom fighters against a government that we diplomatically recognize yet these same seven support a similar policy in afghanistan where we support the guerrillas against a government that we do recognize fifteen scoffed at nicaragua as a threat by simply ignoring the soviet and cuban elements of the communist regime six applied guidelines to united states behavior which if applied in afghanistan would mean an end to all aid to the afghan freedom fighters this happened again by the way today if we had a moratorium on aid to the afghan freedom fighters until all the aid was audited we would simply cut off the aid it is fascinating to me that no one on the left has proposed a moratorium on aid to the ethiopian communist government a prosoviet dictatorship no one has suggested that we should not send them the american taxpayers dollars until we audit the communists but those on the democratic left were very confortable in suggesting that we cut off aid to the freedom fighters who were proamerican last year 33 confidently asserted the freedom fighters could not win even with the aid some of these were members who 16 years ago predicted peace and freedom in cambodia and vietnam if only we would cut off aid but we got the peace and freedom of slavery and of death twentysix wrongly analyzed the nicaraguan communists by ignoring the leninistcommunistsoviet system of tyranny that is they described nicaragua as though it was a democracy or as though it was somehow just a group of guys who liked designer sunglasses but were basically reasonable people they ignored all we have learned over the last 70 years about the nature of a leninistsoviet state and all we learned from the grenada documents about the way the cubans train secret police and organize dictatorships last year 16 suggested america could not afford to send 100 million to the freedom fighters yet they consistently vote for more spending on virtually everything else in the budget in fact 15 of them last year voted for increasing the number of automatic elevator operators for congress in other words there was as much money as we need for more automatic elevator operators to run elevators which will run automatically if you push a button but not a dime more to defend freedom in central america two who have consistently voted against president reagans central american policy and helped defeat many of his requests piously asserted that reagan had gotten everything he asked for in central america over the last 5 years again we saw this pattern today on the one hand leftwing democrats do everything they can to block every kind of rational policy from a conservative standpoint in central america on the other hand they blame reagan because congress has tied his hands and made it impossible to have an effective policy two suggested the president should declare war on nicaragua as an alternative to aiding the freedom fighters seventeen suggested we should use american troops if the nicaraguan communists are a threat to american security and i might point out that as recently as today one of the leadoff leftwing democratic speakers suggested that if we really have a problem in central america let us use american troops but vote not to send money to help the freedom fighters i find it a little bizarre that the correct answer is that american troops should go and fight but the local people who are willing to fight for themselves should not be helped last year five leftwing democrats predicted that a yes vote would lead to escalation and nicaraguan communist attacks into honduras none of them would accept that defeating the aid would lead to what really happened which was in fact that 1 000 nicaraguan communists invadedhonduras 2 days after aid was at that point defeated eighteen who opposed the aid did so because they perceived the threat of mccarthyism they mistook attacks on their record and judgment for attacks on their patriotism and security several bitterly resented any suggestion that their no vote would lower freedom fighter morale and thereby encourage communist aggression an extreme example of the lefts isolation and fear of reality was a particularly odd request by one democrat after representative bob walker had spoken the democrat protestedand i quote i request the gentlemans words be taken down he is questioning the judgment of other members of this house the democrat continued he questions the judgment of the members of the house who oppose the reagan proposition when asked if he insisted on his request he continued yes i do because it followed a statement that i just made when i indicated that i oppose the presidents position and certainly by inference he is questioning my judgment and i resent it that is found on page 1212 on 0l 2010 now i would suggest if you look at that that this incident illustrates the degree to which the left now confuses its belief system with moral righteousness and its judgment with patriotism to question the democratic lefts record is perceived by the left as an assault on their motives to question the results of their policies is seen by the left as a smear on their patriotism notice that the man was complaining because what was being questioned was and again i quote the words his judgment but of course in a debate that is what you question if we thought the judgment was sound we would vote with him it is precisely because we think the lefts judgment is so bad that we are systematically suggesting that there is a gap between reality and their view of the world the fact is from a historical standpoint while meaning well the american left has performed badly unable to accept the responsibility of 20 years of failure they deny their guilt the democratic left has been wrong about communism their actions made it easier for the communist dictatorship to thrive in vietnam they have accepted communist massacres in cambodia they ignore communist colonies imposed on angola and mozambique they condone communist savagery imposed on ethiopia and now they facilitate the current communist regime in nicaragua the results of their policies are refugees from southeast asia vietnamese and cuban boat people the desperate appeals of freedom fighters the living testimony of solzhenitsyn shcharansky and sakharov and the cries of refuseniks and dissidents throughout the soviet empire it is little wonder that the democratic left finds it easier to hide in a pleasant fantasy world they blame america first and seek unrealistic solutions which will somehow allow america to live comfortably with the soviet empire and its military bases in our backyard let me quote for just a moment from ed feulners introduction to timothy ashbys the bear in the backyardmoscows caribbean strategy dr feuner the head of the heritage foundation says and i quote what zbigniew brzezinski has described as a fourth central strategic front in the worldwide unitedstates soviet contest has opened in the caribbean and central america never before in history has the unitedstates been faced with a national security threat of such proportions so close to its borders what would have been unthinkable to americans a generation ago has become reality the soviet union a rival superpower unprecedented in aggressiveness and strategic capability has established a major military espionage political and cultural presence in the united states backyard having tested and found wanting the unitedstates resolve in protecting its vital caribbean interests the kremlin has declared the monroe doctrine dead dr feulner and timothy ashby in fact put their finger on a key point what we should have been debating in this house today was whether or not we would act to somehow move the soviet union out of cuba to make sure the soviet union left nicaragua to reestablish american security in our own backyard instead the modem democratic left consistently trivializes the issues afraid to face up to the big tough realities they create tiny fantasies afraid to deal with the soviet empire they create small issues unwilling to deal with literally thousands of soviet colonial troops in cuba and thousands of cuban colonial troops in nicaragua they instead propose that we have cpas and accountants who will magically cure americas problems in the world it is impossible to have a rational debate with these deluded ideologues this 10 hours of talking past each other proves we need a new approach to discussing foreign policy the key to a successful dialog on americas survival and the survival of freedom is to recognize that the american left can be defined and exposed but it cannot be debated we must reach beyond them to have a dialogue with the american peoplethrough the news mediaso they can learn and choose the worldview and solutions they agree with since modern leftwing democrats live in a fantasy world true debate is impossible after all watching a debate about medicine between two doctors is one experience watching a debate between a doctor and an alcoholic masquerading as a doctor so he can prescribe whiskey is a totally different proposition the american left replaces fact with fantasy reality with rhetoric and security with sentiment we are at the end of a 20year foreign policy debate dominated by left wing language and assumptions for 20 years congressional subcommittees in which leftwing democrats have held very powerful positions have shaped our foreign policy consequently their policies have been implemented by bureaucracies weakened and made ineffective by two decades of american military and diplomatic decay and withdrawal from the real world because the vision defines and determines tactics we must create the new consensus in american foreign policy at the vision level first the specific tactical victories will follow president harry truman convinced america there was a soviet empire and that it threatened america only then he won the vote on aid to greece and turkey he could not have done it in reverse order where are we today and how did we get here let me start with the basics and this is frankly not believeable to many of leftwing friends because they simply reject this reality there is a soviet communist empire the soviet empire is based on the writings of lenin it maintains and explains its power and control over its people and its colonies through the communist party the secret police and the military the soviet empires grasp reaches to east germany poland czechoslovakia hungary bulgaria syria libya the plo south yemen ethiopia angola mozambique from the arctic to afghanistan the soviet empire continues to expand its grasp by using communist cuban colonial troops it dominates the mouth of the red sea it has a major presence in the mediterranean it has bases on both the indian and atlantic coasts of southern africa western pacific the caribbean and the pacific coast of north america if you accept that the soviet empire is a threat and if you also accept that its allies are part of the empire then you have to accept that the allies of the soviets are a threat the nicaraguan communists promised the united states and the organization of american states it would quickly hold free elections thereby gaining vital support in their effort to overthrow somoza however since taking power the nicaraguan communists have suppressed true nicaraguan democrats and imposed a cubanstyle communist dictatorship the nicaraguan communists followed the leninistsoviet doctrine quite well they are doing precisely what they should to cement their alliance with the soviets and cubans against freedom and the united states the lesson of 26 years of communism in cuba should be clear castro has consolidated power and trained terrorists and guerrillas who subvert free countries cuba votes against israel and the united states in the un it provides colonial troops for the soviets to use against israel and the third world it provides a base for soviet spying against the united states it threatens its neighbors with subversion and now cuba is training the nicaraguan communists to be as antiamerican and prosoviet as their cuban comrades a sovietcuba foothold on the north american continent is a threat to the united states because it gives the soviets additional bases in our own backyard it imposes communism on people who want to be free it also increases the resources and power of the soviet empire at the time when it would otherwise be decaying rapidly the rebellion of free nicaraguans against communist dictatorship is part of a worldwide rebirth of freedom in defiance of the soviet empire and communism in afghanistan cambodia ethiopia angola and nicaragua communist dictatorships and their soviet and cuban colonial enforcers are being challenged by nationalist groups determined to free their nations both our own security as americans and our moral hertiage beginning with the declaration of independence compel us to recognize the threat of the soviet empire and our responsibility of aiding freedom fighters i must say to stand in a house which has george washingtons portrait and lafayettes portrait and hear leftwing democrats talk about getting accountants to audit the books of guerrilla fighters who are fighting for freedom is almost enough to make one despair can you imagine if the french had had people as foolish as leftwing democrats who said send no money to george washington at valley forge do nothing to help benjamin franklin after all we have not audited the american account can you imagine what would have happended to our revolution for freedom if in fact cpas had been called in by the french king who said oh we cannot do anything to help freedom until we audit thomas jefferson it is madness it is absolutely irrational it is precisely the fantasy world of the modern left which ignores history and is certainly not worthy of either washingtons portrait or lafayettes portrait"], [0.0018591940170153975, 0.0018591940170153975, 0, "that is the peace that we condemned czechoslovakia to that is the peace we condemed poland to in world ii by allowing a horrible document like the munich agreement to be signed the fact of the matter is that when samoza left office was run out of the country and the sandinistas took over there were about 800 or 900 people in their prisons today they have what 13 or 12 times as many prisons and about 11 000 political prisoners so the lady you are talking about this doctor who was a political leader down there who only spoke out for freedom that lady is about 1 of about 10 000 to 11 000 people who are condemned to prison and as the gentleman from california said many times the greatest growth industry in nicaragua is the prisons because they are growing with leaps and bounds so i thank the gentleman from california for his contribution and for bringing this article to our attention i would like to just cite a couple other things that parallel what happened after munich and before munich before munich great britain had a policy of disarmament we have members of our congress who want to have in effect unilateral disarmament who want to cut our defense budget back to the bone back to where we had gaping holes in the military in the late seventies that is something that we cannot tolerate what was happening prior to world war ii great britain was involved in disarmament conferences in geneva along with other countries in the free world in fact all the free world countries were concerned there would be a repeat of world war i so they all went to geneva to have a disarmament conference the united states was a participant france spain great britain italy all of them were up there at this disarmament conferencei take that back italy was not there that was one of the axis powers but litler at the time of this disarmament conference was taking place was involved in the biggest military buildup in the history of mankind the thing that is ironic about this while great britain and her allies were disarming they were selling engine parts and aircraft engines to herr hitler while he was involved in this huge military buildup now what do we see today that parallels that today the soviet union spends 17 percent of their gnp on military hardware and on an offensive capability while they are doing this as i said before the united states is involved in cutting back or trying to cut back by many members of this body those of us who believe in a strong military stand in the breach year after year trying to make sure we have an adequate defense and that we are not involved in unilateral disannament nevertheless there are those who want unilateral disarmament not unlike what england experienced under lord chamberlain prior to world war ii what it led to was a terrible military tragedy now in central america while we withdraw support from our friends in nicaragua who want freedom the freedom fighters who have laid their lives on the line down there we have given them i think a couple hundred million dollars in military supplies while we withdraw all support the last vestiges of help to the freedom fighters in nicaragua the contras the soviet union continues the greatest military buildup in the history of central america so far they sent between 3 and 5 billion dollars worth of military hardware down there there have been thousands of tons of war materials going in there on a regular basis while we do nothing while the freedom fighters the contras in nicaragua are being stamped out and run out of the country this buildup continues make no mistake about it the parallels between what happened in 1938 and today are real if we do not help our allies in central america militarily today by giving them the supplies necessary to fight for freedom then the tryants in nicaragua who are receiving these huge quantities of miltary supplies from the soviet union will continue to export and expand that revolution throughout all of central america and up into mexico once they get into mexico or close to it then the united states will have no option no option whatsoever but to deploy american troops south of the mexicanamerican border to defend what i call the soft underbelly of america and to protect ourselves from having a military presence of the soviet type on the rio grande we cannot allow that to occur and yet our actions today by cutting off aid to the freedom fighters will lead to that eventually because the soviets are not cutting back on their military supplies to the communists in that area and the exportation of revolution is continuing we have found sup11 922 4 plies soviet and communist military supplies in many countries in central anti south america and it goes on and on and we do not do anything about it i flew into a place as i said before called chalatenango province in northern el salvador there had been a fhefight there 2 days before and during that firelight many people had been killed and when we landed they took me in to talk to a captured communist guerrilla we asked this gentleman i used our own interpreter where were you trained he told us he had been trained along with his cadre in nicaragua in a camp just outside managua he then took us outside they took us outside along with this gentleman to take a look at the captured military supplies that they had captured in this fight that took place a day or two before we saw bulgarian hand grenades soviet mortars and m16 rifles that had come from vietnam these military supplies had been supplied to them by the soviet bloc through cuba and through nicaragua there is just no question that the buildup and the exportation of revolution has been perpetrated on the people of central america by the soviet bloc and by the cubans if we continue to cut off aid to those fighting for freedom in places like angola or afghanistan or nicaragua then we will reap the whirlwind the soviet union in my opinion will never involve itself in a frontal attack on the united states of america their attacks will come in bits and pieces through her surrogates in angola it will be by using the cubans to take over that country in mozambique they will use the communist frelino govermuent supplied by the soviet union and helped by the cubans in afghanistan they will use her surrogates the communist government in kabul and if necessary they will keep their soviet troops in there and in nicaragua they will use the cubans and the nicaraguan communists the sandinistas to solidify their position there then they will use the sandinista troops in exporting revolution into these other central american countries as well as training commurist guerrillas in those countries so they are going to take the world in bits and pieces without a direct frontal assault it is not going to be like herr hitler coining across the rhineland in world war ii with a direct frontal attack with his panzer divisions it will be small brush fire wars and we will see the world go communist in bits and pieces we need to deal with that we need to deal with that from a position of strength we must not involve ourselves in signing agreements that will involve capitulation by our friends and allies right now as i said before there are negotiations going on in angola and those negotiations i believe could lead to a complete communist takeover in angola and an erosion of support for freedom forces in that country and the countries south of there the communist control angola mozamnbique and zimbabwe and if we allow them to solidify their positions in those three countries then the entire southern tier of africa will be in jeopardy the minerals that we need to survive as a nation come from only two major sources the southern tier of africa and from the soviet bloc if the soviets have their way by using their surrogates to take over the southern tier of africa then ultimately the united states will have to go to the soviet union with hat in hand and ask for the minerals that we need to produce cars to produce defense materials to defend this country and they will literally have us by the throat and yet we continue to negotiate we continue to sign agreements that are not going to be lived up to by the soviet bloc by the cubans or by their allies i feel we need to realize that we are not just in a continuing cold war with the soviet union we are involved in a real war with the soviet union and it has not changed my colleagues on this floor on the other side of the aisle tell us from time to time that glasnost is a new era the beginning of a new era in sovietamerican relations and that we can trust general secretary gorbachev that we can sign agreements with them knowing full well that they will live up to those agreements that as long as they are somewhat verifiable we need not worry the fact of the matter is that while we reduce our defense spending to 5 or 4 percent of our total budget or 6 percent of our total gnp rather the soviets have expanded their defense spending to 17 percent they are not cutting back one little bit in the area of offensive military capability they outnumber us by about 5 to 1 as far as military personnel are concerned they have as a matter of fact over 100 divisions we have 29 divisions and that does not include their warsaw pact allies they have five times as many tanks as we have they have two or three times as many artillery pieces and then you can get into the other nuclear weaponry and the ships and so on and so forth and in most cases they outnumber us dramatically and they continue to build build build and modernize we signed an inf treaty not long ago that was hailed by our president as being an historic document cne that would bring us peace and take us back from the nuclear precipice the fact of the matter is that document i think was fatally flawed we signed that document saying that there would be onslte virification the fact of the matter is that the ss20s that are supposed to be destroyed by the soviet union are in mobile missiles with three nuclear warheads a mobile missile is almost impossible to verify being destroyed because it can be moved around the country sure they will show us the destruction of some of those missile systems but not all in addition to that they are replacing the ss20s with a new generation of missiles called the ss25 it is an intercontinental ballistic missile that can be retargeted on the same targets that the ss20 was directed at and yet we signed that agreement the soviets build we believe we sign an agreement and they move forward and they use this military buildup to take other little countries in brush fire wars i do not know when we are going to wake up i do not know when we are going to learn lessons from history i do not know when we are going to realize that the munich of 1938 will become very real today unless we start realizing the soviets have one ultimate goal and objective they stated it very clearly in 1917 1918 and 1919 after they took power and that is world domination if we are to survive as a free nation if the free nations of the world are to survive then we must be strong and we must deal from a position of strength we must not sign agreements that give away the freedoms of our friends and our allies we must stand with those small countries those fledgling democracies that are fighting to retain their freedom in central america on our southern flank there are a number of democracies that are very new fledgling democracies that are struggling to survive they are being attacked daily by communist guerrillas who are being supported by the soviet union we have seen nicaragua fall el salvador is in jeopardy as we speak honduras and guatemala are in jeopardy and ultimately i think mexico will be in jeopardy and if we do not help those countries survive then we will have to fight alone we will have to stand up to the communists ultimately alone in central america or someplace in mexico that is a thought that i do not like to think about i think winston churchill said something very similar to that he said that if you will not help your allies if you will not do what is necessary to fight the nazisand i am paraphrasing him nowhe said that someday you will have to stand alone against them and you may have to fight knowing full well that you may not be able to survive you may have to fight not for freedom but just to survive one may fight knowing full well that he is going to lose because he would rather not live as a slave these are dire thoughts that i am presenting to my colleagues tonight but on the 50th anniversary of the munich agreement we need to step back and take a look at what happened then and look at what is going on today in 1938 to a tumultuous welcome lord chamberlain got off the plane at heathrow airport held aloft the agreement and said peace in our time and he would have won the nobel prize as i said earlier had there been one at that time we see in central america a similar agreement being signed a gentleman the preisdent of costa rica president arias getting the nobel peace prize for coming up with this and we are heading down the same basic road that was traveled back in 1938 and yet nobody will admit to it nobody will agree that there is a threat not only to the security of the other fledgling democracies or to fledgling democracies of central america but to the united states as well are we going to wait until all of those countries go communist are we going to cut off aid to el salvador guatemala and honduras like we have to the freedom fighters in nicaragua and then stand alone against the communists of central america i talked to bayardo arce at the airport in managua he told me that their goal was to build a 1 millionman army in that country major miranda who defected from that country who was one of the assistants to the leaders one of the comandantes down there said that they were going to build to a 600 000man army bayardo arce told me that they wanted a 1 millionman army the fact of the matter is we only have 2 million men in our entire military force if they build up that kind of military force in central america supplied by the soviet union we will not fighting the soviet union we will be fighting one of their tentacles we will have to withdraw our support from areas countries like nato and the mideast and the middle east and focus that

figured that after march 3 27 days ago ronald reagan was whipped that he was a lameduck president and that the liberal and sometimes radical leadership of this house had boxed him in a corner and that they could freely ravage across the countryside in honduras and try to capture 22 to 25 percent of their supplies kill 1 000 of more contras and that it would be a deadly blow to the freedom fighters movement and they could exercise their will they were shocked after the perverted expriest put in a call to you to jim wright and they said that if there were any troops in there we will get them out and then you will recall at the leadership meeting on march 16 you said to our secretary of state mr secretary miguel descoto has just called me and said that the troops are leaving so maybe we dont have an emergency then the majority whip the gentleman from california mr coelho said mr secretary although not quite that firmly with his finger in the air we dont trust you we trust you on panama we trust you on the middle east but we dont trust you on central america so we are going to go on tle suspended priests word that the troops are out well of course they stayed in there for 5 days but it was a onetwo punch i say to the gentleman from california not only did george shultz look at our republican leader and look at our excellent national security advisor the threestar general colin powell he looked around and in his laconic style said well we cant even agree there is an emergency so how can we discuss a package he looked at our leader the gentleman from illinois mr miciielj and he looked at the gentleman from wyoming and said thats it you have been told goodbye i turned to bos mcewen who was kind of like a fly on the wall in back of me and i said bon they are going back to the situation room and i trust our guys are going to make a definitive decision well they went back and had the call they were waiting for president azcona the courageous oneterm 4year president who has less then 2 years to go now and they said here is the request president azcona wants our troops down there and even some air which they never sent they did not have to the minute those troops started arriving the next morning they were on their way that night he said the second punch to his fighter pilots at la sabe go get them blast them off honduran soil and see if you can shoot down some soviet supplied hind helicopters while you are at it here is what i want to tell the gentleman and i have told nobody this and for all of our colleagues and you you will be hearing it for the first time listen to this lie i only wish i had time to get a big graphic blowup of the basic platoon leaders map the platoon sergeants map with little squares kilometer squares that is how big the scale is here each one is called a click to mud soldiers here is a map of the whole bocay fighting area from a few days ago here is the border between honduras and nicaragua nicaragua being more to the west than it is to tile north here is the border which is more than twothirds of the border between these two countries remember that el salvador is separated by the gulf of fonseca please look at your globes and others who are interested and see that the only land border between honduras and nicaragua is mlarch a0 1 988 this border and most of it is the rio coco river here comes the rio coco river here is the bocay river a river totally inside nicaragua it leaves at a 90degree angle to the east and then breaks due south and courses through these hills under triple canopy cover in some areas looks for all the world like a tiny amazon and goes due south until it hits creating almost a photographic image of the confluence right here of the rio coco the border river and the bocay the bocay splits into the amaka and the bocay the communist liars in managua took about 30 international press most of them i am sorry to say tragically enamored by the communist revolution the betrayed revolution in managua they brought them up on soviet manufactured helicopters maybe with cuban pilots for all we know because they interchange the cuban pilots with the nicaraguan mig pilots who were trained in migs in cuba and retrained into these vicious soviet helicopter gunships they fly the press to a little hillock at the confluence of the bocay and the amaka and lie to them and tell them that they are up here exactly 1 2 3 4 5 6 2 kilometers or clicks in military language north they tell them they are at the confluence of the bocay and the border with honduras they tell them to look across the river they tell them it is the rio coco they are really looking across the bocay and they say you see there is no fighting in there what they could not have known when they left managua is that president reagans decisive gutty decision to send the 82d airborne and the 7th light infantry down to palmerola and then to spread them out to bases going beyond the socalled mrazek linethe only good thing about the expiration of aid on february 29 was that it cancelled the mrazek line where our military could not help honduras and go within 20not kilometers 20 miles that is almost 30 kilometers against this border but they came all the way up to jomastrung about 17 of these little clicks from the border that emboldened as i said the great president azcona of honduras and while the press was on this hill being lied to looking up at the amaka and at the bocay river thinking they were looking into honduras where there was no activity because the communists had their cp their command post there here come four screaming super mystere jets given in 1972 by israel to the government of honduras flying top cover are two f5s supplied after a tough fight over in the foreign affairs committee where we beat with a tie vote an attempt by two liberals over here who love the sandinistas to stop us from sending f5 tiger aircraft down there our two f5s the only two in the first two delivered we are going to try to expedite the full delivery of 12 airplanes now to honduras they flew top cover just in case cuba managed to send a mig over into this part of the world and the 4 super mysteres made in france the very material the very airplanes that flew and turned the air battle in the lightening war of 1967 5 years later given to honduras aging old airplanes that we have had to do a job on for aluminum rot supermysteres come down into this command post inside nicaragua with their jet engines ricocheting that incredible jet sound up and down the bocay river and they start bombing the command post with the press the liberal international press on scene it must have been a sight to behold one person told me one press guy who is not a liberal said that they started screaming and they were running into the woods they said oh dont do that its mine and then one of the press screamed well in that case blankety blank cursed blasphemy vulgarity get us theholy vulgarity blasphemy back to managua so they loaded them onto a soviet ship helicopter they did not know that the four mysteres could not go back to lasabe because of the weather recovered at palmerola rearmed with airtoair missiles as this is going on one of our great democrats sonny montgomery four members in his party and three republicans our friends duncan hunter of california bob mcewen of ohio and j p hammerschmidt of arkansas were all sitting there at palmerola getting a briefing while this airstrike goes on they recovered back to palmerola armed with airtoair missiles and go hind and hip hunting those are the nato names for the soviet killer gunships and the big troop carriers that they have also put racks on and loaded with rockets and gatling guns they are also like killer tanks in the air and the hip got away with the press back to managua and i am glad they did as angry as i am at liberals selling out western civilization to soviet threats all around the world as angry at liberal press people who think we should cut off the mujahidin groups in afghanistan cut off jonas savimbi and the freedom fighters in angola let these poor freedom fighters in nicaragua starve to death and straggle out like the bataan death march as angry as i am as james burner wrote over the suicide of the west through radical and liberal leftist press people around the world i would not want them to have their flesh ripped apart as one of these hind helicopters went crashing into the ground because the super mysteres of honduras had a right to shoot down these planes that were

that it took from december 7 1941 to harry trumans birthday on may 8 1945 to crush mussolini and hitler and then you had a handful of days until the shooting stopped on august 15 1945 and it appeared that a country starting from scratch with broomhandle guns and tin cans on sticks simulating mortars in the louisiana army war maneuvers of 1940 with lieutenant colonel eisenhower in just 3 years and 5 months and a day we crushed this nazi terror around the world and this numbing effect that has taken us over the last 8 years with the emergence of the communist dictatorship 9 years this last july 19 the sandinistas have been in power one thing popped into my mind when the gentleman talked about numbing members of this congress in recent years created a first in the capital of managua two members of this chamber including the gentleman from michigan that i debated on crossfire tonight who sat in as speaker pro tempore for about the longest period of anybody tonight they went down to managua and kicked unitedstates state department people out of the room so that they could have a secret meeting with the communist dictator and his staff in the capital of managua the embassy people down there told me a few weeks later when i was there septemnber 22 1 988 that they were shocked that they would be told to get out of tile room as though they could not be trusted they usually take notes about american appearances around the world not to eavesdrop i have just been at meetings with communist functionaries in mongolia in the soviet union in poland i wanted the trained ambassadorial people the staff of our state department around the world to not only brief me before i go in to sit there and witness what i am being told to use their language skills but then after i have had the meeting to debrief what took place at that neeting i had a stunning meeting with the head of the entire prison system in the soviet union and the head of all of the police officers 66 000 precincts as he put it in the soviet union nobody in the internal affairs ministry in moscow has ever met with a unitedstates senator or a unitedstates congressman and that happened to me just at the end of last month i wanted the state department people there to analyze this plus to translate for me but it became a regular occurrance in nicaragua the only nation on the face of the earth where we have diplomatic exchanges and recognition of governments only there did members of the majority party liberal democrats go down there and demand private meetings with the communist dictators instead of an incident being made about it on the house floor and instead of secretary of state shultz bringing it before speaker wright and speaker wrights attention calling in the gentleman who is majority leader in the senate when it was robert dole when we were in the majority and the majority leader now and getting to the root of this thing instead because of national technical means some of the dialog that transpired in those meetings went back and forth let me tell my colleagues something in very careful diplomatic language of my own but i can tell anybody in this chamber who wants to hear it off the floor every member of our embassy in honduras top to bottom every member of our ambassadorial staff in costa rica top to bottom believes that a member of the other chamber is having an affair with a female officer of the government of costa rica and is sharing that mistress with the highest ranking people in that government of costa rica and that member of the other body positions himself in san jose and would use air force airplanes and time and fuel to fly individually to guatemala for meetings back to san jose to tegucigalpa honduras back to san jose fly to el salvador and back to san jose to every country in that area always returning to the san jose base so he is carrying on his affair i had what they call a country team briefing i said wait a minute this is important what you are telling me because it compromises this persons integrity you are telling me everyone of you in this room agrees with this do you do you do you everybody on this staff what does our embassy all of them think down there in costa rica they all agree with the same facts that this unitedstates senator is having an affair with one of the high dignitaries in this government female and that so is another high ranking person of that government i am not going to say how highranking it would astound everybody here and this kind of bargaining is going on in our negotiations down there while young american marines get killed when the terror operation was worked out in a safe house in managua and this congressmen is desparate to see the next 12 legislative days go by so that this socalled historic 100th congress can adjourn we can get george bush elected president of the united states and go into gridlock in the 101st congress with a democratic liberal controlled senate democratic liberal controlled house a presidency at least the white house understanding something about the voices crying out for freedom through solidarity in poland which i witnessed with my own eyes a few weeks ago freedom is exploding around this world free market democracies are on the march and the communist dictators around this world as i told them in the communist foreign ministry in moscow you have on the fringes of your sphere of influence what we call your empire as you call us an imperialist empire you have on the fringes stalinist thugs two brothers in cuba named castro and two brothers in nicaragua named ortega and this infinite beginning of a new relationship between the soviet union and the united states of america is going to be destroyed by these stalinist thugs in cuba and nicaragua disagreeing with some of the commie counsel and they are going to do exactly what they want to provoke stalinist terror in our hemisphere and it is going to damage our relations the no 2 man in their north american division of their foreign ministry at the meeting that i had in the foreign ministry after catching them watching money line on a cnn channel that ted turner has given them as a gift when our own embassy people cannot watch any american television by virtue of satelliteat the luncheon at the ambassadors house later in the same response to the same challenge they said congressman there is much merit in what you say about these people on the fringes of our sphere of influence as you call it i asked our fine ambassador there jack matlock i hope you didnt mind me bringing up some tough questions about nicaragua at this lunch and the ambassador said congressman it was excellent what you did these people must hear from american senators and congressmen how you feel about this regime that they are sponsoring and that they are the cash cow for that they are feeding in both cuba and nicaragua i want everybody to be aware that the communist government in moscow in spite of all of the moves tinder glasnost an d the restructuring of perestroika so called they are pumping into cuba 14 million not rubles dollars a day they are pumping into hanoi the communist conquerors of all of indochina 9 million a day and they are keeping daniel ortega floated in a decaying economy with over 2 000 percent interesti mean inflation at the rate of 4 million a day that is almost a billion and a half dollars a year to keep this communist terror alive in nicaragua and i come back to a line i used on television tonight and that i used 3 hours ago some liberal democrats in this chamber are making central america safe for communism and i cannot believe i am an eyewitness to this from the inside out and heaven knows what course we are going to take over the next 12 to 14

students who i have dropped out of their training s programs before they finished then i we would allow only loans for students i in their third and fourth years of post secondary education c a third plan is being offered by proprietary schools owners they have put together a manual for school officials which gives stepbystep instructions for setting up a student loan counseling program with followup activities each of these groups is focusing on this serious problem of student loan defaults but as we can see its difficult to agree on a single solution each approach has some merits and i am going to address them in more detail later but before i get to that id like to give you a little background on gsl the guaranteed student loan program was created in 1965 and has grown to a national program which last year provided 8 6 billion in loans to 3 5 million students during the last 6 years the loan default rate has ranged from a high of 9 7 percent in 1981 to a low of 8 3 percent in 1984 last years rate was 9 4 percent which represents a cost to the agency of 1 6 billion since college costs have been rising at twice the rate of inflation throughout the 1980s its becoming harder and harder for students and their parents to pay with all of the recent cuts and limitations on grants and student aid the gsl program has become i vital for millions of students but unfortunately some of these students are defaulting on their student loans the administrations solution was pror posed last month by secretary of education bennett his plan involves targeting schools with students who are i at high risk of defaulting based on data kept by the gsl program i once the schools have been identi fled the secretary will work with them to reduce the default rates of s their students if the students fail to repay their loans then the school might lose its guaranteed student loan eligibility d shortly after bennetts plan was proposed a report by the department l of educations inspector generals r office found that the default data e which the secretary used in his prob posal contained significant errors and that use of the data will result in the iepartment of education making inorrect decisions in monitoring and nanaging the multibilliondollar luaranteed student loan program in spite of the unreliability of this ata secretary bennett is going ahead rith his plan to try to targetschools ith high default rates if the stuents from these targeted schools coninue to default on their loans then he department of education will ither limit suspend or terminate a chools guaranteed student loan eligiility one of the criticisms of bennetts lan is that the burden is on the chool to prove that it should not lose ts eligibility to qualify for gsl loans eligibility decisions are also not suffiiently reviewed and many schools could be dropped from the gsl program unfairly another problem with the secretarys default reduction proposal is that it fails to mention that school officials cannot easily and accurately identify students who have defaulted on loans because school officials are denied access to loan default information if schools cannot identify defaulting students then they should not be held responsible for their students who default but that is exactly just what secretary bennett proposes schools should possibly shoulder some of the responsibility for student loan defaults but its basically not their fault since after all schools dont default on loans students do in congress my colleagues on the education and labor committee and i are primarily focusing on students as we consider various options to control student loan defaults as i mentioned earlier one of the bills restructures the federal student grant and loan programs to allow firstand secondyear students to receive only grants and no loans students would be eligible for gsl loans only after the completion of their second year but for all students the loans and grants would be provided on the same need basis another alternative might tie the grant and loan programs more closely to family income so that we establish two income levelsa low one for grants and a slightly higher one for loan eligibility for example we might determine that applicants for postsecondary education whose family income was below 20 000 a year might be eligible for grants alone while families with an annual income which falls between 20 000 and 30 000 might be eligible for loans with adequate funding either of these congressional proposals might improve the student loan and grant programs and ensure that all worthy students receive the postsecondary aid they need a third approach to the default problem has been developed by the orhl11472 ganizations and associations which they are helping them become proteach students who have the highest ductive taxpaying citizens risk of defaulting in fact a recent comprehensive this program is called the private study by the university of arkansas career schools default management indicated that even if every student in initiative and it was started by the na the country defaulted on his or her tional association of trade and tech guaranteed student loan the governnical schools and the association of ment would still benefit on the avertrade and technical associations age taxable earnings increase with they have been joined by the nation education so the government would al association of health career receive enough in increased taxes from schools the national association of these educated students to pay for accredited cosmetology schools and their loans the national home study council congress and the adtwo weeks ago they released their ministration need to work together default management manual to with members of the educational and suggest ways for schools to reduce the vocational training communities to number of gsl defaults design a fair and workable plan for reafter the manual outlines who de ducing defaults on guaranteed student faults and why it describes a model loans default prevention program that can i encourage all of my colleagues to easily be adopted by any school which work with members of the education uses gsl loans it is extremely practi and labor committee as we look critical and its sponsors are going to spend cally at secretary bennetts proposal the next 5 months explaining their de and as we develop more equitable and fault management program to schools realistic alternatives the individual across the united states followup and loan

the default problem which gives sound advice to students and could be adopted by federal loan schools involved with the gsl pro agencies gram in light of cuts in government instead of reducing the

millions of men and tivities the christmas party the presiwomen jobrelated practical training dent is throwing down there and we will try to make this as brief as possible today the state department and the defense intelligence agency and the cia released and declassified some information given to the government of the united states by the defector major roger miranda bengoechea who was a very high official in the communist sandinista government major miranda has served as the deputy chief of the sandinista forces the personal administrative assistant to minister of defense humberto ortego and aid to the chief of the general staff miranda became chief of the secretariat in early 1982 the secretariat is the only entity that reports directly to the defense minister humberto ortego giving then major miranda more executive power than the chief of the general staff who is the major general miranda defected after visiting the nicaraguan battlefields where he says he noted that the resistance forces were not mercenaries but compesinos from the local population the nicaraguan resistance forces are the legitimate representatives of the interests and hopes of the nicaraguan people that is the contras he said after being out in the battlefields miranda said in an interview since his defection he also said he was disgusted with the corruption that is destroying the sandinista cause on october 25 he went to mexico for a physical a supposed physical and he and his wife went to the american embassy and defected since that time he has been meeting with our government officials telling them what the intentions of the communist sandinista government really are not what they tell the press not what they tell the people who believe in them but what the facts really are today when they declassified this information i became very concerned and thought this ought to be conveyed to all my colleagues and to the america people some of the major revelations are these there is going to be a continued military buildup that calls for increased soviet bloc military aid over the next 7 years the soviet union sent 14 000 tons of military assistance into nicaragua 3 years ago 18 000 tons of military supplies 2 years ago last year they sent 23 000 tons of military supplies in and this year it is going to be between 32 000 and 36 000 tons it is a tremendous military buildup major miranda says the soviet union has promised the sandinistas mig21 high performance aircraft now our government has said they will not allow that kind of aircraft on the northamerican continent because of the possibility of spying on the western coast of the united states the possibility that they could build up a military force big enough to take over all of central america and up into mexico and force the united hl11473 states to defend our southern flank nevertheless they have signed a secret agreement with the soviet union that will require that the sandinistas by 1991 get mig21 and possibly mig23 high performance fighter aircraft the migs are now expected to come sometime around 1991 or after the sandinistas also have requested more mi25 hind helicopters as if they do not have enough already that is the flying tank mi17 hip helicopters and an an26 transport aircraft the sandinistas intend to build an army and militia totalling a half a million men we were told up to now that it was going to be a quarter of a million men far in excess of all the other governments of central america combined and now we are told it is going to be a half a million man army humberto ortega in a speech delivered on saturday said they were going to increase them to 600 000 men in the military service many more armored personnel carriers selfpropelled howitzers antitank weapons surfacetoair missiles and antiaircraft guns are expected or already have been delivered they requested and are going to get three new 400ton naval vessels miranda said the sandinista commandante think that the only way of guaranteeing the development of their marxist program in nicaragua is to construct a powerful army one can sign agreements one can appear to be more flexible in the political system but they will never negotiate the development of their massive army they know that their power rests in the long run in the size of that army miranda went on that the sandinistas do not have any desire to negotiate the size of that army that they plan to have in nicaragua yes they are going to sit down and talk but after months of discussion they are going to say that they did not arrive at any agreement they are just trying to buy time to kill the contras let them die on the vine i think that is the most vulnerable point where they show the least desire to reach peace in central america according to miranda the sandinistas have continued to support the salvadoran insurgents the guerrillas the communist guerrillas in el salvador in spite of the central american peace plan as a matter of fact he told us yesterday at a meeting that they were giving additional aid to the communist guerrillas in el salvador after the peace accords were signed in guatemala in august so they signed a peace agreement saying they were going to work for peace down there and follow democratic principles and not export revolution and after that they continued to export revolutionary materials and supplies into el salvador he went on that at the request of guerrilla leader joiquin villalobos humberto ortega agreed in september 1987 to provide training in the use of surfacetoair missiles to salvadoran guerrillas they are training communist guerrillas from el salvador in nicaragua today they said they were not doing that but they are in fact training communist guerrillas in nicaragua that are fighting to undermine the government of el salvador they are also exporting revolutionary supplies into guatemala and honduras in october 1987 15 salvadoran guerrillas completed a 35day course in using a variety of surfacetoair missiles the training conducted in nicaragua was approved by the sandinistas the sandinista commandantes this entire weapons supply operation is handled by the clandestine entity known as the bureau which is run by commandante bayardo arce i met with bayardo arce sunday evening at the airport in managua this past sunday he told me that they were building not to a 600 000man army but to a 1millionman army weapons bound for el salvador costa rica colombia and other latin american guerrilla groups are shipped via commercial vessels and arrive from cuba and are stored in managua and are sent on to their designated targets the peace plan they plan to use as a weapon to deceive the american people to deceive the american government and to further their attempts to undermine all of the fledgling democracies in central america here is what he had to say the sandinistas have no intention of complying with the guatemala peace accords bear in mind this gentleman was one of the chiefs in the sandinista government he was the deputy assistant to humberto ortega the defense minister of nicaragua and he brought documents with him verifying everything he said to us it has been checked out the sandinistas have no intention of complying with the guatemala peace accords cuban and soviet advisers have told the sandinistas to talk about democracy pluralism and reform the goal of building a marxist state is to be downplayed he said they the sandinistas do not have the will to achieve that peace they had already made an agreement with the soviets and the cubans on plans for the sandinista army for the next 8 years with what desire then are they going to talk of peace when at the same time in the back of their minds they are thinking about creating one of the most powerful armies in latin america with an armament that few other armies in latin america have we are talking about selfpropelled artillery we are talking about mig21s we are talking about new 400ton battleships for the navy that no other central american country has he said the sandinistas had begun to recognize that the resistance enjoys a base of support in the countryside among the compesinos the real people an important social base in fact it is one of the fundamental facts that permits one to explain why after so many of the sandinista popular army offensives they are still out there the resistance in the nicaraguan countryside is like a fish in water he said plans to invade costa rica honduras and capture united states personnel and property in response to any direct united states military action is a real probability he said in the event of direct united states intervention if we think we are threatened or we must come to the rescue of honduras el salvador or guatemala he said in the event of direct united states intervention in nicaragua the sandinistas would attempt to regionalize and protract the conflict by sending helicopters and troops to invade costa rica which has no army destroy infrastructure targets and the united states embassy in san jose a sandinista battalion will simultaneously attack honduras this has just been declassified the american people and my colleagues in the congress need to be aware of this because many of my colleagues on that side of the aisle tell us that we do not have to worry about the sandinistas going beyond the borders of nicaragua that they promised freedom democracy freedom of assembly freedom of the press freedom of religion and all the things that we hold dear i might recommend to my colleagues they read what they promised in 1979 when they took power which were the same things that they promised in guatemala in august of this year they did not keep the promises then they are not going to keep them now and mr miranda has pointed out exactly what they plan for us he said that the sandinista government the hierarchy considers both the democrats and the republicans their enemies because we both want to end the revolution down there we just have different ways to approach it he did say however that democrats are more foolish than republicans because they are more malleable he said that i did not say that some things i think that need to be pointed out tomy colleagues are what is really going on down there as respects the poor people who are having to endure this communist totalitarian government we were in a town called leon on sunday for a rally i thought there were going to be 400 or 500 people there we ended up having 7 000 i went into a crowded movie theater and it seated about 1 800 people we went in there and instead we could hardly find room to get in the place they hl11474 were waving flags they had a little local band they were beating drums and singing patriotic songs every person who spoke from the local area from the opposition parties said that the sandinistas and their repression was intolerable they were killing the country after the meeting we went outside and we marched down the streets with these people who were waving their flags and chanting for freedom seven thousand people were involved in that little town when they passed the headquarters of the communist sandinista military they were waving their fists and saying sandinistas must go and they were making other comments as well we met with some of the business people at the conclusion of that meeting and i want to tell my colleagues what they said has happened to this economy since the sandinistas took power in 1979 cattle production and beef sales for export has gone from 70 million pounds to 10 million pounds a 700percent drop the cotton growers in 1979 exported 650 000 bales of cotton this year it is going to be 189 000 bales of cotton a drop of about 600 or 500 percent the small producers who produce cotton went from 5 000 to 270 they talked about the loss of techhology they had 2 000 engineers in the country 1 500 have fled they talked about in 1979 the exports from the government of somoza when he fled was 200 million in exports and now it is 10 million a drop of 2 000 percent they had 22 multinational corporations in nicaragua in 1978 and 1979 and that has now dropped to six in 1979 when the sandinistas took power they communized 75 percent of the industry there is no foreign currency to replace the aging industrial base and equipment now there are no technical advisers to help with the technical problems of the country the average worker down there the average worker is now making between 5 and 17 a month and for that he has to work 48 hours a week plus he has to donate 12 hours to the sandinista government that is a total of 60 hours of work for 5 to 17 a week that means that the one person who works will be able to feed himself probably twice a day and that does not include his famly as a result of this the black market has gone wild on the black market 70 percent of the commerce in that country is conducted while i was down there i bought some currency on entering the country one must buy currency at the airport or one cannot get into the country i have here an old cordoba currency when the sandinistas came into power shortly after this piece of currency was printed and this is a 20cordoba bill i bought this one which is the same bill but my colleagues will notice over the top of it is printed 20 000 when i was down there 2 months ago the exchange rate was 7 200 cordobas for 1 unitedstates dollar when i went back this weekend it was 15 000 cordobas for 1 unitedstates dollar and that is the official rate on the black market it is double that 30 000 cordobas for 1 unitedstates dollar one cannot buy anything the money is worthless the money is getting more worthless all the time it is only worth a few cents now this 20 000cordoba bill is worth 67 cents and when somoza the tyrant fled the country it was 10 cordoba for 1 unitedstates dollar each cordoba was worth 10 cents now 20 000 cordobas are worth 67 cents is it any wonder the people cannot eat they are starving they are dying on the vine we need to make our colleagues in the unitedstates congress and the people across this country aware of that fact humberto ortega in a speech this weekened after major miranda made these revelations said yes they are building toward a 600 000man army yes they are exporting revolution yes they are training guerrillas in their own country and yes they are planning to get soviet mtg21s and other aircraft major miranda has been supported by the defense minister himself in what major miranda has said this morning in the washington post the speaker of this house of representatives said that the speech was preposterous the speech by the defense minister humberto ortega he described the speech as outrageous and counterproductive he said that it was it was intemperate and irrational i would like to conclude by saying what does it take to convince the leader of this house what does it take to convince the majority of the congressman in the democrat party in this house to believe what these people are all about a defector a military major the assistant to the secretary of defense down there of nicaragua the defense minister humberto ortega has told us of the vast military buildup that they are planning humberto ortega himself has told us the same thing and yet members on that side of the aisle still do not believe my concern is are we going to wait until el salvador is undermined and falls are we going to wait until honduras falls and costa rica falls are we going to wait until they get into guatemala and southern mexico before we respond we should be supporting the contras who are fighting not only for their own freedom and the promises of democracy made to their people in 1979 and again in august in esquipulas guatemala but also for the freedoms and the security of the united states as well we have a 1 980mile border between us and mexico we cannot even keep illegal aliens out all of my colleagues know that last year we passed the simpsonmazzoli immigration reform bill and in that bill we allowed anybody who has been in this country illegally for 5 years or more to get permanent resident status because we could not find them and get them out this year we said if they had been here 5 years or longer and they wanted to bring their families up here they can bring their families up even though they came in illegally we are going to give permanent resident status to them because we cannot control the border and we will make them unitedstates citizens and it is going to cost us dearly in welfare costs housing costs social security costs and jobs because a lot of those people work for a heck of a lot less so we have a lot of pressure on us because we cannot keep illegal aliens from coming across the border can my colleagues imagine what it is going to be like if humberto ortegas prophecy in what he promises to do takes place if they can consolidate power and crush the contras in nicaragua and accomplish that because we do not act in this body then they will rapidly export revolution or even more rapidly export revolution into el salvador costa rica honduras guatemala and up into mexico they told us time and again what they plan to do yet the leadership in this house and the majority in this house continues to believe that it aint so well it is so if we have to defend that 2 000mile border it is going to cost us dearly in manpower our young boys are going to be down there fighting and dying to defend that southern flank the soft underbelly of america it is going to cost us billions of dollars and we are going to get 5 10 20 million people fleeing those countries and coming into this country as refugees not as illegal aliens as refugees we are going to have to deal with that it is going to cost us dearly it is estimated if we get 5 million to 10 million refugees coming into this country it will increase unemployment among americans by 5 percent to 7 percent and for each 1 percent of unemployment it costs the taxpayers of this country 30 billion that is 150 billion to 210 billion in just lost jobs not to mention the vast amount of expense it will cost to defend a 2 000mile border between the united states and mexico or if we have to to send them down into honduras when i met with president azcona in tegucigalpa honduras he told me face to face that if the peace process fails and if the contras are destroyed because of lack of will in this body that they do not get any more aid from us to fight the fight for freedom down there that he is going to have to hl11475 request 50 000 americans be stationed in honduras and he is going to ask for 250 million in additional military aid he has told us that is what he will have to do in el salvador that fledgling democracy is going to need assistance so is costa rica which does not have an army and guatemala will need assistance as well either we do what is necessary now by helping the contras or we are going to have to pay dearly later many people had doubts about this before and i can understand that because we have been debating it a lot and we have heard different stories coming across the national news media but now we have the facts the defense minister of nicaragua himself has told us what he plans to do major miranda has given us secret documents that show the secret agreements that they have signed with the soviets there is no question about it now the unitedstates congress when we come back after the holidays must vote for additional contra aid if we do not we are going to rue the day it is that old statement that has been made in television commercials for years when they show a guy with a fram oil filter on television and he says you can either pay me now or pay me later the implication is if you buy fram oil filters you are going to keep your engine in good shape and you will not have to pay for major repairs for your automobile engine someplace down the road the statement i am making tonight is you can pay now by helping the contras fight for freedom and give them the wherewithal to put that country into the free column as was promised them in 1979 and again in august of this year at esquipulas or later it is going to cost us billions of dollars and a lot of young american lives we need to deal with this problem we can no longer dillydally the time is late they told us what they plan to do and this congress must act for the american people and for the people of central america"], [0.9650768712162971,

sanctions that will be taken against employees second establishing a drugfree awareness program for employees third requiring each employee to certify that he or she received a copy of the statement

voice in the soviet union if any for their own destinies the gentleman showed me what the real illustration of what the jews call the righteous gentile the righteous gentile of course was a person or persons designated during the time of world war ii who were nonjewish people who helped the jews escape from europe or from wherever it was that they were being oppressed and sure enough being murdered by the terrible nazi terror the gentleman has fit that description so well that i felt that though i have no real authority that i should designate him as the true righteous gentile on our trip i remember when we left the reichstag in west germany and as we left i was so struck by what i had seen looking just across the wall and i felt the reality of what all of that oppression is today and then i looked at the memorials to those people who had been killed trying to leave east germany crossing into west germany and i looked at the one memorial that had on it the date of february 1987

union was so relevant to all of the world and how it was that the gentleman throughout his history and his public career has been a hero to so many people who have very little to say about their

lakes ports have received only about 50 000 tons in the first 3 months of this year less than half the amount we would have expected ports that have traditionally handled these cargoes such as

situation which does not benefit the consumers of either country involved let us not forget the disastrous ramifications of the smoothawley legislation of 1930 which increased import tariffs dramatically it is well documented that the smoothawley act greatly exacerbated the ills of the great depression the first victims of h r 3 would be the american consumer who would pay more for fewer goods next a new block of jobless americans would develop from the many industries dependent on exports the united states cannot legislate away domestic economic inefficiency clearly this bill is not in the best interest of the united states in light of this current debate regarding h r 3 i should like to share with my colleagues a letter i have recently sent to the president dear mr president thank you for your letter of may 5 regarding h r 3 however i should make it clear that i do not seek an alternative trade bill i think the current law provides ample authority to you to den with international trade issues in particular i would not support h r 3 absent the plant closing section please make it clear that your opposition to h r 3 is not limited to the plant closing section with unemployment dropping and the cost of living inching up the last thing we need is an inflationary halt in importz sincerely"], [0.0001709461212158203, 0.4998290538787842, 1, "i rise in strong support of h r 281 the building and construction labor law amendments of 1987 which is sorely needed to close loopholes in our labor law which presently allow construc tion companies which have signed legitimate union contracts to escape their obligations under the contracts by setting up nonunion subsidiaries this years bill has been carefully crafted to alleviate many of the concerns expressed during debate on the legislation last congress the provisions of the bill apply only to firms which in fact should be considered the same company for labor relations purposes to be considered a single employer entities must meet the stringent test of having substantial common ownership control or management and must be performing work covered by a union contract signed by one of the entities and must be operating in the geographic area covered by the contract truly separate companies would in no way have collective bargaining agreements imposed upon them and the establishment of nonunion subsidiaries which do not undermine the terms of existing collective bargaining agreements would not be prevented under this legislation further this bill does not require employers to enter into prehire agreements against their will however the bill does prevent employers from unilaterally withdrawing from agreements which have been signed in good faith which is in line with a principle that has previously been established by the national labor relations board the bill also requires an employer to negotiate with the union when an agreement expires unless the workers involved decide otherwise which is a normal standard for collective bargaining agreements the unique circumstances of the construction industry mandate that construction employers and unions be able to enter into prehire agreements without formal procedures for holding union recognition elections many times a construction project is completed in less time than it takes to hold a union certification election therefore prehire agreements and the right to enforce those agreements are crucial to a construction workers lawful right to union representation it is important to keep in mind that h r 281 would not deny a worker the right to choose between union and nonunion employment construction workers who are subject to prehire agreements can demand decertification elections at any time during a contracts term additionally while the bill does require employers to negotiate with the union when an agreement expires it does not require that the employers reach agreement on a new contract it is unfortunate that so much misinformation in regard to this legislation has been circulated recently this bill is desperately needed to correct an inequity that is causing a great deal of undue hardship for this nations construction workers and i strongly urge my colleagues to give their full support to h r h5166"]]}
