considered in the period of time i have been privileged to serve in this house i want to reiterate that this is not a partisan matter as a matter of fact i have done everything i can to avoid it becoming recognized as a partisan matter as has the gentleman from georgia i want to state categorically that there is no one in this house that i have more genuine respect for than the gentleman from georgia who in my judgment is a man of impeccable integrity i fully support the efforts of the committee on public works and transportation to inquire into the manner in which superfund legislation is

disappointment to me that a conflict with the administration over access to files had been allowed to deteriorate into confrontation reflected in this proposal to cite the epa administrator for contempt of congress i have believed throughout and continue to believe that this dispute can and should be resolved through negotiation leading to committee access to the documents in question and therefore accomplishing far more quickly what the contempt citation presumably is supposed to achieve when one considers the full range of potential court action that could be involved in this matter to date it has not been possible to develop in as important a matter as a citation for criminal contempt the same sort of strong bipartisan consensus that normally characterizes the work of the committee on public works and transportation that consensus over the years has not been achieved easily and i am very disappointed over the fact that we have not been able to achieve this but the principal issue i think and the concern of the administration is the question of precedent i do not believe the administration is desirous of depriving the congress of access to legitimate requests for information to carry out its investigation i do not believe that they are desirous of holding back on environmental enforcement information what i do believe is that they are concerned about some of the enforcement sensitive information and even more importantly concerned over the precedent that could actually cause problems in enforcement in other areas going beyond the environmental protection issue i am talking about areas of drug traffic and i am talking about organized crime as well as some of the sec matters the contempt power of congress is an extraordinary power and should not be used unless all other avenues have been exhausted the committees action i think fails to recognize that epa agreed to turn over to the committee a substantial amount of information including some sensitive documents it would have been far more appropriate had the committee accepted the documents analyzed them and then used the knowledge thus derived to argue for any additional documents

the secretary of agriculture or the state director as his designee would still retain authority for making the final selection it is no secret that farmers home has been under increasing attack from

the county committee will have some input into the appointment process through their own locally elected officials an added advantage is that while this amendment provides for demo cratic input from
