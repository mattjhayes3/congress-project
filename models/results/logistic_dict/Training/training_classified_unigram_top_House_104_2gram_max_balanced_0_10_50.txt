frankly this is one of the worst pieces of legislation i have ever seen in the 40 years i have served in this body the bill includes both medicare and medicaid cuts and tax breaks our republican colleagues said that they were not tying the two together well they are tying them together in this bill the poor and the aged are going to understand that the contributions that they are making of about 500 billion is being made so that a tax cut can be given to the wealthiest americans that is finally proven in this piece of legislation the pernicious approach violates the contract we have with seniors who have paid for their medicare benefits it means seniors will pay more and get less choice of doctors poor quality lab tests and nursing homes that do not meet common standards of decency by separating action on medicare from the rest of reconciliation republicans tried to convince us that 270 billion in medicare cuts do not pay for 245 billion in tax breaks for the rich but americans can perform the simple math required they know when someone is pulling the wool over their eyes the bill also destroys medicaid under the mantra of states rights republicans are pulling the safety net out from under middle class families poor children women seniors and the disabledthe most vulnerable of americans up until last night the republican bill arbitrarily cut 182 billion from medicaid now they say they have fixed it by cutting only 170 billion but this midnight deal does not change the fact that this bill abdicates the federal governments role in medicaid reduces health care for the most needy and invites abuse by states it takes away vitally important guarantees under current law protection from having to sell the family home or farm to pay for a loved ones nursing home care guaranteeing coverage for seniors with alzheimers setting minimum standards of safety cleanliness and decency for nursing homes and guaranteeing health care for children and pregnant women i and other members tried to correct one of the most glaring defects in the bill by offering an amendment on behalf of mr gingrich in debate last week the speaker obviously was under the misimpression that his new medigrant program does what current law guaranteescovering the cost of medicare premiums for seniors under the poverty line in fact this bill repeals what current law provides our amendment would have restored provisions the speaker erroneously relied on and guarantee that the poorest of seniors have medicare coverage but the rules committee gagged us from amending the bill so that it will do what the speaker says it does i also want to point out the devastating impact that this bill has on health care for veterans the secretary of veterans affairs says that the harsh spending caps in the republican plan will require 41 veterans hospitals to close their doors as a result more than 1 million veterans will be denied health care by 2002 i do not share the misguided view of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that the best way for veterans to stay healthy is not to get sick this bill walks away from responsible government to help people in need in favor of lining the pockets of the wealthiest americans with unneeded tax cuts in addition to health care cuts this bill slashes education job training and other programs upon which we empower people to help themselves most americans will get nothing or pay more under the gop tax break the small percentage of the tax cuts that will go to families earning less than 50 000 a year will be more than offset by spending cuts these families stand to lose 648 a year or more under the gop plan those earning more than 350 000 the richest 1 percentwill get 14 050 a year for the tax cut i find it curious that my republican colleagues who criticize the president for not cutting middle class taxes enough are rushing to raise taxes on many low income families i must confess i am not surprised however that they would follow through on their threats to slash programs vital to the financial security of working americans finally i must object to the cavalier manner in which the republican leadership has included massive changes in farm programs the socalled freedomtofarm proposal was found to be so objectionable that the house agriculture committee failed to get it out of committee on an issue as vital as our nations food security this bill shreds responsible legislating for partisan game playing and makes rural americans the pawns this is not the way to legislate and it is a dangerous way to govern this is the biggest and the most important bill to be considered by the house this year the cuts are too large it hurts terribly the health care coverage of millions of americans i strongly oppose the bill i now look forward to hearing from my republican colleagues about what a great piece of legislation this is i reserve the balance of my time"], [3.814697265625e-06, 0.9999961853027344,

monthly premiums for medicare recipients but yesterday republican staff corrected the speaker and admitted that their plan would increase medicare premiums by 32 a month not the 7 a month the speaker claimed the republicancontrolled congressional budget office estimates that the gop plan will actually increase premiums by 56 50 a month why all the confusion because it is not just the american people whoare being kept in the dark about the republican partys plan to cut 270 billion from medicare to finance a tax cut for the wealthy the republican leadership is also in the dark if there is a gop medicare plan it must be written in invisible ink because nobody has seen it not even the speaker"], [8.940696716308594e-06, 0.9999910593032837, 1, "i want to address the house about the fact that increasingly and persistently we see efforts on the part of the republican leadership in the past in 1995 again this year and i suspect unfortunately to continue through the rest of 1996 efforts to cut medicare and medicaid i also want to remind my colleagues on the republican side and particularly the gop leadership about the need to pass health insurance reform my colleagues on the democratic side are aware of the fact that we have within our caucus a democratic health care task force part of our effort has been to try to preserve medicare and medicaid and to oppose the drastic cuts in medicare and medicaid that would negatively impact americas seniors if the republican proposals were to go forth in the house of representatives and in the senate similarly our democratic health care task force has been supportive of legislation that was originally introduced by senator kassebaum who is a republican and senator kennedy who is a democrat and here in the house by one of my colleagues on the republican side the gentlewoman from new jersey mrs rouxema that would try to reform the health care system to provide coverage insurance coverage for those people who lose their jobs or have to change jobs and also those americans who suffer from preexisting medical conditions who are unable to get health insurance now because of restrictions in the private health insurance market i just wanted to say very briefly before i went into a few details about why it is necessary to keep up this battle against cuts in medicare and medicaid to say very briefly that on the issue of medicare the republican plans have basically been to eliminate provider choice to seniors to allow doctors to overcharge seniors to force seniors to pay more out of pocket and to get less under medicare and basically to cut medicare and medicare programs for seniors in order to use the money for tax breaks primarily for wealthy americans on the issue of medicaid most of the republican plans have been to eliminate benefit guarantees to seniors for the disabled children and also many other american families and to allow states to cut an additional 178 billion on top of the congressional republican cut of 72 billion i wanted to start out this evening though by talking about the kennedykassebaum bill and the effort to provide health insurance reform this year that has basically been spearheaded here in the house of representatives not only by democrats but also some republicans who feel that modest health insurance reform is the way to go in this congress before we adjourn the president president clinton pledged his support for the bipartisan kennedykassebaum bill in his state of the union address earlier this year and congressional democrats have tried to work with moderate republicans to get the bill on its way to the presidents desk the senate passed the kennedykassebaum bill 100 to 0 unanimously but what is holding up this bipartisan health insurance reform bill is the republican leaderships insistence here in the house on adding medical savings accounts a special perk for the healthy and wealthy that lets them opt out of traditional health plans and drives up costs for everyone else who remains in traditional health plans the senate voted not to include the medical savings account perk in their version of the bill but house republicans and rightwing senate republicans still demand that it be included in the final version sent to the president i am asked over and over again why is that the speaker speaker gingrich and his republican colleagues in the leadership are so determined to include msas or medical savings accounts in an otherwise bipartisan bill the reason i believe is because of the 1 2 million in political contributions to the gop over the past year i should say over the past 5 years that have come from j patrick rooney and other executives of the of the golden rule insurance co which will reap massive profits if the republican medical savings accounts plan becomes law a few weeks ago the consumers union which is a group that puts out reports from time to time on health care issues issued a report actually on june 26 of this year that is entitled medical savings accounts a growing threat to consumers health care security i am not going to get into all the details of this consumers union report here this afternoon but i just wanted to touch on the executive summary which begins the report and explains why msas or medical savings accounts are harmful to most consumers it says in the executive summary of this consumers union report that the medical savings accounts would basically not only be a roadblock to congressional enactment of modest health insurance reform that addresses the issue of portability when people change jobs or when they have a preexisting medical condition but basically would devastate consumers in the health care system so here we have a situation where we are moving or we are trying to move those of us who support this kennedykassebaum bill in a way that would include more people who now do not have health insurance we know that many americans have no health insurance and we are trying to get more of them coverage so we are saying if you lose a job or you transfer a job or you have a preexisting medical condition we want you to be able to get health insurance but msas or the inclusion of msas in this bill would do just the opposite it would drive up the costs of health insurance and make it more difficult for more americans to get insured because of the increased costs that health insurance would have a key conclusion of this consumers union report says and there are three one that the proposed msas will mean severe financial hardships for families that use msas because they are devoid of essential consumer protections families with average income would have to pay 9 percent to 23 percent of annual income for health care before msa coverage kicks in now understand that when you talk about msas it is a high deductible policy it basically says when you have a catastrophic problem that your health care needs would be taken care of but if you have anything less than that your ordinary daily medical needs then you have to pay out of pocket the consumers union report says second that millions of consumers will find that the health insurance that they want the most the traditional lowdeductible comprehensive coverage is no longer available to them and third that msas are likely to increase the already large number of uninsured and underinsured americans making it even harder for congress to make health care affordable and accessible i wanted to cite 10 ways that the consumers union mentions why msas harm consumers they list them as follows first msas expose individuals to paying the first 5 000 for health care each year before insurance coverage kicks in this is the high deductible for families it is 7 500 second msas allow insurance compaifies to charge consumers 30 percent on all covered expenses after the deductible is met so even after you go beyond the deductible you are talking about a 30 percent outofpocket cost third msas allow insurance companies to include low lifetime limits in their policies leaving families unprotected against the cost of catastrophic illness fourth msas do not provide a cap on outofpocket costs fifth msas would lead to drastic premium increases for traditional comprehensive policies ultimately promoting the elimination of these policies in some markets what you are doing here if you are healthy or you are wealthy you buy this high deductible msa but because the healthy and wealthy people are now taken out of the insurance pool the costs for those who are left in the insurance pool goes up premiums go up and a lot of people simply cannot afford traditional health insurance anymore the sixth point that consumer union makes is that msas leave benefit design up to insurance companies allowing policies that exclude preventive care and conditions such as pregnancy seventh msas do not require insurance companies to accept all individuals who apply for coverage or to charge them a fair price eighth msas do not require employers to contribute to the high deductible insurance policy or the employees msa in other words contributions from your employer are voluntary ninth msas do not require employers who offer them to also offer employees a choice of a traditional low deductible comprehensive health insurance plan your traditional health insurance plan and lastly tenth msas do not require employers to continue to spend the same amount on health care coverage that they do today essentially the conclusion in brief that the consumer union report makes is that congress should keep msas out of health insurance ieform legislation i could nothave said it better if we are going to see comprehensive health insurance reform passed this year in the house in the senate and be signed by the president that addresses the issues of portability and makes it possible for people with preexisting conditions to get health insurance that they need msas cannot be included i have to hope that between the house and the senate over the next few weeks or the next few months before we adjourn that an effort is made on a bipartisan basis to simply move the original kennedykassebaum bill without msas otherwise there will be no health insurance reform passed in congress and signed into law this year which i think would be a tragedy for so many millions of americans who need health insurance and cannot get it now because of the restrictions that exist under existing law i wanted to spend a little time on the medicare issue and also a little bit on the medicaid issue because medicare and medicaid are so important not only to senior citizens not only to lowincome people but also hospitals because so many of our hospitals and our health care institutions are heavily medicare and medicaid dependent and if we make the kind of drastic cuts in medicare and medicaid that the republican leadership has been proposing for the last 18 months our hospitals and our health care institutions in general will suffer many of them will actually close because they will not have sufficient funds to continue to operate medicare right now provides quality health care benefits for over 32 million senior citizens but again the republican leadership wants to transform medicare into a program of substandard care the republican leadership says that medicare is in crisis we hear that time and time again on the floor of this house they say that that is because it is running a deficit but i would argue that minor adjustments not a major overhaul could insure medicare solvency when democrats were in the majority we made sure that medicare was being adequately funded in 1982 the medicare trustees predicted that the medicare trust fund would run out of money by 1986 but obviously that did not happen democrats protected medicare and maintained a level of quality care for senior citizens into the 1990s now that the republicans are in the majority they are scaring senior citizens by saying that medicare is again going to go bankrupt in the early part of the next decade and using words like reform to disguise their efforts to destroy the medicare program if you listen to speaker newt gingrich i would maintain that his real motives lie in a speech he gave during last years medicare debate where the speaker said he wanted to see medicare wither on the vine that is a sign i would say of the misguided republican leadership that medicare would be led to wither on the vine so many of those who are now in the leadership speaker gingrich mr dole now the republican presidential candidate in particular did not support medicare when it was first voted on the floor here of the house of representatives 30 some odd years ago i think it is a sign of the misguided republican leadership that medicare has run its first ever deficit in its 31 years as a health care program for senior citizens now when the republicans are in control of congress the republican budget that was passed just a few weeks ago or perhaps a month ago now calls for over 168 billion in cuts reductions or whatever you want to call them in the medicare program i do not want to get into this debate on whether it is a real cut or a cut in the growth of the program but in any case it is a 168 billion cut basically the republican leadership is proposing to take money out of the medicare program in order to pay for tax breaks for wealthy americans although the amount of money being taken from medicare is significant i do not want to downplay that the devil is really in the details because the republican leadership is proposing a major overhaul of medicare to make it less efficient and more costly for seniors as much as we decry as democrats the cuts in medicare more significant is what the republicans are trying to do to restructure the medicare program basically their proposal calls for coopting senior citizens into managed care i do not have a problem with managed care per se but i do not believe in speaker gingrichs attempts to force seniors into managed care and somehow say that that is giving senior citizens more choices the only choice that the republican leadership is giving to seniors under their medicare plan is the choice to receive substandard health care where medicare historically offered patients their own choice of doctors protected against high outofpocket costs and offered a guaranteed level of coverage the republican leadership proposal would essentially take that all away in addition and this goes back to what i was saying before the republicans are proposing to incorporate the medical savings accounts what we discussed before in the context of health care reform they want to incorporate the msas also into the medicare overhaul last year the nonpartisan congressional budget office stated that these tax breaks the msa tax breaks would actually cost medicare several billion dollars again an effort to restructure medicare and i would maintain overhaul it in a way that has a very negative impact on americas senior citizens i would urge really that senior citizens again take notice of what is happening here and what is being propqsed by the republicans and call on congress to protect medicare from any further raids by speaker gingrich and the republican leadership lastly this afternoon i want to talk a little bit about medicaid medicaid many people think of as the program for poor people but it also pays about 50 percent of all nursing home care for senior citizens the republican budget makes extreme cuts 72 billion over 6 years to the medicaid program and allows states to cut an additional 178 billion for a grand total of 250 billion in medicaid cuts these medicaid cuts are over and above the medicare cuts i discussed before without medicaid many middleclass adult children of nursing home parents will have to pay for their parents expensive care while trying to send their own children through college so keep in mind and i say that to those americans who would have parents or grandparents that are in nursing homes if you have to end up paying for a lot of their care that means less money out of your pocket that you might not have available to pay for your own children your own childrens education or other programs recently the commerce committee voted on the medicaid repeal act the republican medicaid proposal i am a member of the committee on commerce and i fought very hard against this bill when it came to our committee the republican medicaid repeal act will eliminate all current guarantees of health care coverage and eliminate current guarantees of nursing home benefits to the elderly i offered an amendment during the markup in the committee on commerce that would return these guarantees in this terrible legislation but it was rejected by every republican on the committee other democrats offered similar amendments to continue health care coverage for the disabled for children for pregnant women again all of these were defeated by the republican members of the committee on top of all this the gop medical repeal act will sharply reduce payments to hospitals for care i said before i do not think a lot of people realize how dependent many of americas hospitals and health care institutions are on medicare and medicaid in new jersey my state a lot of hospitals have the majority of their income from those two federal and state programs what i am concerned about is with these steep cuts that are being proposed in both programs a lot of hospitals in new jersey and throughout the country will simply have to close their doors i think at a time when congress should be seeking ways to decrease the number of uninsured and underinsured the republican leaderships answers will make these problems worse what we are talking about here is an effort to try to provide quality health care for seniors and for all americans the bottom line is that more and more americans today and you can make a comparison with last year 2 years ago 5 years 10 years ago every year more and more americans and the percentage of americans are uninsured and have no health insurance if we make these drastic changes in medicare and medicaid if we do not do what is necessary to reform health care insurance along the lines of what senators kassebaum and kennedy have proposed then we are going to see more and more americans be uninsured and not have health care the consequences to our society are severe not only today but certainly tomorrow the irony really too of the republican budget which was passed in this house not too long ago is that in addition to making these cuts in medicare and medicaid it also increases the deficit in the past democrats were able to decrease the deficit and still preserve medicare and medicaid i think that this is just a strong indication of the misplaced priorities and values of the republican leadership if they find it necessary to cut medicare and medicaid and in the same context are actually increasing the deficit i remain committed to fighting these republican efforts that would raise the deficit while slashing medicare and medicaid and i know that myself and many of my democratic colleagues will continue to speak out over the next few weeks and the next few months until this session ends to remind american seniors that we cannot make these drastic changes in the medicare and the medicaid program and that we need to pass health insurance reform now and certainly before the end of this session of congress"], [1.049041748046875e-05, 0.9999895095825195, 1, "today i rise to voice my dismay at the ongoing assault taking place on some of the most important educational programs in this country student loans are under attack by republican budget cutters who want to give the wealthy a huge tax break the republican plan cuts 10 billion in the stafford loan program over the next 7 years these cuts will add an additional 3 100 to undergraduate costs and 9 400 to graduate students the republicans want to knock 157 000 students out of the

percent even programs like head start will not be safe from the republican budget ax why these cuts mr speaker the simple answer to that is republicans are making these cuts to give tax breaks to the

plan which actually increases the deficit starting next year projections show that the 1996 deficit will be approximately 130 billion but under the gop plan it will increase to 153 billion in 1997 the gop deficit is also higher in 1998 than this years deficit i ask why the reason is because the gop are intent on their large tax breaks for the wealthy part of which are paid for through excessive medicare cuts in 1992 the deficit was 290 billion and in 1993 it was 255 billion under democratic leadership the deficit has actually dropped 4 years in a row to the projected 130 billion of this year what is the reason for the republican deficit increase misplaced priorities tax breaks for their wealthy friends and a slush fund for future unnecessary tax breaks while the republicans claim to be deficit hawks and the saviors of medicare the facts indicate that they are intent on pushing this country further into debt and making large and unnecessary cuts in medicare this republican deficitincreasing budget also makes extreme cuts of 72 billion over 6 years to the medicaid program and allows states to cut an additional 178 billion for a grand total of 250 billion in medicaid cuts we are talking about major cuts in medicaid as well as medicare many people look at the medicaid program as primarily for the poor and of course it does assist poor people but it also pays about 50 percent of all nursing home care for senior citizens without medicaid many middleclass adult children of nursing home parents will have to pay for their parents expensive care while at the same time trying to send their own children through college last thursday the committee on commerce of which i am a member voted on the medicaid repeal act which i vigorously fought the medicaid repeal act will

the floor this morning and talk about how he is trying to increase portability and also increase health insuiance for those with preexisting health conditions through the kennedykassebaum legislation but that reality is that the speaker and the rest of the republican leadership have been insisting on including medical savings accounts in this kennedykassebaum health care reform what that will mean is that the healthy and the wealthy will opt out of the traditional health insurance programs and the cost for everyone else for health insurance will go up so again even though the republican leadership talks about how they are trying to expand health care options in fact what they are doing is making those options fewer because more and more people will not be able to afford health insurance i just wanted to say in conclusion that in the past democrats were able to decrease the deficit and preserve medicare and medicaid the republicans have misplaced priorities and values the democrats have a proven track record of reducing the deficit and ensuring that senior citizens have adequate health care i remain committed to fighting these republicans efforts that would raise the

government shutdowns earlier this year and late last year are back former senator dole and speaker gingrich are bringing us a 500 billion economic package have proposed a 500 billion economic plan tax break package mostly for the wealthy that will result in more cuts to medicare more cuts to student loans more cuts to medicaid and more cuts to environmental programs let us look at a bit of history as we discuss this dole economic plan and as we discuss the cuts in medicare and what all of that means and what that meant last year last year the plan of the speaker the gentleman from georgia and senator dole was to give some 245 billion in tax breaks mostly for the wealthy and they planned to pay for this plan by making 270 billion of cuts in medicare and several billion about 180 billion cuts in medicaid several billion worth of cuts in student loans and several billion of cuts in environmental protection this 245 billion tax break mostly for the wealthy which would result in the 270 billion in medicare cuts was the beginning of the unraveling of the medicare program let me quote what speaker gingrich said about medicare and let me quote what thensenator dole said about medicare last october speaker gingrich speaking to a group of insurance executives all of whom would benefit greatly from this dismantling of the medicare program said now we didnt get rid of medicare in round one because we dont think that is politically smart we dont think that is the right way to go through a transition but we believe that medicare is going to wither on the vine the same day speaking to another group a group called the american conservation union thensenator dole who was leading the fight for the medicare cuts in the senate said i was there fighting the fight voting against medicare one of 12 because we knew it wouldnt work in 1965 since that time the same people that tried to on the one hand say they are here to try to defend medicare and save medicare are attacking medicare under their breath attacking medicare behind closed doors in republican caucuses and occasionally letting it slip and attacking medicare in public one prominent member of the committee on ways and means called medicare socialized medicine the majority leader the gentleman from texas said that in a free society medicare would not exist whatever that means other prominent republicans have labeled medicare a program of socialism a program that does not make sense for people a program that we simply do not need the point is that this crowd gingrich dole the gentleman from texas mr armey the leadership of the republican party not mainstream republicanism which most people in this country that are republicans i think are more likely to believe in and not the mainstream republicanism that supported medicare in past decades but this new extremist crowd of gingrich and armey and the gentleman from texas tom delay and some of the other leaders in the other house are simply opposed to medicare they wanted it to wither on the vine they bragged about voting against it it is pretty clear that this 245 billion tax cut they proposed last year and paid for by the 200some billion tax cuts in medicare are the way they can end the program of medicare end the programs of student loans end some of the environnlental protection measures that brings us to the point today to the dole program today he has proposed in the presidential race i might add that senator dole and his running mate mr kemp came to the republican caucus today to talk about how they were going to pay for the major tax break mostly for the wealthy and talk about how they were going to do the medicare cuts a few republicans have stood up and been honest about what the dole economic plan means if you are going to provide 500 billion in tax breaks mostly for the rich then you are going to have to cut medicare even more than thensenator dole and speaker gingrich proposed last year that simply means that if it was 270 billion in cuts in medicare last year they are going to propose even more cuts this year once they are honest with the public what that really means is those senior citizens that are now paying 46 a month for medicare premiums will have their premium at least doubled to 90 or 100 or maybe 110 a month to pay for their premium it also means that deductibles will be higher it also means that copays will be higher so that this party this gingrichdole party that says they are against tax increases clearly want to put this senior citizen tax on medicare beneficiaries it is not 46 a month which is what it used to be or 5 or 10 copayments what it used to be or 50 deductible what it used to be all of a sudden it is probably going to be double that in order to pay for this huge 500 billion in tax breaks mostly for the wealthy at the same time they are going to go right at the heart of student loans and end the student loan program that students in this country have been accustomed to raise the prices on other kinds of student loans and student grants cut student grants and raise the prices on other student loans and in order again to pay for this 500 billion

that in the tax break package that is being offered by the republican majority in this house that there was another ronald reagan program called the alternate minimum tax for those who do not know what the alternate minimum tax is this is a tax that the richest corporations in the united states pay president reagan with very good thought and vision put this into practice because oftentimes the richest corporations in this country when they took all of their deductions would find that they had a zero tax obligation he thought as did others that it would be unfair to have that occur that the richest corporations in the country would not be paying some portion or a fair share of taxes the way that ordinary americans pay their taxes so he put in a 20 percent rate and the congress approved of a 20 percent rate on the richest corporations in the country into that tax package that the republicans are proposing the 245 billion tax break package the alternate minimum tax is repealed repealed which means that once again if this passes and is law that the richest corporations in the united states will have a zero tax obligation it is a 17 billion windfall to the richest corporations i want to remind my republican colleagues about that and i also want to remind the listening public that what mr kemp says that tampering with the earned income tax credit which the republican package does in cutting the earned income tax credit is an increase on taxes for working families at the same time as my republican colleagues are decreasing taxes for the richest corporations in this nation no wonder the public said to the president of the united states 60 percent of the public said veto mr gingrichs budget bill and do not balance the budget on the backs of seniors and medicare and medicaid and on students and education and on working families with being unfair to them in terms of taxes my colleagues are here tonight so that we may have an opportunity to talk about something that is on everyones minds everyones lips and it is in all of the news and what we have tried to do is to organize a special order tonight on behalf of the millions of senior citizens in this country and their families who are sitting at their kitchen tables tonight struggling to cope with the impact of the government shutdown day no 20 our seniors including many of this nations veterans live on fixed incomes they do not have money to fall back on when their benefits are cut off now these vulnerable citizens have become pawns in what is a very very cynical political game being played by house republicans who are refusing to open the federal government despite what they tell the public they had the opportunity to open the federal government 12 times the latest was yesterday let us be clear about what is happening here the president of the united states the democrats responsible republicans all agree that it is time to end the government shutdown and it is time for speaker gingrich and the right wing extremists in the house to stop holding americas seniors hostage to their political games it is power politics at its worst is what weare watching bob dole and i dont have the quote up here but i will get it bob dole the republican majority leader of the other body wants to reopen the government he said enough is enough and he is right he is absolutely right he said that this has gone about as far as it can go we need now to put people back to work i dont want to misquote the majority leader this is what he says i dont see any sense in what we have been doing i would hope that we would have quick action in the house people have been gone from their jobs long enough enough is enough and that quote was on january 2 now how are seniors affected by the shutdown of the federal government that is what my colleagues and i are here to talk about tonight in my own district the third district of connecticut the veterans hospital in west haven connecticut cannot now legally pay for anything they must depend on vendors to continue to provide without payment food hearing aids glasses medical supplies ambulance services and all of the lifesaving treatments provided our nations veterans mr vincent ng the director of va hospitals in connecticut said we will do whatever is necessary to care for or patients we hope our contractors will support the needs of the medical centers during this crisis situation so that we will be able to maintain our full standard of patient care our nations veterans should not be forced into paying for the failings of this congress men and women who have put their lives on the line for this congress and for this country deserve better than that it is just not the veterans who are being hurt but those who care for them as well one va employee called my office today to explain that he had received a paycheck of one weeks pay and two weeks worth of deductions he called because he does not have any money for food we made a reference for him and we directed him to the nearest food bank to the nearest food pantry he is not alone the plight of the va employees in my district prompted mayor richard borer of west haven ct to make a public plea for donations to the local food shelters to help feed workers who are now not being paid the people who care for our veterans deserve better the crisis facing our elderly veterans extends to every single state in this nation if the government shutdown continues veterans benefits may run out new claims are not being paid for va pensions rehabilitation counseling education and home loans programs that provide food to the elderly are also in jeopardy if the government shutdown continues funding for the meals on wheels program has evaporated to understand how many seniors rely on this service let me again give an example of one of the meals on wheels providers in my district the new haven community action agency provides meals to 2 000 senior citizens every single day some 600 000 elderly americans face the loss of meals on wheels transportation and personal care what are we about in this nation what are these people doing to seniors and to veterans in this country the meals on wheels program in my state has suffered a 40 percent cut in funding because of the shutdown it is unclear how much longer we will be able to carry the federal governments responsibilities to feed our elderly in addition federal funds to states for medicaid have been severely limited on december 27 states received only 40 percent of the estimated quarterly payment for medicaid without further action the federal match for medicaid and its 36 million beneficiaries of the medicaid program twothirds are elderly and the disabled while the house republican leadership refuses to reopen the government the republican leadership in this body continue to take their paychecks these same republican leaders promised last year that they were going to make this congress live under the same rules as everybody else but today while seniors worry about the fate of elderly feeding programs while veterans health services are jeopardized while seniors are suffering the congressional paychecks just keep on coming to the leaders to mr gingrich i am returning my congressional pay back to the unitedstates treasury and will continue to do so until the government is reopened if speaker gingrich and the right wing extremists in the house of representatives who are keeping this government closed were forced to put their paychecks on the line i think the crisis would be over in a heartbeat the president democrats and republicans in the unitedstates senate all want to reopen the government and stop inflicting pain on our seniors and veterans but a small band of extremists in this body are holding america hostage yesterday when the democrats voted to try to reopen the government only 2 republicans were brave enough to join us only 2 democrats need 20 good republicans twenty 197 democrats are prepared to have voted to reopen this government we need 20 republican votes so i am pleading with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to have the courage have the courage to do the right thing to show their allegiance to the american people instead of their allegiance to newt gingrich join us to reopen the government and restore the services that the taxpayers have paid for and are paying for every single day that this government is shut down we only need 20 good republicans 20 patriots the 20day government shutdown is affecting more and more americans seniors have been hit extremely hard and remember most older americans live on extremely limited monthly budgets and are not able to compensate for the loss of vital federal benefits our nations veterans and other senior citizens should not be asked to pay the price of the gingrich government shutdown i now yield time to my colleagues who have joined me on the floor tonight so we can engage in a dialog and discussion on this issue i yield to my colleague from new jersey mr frank pallone who has been a real warrior in this effort to reopen our government and real

washington operates than any other legislation in the last half century it eliminates deficits over the next 7 years and does so honestly and fairly and in doing so we ease the crushing burden of federal debt on our children a balanced budget will not only keep the national debt from going higher and higher it means help for folks right now balancing the budget will lower interest rates which will mean lower mortgage rates lower car loans costs lower rates on student loans and more jobs for instance according to drimcgraw hill an independent economic consulting firm fixed rate mortgages

republican budget reconciliation conference report the bill represents a reckless restructuring of nationa priorities which advocates a shift of resources and commitment away from working american families and granted to the most affluent segments of our society this republican gingrich reconciliation bill abandons the goal of equality of social health education and economic responsibility for members of our american society i have supported in the past and will continue to support responsible deficit reduction policies i voted for the alternative coalition budget a difficult vote but appropriate which would reach a budget surplus in 7 years end corporate subsidies and permit higher spending on crucial national investment priorities without lavishing tax breaks on the wealthy i supported the 1993 reconciliation measure which has to date exceeded its targets with 3 straight years of deficit reduction resulting in the lowest annual deficit as a percent of gdp since the late 1970s i certainly do not support the republican reconciliation bill which slashes proven programs that ensure economic and health security for working americans families and seniors in order to finance tax breaks principally for investors corporations and affluent individuals the legislation includes deep cuts and new fees for student loans and deep cuts in medicaid and medicare further it includes provisions to put american pensions at risk and promote environmental degradation this measure disassembles the federal commitment and structure that has built and empowered our nation to unprecedented economic and social achievement at the same time this reconciliation measure cuts deeply 270 billion from medicare the bill gives 245 billion in tax breaks to the wealthiest members of our society and corporate america in fact the wealthiest 12 percent of american families those with an income over walker walsh wamp ward waters watt nc watts ok waxman weldon fl weldon pa weller white whitfleld wicker 100 000 will get 45 percent of the tax break benefits over 110 billion in tax breaks the republicans continue to insist on a cut in the capital gains tax rate for big investors a reduction of the alternative minimum tax for corporations and a limited child tax credit which is actually denied to 33 percent of kids because they are low income in addition the republican gingrich reconciliation bill cuts the existing earned income tax credit by over 32 billion thereby producing a tax increase for the working poor in fact the joint committee on taxation reported that families with under 30 000 in income will actually pay more in taxesthats right pay more under the republican gingrich tax break measure some break its more on the backs of hardworking families policymakers who are serious about deficit reduction do not push a package which includes 245 billion in tax breaks skewed to the wealthiest in our society not only is it unwise to reduce revenues in this time of fiscal constraints but it is unfair to dole out benefits to the wellheeled when everyone else in society is being told they must sacrifice the new republican gingrich majority in the house has made the medicare and medicaid programs its target for nearly 50 percent of the total spending cuts contained in the republican reconciliation package medicare is one of our nations most successful programs it was established over 30 years ago as a national commitment to assure seniors health care coverage the republican gingrich scheme is going to threaten the integrity of this program and make seniors pay more for less health care coverage with 270 billion in cuts overall medicare spending will be cut by a cumulative 6 795 per senior over the next 7 years meaning that in 2002 there will be 1 700 less in medicare dollars per senior in that year alone even the trustees of the medicare trust fund strongly oppose the republican plan because the extensive cuts go far beyond program reform or trust fund stability the republican plan is not designed to save medicare it is a scheme to let medicare wither on the vine in the name of balancing the budget the republican reconciliation bill not only creates a social deficit in our nation but also creates a serious environmental deficit this legislation amounts to a wholesale degradation of americas natural resource legacy evoking the tradition of 19th century robber barons who exploited the west we see the imprint of special interests including the mining oil and gas industries throughout the republican reconciliation measure in particular the decision to destroy forever the arctic national wildlife refuge anwr by permitting oil and gas exploration and drilling demonstrates the true spirit of the republican majority anwr is the last great piece of american wilderness and opening the refuge area to drilling will assure destruction of this pristine wilderness folding this measure into this bill is a sleight of hand way to circumvent the process and force this wholesale policy change upon the american public without open debate on its merits the question really is about the direction our nation should be heading and what values we want to cultivate to enhance our future this republican gingrich reconciliation bill reveals a significant change in national priorities and values under the gop leadership republicans misplaced priorities are to pull back from proven albeit not perfect policies for health care housing education and the environment in order to give tax breaks to the wealthy and placate special interests we in congress should do better surely we should know better a balanced budget mantra does not disguise the true intent or effect of the republican reconciliation bill which polarizes and balkanizes our society reneging on the basic social contract and abandoning families and the very programs that have permitted us to take care of those who are vulnerable and in need in essence to take care of one another when we face crisis in our lives apparently the gop thinks that if they claim to balance the budget anything goes but they are wrong the american people care the american people do not want an abandonment of valued principles and policies which allow the most vulnerable in our society to live with dignity they also do not want a redistribution of wealth which makes it more difficult for working american families to get ahead while giving special benefits to corporations and special interests this republican reconciliation bill is an affront to

for tax breaks for wealthy individuals and corporations where are they getting it by squeezing the medicare system it is wrong and the seniors understood that it was wrong last year and it is wrong this year as well just as there is nothing really new in this years trustees report there is nothing really new in this years republican retread as they did last year republicans try to justify their deep medicare cuts by claiming they are needed to preserve medicare against the insolvency of the hospital insurance trust fund the hypocrisy of this claim is so transparent that no senior citizen should take it seriously last year a few weeks before they proposed their massive medicare cuts house republicans passed a tax bill that took almost 90 billion in revenues out of the medicare hospital insurance trust fund over the next 10 yearsand brought it that much closer to insolvency understand republicans took 90 billion out of that last year for the purposes of their tax breaks we did not hear a word then about the impending bankruptcy in medicare the presidents economic recovery plan in 1993 extended the solvency of the trust fund for 3 years it passed without a single republican vote when we had the opportunity to provide for additional kinds of solvency we were unable to get a single republican vote we did not hear a word from the republicans then about the impending bankruptcy of medicare like last year the republican plan proposes deep cuts in medicare to fund new undeserved tax breaks for the wealthy like last year the republican plan is designed to cause medicare to wither on the vine in the words of speaker gingrichby forcing senior citizens to give up their family doctor and join private insurance plans majority leader dole has said that enacting medicare was a mistake from the beginningand he is trying to use this budget to correct that mistake last year republicans tried to justify their excessive medicare cuts with a large array of misguided arguments this year they are repeating the same arguments as if repetition can somehow substitute for reality the american people were not fooled last yearand they certainly will not be fooled this year when republicans took up the issue last year they proposed to cut medicare by 270 billionthree times more than the amount the medicare trustees said was needed to stabilize the trust fund this year republicans are proposing to cut 16 7 billion from medicare by contrast the presidents plan cuts medicare by 116 billion44 percent less but it guarantees medicare solvency for 10 years and it funds medicare at the level necessary to assure that quality care will be available for senior citizens when they need it even worse republicans support an inflexible ceiling on medicare spending consequently if inflation is higher or medical needs are greater than anticipated medicare spending will not go up and many senior citizens will be out of luck and out of care an estimated 20 percent of all medicare hospitalization can be avoided by relying on better preventive services and more timely primary and outpatient care so if we have interventions earlier if we have better home care if we have the investment in our seniors to avoid the more costly expenses when they must come into the hospital that can save billions and billions of dollars we ought to be thinking about that without reducing the services for our elderly and actually improve the quality of health care for our seniors as much as 10 percent of all medicare expenditures may be due to fraud and can be reduced or eliminated by better oversight the work senator harkin has been involved in in reviewing medicaid and medicare fraud is absolutely powerful and absolutely convincing about the tens of billions of dollars that can be saved you go to any hall in this country and ask our senior citizens where there can be savings any senior citizen can give you chapter and verse about how there can be savings in the medicare system many of them can tell you about the fraud that is being perpetrated upon them at the present time we ought to address that kind of issue before we are talking about reductions in essential services medicare could save 20 billion annually if senior citizens have assistance in monitoring their medications more carefully in order to avoid adverse drug reactions we spend billions and billions of dollars a year from adverse drug reactions where the senior will go to a doctor and receive various medications receive other medications from another doctor and find there is an inconsistency in terms of taking both medications and then find they have an illness there are ways to remedy that problem to save billions and billions of dollarsagain to improve the quality of health we do not hear that issue raised or discussed or debated we do not have to destroy medicare in order to save it congress will never allow the medicare trust fund to become bankrupt i know that and the american people know it it is time for the republicans to stop raiding medicare and join in sensible steps to improve and strengthen it for the future another false republican argument in defense of their medicare cuts is that the reductions are not really cuts because the total amount of medicare spending will continue to grow but every household in america knows that if the cost of your rent the cost of your utilities and the cost of your food go upand your income stays the same or goes up more slowlyyou have taken a real cut in your living standard republicans speak of a cut in defense even though defense spending has remained stable apparently the same republican logic does not apply to spending on medicare that applies to spending on guns and tanks a cut is a cut is a cutwhether it is in medicare or social security or national defense republicans also claim that deep cuts in medicare are necessary to balance the budget but that argument only proves that republican priorities are wrong democrats favor a balanced budget and president clinton has proposed a balanced budgetbalanced fairly not balanced on the backs of senior citizens or children or workers there is a right way to balance the budget and a rightwing way and unfortunately the republicans continue to pick the rightwing way republicans deny that their medicare cuts will fund tax cuts for the wealthy this time the leopard claims that it really has changed its spots but their budget clearly envisions 60 billion in revenue increases from tax extenders and closing of selected corporate loopholes in order to fund 60 billion in new tax breaks for the undeserving rich without those new tax breaks they wouldnt need to cut medicare by 167 billion the democratic amendment eliminates these new tax breaks for the wealthy and uses them to protect medicare the medicare trust fund should not be a slush fund for republican tax breaks for the rich republicans can run as hard as they want in this election year but they can not hide from these facts even more damaging than the loss of the billions of dollars that republicans would slash from medicare is their attempt to turn medicare over to the private insurance industfy the republican budget contains a number of changes to force senior citizens to give up their own doctors and join private insurance plans once they are forced into these plans senior citizens will be stripped of many of the protections they enjoy todayprotection against overcharges by doctors and other health care providers protection against premiumgouging and profiteering by insurlance companies protection of their right to keep their own family doctor and go to the specialist of their choice republicans claim they only want to offer senior citizens a choice but this is a choice no senior citizen should be forced to make the harsh cuts in medicare contained in the republican budget are also a repudiation of our historic commitment to social security because the distinction between medicare and social security is a false one medicare is part of the same compact between the government and the people as social security that compact says contribute during your working years and we will guarantee basic income and health security in your retirement years any senior citizen who has been hospitalized or who suffers from a serious chronic illness knows that there is no retirement security without health security the cost of illness is too high a few days in an intensive care unit can cost more than the total yearly income of many senior citizens the low and moderateincome elderly will suffer most from these medicare cuts eightythree percent of all medicare spending is for older americans with annual incomes below 25 000 twothirds is for those with incomes below 15 000 no budget plan that purports to be part of a contract with america should break americas contract with the elderly it is bad enough to propose these deep cuts in medicare at all it is even worse to make these cuts in order to pay for an undeserved and unneeded tax break for the wealthiest americans everyone knows that the real vote on medicare is not on the floor of the senate or the floor of the house of representatives the real vote will be cast in november by the american people and they know that the future of medicare is too important to

cuts to pay for the tax breaks americans across the board overwhelmingly oppose using medicare as a cash cow to pay for the republican plan to offer tax breaks to the very wealthy a recently released harris poll suggests that the opposition is even stronger among the wealthiest americans when the question was asked do you favor or oppose cutting the future costs of medicare to pay for a tax break 86 percent of americans with income of 50 000 or more said they did not favor doing this while only 83 percent of all americans said they opposed the plan to cut services for our children and our senior citizens for a tax break for the wealthy while the tax break for the wealthy is being given attention the tax break for the working poor has been taken away it seems to me that we are not listening perhaps there are persons inside listening only to selective voices but they are not listening to the majority of americans and this is a body that is of by and for the people so who are we

that when they retire and reach their days on a fixed income they would have available to them a fund that they have paid ilito for health care while medicaid was essentially passed as a program for our children almost 70 percent of those dollars are being paid for longterm care for our seniors and why is that it is because our seniors do not have the money now they are very stretched with what

halfmillion dollars in the houston independent school district the largest school district in the state of texas the school breakfast and lunch programs as estimated by the texas education agency will

outvoted on a party line vote by the republican majority i will go to that in a few minutes let us look at what this new amended contract for america talks about not only cutting children nutrition programs and the wic program let us see now we are having 11 million for two new executive airplanes for the army that they did not request 20 million more for a new runway for a base that is on the base closure commission list a million dollars for a bike trail in north miami beach one thing that is apparent in this new amended contract with america there is no clause that our children will have a hot nutritious meal or a clause that oihr children will have a safe and drugfree school or that our children may have a summer youth job program let me continue with the childrens nutrition a tv consumer reporter in houston just last night said that it took the republican majority 40 years to gain control of the house but only took them 40 days to cut food to children the schoolbased nutrition grant program overall funding would be 104 million less in fiscal year 1996 101 3 billion would be transferred out of the block grant in 1996 for nonfood programs which would compromise the health of children the schoolbased nutrition block grant would eliminate the standards that guarantee americas children access to healthy meals there was an amendment adopted in the committee last week that said for the first year the states can all come up with 50 nutritional grant programs but at the end of that year there would be some national standards well we already have some national standards that apply whether you are in texas or new york or california we are building in additional costs into this program by having 50 states to develop their nutrition plans and then have to comply with some national standards the new schoolbased nutrition block grant would not respond to recessions or recoveries if this bill had been enacted in 1989 it would have resulted in the 70percent reduction in funding for school meals in 1994 alone between 1990 and 1994 the number of free lunches served to lowincome children increased by 23 percent during that period the number of free meals served in child care centers increased by 45 percent the block grants would not eespond to the change in the school population which is expected to increase by 4 to 6 percent in the state of texas alone we would lose 4 percent of our funding every september and all during the year we have new children who show up at our doors and qualify for these programs we are not only cutting 4 percent but if those new children show up they would not have it yesterday morning before i left houston i went to a nutrition program in the heights part of my district at the field elementary school that is a school that has 90 percent of their children have free or reduced lunch what 4 percent would we cut from those 90 percent of those children and next year when we have at least 20 more kids who show up or are qualified are we going to tell that principal or that teacher or that food service worker who does a hard job there that they cannot serve those children there are reforms we can do in the program but not cutting off the meals that those children have i saw that meal they had cereal they had the option of orange juice and milk a number of kids actually drank both the orange juice and the milk they had some little sausages i noticed this last friday the committee on agriculture cut the effort for the food stamp program i am glad they are concerned about that but i know we have some concern about the food stamp abuses but i know i saw those children eating that food i would hope that the republican majority would see the err of their ways on school nutrition and also change

time i rise in total opposition to term limits i oppose term limits because they are undemocratic and because they represent the ultimate in elitism for someone from some other part of the country to come to my district and tell my voters they cannot vote for me just because i happen to have been in office for 6 years or 8 years or 12 years is the ultimate insider mentality they are saying that they know more than the average voter in the average district around this country perhaps in their districts people want to elect parttime farmers or barnyard philosophers that is fine let them elect those people let them send them here to congress but my point is that it is up to each voter in each district to decide what person they want to elect to congress i must say that while it is very seldom that i agree with my friend the gentleman from illinois there is a lot to be said for the logic of retroactivity my feeling is that we should only amend the constitution if it represents an ultimate truth something about which there can be no debate for instance the 13th amendment abolished slavery now would those who favor term limitshave followed the logic in the 1860s of saying i am opposed to slavery but im not going to free my slaves until the amendment is adopted or im going to continue being a slave holder because the 13th amendment isnt adopted yet of course not if it is wrong if it is immoral if it somehow tears away at our country not to have term limits then lead by examplego home because otherwise what you are saying is that this is just a political issue that we use to get elected and as a republican i am very very concerned about this entire pernicious pattern of pandering and posturing by members who seem to have an unquenchable quest or an unquenchable thirst for selfflagellation it is part of an overall pattern where they are denouncing everything about the congress denouncing being a politician denouncing being a person committed to making change in government my feeling or my strong belief is that those of us who say we want change what we are really doing those of us who support term limits are saying that the voters in the districts are not smart enough to elect the proper members to congress and what could be more elitist what could be more antidemocratic what could be more of an insidethebeltway mentality than to be denying the voters of individual districts the right to elect the members of their choice just think i say to the republicans my fellow republicans of some of the outstanding members who would not have been elected if we had had term limits the voters of ohio would not have been allowed to reelect robert taft to his third term in the unitedstates senate the voters of illinois would not have been able to elect everett dirksen the voters of kansas would not have been allowed to reelect robert dole and on the democratic side outstanding leaders such as sam rayburn would not have been allowed to return to congress because someone in washington said that it is wrong for the people in texas or ohio or illinois to select the person they want to represent them in congress i am probably the last person in this body who could be accused of being an anglophile however the point is made about winston churchill he was a man who served over 40 years in the british parliament are we saying it was wrong or that it was immoral for winston churchill to be in the parliament at the time of world war h who among us would be better qualified would it have been that parttime farmer from some state would he have been a better speaker maybe he would have but let the voters in that district decide also one of the main arguments that we have used against congress in our incessant campaigns against congress has been the fact that staffs are too powerful nothing could make staffs more powerful than to have members rotating in and out and having a permanent unelected body of staff deciding the legislation deciding the procedures deciding the process i strongly believe that for a congress to be effective we need a whole range of members in this congress we need the institutional memory of someone like a henry hyde or a joe moakley"], [7.462501525878906e-05, 0.5000746250152588, 0, "i would not like to get to the end and the gentlewoman have 10 minutes remaining for one speaker to speak and we have

to do very much particuharly with regard to work requirements nd that iz what the democratic substitute does first on face value in t erma of the face work participation requirements the main bill is stronger than the sub stitute but we have to look beyond face value when we look at work requirements madam chairman at any given time if we take a snapshot of the welfare caseload at any given time there are people ccming on and people going off naturally without doing anything people are leaving the welfare caseload but others are coming en and historically it has been growing and we havl been paying more and more money the substitute would count people who leave naturally from the caseload towards meeting the work participation requirements that is like a 10percent bonus every year what it would mean is that in order to meet the work re uirements in the first year the governors would have to do very little they have to get another 4 percent of the caseload working that is the reason
