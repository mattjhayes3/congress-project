their legislative work in a hearing at the early stages of his leadership when we were allowed to present solutions they were not republican solutions or democratic solutions they were solutions for those of us who love america and i just want to simply reinforce that i thank mr skelton for his leadership i have legislation that declares a military success and i rise today to make it clear that i believe that the fallen in battle are heroes and those who still fight carry their banner for 3 611 have died and i dont know why were not on this floor declaring a military victory thanking our soldiers and my good friend from texas says thai he supports the iraq study group so do i and i have legislation we all have legislation that responds to the iraq study group i might remind him that that report bipartisan report speaks articulately to redeployment and so when we look at the costs of the war 120 billion americans are asking should one more drop of blood be shed and my answer to that is no should we engage yes should we involve in the surge of diplomacy absolutely we want to make sure that all of those nation states can work to help solve the divide the civil war but we must face the facts that this process that the president is continuing to repeat does not work it is wracked with corruption and misdirection there were no weapons of mass destruction as a member of the homeland security committee i have been disturbed this whole week as i listened to the secretary of homeland security speak about his gut feeling of the possibility of a terrorist attack im a member of that committee i live every day with the idea that the question will be asked by americans to the homeland security committee and the homeland security department does the secretary realize that we have fueled the fires of terrorism by training terrorists in this war and so when i speak of why we must end it is to save lives it is to reconcile iraq and it is to make america safer i ask for support of the underlying legislation i rise in strong support of h r 2956 the responsible redeployment from iraq act i rise in strong support of this legislation because i am listening and responding to the will of the american people last november 2006 americans went to polls by the millions united in their resolve to vote for change they voted for a new direction and a change in the bush administrations disastrous policy in iraq the new democratic majority heard them and responded by passing h r 1591 the iraq accountability act the president vetoed the bill demanding instead a continuation of the ancien r6gime under which the republicanled congress gave him a blank check to mismanage the occupation and reconstruction of iraq those days are over no matter how many veto threats the president issues this congress is not going to give him a blank check to escalate and continue the war ad infinitum it is long past time for change in iraq it is time for the people and government of iraq to take primary responsibility for their own country it is time for the president to recognize the reality on the ground in iraq the time when a surge in troops is useful and necessary is past it is now time to redeploy our troops and launch a diplomatic surge for national and political reconciliation in iraq h r 2956 will help achieve this goal and that is why i support the measure there is no more important issue facing the congress the president and the american people than the war in iraq it is a subject which agitates the passions of all americans including members of congress the framers understood that while the military does the fighting a nation goes to war that is why the framers lodged the power to declare war in the congress the branch of govemnment closest to the people they knew that the decision to go to war was too important to be left to the whim of a single person no matter how wise or wellinformed he or she might be four years ago president bush stood under a banner that proclaimed mission accomplished if the mission was to further place our troops in harms way at the hands of insurgents and sectarian violence then it is mission accomplished after spending more than 450 billion sacrificing the lives of 3 611 of americas finest citizensoldiers what have we accomplished and where are we headed i cannot support the presidents waging of a war that has no clear direction does not meet the benchmarks that the president set and has no visible target four years after launching the invasion conquest and occupation of iraq the evidence is clear and irrefutable the preemptive invasion of iraq while a spectacularly executed military operation was a strategic blunder without parallel in the history of american foreign policy this is what can happen when the congress allows itself to be stampeded into authorizing a president to launch a preemptive war of choice it is time to change our strategy in iraq it is time to engage the key stakeholders in the middle east and make real strides towards securing a just and lasting peace in iraq and for the iraqi people and most important bring our troops home so they can be reunited with their families friends and neighbors that is why i support h r 2956 the responsible redeployment from iraq act requires a responsible redeployment of unitedstates troops beginning within 120 days of enactment and ending by april 1 2008 the legislation requires the president to publicly justify the postredeployment missions for the unitedstates military in iraq and the minimum number of troops necessary to carry out those missions this legislation is consistent with the advice of military and foreign policy experts ensures the safety of our men and women in uniform addresses our commitment to fighting terrorism and reflects the will of the american people the need for a new direction in iraq could not be clearer in the face of mounting evidence that progress is not being made in iraq military leaders defense experts republican and democratic members of congress and the american people are demanding change yet the president continues to urge continued support for a failed policy that is not making america safer or supporting our troops in a report released today by the white house the administration concedes that violence continues in iraq and that the iraqi government has failed to meet key benchmarks endorsed by the president in january and political reconciliation is nonexistent by thebush administrations own admission there is unsatisfactory progress on all of the political reconciliation benchmarks announced by the president on january 10 2007 in fact just this week the national security network reported that since the president announced his surge policy 6 months ago more than 25 000 troops have been sent to iraq approximately 600 have been killed and more than 3 000 have been wounded president bush and vice president cheney have been given numerous chances and ample time by the american people and the congress to straighten out the mess in iraq they have failed it is little wonder that the criticism of the administrations failed policy in iraq is mounting by the day respected military leaders like ltg william odom have spoken forcefully according to lieutenant general odom no effective new strategy can be devised for the united states until it begins withdrawing its forces from iraq only that step will break the paralysis that now confronts us key republican senators are joining the chorus of critics in addition to foreign relations committee ranking member senator richard lugar some of the presidents allies in congress have spoken out senator pete domenici says theres no reason to wait trying to tell that he must change his ways because there is nothing positive happening senator elizabeth dole says it is my firm hope and belief that we can start bringing our troops home in 2008 senator lamar alexander says the president

orders also really for reminding us tonight of much of this unfinished business of our great country and laying out the glaring disparities that were witnessing in the african american community but also what our economic empowerment agenda is of the congressional black caucus so thank you congresswoman tubbs jones millions of americans are one paycheck that is if they have a paycheck away from poverty now the numbers speak for themselves gas prices are at record levels averaging in my district 3 73 a gallon even as oil is traded at over 100 a barrel and big oil companies are reaping in record profits foreclosures have skyrocketed putting hundreds of thousands of people out on the street the american dream of homeownership is quickly turning into a nightmare for many hardworking individuals and families in our country in my district in alameda county we are projected to lose nearly 4 700 homes to foreclosures due to the subprime mortgage crisis eliminating 3 2 billion in home equity value thats equal to a drop in home equity by almost 8 500 for each homeowner in my district meanwhile food prices have risen squeezing recipients of food stamps even as the number of people expected to enroll in the program will reach a record 28 million people in the next fiscal year health care costs are going through the roof even as this administration is posing massive cuts in funding for medicare and l4dicaid and african americans continue to be the hardest hit as of february 2008 the unemployment rate for african americans was over 8 3 percent nearly double the national average of 4 3 percent among the african american community poverty rates are 2 5 times higher than the national average even more disturbing almost 40 percent of african american children under 5 years of age live in poverty and all the while african americans continue to be the target for as we talked about earlier subprime loans african americans are three times more likely to have a subprime loan than whites accounting for 52 percent of all subprime loans and as the housing market has collapsed estimates indicate that african americans alone will lose between 164 to 213 billion in home equity value during this recession its long past time for congress to address the burden of this economic downturn on the african american community and other communities of color and address the ongoing lack of opportunity in minority communities in america even in the face of this massive housing crisis and impending recession growing unemployment and the highest number of applicants for food stamps since the programs inception the bush administration wants to cut funding mind you cut funding for the most vital programs so that he can continue to fund his failed occupation in iraq this is partly due to iraq billions of dollars that have beenspent this economic downturn i personally call this the iraq recession at nearly half a trillion dollars the occupation of iraq and the resulting iraq recession has wasted too much of american treasure drained too much of our american resources and most importantly claimed too many american lives and we cannot dismiss the toll that this occupation has had on the economic security of our nation and on the average american family who will feel the impact of these expenses for years to come the joint economic committee estimates the total bill for the war through 2008 will cost the typical family of four a full 16 500 can you imagine what a family of four can do with 16 500 this conflict has claimed the lives of more than 4 000 brave members of our armed forces and has resulted in injuries to more than 28 000 others five years after the invasion and occupation of iraq 47 million americans are living without health insurance 47 million and more than 36 million people continue to live in poverty at least 2 million of which have fallen into poverty since 2003 five years later it is projected that more than 2 million american families will lose their homes to foreclosure primarily over the next 2 years and worse as the demand is increasing for programs serving children the elderly and the poor and those facing the loss of their income more than half of our states face serious budget shortfalls that will force them to cut back or even eliminate programs that serve the most vulnerable of our populations so we must address the needs and the will of our country by bringing an end to this occupation and to the immeasurable costs that will continue to be exacted on the physical and economic security of the american people for generations to come fortyone years ago dr martin luther king was as he said compelled to see the war as the enemy of the poor and attack it as such of course dr king was referring to the vietnam war but his understanding of the relationship between the vast sums spent dropping bombs in a foreign country and the resulting lack of funding for programs that relieve hunger and poverty are just as true today as they were back then especially now with this economic downturn a recent survey revealed that 68 percent of americans believe that ending the war and occupation in iraq is an important step the unitedstates government must take to respond to the current economic recession so we must put an end to this occupation and we must fund a real economic stimulus plan that expands unemployment assistance and food stamp benefits provides housing assistance and foreclosure relief for homeowners and expands medicaid payments to states through the federal medical assistance percentage we need to pass a real bankruptcy reform bill i believe this one that were working on now is h r 3609 its called the emergency home ownership and mortgage equity protection act of 2007 that will give struggling homeowners a fighting chance to stay in their homes weve got to reauthorize and realize that hope vi is an important important housing initiative and pass h r 3524 to finally stop putting an end to predatory lending and instead of spending billions to bail out bear stearns we should really be investing that money to train our workforce and to expand green jobs and eradicate poverty so as we remember 3 years ago hurricane katrina served as a real rude wake up call to the nation and the continuing inequality that plagues minority communities especially the african communities in america katrina opened the eyes of many americans about the continuing burden of poverty that often isolates and traps generations of americans of color african americans in a cycle of poverty and disenfranchisement so we cannot ignore the legacy of katrina nor can we ignore the legacy of dr kings words so this week as we approach the 40th anniversary of dr kings assassination let us all make a commitment to honor his vision and his lifes work we must end this occupation of iraq and we must enact a real economic stimulus plan so that the american people can move forward take care of their families come out of this downturn and really begin to live the type of life the quality of life that they so deserve in the wealthiest and most powerful country in

the other side of the aisle or in this chamber dont think that thats a little too much to save then ill offer an amendment that says we ought to keep it at the presidents level the 0 6 percent increase what that would do would save about 1 1 billion i offered an amendment that said well there may be some people who believe that keeping it at last years level is not an appropriate level that keeping it at the level that the president and the administration requested is not an appropriate level that well then maybe we just ought to decrease it or reduce it by 1 percent now this isnt a 1 percent cut this would be a 1 percent reduction in the increase the increase is about 4 3 percent this would be a 1 percent reduction increasing it about 3 3 percent so if you didnt believe that we ought to keep it at last years number if you didnt believe that we ought to put it at the number that the president requested then you might believe that we ought to just reduce spending by 1 percent decrease it by 1 percent in the reduction of the increase and so we offered that amendment and then a final amendment overall amendment was offered by mrs musgrave the gentlelady from colorado she said in essence well you may not believe that we ought to keep it at last years amount you may not believe that we ought to go to the presidents amount you may not believe that you ought to cut 1 percent that may seem to be too much but you ought to believe that you could cut a half a percent you ought to believe that you could cut a half a percent so 50 cents out of every 100 that you ought to be able to cut that amount those four amendments were offered on the floor of the house today the fact is that each and every one of those amendments failed that the vast majority of the members of the majority party the democrat party voted against those to carry the day so that they believe that no you ought not keep the spending level as a matter of fact you ought not keep the spending level in this area of the budget to last year you ought not save 1 3 billion and they voted that you ought not have the amount of spending be at the level that the administration that the president requested this is the executive branch the branch that is responsible for carrying out the laws and the bills and the priorities that we pass here in congress you ought not keep it at that level you arent interested in saving 1 1 billion again a fact they also said as a matter of fact that you dont want to cut it 1 percent you dont want to have a reduction of 1 percent remember a reduction in the increase not a redaction in real numbers but a reduction in the increase none of these amendments would have reduced in real dollars all of them were a percentage reduction in the increase the majority party in fact as a majority said no we dont as a matter of fact want to reduce the increase by 1 percent also as a matter of fact they said that they didntwant to reduce it by onehalf of 1 percent they didnt want to realize savings that would result in a 50 cent savings out of every 100 spent by the federal government in the area of energy and water appropriations now i dont know about you but when times are tight in our household when times are tight in the household of my constituents when times are tight in households all across this nation when american families have times when they are spending more or budgeting more than is coming in what they do is they look at their budget they look at their family budget and say where can we save some money sometimes they say well well just cut everything a little bit well spend a little less on everything thats the similar story thats the analogy to the family budget but what this congress said what this majority party said is that no we dont believe that were not spending enough in fact we believe that we ought to spend more we ought to spend more than the increase last year we ought to spend more than was requested by the administration we just ought to spend more and so it rings on deaf ears when the majority party says and had said before the election in november we will rein in fedpral spending well thts is a clear example once again of what i have dubbed orwellian democracy after george orwell the famous author who famously in his books demonstrated that policies of governments oftentimes say one thing and do exactly the opposite thats what we find now in i believe this majority party is that they say one thing and do exactly the opposite so they say with a straight face that we are reining in government spending that we are reining in federal spending but in fact whats happening is a significant increase in federal spending and an increase of greater than the amount that they railed against last year which strikes me as being somewhat disingenuous and also misleading to the american people the american people go to the polls every 2 years and they vote based upon what people are going to tefl them what they are going to do i believe before that our side of the aisle had gotten a little wayward in terms ofspending so the message of reining in federal spending fell on receptive ears the problem is that it hasnt been followed up by action so its a leadership that continues to say one thing and to do another truly truly remarkable now i want to talk a little bit about the issue of taxes and the tax increases that will be required to cover the amount of spending that the new majorityhas begun to march down a path to spend the appropriations bill last week was an example of that the appropriations bill today was an example of that and most of them as they come up through the 12 bills of the appropriations process will indeed demonstrate the lack of fiscal responsibility so what the other side is going to have to do is to find revenue instead of doing what our party did and this president did and president reagan did and in fact president kennedy did in order to gain increased economic activity and in order to increase revenue to the federal government those three individuals president bush president reagan and president kennedy all decreased taxes in a somewhat nonintuitive kind of activity increased revenue to the federal government because when you decrease taxes what you do is you allow people to keep more of their money you allow them to keep more of their money in their back pocket and in their pocketbook hence they are able to decide for themselves when to save or when to spend or when to invest when they spend because they have more money what results is increased economic activity well the current majority party demonstrates clear differences between a conservative republican philosophy and a liberal democrat philosophy the difference is that we believe taxes ought to be reduced in order to increase economic activity the other side clearly believes that the taxes ought to be increased with the peculiar notion that if you just increase taxes enough you will gain enough revenue to the federal government to equal the appetite for spending so they passed a budget and their budget would increase taxes for every single american that pays taxes every single american that pays taxes the largest tax increase in the history of our nation was passed by this majority just a few short months ago when you ask well what would that cover what happens is that all of the tax the appropriate tax reductions of earlier in this decade 2001 an4 2003 if the budget that was adopted by this majority is allowed to proceed over the next number of years all of those tax reductions go away all of the tax increases come back what happens on december 31 2010 which isnt too far away what happens is that the tax rates on ordinary income go from 35 percent overnight to 39 6 percent the capital gains tax goes from 15 percent to 20 percent overnight dividends tax goes from 15 percent to 39 6 overnight estate tax this is the death tax this is what individuals individuals families their estate has to pay when they die it would be 0 percent on december 31 2010 under the majority partys budget and under the budget that they adopted again this is the largest tax increase in the history of our nation it will jump to 55 percent overnight in 1 second child tax credit which would rest at 1 000 in 2010 would decrease in half it would be cut in half decrease child tax credits by 50 percent down to 500 the lowest tax bracket those at the lower end of the economic spectrum who currently pay 10 percent would pay 15 percent a significant increase in their taxes nearly about half of what they would currently pay now it just doesnt make any sense to have that kind of tax policy in place when in fact what they have said before is that they would responsibly spend american hardearned taxpayer money and be fiscally responsible instead what they have done is gone back to a tried and true method of tax and spend so everybodys taxes nearly 400 billion will shoot up virtually overnight now in their budgetary process and that might be all right for some people that whole tax increase and gaining supposedly gaining new revenue for the federal government some people will say thats fine if you are really solving problems if you are truly solving problems then it may be appropriate for us to do that as you well know the largest problem that we have in our nation from a fiscal standpoint is the issue of entitlement spending automatic spending that occurs in our federal government programs primarily three programs social security medicare and medicaid this chart here outlines the percentage of the federal budget that goes for those programs these are the programs that are on automatic pilot they just kind of continued to increase because of the demographics of our society aging population the monies for these programs continue to increase year after year unless there is particular reform so in 1995 those three programs that are in this yellow portion of this pie chart here were about 48 7 percent of the federal budget in 2005 they measured 53 percent they are a little over 54 percent now in 2017 they will be 62 2 percent with no changes and within another oh 10 to 15 years beyond that they will consume the entire federal budget if the budget remains at its current level which is its historic rate now many of my constituents might say if you are going to increase taxes like the majority party has done by adopting the largest tax increase in the history of our nation nearly a 400 billion tax increase if you are going to do that that might be okay if you are going to olve real problems if you are going to solve real problems but the fact of the matter is that the budget didnt solve any of the problems none zero when we look at this graph this graph is evidence of the absolute emptiness of the promise that the majority party had to reform entitlement spending to reform automatic spending mandatory spending in our budget in 1997 we had 125 130 billion in appropriate reform and reductions the deficit reduction act in 2005 had about 43 billion in appropriate reductions the budget just adopted for the coming years by the new majority party had zero zero no money at all for appropriate fiscal reform responsible reform in the area of medicare medicaid social security those programs are social compacts with the american people but they are programs that left on their current course will not be able to survive they will not be able to survive so every day that we wait the problems get greater the solution gets more elusive for each of those programs so it is imperative itis imperative that we move forward i would challenge my friends on the other side of the aisle to join together with those of us who are interested in true fiscal responsibility and true entitlement reform and lets get it done lets get it done on behalf of the american people because frankly thats what they sent us here to washington to do to solve big problems this graph demonstrates that we are not solving big problems here as i say if you were going to increase significantly the amount of taxes that the american people are paying then many of them may say i think there is a better way to do it as i mentioned because i think tax reductions increase revenue to a greater degree to the federal government but many people across this nation might say well i am all right paying a little more taxes if we are solving real problems but not if were on a spending spree that appears to be what is occurring with this new majority this graph demonstrates the commitment to entitlement reform which apparently in this new majority is zero so i urge my colleagues to rethink the process and the policies thatthey put in place that will result in no significant entitlement reform as they are looking once again at their budget and at their policies i would urge them also to look back into history the next graph demonstrates clearly what kind of economic policy does work this graph could be a number of things that show that demonstrate negative growth or negative activity in the economy to positive activity in the economy over the years of this decade this graph as a matter of fact is the graph about job creation how many new jobs have been created in our nation since the beginning of 2001 as you can see what we have here for month after mohth after month after month between 2001 and 2003 virtually negative job growth during that period of time no new jobs in fact losing jobs in the economy for every single quarter with the exception of four during that 4year period something happened miraculously in the beginning of 2003 the early months of 2003 in this vertical line here that marks the beginning of moving toward quarter after quarter after quarter after quarter of increased job growth over 7 million new jobs since the summer of 2003 what happened at that time is as you know this is when the final appropriate tax reductions were adopted by the republican majority with this administration and this congress what that has resulted in is remarkable increase in job growth across our nation virtually every single state virtually every single state has seen increase in job growth over that period of time average job gain of 168 000 new jobs per month on average so one would think that if you were charged with coming up with economic policy for our nation that you would look back and say well this looks to be a pretty good program here that has resulted in significant job growth as i said before this could be economic development you could see a significant decrease in unemployment all sorts of things could go on these axis and you would see positive activity during this same period of time so if you were charged with coming up with economic policy for our nation one would think that you would look at this and say what happened what happened at that point that made the resulting number of quarters to the current time made it so productive how did we become so productive as a nation compared to where we were earlier in this decade well as i said what happened during that time was appropriate tax reductions making it so that individuals paid less of their hardearned taxpayer money that they are allowed to keep more of their money so that they decide when they spend or they save or they invest its those kinds of policies that have resulted in can significant economic growth and economic activity i would urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle as they are working through their process as they are trying to figure out how to make certain that we stay a global world competitive economic engine that what they ought to do is look into history just a few short years ago there was a policy that was adopted by this congress that resulted in remarkable remarkable economic activity so that we have the most economically productive nation in the world the industrialized world we continue to perform month after month after month one of the main reasons for that is indeed the decrease the appropriate reductions in taxes all across the nation so that anybody who has paid taxes pays fewer taxes less taxes today from a percentage standpoint than they did prior to that early point in 2003 thats what results in increasing economic activity its not something that is unique to these tax reductions in 2003 in fact thats what we saw when president reagan decreased taxes in the 1980s decreased taxes for the american people many folks said oh you cant do that you wont be able to fund the programs in the federal government but what happened is that as happened here it increased revenue to the federal government because you decreased taxes because you cut taxes and because you allow the american people to keep more of their hardearned money and thats what results in increasing economic activity and it hasnt only been on the republican side of the aisle democrats indeed have shown this same kind of discipline in the past when president kennedy in the early 1960s in fact cut taxes decreased taxes appropriate tax reductions for the american people because he knew that if you decrease taxes to the american people what happens is that they will determine for themselves responsibly when to save or to spend or invest and in fact that increases economic activity for our nation it points out one of the fundamental differences that i talked about between a conservative republican philosophy and a liberal democrat philosophy and that is that we believe that the american people know best how to spend their money not washington there are very few times when washington knows better how to spend someones money than themselves and it just makes common h6816 cc sense because only an individual only people know their priorities now there are certain things that we have to spend common money on without a doubt and we talked about one of those that we dealt with earlier today but theres a responsible way to do it and that responsible way to do it is to identify clearly identify those programs that ought to be absolute priorities and i would suggest that that is so many fewer programs than this federal government is currently undertaking but the democrat liberal majority has a mentality that tends to come from san francisco i guess which means that you just ought to spend just as much as you can get you just ought to spend as much as you can get and so im pleased to join with my colleagues and point out that the economic policies that have been successful in the past and will continue to be successful if theyre adopted are those policies that will result in more hardearned taxpayer noney being able to be kept by hardearned american taxpayers i just want to highlight once more a chart that demonstrates exactly that and that is that when you reduce taxes to the american people when you reduce appropriately taxes so that the american people can keep more of their hardearned money which is what occurred here in the early part of 2003 tax revenues were going down and down and down 3 straight years of decreases between 2000 and 2003 tax reductions occurred with thetax relief act being passed and then the revenues increased significantly so that greater revenues than ever seen by the federal government because of tax reductions and thats the kind of responsible economic policy that we believe that i believe ought to be put in place and kept in place so that you decrease the tax burden on the american people you allow them to determine when they save or they spend or they invest their own money and then what happens is that the economy flourishes because theres more money available to drive the economy more jobs created more economic activity more independence and more liberty more liberty and more freedom because when people are able to keep their own money theyre freer theyre freer to make decisions about how they indeed spend or save or invest their own money so were talking some economic policy tonight and hopefully well be able to encourage our friends on the other side of the aisle to adopt some of these commonsense reforms im pleased to be joined by my good friend from texas whos going to talk a little bit also about some economic

proposed rule for consideration of the alternative minimum tax but i want to thank him for his friendship in the committee and the professional nature of the way he conducts himself today we are going to debate a tax increase on america no surprise the american public has gotten used to this the taxandspend democrat congress the new congress the new way to run washington d c has resulted in not only economic failures here in this country the last 18 months but also higher gas prices the inability that we have to control the flow in energy that comes into this country and has made us now more than ever to where we have to go get our energy overseas send our money overseas and not be able to be energy sufficient here in this country but now i find out that the excuse for raising taxes on americans today is that theres a loophole in the tax lawa loopholeand unintended consequences the bottom line is that its the tax law it was therefore reasoned and the opportunity for us to grow our economy and build jobs and have job creation and to protect the american consumer is why these were parts of the tax law it is not unintended consequences it is not a loophole it is the law the tax law of the united states that i am very proud of and i am disappointed to see that the congress today will be debating new tax increases on the american people so i rise in strong opposition to this closedi rule yet another closed rule by this new majority that we have here and to the underlying legislation which takes the baffling approach once again of raising taxes on americans and on the american economy during a downturn of our economy rather than taking a way to prevent a tax increase on hardworking and unsuspecting middle class taxpayers which sets the stage for evenmore jobkilling tax increases in the very near future just to prevent the current lowtax policies that republicans in congress worked so hard to pass and to support on behalf of american taxpayers i think its interesting that when republicans bring tax bills to the floor of the house of representatives we are able to tout how many jobs our tax bill will create how many jobs the economy will create i have never ever heard of a democrat taxandspend bill that then touts how many jobs will be created because they dont they kill jobs they kill jobs in america every time we do what we are doing today with the new democrat majorit to raise taxes on america under the democrats flawed policy of payasyougo logic used to defend this legislation in just 2 short yearswhen a number of critically important tax policies like the 1 000 republican tax credit and the republican lower tax rate on income and capital gains and dividends are set to expire that created job growththe new democrat majority payasyougo rules will require more than 3 5 trillion in tax increases and that is what they stand for today increasing taxes on the american people killing jobs all across the country and yet they want to blame president bush just incredible it makes no sense to me why we are hamstringing our economy and saddling working families with higher taxes when revenues arent the problem washington is already collecting more taxes as a percentage of gdp than the historical average over the last 40 years we dont have a revenue problem we have a spending problem what washington really has is a spending problem that this new democrat majority cant fix and cant solve because they are all about taxing and spending federal spending is higher by nearly 530 billion more than the congressional budget offices 2000 projection for the year 2007 so going back to 2000 and they projected how much money we would need to spend we are 530 billion more this year thanks to a new democrat majority making increased spending the main reason why 99 percent of our nations worsened budget picture over the last 7 years is occurring we have got a downturn in the economy because we are raising taxes and spending to support a bloated government the american people have known for a long time that republican members of congress support an economically responsible solution to solving the alternative minimum tax problem just contrast this years republican budget proposal which prevented expansion of the amt for the next 3 years and achieved full repeal in 2013 with the democrat budget if you compare them the democrat budget which jammed a 70 billion tax increase into our economy to pay for simply a temporary 1year fix and did nothing about amt for the next 5 years after that a 1year fix raising taxes 70 billion rather than fixing the problem taxpayers are already aware that last month house republicans unanimously supported a clean amt patch without tax increases to prevent more than 25 million familiesincluding 21 million families who didnt owe amt in 2007from paying an additional 61 5 billion thats going to come due this next april just like we did in december of last year and just like we will continue to do if republicans once again become the majority party in congress what taxpayers may not realize is that house democrats used to be for the same thingat least that was until they won the majority and with it came the opportunity to salivate to get all this money and to couple what used to be a bipartisan commonsense tax prevention policy with massive unnecessary tax hikes that burden this country and for 18 months we have seen the promise of higher taxes and its killing our economy as recently as last december the house passed a clean amt patch without crippling the economy with tax increases by an overwhelming majority of 35264 the only thing worse than house democrats taxandspend flipflops on this issue is the fact that their comrades in the other bodyincluding finance chairman max baucushave already recognized the reality that at the end of this day the amt patch will not be paid for and that this cynical exercise meant to provide political cover is in fact deadonarrival the moment it passes this house but let it be said its another opportunity for the new democrat majority to show how much they want tax increases to ruin our economy the cost of this political gamesmanship is really quite simple the exposure of millions of middle class taxpayers to an average tax increase of 2 400 and the increased likelihood of a repeat of last years mismanaged process in which the late enactment of the patch prevented the irs from processing amtaffected returns until about 4 weeks into the filing season it was a disaster this year as a result of the new majority what is worse is how the democrat congress proposed to raise the additional 61 billion of additional taxes just to prevent this tax increase thats right we are going to have a tax increase on the tax increase on middle class families who were never intended to pay this first and rather unsurprisingly this democrat drillnothing congress helps repeal a tax deduction that helps american companies to produce energy for american consumers but they are going to take that advantage away from consumers it will only hurt energy exploration in this country and now what we are going tosee is that the american consumer will pay more at the pump while this proposal is laifghable at best for everyone tuning in on cspan across america today it is about par for the course for the democrat party that also thinks that suing opec not increasing the supply of american energy will help bring down prices for consumers second this bill increases taxes on entrepreneurs that create jobs and improve failing companies and raises the longterm capital gains rate on them from 15 to 35 percent or even higher so the people that are the goose that are laying the golden egg are once again slaughtered by this new democrat proposal once again i know that most people around this country watching this debate understand that raising taxes on job creators reduces jobs and hurts our economy but dont worry you can blame president bush for that for the actions of this congress unfortunately this proposal is not a surprise coming from a democrat congress that believes when real estate and credit markets are at their weakest that is the optimal time to raise taxes and send our economy over the edge finally the bill goes back on americas word by increasing taxes on transactions with treaty countries by mandating a new reporting requirement on private companies so that the irs can know directly how much is being paid to merchants every year including the social security or tax identification numbers associated with those transactions i have got to hand it to the new democrat majority every single week they find out a new way to assault the taxpayer every single week they find a way to raise taxes to increase spending and more rules and regulations they did it again this week congratulations to the new democrat majority i strongly oppose this tax increase and i will tell you that will continue to stand up on the side of taxpayers and middle class americans who say enough is enough i reserve the balance of my time"], [0.00013232053606770933,

illnesses the congress must say no and override his veto thursday so that our children have access to regular checkups preventative care and a primary physician we must stand with the american people who overwhelmingly support increasing access to childrens health care we must stand with nearly every single health organization every single childrens organization in america like the american medical association the american academy of pediatrics the childrens defense fund easter seals the march of dimes and countless others who support their bill because they all understand the devastating impact of being uninsured we must stand with the largest health insurance trade association in the country americas health insurance plans who praised expanding the state childrens health insurance program as a vital step in ensuring the health security of millions of americas children sadly i believe like many of us believe that the president is totally disconnected from the reality of our childrens lives he has asked congress for another 190 billion 190 billion to fund his occupation of iraq while he has vetoed a fraction of that amount for our children this is a shortsighted assault on our nations children and we cannot stand for it this program is one of the most successful programs in the nation and it should be reauthorized and it should be expanded when i was a state senator in california i helped write the california state program called healthy families and now healthy families provides lowcost access to health care for over 800 000 children more than any other state the flexibility built into schip has allowed california to provide access to health dental and vision coverage for children and also let me just say that if this doesnt get overridden we dont know what is going to happen in california like in other states so this needs to continue comprehensive health coverage for children is also a very vital step towards eliminating the continuing health disparities that plague minority populations including 800 000 asian pacific americans 1 4 million african americans and 3 4 million hispanics providing health care coverage for our children is one of

for our men and women who are defending liberty and fighting tyranny and fighting terror around the world dont mesh they dont mesh there are some who get it right though throughout congress some members of the majority party who anderstand and appreciate what their leadership is trying to do one of those is senator joseph lieberman from connecticut speaker pelosi was quoted as saying democrats have proposed a different course of action over and over again we have suggested a different plan and senator lieberman was very sage when he said any alternatives that i have heard ultimately dont work they are all about failing they are all about withdrawing and i think allowing iraq to collapse would be a disaster for the iraqis for the middle east and for us slow bleed slow bleed that is a sad and dangerous time when we find our majority party here in the united states house of representatives supporting a policy that would remove the ability for our troops to do what they must do to defend our liberty what is our principle on our side of the aisle what is the republican principle well the principle is that our troops incombat deserve to be sent the resourses and the reinforcemepts that they need to succeed in their mission in iraq without strings and without delay without strings and without delay we have as a matter of fact a piece of legislation that would do just that representative sam johnson from texas a war hero truly a war hero an individual who spent years in a prisoner of war camp in vietnam an individual who knows of the challenges that troops face when involved with an enemy that is ferocious but an individual who understands and appreciates that from this chamber from that congress you cannot micromanage a war and when you attempt to do that as a congress when you attempt to have 435 members of congress who want to all be generals or 100 members of the united states senate who want to all be generals or commanders in chief when you have that it doesnt work it cant work it is impossible so if you want to have the vote i tell my friends i ask my friends i challenge my friends in the majority party if you want to have the vote on whether or not we ought to simply cut off the funding to support our troops in iraq and afghanistan let us have that vote let us have that vote i would be interested in the outcome of that i doubt we would get 100 votes in support of that and it wouldnt because that is not what the american people want the american people dont want failure and that is the prescription that the democrats the majority party are giving us we have a bill house resolution 511 introduced by representative sam johnson as i mentioned and it is very simple it states what the prihciple ought to be when american military forces are in harms way and that principle says as this resolution says congress will not cut off or restrict funding for units and members of the armed forces that the commander in chief has deployed in harms way in support of operation iraqi freedom and operation enduring freedom that is it that is it the problem with that is that that doesnt fit the bumpersticker politics of the majority party that doesnt fit the orwellian democracy of the majority party that doesnt fit the hypocritical actions that are being taken by the majority party and consequently this bill is languishing in committee there is a discharge petition which as you know is a petition that members of the house of representatives can sign to be able to bring legislation out of the committee when it is against the will of the leadership that discharge petition was begun today what it allowsis members of the house of representatives when there are a majority of them and that takes 218 members when there is a majority of them who sign that then that bill then comes to the floor of the house for a vote so i challenge my friends on both sides of the aisle house resolution 511 sign the discharge petition this is principle this is principle this is truth this is the kind of support that our men and women deserve it is not feigned support it is not orwellian support it doesnt say yes i support you and then pull the rug out from under you it is not hypocritical support it doesnt say we want to support you so very very much but we are not going to do what it takes this says it all it says that we will not cut off or restrict funding for units or members that are deployed in harms way whycant we have a vote on that mr speaker what are they afraid of mr speaker what are they afraid of i would suggest they are afraid of the fact that this would pass on the floor of the house of representatives this bill would pass and because it doesnt fit their political agenda their political agenda then i doubt that we will see it unless we can get 218 members of the house of representatives to sign the discharge petition so what about this bill that they are going to bring to the floor what about this supplemental bill that the majority party is planning to bring to the floor this week of course we have been told it would be earlier than this so they seem to be having some difficulty within their own ranks in garnering support but what the bill does as we understand it is to put in place an inflexible timeline an inflexible timeline that says that the troops must come home regardless of what is happening on the ground unless the mission is completely accomplished in essence well as you know in battle and in war it is just not possible to have 535 commanders in chief that is not the way our system works not the way it ought to work not the way our founders envisioned it in fact it is curious when the articles of confederation were written and our nation was formed some of the aspects of those articles didnt work very well so the match 20 2007 cc founders ofour great nationgot together in a constitutional convention and they worked on issues to try to make certain that this federalist system this united states could come together and work together and one of the first things that they did was recognize that in the articles of confederation there were no provisions for a commander in chief so one of the easiest things that they were able to do was to get consensus on the fact that the commander in chief ought to be one individual and that that individual ought to be the president of the united states and the executive branch and that that was the only way to work it because obviously you couldnt have countless members of the house of representatives or countless members of the united states senate who were functioning as commanders in chief it doesnt work and they recognized that so putting in place an inflexible timeline that culminates with a date certain for the withdrawal micromanages our commanders in the field and it undermines the efforts of our troops on the ground i believe that i believe that putting in place the kind of artificial timelines and artificial constraints on our commanders on our generals on our troops would be a disaster it doesnt make any sense all it does is make political points and that isnt fact isnt fact it is just not republicans who believe that that would be the wrong course there is a remarkable orchestra of individuals and groups all around the nation that are standing up now and speaking out against the foolishness of that kind of proposal i cite for you the washington post now the washington post is a wonderful newspaper it has been around for a long time but nobody would contend that the washington post was a very conservative newspaper or a great friend of conservative thought nobody would contend that but what does the washington post say about this plan of the majority about the democrat plan they say it is an attempt to impose detailed management on a war without regard for the war itself that was written on march 13 just 1 week ago an attempt to impose detailed management on the war without regard for the war itself what volumes that speaks when you think about where it is coming from it is not coming from individuals who would have any political chip no political reason to embarrass the majority party or to call them out on a policy that may not necessarily be very sound what that does is demonstrate that they understand and appreciate the consequence of adopting what is supposed to come to this floor this week as the iraq war supplemental would be devastating for the nation of iraq for the middle east for the united states and yes for the world we have heard a lot about the iraq study group the iraq study group was the bipartisan group that got together actually a group that began because representative frank wolf a republican in this house added it to a piece of legislation that was passed almost a year ago what it said is that we ought to have a bipartisan group get together and work in a non political way to make recommendations to the executive branch and to congress about how to move forward in iraq they came up with a number of recommendations we hear it all the time from the other side that the iraq study group didnt endorse this or didnt propose this or didnt support that that they supported a withdrawal of the troops from iraq that they didnt support any escalation in the number in fact if you look on page 73 of the iraq study group that is another fact if you look on page 73 of the iraq study group report it in fact supports an escalation a small escalation of the number of troops in iraq what they also did was oppose a date certain for withdrawal again a fact i quote from one of the cochairman former secretary of state james baker who said in testifying before the united states senate committee on foreign relations the study group set no timetables and we set no deadlines we believe that military commanders must have the flexibility to respond to events on the ground i hope that my colleagues here in the house heard that i hope that they are listening because what they are saying what the iraq study group said is exactly what we are saying now and that is that this supplemental bill that has artificial timetables and artificial deadlines that are capricious and politically motivated clearly that that kind of action is not appropriate it wasnt called for by the iraq study group and would not allow the military commanders to have the flexibility that they need to succeed how about the los angeles times again not a paper in our nation that has tended to be terribly friendly to conservatives or republicans the los angeles times in an editorial on march 12 when it had reviewed what the majority party was proposing in this supplemental iraq war resolution to fund the hard incredibly diligently working men and women who are defending liberty what did the los angeles times say well the los angeles times called for the bill to be vetoed vetoed why would they do that i appreciate our receiving a message from the senate the message from the senate is that a senate bill was passed and we are pleased to see that we look forward to the time when the senate will take up some of the legislation that the house majority has passed that they have been so terribly proudof and look forward to working in concert on that legislation but i was talking about the supplemental war resolution that will come forward the bill that will provide for appropriate funding of our troops in harms way defending liberty and defending us and the proposal that is coming from the majority party is a proposal that would micromanage the operations of our troops it is a proposal that has been described as slow bleed which is a proposal that means that you will defund you will remove the funding from the men and women who are working so valiantly to defend us that is not just an opinion from our side of the aisle that is an opinion from all over many people are recognizing that the washington post as i mentioned had an editorial that criticized the majority party for coming forward with it the iraq study group supports in fact a minor small escalation in the number of troops and never said never said that they agreed with artificial timelines the los angeles times again a paper that has not been noted for its friendliness to our side of the aisle called for the bill to be vetoed they called for the bill to be vetoed why did they do so they said it is absurd for house speaker nancy pelosi to try to micromanage the conflict and the evolution of iraqi society with arbitrary timetables and benchmarks that is a fact march 12 of this year the los angeles times calls the war supplemental absurd and what about the national intelligence estimate the national intelligence estimate which was released in january warned of the dangers of early troop withdrawal they said that if coalition forces were withdrawn rapidly during the term of this estimate we judge that this almost certainly would lead to a significant increase in the scale and scope of sectarian conflict in iraq i think it is important to give credibility to the national intelligence estimate those are the folks that determine in an objective way in a non political way what are the consequences or prospective consequences of actions that this nation takes this poster here talks about the consequences of failure it is important that we talk about the consequences of failure because many people not just on our side of the aisle but many people around this nation including the washington post including the los angeles times have concluded for themselves that the proposal that the majority party has put forward is a bill that will result in defeat or failure in iraq so it is important that we look at the consequences of failure for our nation what are the consequences of failure this is from the national intelligence estimate what they say is that iraqi security forces would be subject to sectarian control that interference by neighboring countries would occur in an open conflict that means iran syria other neighboring countries that massive civilian casualties and population displacement would occur massive civilian casualties i wonder if the majority party the leadership in the majority party has considered the consequences of that what would happen al qaeda in iraq would plan increased attacks inside and outside of iraq and spiraling violence and political disarray including kurdish attempts at autonomy in kirkuk clearly clearly failure failure will result in a much worse situation for the people in iraq the people in the middle east i would suggest much more danger in the middle east and for our friends in israel and it would result in a much more dangerous situation i believe for the united states of america so what are they doing what is the other side doing to try to pass this piece of legislation this hypocritical piece of legislation this piece of legislation that they are having such difficulty doing because again what the american people want and what they in their rhetoric what the majority party in their rhetoric say are two completely different things so what are they having to do well they are having to use a lot of what has come to be known in this town as pork the original estimate for the bill was about 100 billion about 100 billion the other side has now added over 20 billion to the bill and what are they doing mr speaker they are buying votes they are buying votes i would suggest that an emergency bill this is an emergency bill to fund our troops is not the appropriate vehicle for unrelated spending either foreign or domestic our troops ought not be bargaining chips our troops ought not be bargaining chips that is what the majority party is doing quoted here in a publication here in washington earlier this month it says democratic leaders see this emerging strategy as a way to encourage their liberal members to vote for the supplemental budget bill this emerging strategy is buying votes adding all sorts of items to the bill curiously this party the majority party ran in their campaign on this wonderful issue of fiscal responsibility financial responsibility making certain that everything that came through congress was paid for they call it paygo payasyougo make certain that you have got the resources in place in order to pay for whatever proposal you are moving forward well they have virtually thrown that out the window we have had a number of amendments on bills that would hold their feet to the fire and make certain that they were accountable on this paygo issue and they have defeated everything that would make them accountable they are doing the same thing here they willfully abandoned their pledge of fiscal responsibility not long ago they pledged to follow payasyougo budget rules and spending restraints to curb the deficit and this bill would not be subject to paygo last year it is important to appreciate that house republicans rejected a 14 billion increase in nonemergency spending that the senate tried to attach to an emergency troop funding bill 14 billion was saved for the american taxpayer in a bill that came to the floor of the house from the senate just last year under a different majority we saved 14 billion the majority party now is going to spend if they have their way with this bill at least 21 billion more than has been requested that is important because this is an emergency bill and as such it doesnt come under the normal budgetary rules so if they are able to spend 21 billion in this piece of legislation then what happens is that they dont need to spend that 21 billion in the normal course of activity in the normal budgetary process so it frees up another 21 billion and in fact what you get is 42 billion of more spending extra spending but our troops deserve the resources that should be in this bill the finite resources the resources that the president and the generals and the commanders in the field have requested they should be able to receive those resources now not after not after our friends on the other side of the aisle in the majority party carry out this incredible political charade of voting on a bill that will never become law in its current form because the senate the senate wont go along they have in essence said so there are some incredible quotes that i have regarding this issue of micromanaging the war and this issue of loading the bill up with pork there is a democratic claim earlier this year just last week as a matter of fact frbm majority leader steny hoyer who said there is no micromanaging of the war period as you know i already have outlined that individuals outside of the republican party and the republican cause have reached the conclusion that yes in fact this is micromanagement again the los angeles times editorial where they said it is absurd that they try to micromanage the war the washington post editorial said in short the democratic proposal to be taken up this week is an attempt to impose detailed management on a war without regard for the war itself aggressive oversight is quite different from mandating military steps according to an inflexible timetable even some of their own members have reached the conclusion that this indeed is micromanaging the war representative dan boren of oklahoma said just 2 weeks ago it is still micromanaging of the war this plan that our friends on the other side of the aisle have truly does a disservice to the discussion does a disservice to the debate makes it seem that all votes are for sale here in washington to members of the house really it is a cynical ploy spending the kind of money they are proposing to spend is not helpful at all where are they planning to put some of that money it is important to look at that we talk about the iraq emergency war supplemental an extra 21 billion where would some of that money go well 1 8 billion in crop disaster assistance it may be appropriate money to be spent but in an emergency war supplemental it is absolutely the wrong place if you will recall if this house if this majority party has its way and puts that money there what it will allow them to do is increase somewhere else spending by 1 8 billion and follow their shadow paygo rules 60 million for salmon fisheries it truly is a cynical ploy on the part of this majority party if they continue to march down this road of packing this legislation with all sorts of extraneous spending that nobody in their logical correct factual truthful mind could conclude was related to the emergency war supplemental 60 million for salmon fisheries 25 million for spinach growers spinach growers may indeed need some emergency assistance but in an emergency war supplemental i think not 50 million for asbestos abatement in the capitol and it goes on and on and on as we know there are very specific guidelines in this bill for our troops very specific dates about when they must be at a certain place in the accomplishment in the engagement in the execution of the challenges that they have before them very specific in this bill there is very specific language about the amount of money that is available for the troops and when it would be cut off if in fact those arbitrary timelines and benchmarks were not met but mr speaker i learned this afternoon something very very interesting and that is there is a significant amount of money for livestock american livestock in this bill that is real pork if you will it may be upwards of billions of dollars but i cant tell you exactly what it is because in the language of the bill it says that the amount of money that will be available for this livestock provision will be such sums as may be necessary that is unlimited and it struck me as truly ironic and sad that this majority party this democrat leadership believes we ought to have an unlimited amount of funds for livestock in this nation and a finite and limited amount of money for our troops in the field that contrast just speaks volumes it speaks volumes about the cynicism with which this hquse is being led about the hypocrisy by which this bill is being brought to the floor an unlimited amount of money for livestock in america and finite limited amounts of money and arbitrary guidelines arbitrary timelines for our troops in the field it saddens me it saddens me to serve in a body where the majority party has a leadership that is that cynical and brings the debate and the items that we discussed here on the floor of the house to a point that is so very very trite really so very very trite i have only a few minutes left and i wanted to spend a few moments discussing the larger issue the larger war qn terror i think it is important we do that because when the american people think about the issue in iraq and whether or not we ought to be there and the debate can be had about whether or not we ought to be there and that is an appropriate debate to have and i wish we could have an honest and open debate and an honest and open vote on whether or not we ought to be there a single vote on that but the majority party has seen not to bring that kind of open and honest debate to the floor of the house of representatives but when americans think about what is going on in the world they understand and appreciate that however things have been executed or delivered in iraq the activity that has gone on on behalf of the american people in iraq although they may have problems with that they understand and appreciate that the bigger picture the larger war on terror is a challenge that we must recognize in america and we all must face it is a challenge and the facing of an enemy the likes of which we have never seen you dont have to go far to find examples of that in fact the best examples i have found are those that come from the selfproclaimed enemies themselves this is a quote from abu musab aizarqawi an individual with whom we had as far as i know no concerns before he decided that he wanted to become a mortal enemy of the free world he acted upon that in a way that has been extremely treacherous he said we have declared a fierce war on this evil principle of democracy and those who follow this wrong ideology well that is a little chilling but it is important that we recognize that is the nature of the enemy in this war on terror the consequences of not engaging and not being certain that we prevail in this war on terror the consequences of failure in that activity would deliver a death knell to our society the issue is as large as that i try to visit schools in my district the sixth district of georgia as often as possible and i like to talk to young people and get their perspective on their life and what they see in the future most of them are very very hopeful and i share that hope and optimism for the future of our nation but oftentimes when we are talking about government and talking about politics and talking about the issues of the day i will ask them especially the middle school students and the high school students i will ask them do you believe the united states will continue to survive forever and it is an interesting question because it forces one to think well what allows us to survive right now what has been put in place that allows us to survive right now most young people when you ask them that question they have not really ever thought about that they have not thought about what has brought about the preservation of our nation the longest surviving democracy in the history of the world it is a remarkable question to ask most of them have not ever thought about it but when they do think about it they understand the gravity of the question they understand that there are challenges in this world they understand there are people like abu musab a1zarqawi out there who want to see the end of our nation as we know it that is not our opinion that is his stated fact that is what he has said that he wants to do so the gravity of the challenge that we have facing us is real and the magnitude of it is remarkable and the ferocity of the enemy is unlike any we have ever faced when i get individuals to tell me well if you just think about this in the way we fought world war ii or previous wars in which we prevailed then you will appreciate we need to do x y and z but i would suggest that the enemy that we are up against is not like any enemy we have faced if you dont believe me all you have to do is think about the terrorist plot and the attacks that were foiled because of the wonderful intelligence work on the part of great britain and the united states and pakistan last august and that plot as you will remember was a plot to bring down at least 10 or more civilian airlines carrying enough people who were flying across the atlantic ocean to bring them down in a terrorist act so they could kill more people than were killed on 9 11 so they had to have 10 or a dozen planes that they would work in concert to bring down that plot was foiled that was a real plot that was a real plan on the part of our enemy and that plan itself is chilling enough but when you realize and appreciate that two of the individuals who were apprehended and had participated in the planning of that and were intent on carrying out that act were a married couple a mom and a dad with an 8monthold child and they were going to use that 8monthold childs baby food in the airplane to be the vessel for carrying the bomb on board they were going to kill themselves and their 8monthold child and bring down a plane and kill as many lhnocent civilians as they could mr speaker that is an enemy whose ferocity we cant even comprehend that is an enemy who says we have declared a fierce war on this evil principle of democracy and those who follow this wrong ideology that is an enemy the likes of which we have never seen and that is an enemy that requires that we in the united states house of representatives work in concert together that understand and ap preciate the gravity of our time of this time and make certain that we do all that we can to follow the principles that have allowed us to become the longestsurviving democracy on the face of the earth part of those principles are embodied in the united states constitution part of that united states constitution that has allowed us to prevail and to have the greatest amount of success and provide the greatest amount of freedom for the greatest number of people ever in the history of mankind part of those principles stipulate that there is one commander in chief not 535 so if the majority party wants to have a vote about whether or not we want to end the funding for the battle that our commander in chief believes we must be engaged in in order to make this next step in the larger war on terror if the majority party wants to have that vote then lets have that vote but to do so as they are planning to do this week in a cynical and hypocritical way to load up the bill with so much extraneous spending tens of billions of dollars in order to buy votes to pass this hypocritical and cynical bill that micromanages this incredibly important endeavor that we are engaged in right now is wrong it does an injustice and a disservice to not just this body but our entire nation i urge my colleagues to encourage leadership on both sides of the aisle to support that open and honest debate i know on our side we are ready for that debate we are ready for that debate i would hope that the speaker and the democrat leadership would encourage and support that debate as well 0l 2115 it is an incredible privilege to come to the floor of the house and share these words i thank my leadership for that opportunity it is very humbling to serve in the united states house of representatives a body in which 10 000 or 11 000 or so individuals have served in the history of our nation it is a great responsibility in serving in this body but the primary responsibility is to make certain that we do all that we can to preserve and protect our constitution and our nation i would suggest humbly that the bill thatis being proposed by the majority leadership this week on the supplemental emergency war resolution is not a bill that does a service to our nation and does credit to the work of this house of representatives i urge my colleagues to

from washington voting in favor of the amendment let me take this opportunity to clear up what must be a further misunderstanding on the part of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle contrary to what my good friend the gentleman from washington would have us believe the amendment was not the modified bishop amendment and i can assure you that the rules committee did not hijack any portion of the amendment submitted by our good friend and former member of the rules committee the gentleman from utah the provision in the rule was based ori language passed on april 9 2008 during consideration of h r 2016 the national landscape conservation system act and it was done to address a concern that a number of members had about the bill the amendment was offered by mr altmire of

also want to point out that the selfexecuting language in the rule is not an unusual or unprecedented procedure it was done numerous times when the other side was in the majority as my good friend from california alluded to in committee testimony on tuesday its a legitimate tool available to address concerns in a bill the amendment that we are selfexecuting is nearly identical to the altmire

of times we have seen oil climb to record 145 a barrel and we have also seen big oil companies continue to post record profits lets go over a few of the points that have happened in the past years the president signed into law legislation including landmark provisions to make cars and trucks more fuel efficient and to promote more affordable american biofuels that all happened because we passed it in this house and provided leadership on this the new fuel standards will reduce our oil consumption by 1 1 million barrels a day in 2020 onehalf of the current unitedstates imports from the persian gulf and will save american families 700 to 1 000 per year at the pump the house also passed legislation to suspend the filling of the strategic petroleum reserve and just this week the speaker called on the president to unilaterally start releasing oil from the strategic petroleum reserve in order to try and bring down the cost of oil on the world market a very responsible proposal we have also voted to invest in homegrown american biofuels in the farm bill we voted to provide tax incentives for renewable energies and energy efficiency and plugin vehicles and creating hundreds and thousands of green jobs we further voted to reduce public transit fares for commuters pinched by the pump we voted to crack down on oil price gouging and in fact were looking into more of that weve directed the cftc to use its full authority to curtail excessive speculation in the markets and other practices which may be distorting the energy market in fact the ag committee as we speak is meeting to look into this matter and plans another hearing tomorrow we have voted to hold opec accountable for oil price fixing and we have called on the repeal of subsidies to profitrich big oil so we can invest in renewable energy futures further i think its important for us as members to look at who in fact is moving to block the lowering of our prices at the pump a general blanket statement that we c n make that i have observed is you put oil people in the white house and you can expect oil prices to go up president bush and republicans have blocked virtually every step that we have tried to make to lower gas prices for the american people some of these steps have been cracking down on oil price gouging which was opposed by 140 republicans the first time and 145 republicans the second time

efficiency was opposed by 174 republicans including every member of the republican leadership increasing commodity futures trading commission oversight authority to prevent manipulation of energy

4ave initially opposed suspending the strategic oil petroleum reserve and while the president signed it into law it was only after issuing veto threats the president vetoed the farm bill twice which included the cftc provisions and the historic investment in american biofuels i mention all these in the context of my good friend from washington bringing up that mr clinton vetoed in 1995 a bill that was put forward on energy the republican party in this house is still blaming president clinton for problems 13 years after the fact when they have been in control of this house and the

committee most americans believe that dependence on foreign oil is a problem and alternative energy sources deserve our support particularly after 9 11 the recent election season saw such high consumer gas prices and high anxiety about energy security but let us look at another industry very cold weather in southern california is causing loss of fruits and vegetables and ranchers in the midwest are losing cattle because of the cold weather the farmeis and ranchers who still have crops and livestock stand to make a lot of money from the price spikes that we are seeing literally as we stand here on the floor today are we blaming those farmers and ranchers for the high prices are we going to cut farm benefits and raise taxes on the farmers no but for some reason when we have cold winters and hot summers and hurricanes in the gulf that raise gas prices we all get mad at energy suppliers it is the easy way out to get mad at the industry since most of our country just uses energy and does not produce it we have a budget deficit and funds for new alternative energy programs are in short supply so industry is being targeted for this purpose i understand why my colleagues are choosing to do this but this plan carries a significant risk of being counterproductive especially in the near future h r 6 exempts the oil and gas industry from a recent manufacturing tax benefit cuts geological expense to major energy producers and requires new payments on 19981999 offshore leases to make up for serious government errors in the original contracts these provisions raise 14 billion over 10 years for clean alternative energy programs that congress will establish through regular order that is why i support this bill that 14 billion will be used for alternatives through the regular order of this congress through our committee process these tax provisions reduce incentives for domestic production and could increase dependence on foreign oil and lng which hurt national security with current high oil prices we may not miss these incentives as much if prices were low but the effects could be very real in the long term however the 100 hours energy bill is a compromise within the democratic caucus to promote alternative energy for the first time in my years in congress the democratic leadership ineluded the members from energy producing states in the process the section 199 tax provision is most unfair because it singles out oil and gas as ineligible as compared to other manufacturing operations the main royalty provision is based on the jindalpombo bill that house republicans overwhelmingly supported a few months ago in june i am also very concerned about the effects of the provision on contract certainty in unitedstates oil and gas leasing but for better or worse there is a consensus among both parties to address this 19981999 lease issue while this bill is a far cry from my preferred energy policies the democratic leadership has been narrow and targeted after extensive discussions between our office and other members offices from oil and gas producing states this bill does not include more punitive measures that seek to alter longstanding oil and gastax or accounting treatment that could destabilize our nations gasoline supply even more we do not repeal the refinery tax provision or the deductions for intangible drilling costs we also

does not count the gentleman says that the bill takes away the right of privacy from workers not so the same process essentially by which people sign petitions under the present law they would sign cards under the new bill perhaps the gentleman should be more concerned about the loss of privacy of workers during campaigns by employers to coerce and intimidate people to vote against the union the gentleman says the bill takes away the right to vote on contracts absolutely not so what the bill says is if there is not an agreement for a contract between management and labor after negotiation after mediation then and only then there would be arbitration it does not take away the right to vote on contracts finally the gentleman says that penalties are somehow out of balance but i think the gentleman respectfully misunderstands if in a unionorganizing drive the unions are found to have coerced people into signing cards the cards are invalid and it is the death penalty for the union because they lose the organizing drive that is the most significant penalty there can be we are all entitled to our own opinion we are not entitled to our own facts"], [0.0003390312194824219,
