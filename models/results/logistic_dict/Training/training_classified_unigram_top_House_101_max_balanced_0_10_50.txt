concurrent resolution 310 i am proud to join my colleagues in the congressional black caucus in endorsing this amendment when ronald reagan first addressed the congress in 1981 he challenged those who opposed the impending policies of reaganomics to devise an alternative which offers a greater chance of balancing the budget stimulating the creation of jobs and reducing inflation the cbc has responded annually with sound innovative budget proposals which address the needs of this nation with pragmatism compassion and integrity this year is no exception like its predecessors the alternative budget proposal fashioned by mr dellums and the cbc for fiscal year 1991 offers sensible and humane alternatives to the skewed fiscal priorities that have heaped pain and neglect upon our nations most vulnerable and disadvantaged citizens over the past decade the dellums amendment proceeds from the belief that a major reordering of priorities must occur if the united states is truly to emerge a kinder and gentler nation in the 1990s the substitute recognizes that recent developments in eastern europe and within the soviet union have dramatically altered the geopolitical landscape and warrant serious reconsideration of current military spending levels it further recognizes that these longawaited changes present our nation with a tremendous opportunity to revitalize critical domestic programs which have withered during a decade of rampant defense overspending accordingly the dellums substitute proposes 23 7 billion more in defense spending cuts than the bush budget this peace dividend is part of 45 1 billion in total revenues to go toward reducing the deficit and breathing new life into nonmilitary programs of benefit to middle and lowincome americans nearly 20 billion will be raised through progressive new revenue measures designed to restore equity to americas tax structure the dellums substitute proposes temporary tax increases for the wealthiest individual and corporate taxpayers the primary beneficiaries of reagan era tax reform this combination of defense savings and progressive revenue measures allows the cbc to commit 33 2 billion more than the bush budget for nonmilitary spending while still achieving greater deficitreduction than the bush budget the substitute meets grahamrudman requirements for fiscal years 1991 and 1992 and produces a surplus in fiscal year 1993 the cbc calls for a halt to the continued reagan bush assault on medicare rejecting the bush administrations proposed 5 5 billion in medicare funding reductions moreover the cbc supports the recommendations of the pepper commission and calls for the creation of a national health policy which provides full health coverage for the 37 million americans who lack insurance and which addresses the needs of minorities the poor and other underserved groups the delliums amendment increases support for education and jobtraining training pro grams including head start and programs for education of the handicapped it supports the creation of youthincentive employment dropout prevention and antigang violence programs and increases funding for sorely needed programs in drug education and treatment the cbc provides funds for the expansion of the supply of permanent affordable lowand moderateincome housing and preserves federal support for public housing rehabilitation and construction it increases funding for agriculture energy conservation and the development of alternative and renewable energy sources and provides increased assistance to emerging democracies in europe africa and the caribbean including enactment of the mickey leland african and caribbean development act no single document offers a more candid statement of our national priorities and values than the federal budget for 10 years the federal budget has manifested an obsession with military spending and production that defies rational justification for 10 years our nations wealthiest individuals and corporations have reaped the benefits of targeted tax rate reductions for 10 years we have watched the inevitable consequences of these policies materialize in the form of massive deficits and the deterioration of domestic programs and for 10 years the disadvantaged of this nation have paid the price america can no longer afford to spend huge sums of money on unnecessary weapons and to indulge the whims of the wealthy at the expense of those who lack adequate food housing clothing and opportunities for quality education and employment it is imperative that

form family and medical leave are good benefits however a federal mandate that all employers regardless of individual circumstances be required to provide this extended time off from work would be bad law weve heard a lot about how the gordonweldon substitute is purported to be a compromise watering down h r 770 as reported which in turn is supposed to have watered down previous proposals ive examined the gordonweldon substitute for all the watering down that is supposed to have happened im a little surprisedthe bill looks about as dry as the lower rio grande during a draught i certainly respect and like the gentlemen sponsoring the substitute but i can not support their proposal public support for mandated leave is not nearly as strong as claimed supporters repeatedly cite polling data showing overwhelming support for these kinds of benefits of course to paraphrase the national rifle association statistics dont kill people kill at any rate some folks torture statistics until they say what those folks want to hear i am reminded of the polls that showed a majority of americans opposed to abortion on demand but a majority also opposed to prohibiting abortion and from just a very few years ago i am reminded of polls that showed a majority of americans supporting the united states aiding resistance to communism in central america but also a majority opposed to the united states assisting guerrillas seeking to overthrow the government of nicaragua the conventional wisdom notwithstanding support for a good benefit in principle is far different from a demand for a universal federal mandate support for such mandates has evaporated in surveys when respondants are asked in more detail about the federal govemnment mandating that employers provide such time off overwhelming majorities in poll after poll have expressed the strongest support for flexible benefit packages where the benefits can be tailored to the needs and circumstances of employees and certainly this one benefit is not a high priority in an april 1989 washington post poll only 3 percent of respondents rated parental leaveeven without the mandate issue raisedas the most important of four issues this bill will be especially burdensome to small businesses which are labor intensive have greater difficulty replacing employees and require flexibility to remain competitive in general small businesses operate on tighter budgets and smaller margins than big businesses costs the bill would impose include overtime of workers absorbing an absent employees workload cost of hiring temporary workers cost of training replacement workers unemployment insurance costs and loss of productivity associated with these and other factors many employees have unique and critical skills and would have to be replaced immediately by new employees for example lawyers accountants physics or special ed teachers rns emergency room personnel medical technicians respiratory therapists radiolcgic technicians and id like to think vocational agriculture teachers sometimes finding a temporary replacement with such specialized skills will be exceedingly difficult especially in small towns and rural areas in other cases the marketplace will require an employer to hire a replacement employee on a permanent basis costs will thus increase as employers provide pay and benefits for duplicate employees lets not lull ourselves into a false sense of security over the bills 50employee small business threshold first there are a lot of businesses with 50 or 100 or 200 employees that for their industries are small for those going through troubled timesauto dealers right now for exampiethis is exactly the type of bill that could put them over the brink second we know the companion bill in the other body has been reported with a 20employee threshold we remember that h r 925 in the last congress had a 15employee threshold we can guess where the conference would go we understand where the agenda of the groups pushing this bill is headed besides opposing the principle of this mandated intrusion into employeremployee relations many small business men and women quite reasonably fear that this mandate could easily be expanded in the future to apply to all employers a powerful example of the harmful effects this bill would have can be found in a rural hospital setting the kind that is so familiar in the 17th district of texas one benefits manager for a hospital testified before a senate subcommittee regarding h r 770s companion bill as follows it costs us 28 000 to train one rn to work in our operating room 18 000 to train a critical care rn and 13 000 to train an rn to work on a medical or surgical floor if a hospital cant hire all the nurses it needs at the outset it wont be able to hire replacement workers either if the supply was inadequate to begin with in the 35 counties of the 17th district of texas we have 42 hospitals mostly small28 have 50 beds or fewer we have several whole counties that have only one or a few registered nurses some of them adjoining counties that have none to attract qualified capable personnel such a hospital may offer generous benefits that for obvious good reasons can not include several kinds of extended time off instead the benefits negotiated will be more costeffective to the hospital and very frequently more useful and desirable to the employee administration and enforcement of this bill would be a nightmare this bill would ultimately require a muchexpanded federal bureaucracy to administer and enforce its requirements by allowing law suits in federal courts the bill would increase workloads in an already overburdened court system allow punitive damages of up to 3 times regular compensatory damagesfor lost wages benefits and interest punitive damages unprecedented under existing federal employment discrimination law encourage law suits by parties with marginal cases in hopes of high outofcourt settlements and unfairly threaten ofteninnocent employers with lengthy expensive administrative reviews and court litigation this bill restricts employees ability to negotiate for other job benefits they themselves prefer since fringe benefits are carved out within a finite pie of costs the bls department of labor bureau of labor statistics estimates that more than 25 percent of all employee compensation currently is in the form of benefits more than 8 percent is mandatory participation in govemment benefit programs for example social security unemployment insurance workers compensation its simple math if this bill raises the mandatory portion to 9 or 10 or 11 percent the voluntarythat is flexible negotiated portionis going to decline from 17 percent to 16 or 15 or 14 percent therefore some employees will lose other benefits they prefer to benefits in this bill unfairly some employees who dont need or cant qualify for family or medical leave will have to give up benefits from their package to pay for these mandated benefits provided for other employees this bill discourages innovative benefits such a mandate will stifle positive trends toward flexible benefits such as cafeteria plans and flextime which provide all employees with benefits more suited to their individual needs rigid work force mandates will impair our international competitiveness supporters of this bill point to similar benefits in other industrialized nations particularly in europe however this is one of several rigid rstrictions on workplace flexibility that have led to zero job creation in europe since 1970 versus 40 million new jobs in the united states the gao cost study of this bill is seriously flawed gaos 1988 study estimated annual costs to the economy of about 200 million per year these were revised upward a year later by 30 percent even gao acknowledges they would double with the addition of spousal leavesuch as the gordonweldon substitute proposes moreover gaos methodology was seriously flawed the sample size in gaos survey was too small to be statistically valid gaos unrepresentative survey covered only 80 firms in 2 labor markets detroit michigan and charleston scthere are 4 5 million small business employers in the unitedstates gao ignored such significant cost items as overtime of workers absorbing an absent employees workload cost of hiring temporary workers cost of training replacement workers unemployment insurance costs and loss of productivity associated with these and other factors gao also estimated that only 1 in 300 employees would take such leave an unsupportable unrealistic and highly debatable figure unintended discrimination will result employers will discriminate in hiring even unconsciously in favor of those least likely to use such leave for example single healthy orphaned males apparently past childrearing age in fact a survey by the certified employee benefits specialists found that 61 percent are worried that mandated leave would result in discriminationmuch of it not even intendedagainst prospective employees most likely to use the leave this is a yuppie bill those working on lower economic rungs cant afford 10 to 15 weeks of unpaid leave lower paid workers will be forced to give up part of their firms benefits pie to pay for higher costs caused by better off employees taking advantage of these mandated benefits but then thats consistent with the agenda of the groups pushing this bill this year they will say the united states is backward because europe has mandated paid leave and we have no leave next year theyll tell us were backward because europe has paid leave and we have only unpaid leave there are better profamily initiatives thatwould provide flexibility and increase economic resources for working families with lost income in fact one such provision was included in the child care substitute i offered just a few weeks ago along with the gentleman from florida

to identify ways to get through the budget crisis we are told that one segment of the corporate community is almost free of taxation further we are told that this segment should be paying somewhere in the neighborhood of 13 to 50 billion a year in taxes that would go a long long way to reducing the deficit further it seems that those foreignowned subsidiaries that are paying their fair share are doing so out of the goodness of their hearts rather than because our laws lead them to it there is something terribly wrong with this system the subcommittee heard both irs and treasury say that the laws are adequate and that operational adjustments would take care of the deficiencies n the system the commissioner stated that localitybased pay would allow irs to hire and retain qualified staff with all due respect i doubt that unitedstates government pay can ever compete with private sector pay it is for this reason that i think we must develop legislative proposals which would be easier to administer id suggest that we look to those employees who testified before the subcommittee for their ideas they did not seem quite as certain that the current law could in fact be adequately administered for starters think we should consider the following first do we need to legislate a separate appropriation of funds to the audit of foreignowned firms operating in the united states irs said no but it we did it would ensure adequate audit coverage of this potentially abusive area second do we need to legislate interagency cooperation testimony presented in last weeks hearings indicated that irs customs and commerce dont coordinate very much in these cases at the very least perhaps we need to amend some disclosure provision of existing law to allow full coordination between agencies third do we need to simplify the law this is where i think we need to involve those employees who testified before the subcommittee who work with this law every day its obvious that we need to do something drastic do we need to implement a system of unitary tax do we need to design penalties with teeth perhaps even 100 percent of any underpayment should we stop allowing companies who make purchases from related foreign corporations to deduct those purchases or limit them according to a prearranged formula i honestly dont know but im going to find out i do know that any changes in
